for all the formidable power of the white house, trump and his top officials can do little more to urge americans to stay home to ease the terrible demands being placed on medical staff in hospitals in worst-hit areas that are crammed with sick patients and running out of basic supplies. there is a feeling of a terrible storm approaching with the government predicting the worst over the next month or so.\n\nit's still heartbreaking when we think about the lives that could be lost -- and so our message yesterday, our message over the next 30 days, is the future is in our hands, pence told cnn.\n\nthe vice president was speaking after the administration tuesday warned that between 100,000 and 240,000 americans could die from the virus -- even if mitigation efforts, like stay-at-home orders now affecting 9 in 10 americans , are properly observed.\n\nthe deepening sense of foreboding is focusing debate on whether trump -- who spent weeks downplaying the likely impact of the pandemic -- had cost lives by not being more proactive.\n\ndemocratic house speaker nancy pelosi told cnn's jake tapper sunday that trump's denial at the beginning was deadly, saying that as the president fiddles, people are dying.\n\nthen there were calls wednesday for the president to mandate a nationwide shutdown with some states still dragging their feet, even as johns hopkins university reported 216,515 confirmed cases in the us and 5,119 deaths as of midnight wednesday -- figures that show that nowhere in the country is likely to be immune.\n\nadding to the evidence that the federal government is falling short, officials confirmed that a national stockpile of ventilators and protective medical gear , desperately needed by frontline health workers, is all but exhausted.\n\ntrump has moved from denying the severity of the pandemic and agitating to open the economy to a recognition of how bad things could get.\n\namerica continues to wage all-out war to defeat the virus -- this horrible, horrible virus, trump said wednesday. the president has extended nationwide self-distancing guidelines until april 30\n\nbut after an unusually somber appearance in the briefing room on tuesday, the president was back to his habitual efforts to distract from any personal culpability for the situation.\n\nhe didn't even want to start his regular dinner time appearance before reporters by talking about the virus, on the deadliest day yet for americans.\n\ninstead he highlighted a new anti-narcotics initiative in a fresh example of how he has often sought to turn coronavirus briefings into the political platform he lacks with campaign rallies canceled.\n\nbizarrely, the president also boasted about his popularity on facebook, and suddenly floated a scheme to build two new hospital ships -- a project that would take years in the event the navy commissions them.\n\nand trump and pence dodged on tough questions about the crisis -- for instance, on loopholes in florida's belated stay-at-home directives finally imposed by republican gov. ron desantis, a trump ally. after pence waffled on a query over whether obamacare exchanges could be opened up to help americans who lost insurance along with their jobs when the economy was shut down, trump poured praise on his vice president.\n\nthat was one of the greatest answers i've ever heard, because mike was able to talk for five minutes and not answer your question, trump told a reporter.\n\nhis performance appeared to confirm the skepticism of critics who saw his much hailed change of previous tone about the scope of the virus as a temporary departure from his unchained norm.\n\nnew questions about trump's responsibility\n\nas the crisis gets worse, with the federal government now predicting between 100,000 and 240,000 americans could die, even if self-distancing works, the question over whether the death toll could have been eased with an earlier white house response are becoming ever more acute.\n\nthe white house claims that trump's leadership has been all but perfect, despite his downplaying of the virus and failure to order a huge preparation effort when it took hold in china.\n\nbut a trump adviser working with the task force told cnn's jim acosta that trump bet that warmer weather in the spring would cause the virus to dissipate.\n\nhe took a gamble and got it wrong, the adviser said. he analyzed the data and opinions of experts and sided with the one that said warm weather will likely slow the virus.\n\nsuch a decision could turn out to be one of the most fateful moments of the us response to the pandemic. the indications of how trump handled the approaching storm will fuel claims by democrats that he cost lives by not acting more quickly.\n\nthe president also tried to deflect blame on wednesday, insisting no one could have predicted that the us could be struck by a disease that would spread like wildfire among the population.\n\nthis is so contagious. nobody's ever seen anything like this, where large groups of people all of a sudden, just by being in the presence of somebody, have it, he said in the briefing.\n\nthat argument was untrue. as china faced a rising challenge from the virus and quarantined the city of wuhan, the virulence of the pandemic was obvious and could be gleaned from news sources.\n\nat the end of february, a senior centers for disease control and prevention official, nancy messonnier, warned publicly that disruption to everyday life may be severe.\n\ntrump also confirmed wednesday that the government was nearing the end of its stocks of items like protective personal equipment and ventilators.\n\nofficials said that the stockpile was never meant to be the sole source of supply for items like protective equipment and that local authorities should seek to fill their need on the open market. that will come as terrible news to state governors and frontline health care workers who are pleading for more equipment -- and for trump to fully unleash the power of government to surge manufacturing of such items.\n\nrepublicans blame impeachment for virus response delays\n\nthe scale of the looming disaster would have tested any administration and was bound to highlight flaws in governance at the local and state level as well. but trump is being criticized so vehemently because he was so vocal in dismissing the threat from the virus for weeks. it also took him a prolonged period to fully embrace the warnings of his scientific advisers on the need for national self-distancing measures.\n\nas the continuing inadequacy of the federal government effort becomes clear, a coordinated effort by the white house and republican allies to redirect blame is under way.\n\ni will be very candid with you and say that in mid-january the cdc was still assessing that the risk of the coronavirus to the american people was low, pence said.\n\nthe very first case, which was someone who had been in china -- in late january around the 20th day of january, pence told cnn's wolf blitzer. the reality is that we could've been better off if china had been more forthcoming.\n\nthere are serious questions about china's cooperating in sharing data about the specifics of the virus. but anyone watching the news could have concluded the new respiratory disease sooner or later was likely to arrive on us shores.\n\nin fact, miami mayor francis suarez told cnn's wolf blitzer on wednesday that his fire chief made such an evaluation on super bowl weekend -- february 1 and 2 -- and ordered protective equipment for his crews, who are as a result now well stocked.\n\nsenate republican majority leader mitch mcconnell opened another front in the effort to deflect criticism from the president on tuesday, saying that the impeachment saga had distracted washington from the looming threat of the virus.\n\nhis spin was enthusiastically taken up by republican senators.\n\ni think there's no question it was a huge distraction, missouri sen. roy blunt told hugh hewitt on his radio show wednesday. now it doesn't mean we weren't paying any attention to what was happening in china or other places, but there's no doubt it was a huge distraction.\n\non the same show, texas republican sen. ted cruz said there was zero interest manifested by either (house speaker) nancy pelosi and (senate democratic minority leader) chuck schumer in the coronavirus outbreak, in anything problematic occurring in china and the chinese communist government's coverup of the coronavirus outbreak.\n\nsuch arguments ignore the primary responsibility of the executive in keeping americans safe. a future investigation will for sure probe whether washington as a whole took the investigation sufficiently seriously and may find that congress was asleep at the switch.\n\nbut the impeachment argument is questionable for several reasons. first, the most visible public official dismissing the seriousness of the coronavirus threat was the president himself.\n\nand trump was acquitted on charges of abusing power and obstructing congress after a senate trial on february 5.\n\non january 26, schumer, the top senate democrat, called on the administration to declare a public health emergency over coronavirus to free up funding.
the promise of cheaper housing brought shari castaneda to palmdale, california, in northern los angeles county, about nine years ago.\n\nthe single mom with five kids had been struggling to pay the bills. i kept hearing that the rent was a lot cheaper out here, so i moved, she said.\n\nbut when she developed health problems -- losing her balance and falling -- castaneda found fewer care options in her new town. unable to find local specialty care, she traveled nearly 65 miles to a public hospital in los angeles, where doctors discovered a tumor on her spine.\n\nthen she had to drive nearly 75 miles to the city of hope cancer center in duarte, california, for an operation to remove it. the procedure left her partially paralyzed. i walked into the hospital and i never really walked again.\n\ncastaneda, 58, receives social security disability payments and is enrolled in medi-cal, the state's medicaid program for low-income people. there are no doctors available here, said castaneda. i called every single one of them in the book, and nobody takes medi-cal out here.\n\ninstead, castaneda now sees doctors nearly 50 miles away in northridge.\n\nsuburbs in the united states, often perceived as enclaves of the affluent, are home to nearly 17 million americans who live in poverty -- more than in cities or rural areas -- and growing demand for care strains the capacity of suburban health services to provide for them, according to a recent study in health affairs. suburban areas have historically received a fraction of health funding that cities have, leaving them with inadequate infrastructure and forcing people like castaneda to scramble for the medical attention they need.\n\nthe health affairs study found that about a fifth of the suburban poor are uninsured, and many who do have health insurance -- especially people on medi-cal -- either can't find providers or must travel far for appointments.\n\nrelated: millions of medicaid recipients already work\n\nthe affordable care act cut california's uninsured rate from 17% in 2013 to about 7% last year due largely to the medicaid expansion, which added more than 3.7 million adults to the state's medi-cal rolls. but that has not ensured access to health care for millions of suburbanites, said alina schnake-mahl, a doctoral candidate at the harvard t.h. chan school of public health in boston, who was lead author of the health affairs study.\n\nthat really goes against the idea that everyone in the suburbs is insured because everyone has a white-collar job with coverage, she said.\n\ncoverage doesn't equate to care even for patients with medi-cal, as castaneda can attest. before the health law, they had trouble finding doctors who would see them because of medi-cal's low payment rates. that problem intensified as millions more signed up for medi-cal, driving many enrollees to seek services at safety-net care facilities.\n\nhealth care services in the suburbs are not robust enough to fill the needs of a growing low-income population, said charlie gillig, supervising attorney at the health consumer center of neighborhood legal services of los angeles county.\n\none half of california's 39 million residents live in suburbs, and rates of poverty among them range from nearly 25% around bakersfield to about 8% in the suburbs outside of san francisco, according to an analysis by elizabeth kneebone, research director at university of california, berkeley's terner center for housing innovation and a senior fellow at the brookings institution. the same analysis showed that 2.7 million suburban californians lived below the poverty line in 2016, compared with 1.9 million in major cities.\n\ncastaneda, who uses an oversized power wheelchair, says it's difficult -- often impossible -- to arrange for a ride in a van. getting to the doctor has become a long, painful ordeal.\n\ncastaneda said she also faces long wait times for her doctor in northridge, a suburb that has seen an influx of patients from poorer areas. you can't get an appointment when you're sick ... so i've just been waiting and waiting, she said. they told me, 'if you get sick enough, just go to the emergency room.'\n\nof course, it can also be tough to get a clinic appointment or see a specialist in cities, but in the suburbs, gillig said, geography exacerbates an already existing problem.\n\nin his recent book on the changing geography of poverty, scott allard, a professor of public policy and governance at the university of washington, showed funding for human services was as much as eight times higher in urban areas than in the suburbs.\n\ncalifornia's metropolitan areas have had many decades to build up massive health care systems to serve the poor, including county hospitals, federally qualified health centers and community clinics. but the current scale of suburban poverty is a recent development.\n\nrelated: without price breaks, rural hospitals struggle to stock key medicines\n\npolicymakers struggle to serve the health needs of cities in eastern contra costa county, about 50 miles from san francisco. in oakley, for example, business and community leaders lobbied hard for a new health center, which opened in 2011. the clinic has two doctors and a nurse practitioner to serve 3,000 patients, most of whom are on medi-cal.\n\nthe oakley clinic also serves patients who lack insurance, because they are undocumented immigrants or because they make too much money to qualify for medi-cal -- or subsidized coverage under obamacare -- and can't afford it on their own.\n\nleticia cazares, regional manager for la clinica, which operates the new health center, said there's a huge need among people who are uninsured. they don't have anywhere else to go.\n\nthis story was produced by kaiser health news (khn), which publishes california healthline, an editorially independent service of the california health care foundation. khn is not affiliated

louisiana senator bill cassidy says his bill to repeal obamacare will boost the number of americans with health insurance.\n\nthere will be more people covered, cassidy said on cnn's new day on wednesday.\n\ncassidy, however, is one of the few who feel this way. many in the health care community -- doctors, hospitals and policy experts -- say it's more a question of how many people will lose their insurance.\n\nthe congressional budget office has yet to release its evaluation of the bill cassidy co-authored with senator lindsey graham of south carolina. its reviews of earlier gop bills in the house and senate found that at least 22 million fewer people would have coverage by 2026, compared to current law.\n\nit's difficult to say exactly what the coverage losses would be under the graham-cassidy bill, experts say. that's largely because it would give a lot of control over health care to the states, while at the same time curtailing federal funding. their decisions will affect how many of their residents have coverage.\n\nrelated: trump says gop's health bill protects pre-existing conditions. here's the truth\n\nhere's how it would work: the legislation would eliminate obamacare's medicaid expansion, as well as federal premium and cost-sharing subsidies to buy policies on the exchanges. instead, states would get a pot of money through 2026, and it would be up to them to figure out how to spend it on health care.\n\nbut that pot would be smaller than it would be under obamacare -- by $107 billion, according to the kaiser family foundation. plus, the money would be redistributed so many states that expanded medicaid -- which saw the greatest coverage gains under the health reform law -- would lose some of their funding, while those that didn't expand would get more.\n\nalso, like the prior gop efforts, the graham-cassidy bill would eliminate the individual mandate. that alone would result in about 15 million fewer insured americans next year, cbo says.\n\nrelated: what's in the latest obamacare repeal bill?\n\nthe bill would also shrink federal support of medicaid by sending states a set amount of funds per enrollee or a lump sum -- again, leaving it up to governors and legislators to decide how to use the money. a per enrollee cap would cut federal spending by $53 billion between 2020 and 2026, compared to current law, kaiser found.\n\nmost states, however, don't have the wherewithal to make up the difference so it's likely they'll tighten enrollment, curtail benefits or trim provider rates.\n\nthe flexibility states will be given under the bill is where to cut, how much to cut and who to cut, said sabrina corlette, research professor at georgetown university's health policy institute. you can't take that much money out of the system and expect more people to continue to get affordable coverage. it just doesn't add up.

(photo by drew angerer/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthe national conversation around health care is increasingly about medicare for all, but democrats are still working to bring republican states on board with expanding access to a different government program – medicaid.\n\nunder the affordable care act, states can get federal money to pay for adding people to the program for low-income americans, but 14 states never accepted it.\n\nkansas lawmakers have taken the first step toward passing medicaid expansion, with the republican-dominated legislature last week voting in favor, two years after a similar initiative was vetoed by former republican gov. sam brownback. the state's current democratic gov. laura kelly, who made medicaid expansion a centerpiece of her 2018 campaign, has vowed to sign the bill if it passes.\n\ni am optimistic that we will get this done. i know that there are a number of legislators that are very interested in getting medicaid expanded, kelly told cnn. they know this time there will be no veto.\n\nwith republican-led efforts in washington to repeal obamacare effectively dead, health care advocacy groups say they are hoping that holdout states will be more willing to accept funds available under the 2010 law.\n\nthe affordable care act allows states to extend coverage to all individuals whose income is at or below 138% of the poverty line. the federal government covers at least 90% of the cost of the policy, while the state picks up the remainder. while many states approved expansion immediately others were slower to it, maine and virginia officially expanded at the beginning of this year.\n\nthe policy's connection to obamacare combined with concerns over cost sparked resistance in predominantly conservative states, but the 2017 repeal and replace debate created a heightened public understanding and support for medicaid, said patricia boozang, senior managing director of manatt health, a law firm that provides counsel on health care issues.\n\nkelly echoed that view, saying that public demand for access to health coverage has grown over the years, partly due to the closure of rural hospitals.\n\nwhen medicaid expansion first came up the opposition just really tried to paint it as 'obamacare' so there were a number of people who were opposed to it just because they thought it was 'obamacare,' kelly said. what we have seen over the six years though is kansans really understand better exactly what it is and how important it is that we do that.\n\nnorth carolina and wisconsin may follow suit. like kansas, each have a democratic governor but a republican-majority legislature.\n\nthe state's political climate is also different now, with less uncertainty over major federal changes to the health care system and growing energy in both parties for increasing access to affordable health insurance and closing the coverage gap, said mandy cohen, north carolina secretary of health and human services.\n\nnon-profit groups are planning to target states that allow ballot measures after successful passage of medicaid expansion initiatives in idaho, nebraska and utah in 2018 – although republicans in both idaho and utah have taken steps to limit their implementation.\n\nsix states – florida, missouri, oklahoma, south dakota, mississippi and wyoming – that never expanded medicaid access allow for ballot initiatives.\n\ndespite a trend toward limited expansion, states like texas, alabama and south carolina aren't expected to move on medicaid expansion anytime soon.\n\ni never say never so we could be surprised, said larissa antoniesse, a policy analyst for the nonprofit kaiser family foundation, which specializes in health care research. it doesn't seem like there's a strong chance for expansion in those states.
west palm beach, florida (cnn) the warning signs around mike bloomberg's campaign started flashing in early february. and by tuesday night, it was clear that all the money in the former new york mayor's bank account couldn't save his sinking campaign .\n\nby the time he made his late entry into the democratic primary race last november, bloomberg knew that his only shot at winning the nomination was to outspend everyone. over the next four months, the former new york mayor did just that, plowing more than a half billion dollars of his own fortune into television ads, and hundreds of millions more on building the biggest field operation of any campaign.\n\neverything about bloomberg's campaign was unprecedented. no one had ever spent that much or gotten in so late. his whole strategy hinged on super tuesday. the 14-state contest would either prove bloomberg's audacious plan could work, or it would end up as one of the most expensive failures in modern political history.\n\nbut bloomberg's downturn began weeks earlier, as his lengthy record became a focal point at the february 19 debate in las vegas. his support for tough policing tactics as mayor of new york city, along with lewd remarks he'd allegedly made to employees at his company, gave bloomberg's opponents ample fodder for attacks. and other candidates, led by massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, seized on it.\n\nfrom the opening minutes, the decision to debate looked like the wrong one. bloomberg appeared lost when attacked, and struggled to hit back against any of his competitors. advisers in new york watched in horror as warren landed the biggest blows\n\nby the time bloomberg took the stage in south florida on tuesday night, it was obvious the harrowing month had all but stalled the former new york mayor. though the audience, lubricated by free wine and beer, and full of bite-sized burgers and flatbreads, gave bloomberg a hero's welcome, his first lines acknowledged the disaster\n\nno matter how many delegates we win tonight, we have done something no one else thought was possible, bloomberg said. in just three months, we have gone from 1% in the polls to be a contender for the democratic nomination for president.\n\nafter a roughly 10-minute speech, bloomberg left the florida convention center, flying home to new york city to reassess his campaign. on wednesday morning, he left his upper east side apartment without offering a hint of what was to come.\n\nless than an hour later, the billionaire was no longer a presidential candidate\n\nthe beginning of the end\n\nbloomberg's poor debate performance exposed what many advisers had worried were his lackluster campaign chops, not to mention his lengthy history as a republican politician -- and the positions that came with that. along with his stop and frisk issues, and the lewd remarks he'd allegedly made, bloomberg also had to contend with critical comments he made about obamacare, the sweeping health care policy passed by former president barack obama.\n\ndemocratic presidential candidates, former new york city mayor mike bloomberg, left, and former vice president joe biden talk during a break in a democratic presidential primary debate wednesday, feb. 19, 2020, in las vegas.\n\naides tried to spin the poor performance as bloomberg just warming up to the format, touting the fact that the others on stage had been hardened by debates and town halls over the last year.\n\nbut the sheen had been taken off and the voters were exposed to the fact that the man they saw in omnipresent ads may not be the same as the one who took the debate stage.\n\nover the following weeks, campaign advisers looked to position bloomberg as the only manager in the race and seized on the rise of coronavirus as an example of the kind of issue bloomberg would tackle as a candidate. they even paid to air a three-minute ad on cbs and nbc on a sunday night, playing up bloomberg as the best prepared candidate to be president.\n\nthen came south carolina.\n\nbiden's initial struggles were part of bloomberg's rationale for getting into the race in the first place. that strategy looked smart as biden faltered through the first contests in iowa and new hampshire and nevada. but when the former vice president ran away with the south carolina primary, it set off a chain of events that ultimately left bloomberg with no real path to the nomination.\n\nwithin 48 hours of his resounding win, money and endorsements poured into the biden campaign. and the field suddenly cleared. pete buttigieg and amy klobuchar dropped out and threw their support his way in an avengers-like pair of events in dallas.\n\nin the eyes of multiple top bloomberg aides, that was the turning point. a resurgent biden undercut their candidate's entire rationale for entering the race.\n\nby tuesday morning, some bloomberg aides were already nervous about the potential for disaster that night.\n\nsuper tuesday debacle\n\nthe first bad sign came from virginia. the state was seen favorably by bloomberg's campaign. they had a sizable team on the ground, had spent nearly $18 million on tv and digital ads there, and the former mayor had a wealth of goodwill built up after spending millions to help flip the state legislature to democrats in 2019.\n\nbefore south carolina, bloomberg's internal polling had him in a three-way tie in virginia with biden and sanders. but within a few minutes of the polls closing on tuesday night, biden was declared the winner, and ended up carrying virginia by 30 points.\n\nbiden's upward trajectory in the mayor's internal polling was so rapid that even 12-hour old polls were out of date, said one bloomberg adviser. it was an unprecedented move, the adviser said.\n\na week earlier, bloomberg's team believed they would be competitive across much of the southern states, aides said, including north carolina, arkansas, tennessee and oklahoma.\n\nby the end of the night, biden had won all five contests, swamping the billionaire.\n\nit's an extraordinary shift, said a bloomberg staffer. i've never seen an avalanche like that.\n\na candidate unto himself\n\ndemocratic presidential candidate mike bloomberg speaks during a campaign rally at the palm beach county convention center in west palm beach, fla., tuesday, march 3, 2020.\n\nfrom the outset, bloomberg's strategy was to operate in a universe onto himself, not part of the everyday stories of democratic primary but not fully in a race against trump. for a short time, the plan worked, and bloomberg's ubiquitous ads caught trump's attention, as the two traded twitter insults.\n\nbut in the end, the strategy appears to have hurt bloomberg, a candidate who, by focusing on someone he wasn't running against, seemed to forget about the actual race he was in. it didn't help that bloomberg proved to be a lackluster campaigner. his prepared speeches and choreographed events obscured his lack of rhetorical agility. he almost never took questions from the audience and engaged with them rarely.\n\nbloomberg's advantage was always going to be his shock and awe spending strategy.\n\nwhen he announced in november, bloomberg's team described how he planned to place at least $40 million worth of television advertising over the first two weeks of his campaign. within the first few weeks, bloomberg had already outspent the rest of the field.\n\nas bloomberg blanketed the airwaves over the next four months, critics complained that he was trying to buy the election. in the end, bloomberg spent over $570 million on television, radio and digital ads, more than five times what the four other candidates who competed in the super tuesday states spent throughout their entire campaigns.\n\nthe numbers for biden alone are staggering. by the time bloomberg endorsed the former vice president on wednesday, biden had spent just 2% of the more than half a billion dollars bloomberg spent on ads.\n\nso much food\n\nbut bloomberg's spending went beyond just television spots and podcast ads.\n\nthe mayor quickly built a staff of over 2,400 people, offering a range of veteran democratic aides and organizers big salaries and free housing, while also guaranteeing his field staff job security through november.\n\noffice workers are seen in the bloomberg campaign headquarters near times square on january 30, 2020\n\nthe campaign also spent big on rent for their 200-plus offices across the country, including more than 100 just in super tuesday states. according to one aide, bloomberg's team paid around $44,000 a month for just one office in charlotte, north carolina, an opulent expense that most campaigns wouldn't even consider spending on a state-based office.\n\nbloomberg's new york headquarters resembled that of a swanky financial data company, much like the one the former mayor ran for years. the campaign, every friday, had a staff meeting that included an open bar, aides said, an unheard of expense on any other campaign. free food was everywhere, including a weekly taco tuesday and regular catered lunches.\n\nso much food, joked one bloomberg aide after the campaign ended. how will i adjust?\n\nthe scope of bloomberg's campaign was most apparent in american samoa, the only contest the billionaire won during his short-lived campaign. bloomberg had an astonishing seven staffers on the south pacific island, more than the six total national delegates the us territory will award and more than biden's campaign had on the ground in virginia.\n\nthe spending also reshaped the race for other candidates who couldn't come close to competing with what the bloomberg campaign was doing.\n\nmichael halle, a senior adviser to buttigieg's campaign, said bloomberg's spending devalued early states, where candidates have to rely on more than name id and tv advertisements to create a media obsession that was in fact a fallacy.\n\nin the critical period of time between iowa and nevada, after pete buttigieg scored a historic victory in iowa and photo finish in new hampshire, halle said. mike bloomberg received, quantitatively, more attention despite not having one a single delegate.\n\nthat point was not lost on bloomberg's top aides, many of whom worried that one electoral misstep could prove disastrous for bloomberg because of how the mayor banked on winning the electability argument.\n\nwhen you base your whole campaign on electability, a bloomberg aide said on wednesday, you really only get one

obamacare remains popular with americans, despite efforts by republican senators to repeal a central provision of the health reform law that requires everyone to maintain coverage or pay a penalty.\n\nnearly 1.5 million consumers signed up for 2018 obamacare coverage in the first 11 days of open enrollment, according to data released by the trump administration wednesday.\n\na year ago, 1 million people had chosen policies in the first 12 days of the season.\n\nof the people who have selected obamacare plans for 2018, about 346,000 were new to the exchanges while 1.1. million were renewing their coverage.\n\nstill the pace has slowed a bit since the initial days of the open enrollment period, which began nov. 1 and runs through dec. 15. just over 150,000 people picked plans in each of the first four days, on average, but that rate cooled slightly to 134,000 in the first 11 days.\n\nthe increased interest in obamacare policies is not necessarily all good news. usually, the sickest consumers are the ones who rush to secure coverage. insurers are concerned that younger and healthier people will forgo enrollment for 2018 amid all the uncertainty and negativity coming out of washington d.c. that could prompt carriers to raise premiums in the future.\n\nrelated: what repealing obamacare's individual mandate means\n\nalso, strong initial sign-ups don't necessarily result in record enrollment. last year, many consumers rushed to pick policies in november and december, particularly after president trump was elected. ultimately, however, half a million fewer americans signed up for obamacare coverage for 2017 by the time open enrollment ended on jan. 31. (consumers are not actually enrolled until they pay their first month's premium.)\n\nenrollment in coming years could sag more if republicans get their way. gop senators announced tuesday that they would seek to repeal obamacare's individual mandate as part of their tax overhaul bill.\n\naxing the mandate, which requires nearly all americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty, would likely wreak havoc on the obamacare market. it would remove the stick that the health reform law wields to prod younger and healthier people to sign up for coverage.\n\nsome 4 million fewer people would be covered in the first year the repeal would take effect, the congressional budget office said last week. that number would rise to 13 million by 2027, as compared to current law. meanwhile, premiums would rise by about 10% in most years of the decade.\n\nwhile experts have mixed views on how effective the mandate has been, many feel that removing it would cause the obamacare market to tilt even more towards sicker and older consumers.\n\nrelated: trump administration is making it even harder to sign up for obamacare\n\nthat, in turn, could make insurers think twice about participating in the exchanges, especially since they would still be required to cover those with pre-existing conditions and not charge them more based on their medical history.\n\nregardless of what congress does, the trump administration has taken several steps that critics say will dampen enrollment for 2018. while it is maintaining the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, it has slashed funding for open enrollment advertising and support. also, consumers will have only six weeks to sign up for coverage on the federal exchange, rather than the three months or more they had in previous years.\n\npremiums for the benchmark silver obamacare plan are soaring 37%, on average, for 2018. but eight in 10 consumers will be able to find policies for $75 or less. that's because the price spike means many enrollees will receive more generous premium subsidies.\n\nare you shopping for obamacare coverage for 2018? what has your experience been? tell us about it at healthcarestories@cnn.com and you could be featured in a cnnmoney story.

'abolish the senate.' i'm having blue caps printed up with that slogan right now. they will be made in america.\n\njohn david dingell jr. was born july 8, 1926 in colorado springs, colorado. he was exposed to politics at an early age when his father was elected to the house in 1932. the young dingell then served as a house page and attended the capitol page school from 1938 to 1943.\n\nwe saw some rather great things, dingell said in a 2012 oral history interview with the office of the house historian. the president (franklin d. roosevelt) declared war the day after the japanese bombed pearl harbor (december 8, 1941). we saw winston churchill on the 26th of december, 1941, when he came to address the congress.\n\nwhen he was 18, dingell enlisted into the us army, almost three years after he watched roosevelt deliver his famous day of infamy address to congress.\n\nafter his father died while in office 1955, dingell was elected to the seat in a special election at the age of 29. he was then re-elected to 29 more congressional sessions, until he decided not to run for re-election in 2014. his wife, debbie, succeeded him and remains in the seat today.\n\ndingell's service, combined with that of his father and his wife, marks the longest consecutive service in congress for a single family: nearly 86 years.\n\ncnn's adam levy contributed to this report.

of the decision by governors in texas and mississippi to prematurely end mask restrictions.\n\nthe moves by the republicans, govs. greg abbott in texas and tate reeves in mississippi, came the day after the us centers for disease control and prevention director pleaded with americans and policymakers not to let up as infection rates fall and vaccination rates rise.\n\ni hope everybody's realized by now, these masks make a difference. we are on the cusp of being able to fundamentally change the nature of this disease because of the way in which we're able to get vaccines in people's arms, biden said when asked about the decisions by abbott and reeves.\n\nthe last thing -- the last thing we need is neanderthal thinking that in the meantime, everything's fine, take off your mask, forget it. it still matters, biden told reporters wednesday in the oval office.\n\nwhat abbott really meant was: an abbott spokeswoman clarified wednesday that the governor was not saying, by ending the mask mandate, that texans should not wear masks.\n\nthe governor was clear in telling texans that covid hasn't ended, his spokeswoman said.\n\nwe must now do more to restore livelihoods and normalcy for texans.\n\nwhat medical advice did abbott get? the truth may be more political maneuvering than neanderthal thinking, which is more sinister. there are smart people in texas who know better. the governor just didn't talk to them. that abbott, still reeling from the power and water shortages that called his leadership into question last week, reportedly the truth may be more political maneuvering than neanderthal thinking, which is more sinister. there are smart people in texas who know better. the governor just didn't talk to them. that abbott, still reeling from the power and water shortages that called his leadership into question last week, reportedly didn't consult his state's chief medical officer before ending the mask mandate makes it hard to see the decision as anything but political.\n\nlet their people go. sen. john cornyn rejected biden's criticism and said texans are ready to throw off the yoke of government intervention, if mask mandates can be considered onerous.\n\nat some point, the government needs to quit making arbitrary rules that do not have any demonstrable connection with the public health, the texas republican said.\n\nthe list of people and corporations disagreeing with the end of mask mandates is long.\n\ndon't leave your mask at home yet. as cnn business reports, masks won't exactly be going away.\n\nleading us grocery chains, pharmacies, retailers and auto manufacturers, including target ( tgt ), kroger ( kr ), cvs ( cvs ), walgreens ( wba ), best buy ( bby ), macy's ( m ) jcpenney ( jcp ), toyota ( tm ), gm ( gm ) and others, say they will continue to require mask wearing at their stores and facilities by both employees and customers.\n\nthere are exceptions, however, and some business advocates are concerned that the end of these states' mask mandates will create new challenges for companies and their workers.\n\nwhere is the middle ground?\n\nopening too soon. while it's easy to while it's easy to roll your eye at abbott ending all restrictions and allowing businesses to open at will, it's also completely legitimate to wonder where the right place is.\n\ntexas will allow all businesses of any type to open 100%. in many other places in the country, any sort of indoor dining and exercise is prohibited.\n\ntaking so long to open. in my neighborhood in virginia, parents are looking at the possibility of sending their kids to in-person public school for the first time in a year after the governor issued an order requiring schools to open by march 15. in my neighborhood in virginia, parents are looking at the possibility of sending their kids to in-person public school for the first time in a year after the governor issued an order requiring schools to open by march 15. arizona's governor issued a similar order wednesday.\n\nthe details border on farce. it appears my two elementary schoolers will go to school two days a week, but they'll be getting virtual instruction there either from teachers not returning in person or teachers in different rooms.\n\nmy middle schooler's teachers are split in half between those returning and those staying virtual. he may get some in-person instruction, but since the school district is hewing strictly to the cdc's guidance on 6 feet of separation for children, he may be getting instruction from a teacher streaming from a different room in the school.\n\nit won't be the grand return to school any of the 40% of students who opted for in-person instruction might have envisioned.\n\nvaccine priorities. virginia has been vaccinating teachers for weeks, although many in our district are not returning. i was flabbergasted to see wednesday that texas announced it would prioritize teachers only after the governor announced the end of restrictions on businesses.\n\ntexas reality vs. virginia reality. i went to cnn's superstar dallas-based national correspondent ed lavandera to ask not only about abbott's move, but also what he's seen in his travels this year. our conversation is below.\n\nshifting the burden for safety away from the government\n\nwhat matters: what's going to be the practical effect of this order by gov. abbott on texans and texas businesses?\n\nlavandera: the governor's executive order ends all the restrictions and operating limits placed on businesses during the coronavirus pandemic starting on wednesday, march 10.\n\ngov. greg abbott is essentially shifting the burden and responsibility of enforcing medical guidelines over social distancing and mask wearing.\n\nbusinesses will now be allowed to operate at full capacity but can still require employees and customers to follow public health safety measures, like mask wearing.\n\nthe governor has made clear in the last year that local jurisdictions at the county and city level do not have the authority to issue stricter public health measures, which has caused tension between many city leaders and the governor. however, the latest executive order does say counties can tighten business restrictions, in a limited capacity, if the hospitalization rate reaches a specific threshold. (if the number of covid-19 patients in a hospital region reaches more than 15% of total capacity for seven straight days, then the restrictions can be implemented.)\n\na big question mark moving forward is how will the public respond? when abbott started reopening the state last spring and issued the mask mandate last summer, there was great confusion over enforcement and many businesses were put in a tough place. we'll be watching closely to see how businesses that choose to require masks will deal with customers who refuse to wear them.\n\ntexas cities vs. red texas\n\nwhat matters: the view from here in washington is that texas is a state rapidly changing from deep red to purple. do those changes factor into how texans have viewed covid restrictions and mask requirements?\n\nlavandera: the pandemic has exposed the growing divide between the democratic leadership in the most populated cities in texas (houston, dallas, san antonio and austin) and the conservative republican officials fully in control of state government.\n\ntexas is a rapidly growing state that's seen its population explode to roughly 29 million. the myth is that these new transplants are making the state more liberal, but in my conversations with political observers that's a questionable theory. it's not a purple state, yet.\n\nwhen you drive around the state, as i have extensively for the last year, there is a clear divide in how politics has clouded perceptions of the medical guidelines during this pandemic. gov. abbott is leaning heavily into the idea that government should not be telling businesses and people how to do things. that sentiment plays well with a large segment of the population.\n\nthe governor said during the reopening announcement that texans have mastered the daily habits to avoid getting covid. that's quite a statement in a state that has seen 2.6 million cases and 44,000 deaths. but the governor's decision has left many local leaders, especially in the state's biggest cities, dumbfounded by his push to ease pandemic restrictions so soon.\n\nthe old rule of texas politics applied to covid\n\nwhat matters: there are there are reports abbott didn't consult all of his medical advisers , which only amplifies the feeling that this is a political decision by a governor already struggling after the power and water fiasco.\n\nlavandera: the way gov. abbott rolled out this decision is a revealing window into the political forces at play. instead of calling a news conference in austin and taking questions from reporters on the intricacies of how this reopening would roll out, gov. abbott announced the reopening of the texas economy at a restaurant in the west texas town of lubbock surrounded by a political friendly crowd. he took no questions.\n\ngov. abbott faces a difficult political reality. on the left, democrats have been inspired by big gains at the local level and the surprising performance by beto o'rourke in the 2018 senate race against ted cruz. (although that excitement has been tempered to some extent by donald trump's performance in the 2020 presidential election.)\n\nthose big city leaders have pushed for more government-led efforts to control the spread of the coronavirus. and on the right, gov. abbott has received a great deal of heat and pushback from the most right-wing, trump-like elements of the republican party in texas. these are the conservative voices that have opposed the governor's pandemic restrictions on businesses and lampooned mask wearing. gov. abbott finds himself in the middle of those political winds and there is talk that a more conservative figure could challenge him in the 2022 gubernatorial primary. an old texas progressive activist named jim hightower once wrote, there's nothing in the middle of the road but yellow stripes and dead armadillos. no politician wants to be the armadillo.\n\nwhat else?\n\nwe won't know the toll these restrictions will have on us communities for some time. states are looking at extreme revenue shortfalls, which could affect funding for schools, roads and all sorts of projects for years.\n\nthe first year of the pandemic was not as devastating on state coffers as expected , probably because of federal aid to businesses and the unemployed.\n\nnow democrats want to keep the spigot of federal money running, although what they can pass through the senate remains very much in question. republicans, now in the minority at the federal level, are looking to move on from covid.\n\nfewer will get checks with senate bill. democrats in the senate and the white house have democrats in the senate and the white house have agreed to a more narrowly targeted set of stimulus checks and will cut out couples making more than $160,000 and individuals making more than $80,000 per year. those additional families would have gotten partial payments under the house plan.\n\npeople need health insurance. there have been there have been hundreds of thousands of sign-ups for obamacare exchanges during a special enrollment period ordered by biden.\n\npence was targeted by rioters! but he's not rejecting the big lie. but he's not rejecting the big lie. pence pushes false election fraud claims in denouncing democratic reform bill\n\nfirst look -- . writes cnn's simone pathe: this cycle, only one senator is running for reelection in a state carried by the opposite party's 2020 presidential candidate: gop sen. ron johnson. his wisconsin seat is the third most likely to flip, but the two-term senator is the most vulnerable republican incumbent. the 10 senate seats most likely to flip in 2022 . writes cnn's simone pathe: this cycle, only one senator is running for reelection in a state carried by the opposite party's 2020 presidential candidate: gop sen. ron johnson. his wisconsin seat is the third most likely to flip, but the two-term senator is the most vulnerable republican incumbent.\n\nnew york gov. andrew cuomo apologizes again. he had spent a week away from cameras.\n\nthis is going to be hard to achieve. biden's energy secretary vows to 'leave no worker behind' in the clean energy revolution
(cnn) white house officials are discussing plans to replace health and human services secretary alex azar following a spate of criticism over the early federal response to the coronavirus , a senior administration official confirmed.\n\nany move to replace azar would be contingent on president donald trump deciding to move forward, and there is currently little appetite inside the white house for a big shake up amid the coronavirus pandemic. the official stressed that nothing is imminent, but there are discussions underway at the white house about replacing azar.\n\nthe president tweeted sunday evening that reports about him firing azar are false and said, alex is doing an excellent job! shortly after, azar quote tweeted the president's tweet as part of a multi-tweet thread. like trump, he smeared the press and called the reports that the president was looking to replace him fake news, then lavished praise on trump's handling of the pandemic.\n\nstill, the discussions come after trump appointed vice president mike pence , rather than azar, as the white house's point man for the coronavirus response at a rare presidential news conference. trump had privately expressed frustration over azar's lack of communication on key issues as the head of the white house coronavirus task force.\n\nazar has also been at odds with centers for medicare and medicaid services administrator seema verma, an ally of pence's from indiana who has been involved in the coronavirus task force briefings.\n\nas the coronavirus spreads across the nation, the trump administration has been criticized for its handling of the pandemic, namely by governors, on both sides of the aisle, in desperate need of critical supplies for their states as the president has moved forward on indicating that many states can reopen by may 1.\n\nin a statement saturday night, deputy white house secretary judd deere said, the department of health and human services, under the leadership of secretary azar, continues to lead on a number of the president's priorities. any speculation about personnel is irresponsible and a distraction from our whole-of-government response to covid-19.\n\nthe move to replace azar was first reported by the wall street journal and politico\n\nsecretary azar is busy responding to a global, public health crisis and doesn't have time for palace intrigue, hhs spokeswoman caitlin oakley said in response to the reports.\n\nthe discussions come amid two major shifts in top personnel at the hhs in recent weeks -- changes that follow months of turmoil at the agency.\n\nlast week, former 2016 trump campaign adviser michael caputo was named to serve as the agency's new spokesman. a source familiar with the situation told cnn that caputo was brought in because of the president's distrust of azar and to expect to see an uncomfortable power dynamic between the two men.\n\nand earlier this week, the director of the agency's office involved in developing a coronavirus vaccine said he was abruptly dismissed from his post in part because he resisted efforts to widen the availability of a coronavirus treatment pushed by the president.\n\ndr. rick bright , who had led the biomedical advanced research and development authority, had clashed directly with azar, two people familiar with the situation told cnn. a senior hhs official denied that bright and azar clashed.\n\nazar's role in the trump administration\n\nas secretary, azar has overseen several top administration priorities, including efforts to weaken the affordable care act, combat the opioid crisis and reduce the cost of prescription drugs.\n\na senior republican told cnn that discussions about possibly removing azar are not surprising because he has been on thin ice for months -- partially for genuine problems handling the coronavirus pandemic as well as frustrating the president earlier for how he dealt with other issues, like obamacare.\n\nanother source who is close to azar but critical of some of his actions said he believes the talk about possibly replacing him is coming from advisers close to the president who are using azar as a scapegoat for white house missteps, including trump's statements at the white house briefing this week regarding disinfectant and heat being able to kill the virus.\n\nthe second source said azar is a good guy, who definitely made mistakes but is also being used to cover for the president's own missteps and trump's reluctance to move on from the pandemic because of his concerns about the economy. this source also said that the president was getting mixed advice on firing azar during the pandemic crisis. some people would like to replace him, but others said it would just look bad and add to the chaos, the source added.\n\nazar, who joined the trump administration in january 2018, served as general counsel and deputy secretary of the agency under former president george w. bush. he then joined eli lilly, becoming president of lilly usa in 2012. he spent nearly nine years at the company, during which time it and other drug makers greatly hiked prices.\n\nhe was appointed health and human services secretary after his predecessor tom price resigned over his use of private planes for government business trips.\n\nan economist and lawyer by training, azar clerked for supreme court justice antonin scalia in the early 1990s and later worked under kenneth starr, the independent counsel on the clinton whitewater investigation who defended trump during his impeachment trial.\n\nthis story has been updated sunday with additional developments.\n\ncorrection: this story has been updated to correct the number of coronavirus cases.

(senate minority leader chuck schumer said monday that he had not spoken with trump since their meeting on friday afternoon; he also called trump glaringly absent in the negotiations.)\n\ni just don't think it helps for him to be involved at all, arizona republican sen. jeff flake said of trump on sunday night. the white house really hasn't been involved from what i've seen.\n\nthere's a simple reason for trump's lack of active involvement: he doesn't possess any sort of deep policy knowledge on this issue and he is uninterested in educating himself on the finer points of the policy debates at work in the shutdown in order to have any sort of real influence over the way forward.\n\nwhen trump has waded into this government funding/immigration fight, he's managed to muddy the waters rather than make them clearer. his 55-minute public conversation with democratic and republican lawmakers earlier this month suggested he was very much open not only to a deal on daca but a broader agreement on comprehensive immigration reform. forty-eight hours later, trump was angrily condemning plans to continue to allow immigrants from shithole countries into the us.\n\nlast friday, when senate minority leader chuck schumer left his meeting with trump, he said he believed a deal to avoid a government shutdown was in the offing. within hours, he had been informed there would be no deal.\n\nwhat explains that lurching between deal and no deal? the obvious answer is that trump doesn't have a strong policy background on any issue other than trade. as a result, he is hugely persuadable – usually by the last person who he talks to. so, what looks like a deal one minute turns into no deal an hour later. and, because he lacks interest in the policy nuance, misunderstandings abound as he agrees to things without even knowing he is doing so. (witness trump's seeming acquiescence to a clean daca vote in that public meeting; house majority leader kevin mccarthy had to step in to make sure trump didn't agree to something without even realizing he was doing it.)\n\nbecause of his unfamiliarity with details, trump winds up being broadly superfluous to the intricate sort of negotiations that wind up closing the gaps between republicans and democrats – or even between republicans and republicans – on major issues.\n\nremember trump's involvement in trying to win over wavering republicans for his hoped-for repeal of the affordable care act? time and time again, gop senators would emerge from meetings with trump bewildered at his lack of a grasp about the specifics of any sort of deal. trump's pitch to these lawmakers was of the 50,000-foot variety: hey, we're all republicans and obamacare is bad, right? there was very little engagement with specific concerns about, say, medicaid expansion dollars in their states.\n\nit all makes some sense when you consider the role trump played in his real estate ventures. he was never the guy negotiating the nitty-gritty details. he was the guy who came in the room at the end to close the deal by the sheer force of his personality.\n\nthat's clearly the role trump saw for himself in the these shutdown negotiations. this, from kevin liptak's terrific trump piece over the weekend, is telling (bolding is mine):\n\nin phone calls on sunday, trump encouraged sen. john cornyn and rep. kevin mccarthy, the no. 2 republicans in the senate and house, to reach an agreement with democrats. but as he did at the end of last week, he stressed they should come to him with a deal instead of offering his own ideas for a way out, according to a person familiar with the calls.\n\nthe reason trump didn't offer his ideas for a way out of the shutdown is that he didn't have ideas for a way out of the shutdown. that, to his mind, isn't really his job. he's the closer. he comes in, signs the paper, shows everyone the signed paper and hands out the pen he used to sign it to some lucky person. that's the job.\n\nthe problem for trump is that senators and house members don't have the same reaction to him that many in the business world do. they are not awed by being in his presence and, therefore, willing to do whatever his people tell them to do. they have their own constituencies and their own interests that exist entirely apart from trump's charisma. (this is especially true when trump's approval ratings sit in the high 30s/very low 40s.)\n\ntrump was a bystander in the government shutdown talks because he simply had very little to offer. his lack of policy knowledge – and his unstinting belief he already knows everything he needs to know – make him, the president of the united states, largely irrelevant to the re-opening of the federal government. amazing.
washington (cnn) president donald trump made 56 false claims last week -- repeating one of his conspiracy theories about the 2016 election, promoting new fiction about impeachment witness lt. col. alexander vindman, and inflating his accomplishments and his standing in the polls.\n\namong other things.\n\nfifty-six false claims over seven days (february 10 through february 16) is just about standard for this president. trump is now averaging about 59 false claims per week since we started keeping track at cnn on july 8.\n\ntrump made 11 of last week's 56 false claims in an interview with geraldo rivera on cleveland radio. but trump isn't only dishonest when speaking to supporters and average citizens: he also made 11 false claims during a white house gathering with state governors.\n\nimmigration was the most frequent subject of trump's false claims, with 10, followed by the economy and democrats at six each. he made five false claims apiece about the mueller investigation, health care and impeachment.\n\ntrump is now up to 1,873 total false claims since july 8.\n\nthe most egregious false claim: the buses to new hampshire\n\njust as trump has a handy fictional excuse for why he lost the popular vote in 2016 -- millions of illegal votes in california and maybe elsewhere -- he has a handy fictional excuse for why he didn't win new hampshire: hundreds and hundreds of buses of improper voters, shipped up from massachusetts, he told a rally crowd in new hampshire last week.\n\nthat simply did not happen . this is the president propagating a conspiracy theory, and undermining faith in american democracy, for no good reason.\n\nthe most revealing false claim: redemption money\n\nsome of trump's lies are extravagantly detailed, as if he has rehearsed a long imaginary script. others are notable for their carelessness, as if he has decided that people will believe him no matter how little effort he has made to make the tale sound precise and convincing.\n\ntrump said the following to his new hampshire rally crowd about the border wall americans are paying for: you do know who's paying for the wall, don't you? right. redemption from illegal aliens that are coming in. the redemption money is paying for the wall.\n\nthere is no such thing as redemption money, immigration experts said. some of the experts thought trump might have been attempting to refer, rather, to remittance money -- money immigrants send back home to their countries of origin.\n\nthis wouldn't have made the claim accurate, since trump has not implemented any of his proposals to impound or tax remittance money to pay for the wall, but it might have seemed at least slightly more plausible if he had taken the time to memorize the right word.\n\nthe most absurd false claim: impeachment polling\n\ntrump's standing in the polls has improved since democrats embarked on their impeachment push in the fall. in gallup polling, he is now at 49% approval , up from 40% in late september.\n\non february 9, new york post columnist miranda devine wrote : trump has gained 10 points since impeachment began in october.\n\ntrump then quoted devine's words in a tweet . except, naturally, he changed her gained 10 points to gained 20 points.\n\nhere is the full list of 56 false claims, starting with the ones we haven't previously included in a weekly roundup:\n\nnew hampshire elections\n\na conspiracy theory about new hampshire in 2016\n\nnow i can't tell you what's happening tomorrow because, you know, you have some pretty strange election laws here, right? remember last time -- we won the primary tremendously? we should've won the election, but they had buses being shipped up from massachusetts, hundreds and hundreds of buses. and it was very, very close, even though they did. but this year, you know we have a great governor, governor sununu, great governor, chris. and now you get prosecuted if you do what they did, so it should be a lot different. -- february 10 campaign rally in manchester, new hampshire\n\nfacts first: there is no evidence for trump's conspiracy theory that hundreds of buses full of illegal voters were sent from massachusetts to new hampshire in the 2016 presidential election. state election officials who conducted a : there is no evidence for trump's conspiracy theory that hundreds of buses full of illegal voters were sent from massachusetts to new hampshire in the 2016 presidential election. state election officials who conducted a detailed review did not turn up any such evidence.\n\nrepublicans voting in the democratic primary in new hampshire\n\nthis has been an incredible state for us. it's a state where the people are great, just great people. and we hear that there could be -- because you have crossovers in primaries, don't you? so i hear a lot of republicans tomorrow will vote for the weakest candidate possible of the democrats. -- february 10 campaign rally in manchester, new hampshire\n\nfacts first: trump was mistaken: new hampshire's primary system does not allow true crossovers, in which people registered for one party can go vote in the other party's primary. only democrats and  : trump was mistaken: new hampshire's primary system does not allow true crossovers, in which people registered for one party can go vote in the other party's primary. only democrats and  undeclared  voters, not registered republicans, were allowed to show up and vote in the democratic primary the day after trump spoke here.\n\ntrump might have meant to refer to independents or even registered democrats who are supportive of republicans, but what he actually said was inaccurate.\n\nthe snake\n\ntrump introduced the snake, a song whose lyrics he uses as an allegory for what he claims is the danger posed by migrants who seem harmless, and said, this was a song from the 1950s, al green... -- february 10 campaign rally in manchester, new hampshire\n\nfacts first: trump was wrong both about who sang the song and about when the song was released. the snake is an : trump was wrong both about who sang the song and about when the song was released. the snake is an al wilson song from 1968 , not an al green song from the 1950s.\n\nthe song was written by oscar brown jr. in 1963; brown's daughters have complained about trump's appropriation of their father's words, saying brown, who died in 2005, would have opposed trump's agenda and message.\n\nimmigration\n\nredemption money and the wall\n\nyou do know who's paying for the wall, don't you? right. redemption from illegal aliens that are coming in. the redemption money is paying for the wall. -- february 10 campaign rally in manchester, new hampshire\n\nfacts first: american taxpayers are paying for trump's border wall. immigration experts say redemption money is not even a term they are familiar with. some guessed that trump might have meant remittance money -- money immigrants send back home to their countries of origin -- but that wouldn't make trump's claim any more factual: he has not implemented any of his proposals to pay for the wall by taxing or impounding remittances.\n\nyou can read a full fact check here\n\nthe number of venezuelans living in the us\n\nwe have millions of people from venezuela living in the united states very successfully. -- february 12 exchange with reporters at meeting with ecuadorian president lenín moreno\n\nfacts first: trump was exaggerating the number of venezuelans living in the us. there were about 363,000 venezuelan-born people living in the us in 2018, plus an additional 129,000 people of venezuelan origin, according to an analysis of census bureau data by mark hugo lopez, director of global migration and demography research at the pew research center.\n\nwhile additional thousands of venezuelans sought asylum in the us in 2019, there is no sign that the current number of venezuelans residing in the country has increased to anywhere close to millions since 2018.\n\nthe mueller investigation\n\nthe legality of the mueller investigation\n\nwho are the four prosecutors (mueller people?) who cut and ran after being exposed for recommending a ridiculous 9 year prison sentence to a man that got caught up in an investigation that was illegal, the mueller scam, and shouldn't ever even have started? -- february 11 tweet\n\nand if you look at the mueller investigation, it was a scam because it was illegally set up. -- february 12 exchange with reporters at meeting with ecuadorian president lenín moreno\n\nfacts first: the mueller investigation was not illegal.\n\nmultiple federal courts have upheld the legality of mueller's appointment and endorsed actions he took, such as subpoenaing witnesses to testify before a grand jury and bringing criminal charges against some senior trump aides.\n\nthe inspector general for the department of justice conducted an exhaustive review and determined in a report released in december that the fbi had a legitimate basis for opening the russia investigation in july 2016, prior to mueller's appointment in may 2017, though his report also criticized some fbi officials for how they had handled other aspects of the investigation.\n\nonly two of the four prosecutors who withdrew from the roger stone case after their sentencing recommendation was reversed by the department of justice had worked on mueller's team. the claim that the prosecutors were exposed is misleading -- they made their sentencing recommendation in a public court filing, not in secret. (stone was later sentenced to 40 months in prison.)\n\nroger stone's crimes\n\ntrump said nobody even knows what roger stone did to face the possibility of a nine-year prison sentence. (prosecutors originally recommended seven to nine years, then the department of justice overruled them and asked for far less time; stone was later sentenced to 40 months in prison .) trump said, you have murderers and drugs addicts; they don't get nine years. nine years for doing something that nobody even can define what he did. -- february 12 exchange with reporters at meeting with ecuadorian president lenín moreno\n\nfacts first: trump is free to believe that stone is innocent, but it's not true that nobody knows what stone did or that nobody can define what he did. a jury : trump is free to believe that stone is innocent, but it's not true that nobody knows what stone did or that nobody can define what he did. a jury convicted stone of seven felonies: five counts of lying to congress, one count of witness tampering, and one count of obstructing a congressional committee proceeding.\n\ncnn and the roger stone raid\n\ntrump said of the fbi's january 2019 raid on roger stone's florida home, footage of which was captured by cnn journalists: this is early in the morning, cnn following them. so they were obviously alerted. -- february 13 radio interview with geraldo rivera\n\nfacts first: cnn was not alerted to the timing of the stone raid and arrest. as cnn's jeremy herb : cnn was not alerted to the timing of the stone raid and arrest. as cnn's jeremy herb explained , cnn's presence outside stone's florida home at the time was the product of good instincts, some key clues, more than a year of observing comings at the dc federal courthouse and the special counsel's office -- and a little luck on the timing. you can read more here\n\nspecial counsel robert mueller's team said in a february 2019 court filing that it was aware of no information indicating that reporters were given any advance knowledge of a possible indictment. federal judge amy berman jackson said there was no evidence in the record to prove the allegation that cnn knew the time and place of the arrest.\n\nroger stone's witness tampering\n\ntrump said of randy credico, the witness roger stone was convicted of tampering with: that person said he had no idea he was going to jail for that. that person didn't want to press charges. -- february 12 exchange with reporters at meeting with ecuadorian president lenín moreno\n\nfacts first: credico did oppose stone being sent to prison, : credico did oppose stone being sent to prison, writing a letter to the judge to advocate against stone's incarceration. (stone was sentenced to 40 months on thursday.) but it's not true that he didn't want stone charged at all.\n\ni never said that, credico told cnn in a text message wednesday. credico noted that he has said he didn't feel personally threatened by stone himself, but he has also said that he felt threatened -- because of the climate in this country right now -- that someone else might try to kill him, t elling cnn's kate bolduan that he feared somebody may pull a jack ruby on me.\n\ni never told the prosecutors to charge or not charge him, credico told cnn on wednesday. he referred us to his letter to the judge, in which he did not proclaim stone innocent. he wrote in that letter: i understand that roger stone has broken federal laws, but a prison sentence is beyond what is required in this case.\n\npaul manafort and judges\n\nis this the judge that put paul manafort in solitary confinement, something that not even mobster al capone had to endure? how did she treat crooked hillary clinton? just asking! -- february 11 tweet\n\nbut paul manafort was put in solitary confinement by the judge... -- february 13 radio interview with geraldo rivera\n\nfacts first: trump did not name the judge, but no judge put manafort in solitary confinement.\n\nwhile a federal judge, amy berman jackson, did revoke manafort's bail and send him to jail in 2018 after he tried to tamper with witnesses (he later pleaded guilty), she didn't dictate where he would be incarcerated or what kind of cell he would be held in. a us marshal, and not the court, made the decision about where he should be placed, she explained in court in 2019.\n\nwhile manafort was held alone at virginia's northern neck regional jail, he was not subjected to the harsh conditions commonly associated with solitary: he was given a large private room, bathroom, shower, workspace, phone and laptop. he even said during a monitored phone call that he was being treated like a vip, according to a court filing by prosecutors.\n\nnonetheless, manafort complained about being at northern neck, saying he was being held in solitary and that he was too far from his lawyers to prepare for trial. a different judge, t.s. ellis, then transferred him to the city jail in alexandria, virginia -- but ellis, too, did not order him held in solitary. upon manafort's arrival, alexandria sheriff dana lawhorne said , because he is a high-profile inmate, mr. manafort will be placed in protective custody, which limits his interactions with other inmates.\n\nat the alexandria jail , manafort's cell had a single bunk, it has a window, radio, newspapers, and view of the television, and he was released for a few hours a day to walk around and be with other people, jackson said in court in 2019.\n\nrobert mueller and congress\n\nasked by interviewer geraldo rivera what he was referring to in a tweet accusing former special counsel and former fbi director robert mueller of having lied to congress, trump said, well, he said in congress that he never applied for the job of the fbi director and now it's been proven that he did. -- february 13 radio interview with geraldo rivera\n\nfacts first: it has not been proven that mueller had applied for the job of fbi director when he met with trump in may 2017. mueller's testimony -- that he met with trump because he had been asked to provide advice on the vacant job of fbi director, not because he was seeking the job again -- has been corroborated by former senior trump aide steve bannon.\n\nmueller, who served as fbi director between 2001 and 2013, testified that he was not acting as a candidate for the job during the conversation with trump. he said that my understanding (was) i was not applying for that job. i was asked to give my input on what it would take to do the job.\n\nbannon, who was serving as white house chief strategist at the time, told mueller's team that the white house had invited mueller to offer a perspective on the institution of the fbi, according to the mueller report. the mueller report also said: bannon said that, although the white house thought about beseeching mueller to become director again, he did not come in looking for the job.\n\nbannon made similar comments in a 2018 interview with msnbc, factcheck.org noted\n\nukraine and impeachment\n\nlt. col. alexander vindman's claims about trump's call\n\ntrump said lt. col. alexander vindman, who raised concerns about trump's july phone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky, reported a false call and reported very inaccurate things about the call. -- february 11 exchange with reporters at signing ceremony for the supporting veterans in stem careers act\n\nfacts first: there is simply no evidence vindman has said anything factually inaccurate about the call. unlike the whistleblower who filed a complaint about the call after being told about it, vindman listened to the call live.

(contrary to trump's repeated claims, the whistleblower's description was also highly accurate .)\n\ntrump is free to disagree with vindman's opinion that trump's words were inappropriate or that they represented a demand of the ukrainian government. but there is n othing to suggest vindman misreported any of those words themselves. /\n\nvindman's response to the call\n\ntrump said vindman, the top ukraine expert on the national security council before he was ousted earlier this month, ran and said he didn't like the call. first of all, that's very insubordinate. why wouldn't he go to his, his immediate -- you know, he went to congress or he went to schiff or he went to somebody. -- february 13 radio interview with geraldo rivera\n\nfacts first: vindman did not run to congress generally or to democratic rep. adam schiff specifically with his concerns about trump's phone call. vindman : vindman did not run to congress generally or to democratic rep. adam schiff specifically with his concerns about trump's phone call. vindman testified in the impeachment inquiry that he reported his concerns to national security council lawyer john eisenberg, who had previously advised him to get in touch with such issues.\n\n(vindman said he also spoke about the call to george kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for european and eurasian affairs, and someone in the intelligence community, whom he did not name. kent testified that vindman did not share the majority of what was said. i learned the majority of the content after reading the declassified read-out.)\n\nvindman did eventually speak to congress in the impeachment inquiry, but only under subpoena.\n\ntrump and republican members of congress have complained that vindman went to eisenberg rather than to his superior on the national security council, europe and russia senior director tim morrison. morrison testified that it was unfortunate, but not unusual that vindman went to eisenberg; morrison, who had been in the job for less than two weeks, testified that his predecessor, fiona hill, did not have the same view of how reporting through the chain of command should work.\n\nvindman testified : i attempted to try to talk to mr. morrison. that didn't happen before i received instructions from john eisenberg to not talk to anybody else any further.\n\na claim in the new york post\n\nthank you to @mirandadevine of the new york post for your interesting (and correct) column today.

trump went from 40% to 49%. trump's increase is much smaller, however, if you look at an average of polls. according to fivethirtyeight's average , trump went from 42.1% on september 30 to 43.2% on january 28 (and 43.3% on february 21).\n\nformer officials\n\njohn bolton and senate confirmation\n\ntrump said of john bolton, his former national security adviser: and i gave him a big break because, you know, that's not a senate-approved job. and he was not able to get a senate approved job, he never had one before. and when he was at the un he was -- he was appointed, but he wasn't approved by the senate. and so we're going to see how it all works out. -- february 10 interview with fox business' trish regan\n\nfacts first: it's not true that john bolton has never been approved by the senate. while trump is correct that bolton was not senate-confirmed for his job as ambassador to the united nations -- president george w. bush resorted to a : it's not true that john bolton has never been approved by the senate. while trump is correct that bolton was not senate-confirmed for his job as ambassador to the united nations -- president george w. bush resorted to a recess appointment to install him in that post in 2005 -- bolton was confirmed for previous positions: in 1982 as assistant administrator of the us agency for international development, in 1985 as assistant attorney general, in 1989 as assistant secretary of state, and in 2001 as undersecretary of state for arms control and international security.\n\njames wolfe and classified information\n\ntrump said: look, you had somebody -- just recently, you saw what happened. he got two months. he got sentenced to two months for leaking classified information at the highest level. and: but think of it: a man leaks classified information -- highly classified. they give him two months. -- february 12 exchange with reporters at meeting with ecuadorian president lenín moreno\n\nfacts first: trump was almost certainly referring to james wolfe, the former senate intelligence committee aide who : trump was almost certainly referring to james wolfe, the former senate intelligence committee aide who received a two-month prison sentence in 2018. but wolfe was not convicted -- nor even charged -- with leaking classified information, and he denies he ever did so . wolfe pleaded guilty to one count of making a false statement to the fbi about his contact with journalists; two other false statement charges were dropped\n\nthe justice department said upon his guilty plea: by his guilty plea, wolfe admitted making false statements to the fbi concerning whether he had provided unclassified, but not otherwise publicly-available, information to reporters.\n\nwolfe's lawyers said in a statement upon the guilty plea: jim was never charged with having compromised classified information, nor is such a charge part of today's plea. upon sentencing wolfe, federal judge ketanji brown jackson noted that she was weighing only wolfe's criminal lying to the fbi;

the report simply said, the oig (office of the inspector general) is issuing this report to the fbi for such action as it deems appropriate. it was a separate entity , the fbi's office of professional responsibility, that recommended mccabe's firing after receiving horowitz's report before its public release.\n\nthe department of justice informed mccabe in february 2020 that it would not be pursuing criminal charges against him.\n\nthe 2008, 2016 and 2020 elections\n\nhillary clinton's campaign spending\n\ntrump claimed it would be easy to beat democratic presidential candidate michael bloomberg. when interviewer geraldo rivera noted that bloomberg has a lot money, trump said, yeah, he's got money but, you know, they spent $2 billion on me, hillary clinton, and mostly negative ads, and i won. and i won really easily if you look at -- you know, the electoral college, i won some states that were -- i won by massive numbers. she spent $2 billion. i mean, they had a $2 billion campaign. -- february 13 radio interview with geraldo rivera\n\nfacts first: trump was more than doubling clinton's spending in the 2016 election. her campaign : trump was more than doubling clinton's spending in the 2016 election. her campaign spent about $563 million , not $2 billion, according to the center for responsive politics, a money-in-politics watchdog group. if you add in spending by outside groups supportive of clinton's candidacy, the total is still just under $770 million, according to the center for responsive politics.\n\njohn mccain and the 2008 election\n\ntrump said he thought sen. mitt romney should have beaten president barack obama in the 2012 election, then said of 2008 republican nominee john mccain: i don't -- i'm not a mccain fan, never was. but i didn't think he could have possibly won that one because, you know, he was handed over sort of a rough time in terms of many different things. and first african american -- i said that the whole thing was really stacked against mccain. and again, i'm not a fan, but i never said he should have won. -- february 13 radio interview with geraldo rivera\n\nfacts first: it's not true that trump never said mccain should have won the 2008 election. he : it's not true that trump never said mccain should have won the 2008 election. he tweeted in 2015: why would anybody listen to @mittromney? he lost an election that should have easily been won against obama. by the way,so did john mccain!\n\nsen. sherrod brown\n\ntrump quoted a tweet about how syndicated opinion columnist connie schultz, a trump critic, is married to democratic sen. sherrod brown. trump wrote: nice conflict. brown dropped out of presidential race fast. polled at zero! -- february 11 tweet\n\nfacts first: brown did not drop out of the presidential race: he : brown did not drop out of the presidential race: he never entered the race at all. while brown did embark in january 2019 on a so-called listening tour of states that vote early in the democratic primary, a sign he was thinking about a run, he announced in march 2019 that he would not go ahead with a candidacy.\n\nwell, there's that, schultz responded when we pointed this out on twitter.\n\nthe us, isis and the philippines\n\nbut if you look back -- if you go back three years ago, when isis was overrunning the philippines, we came in and, literally, singlehandedly were able to save them from vicious attacks on their islands. -- february 12 exchange with reporters at meeting with ecuadorian president lenín moreno\n\nfacts first: isis was not overrunning the philippines three years ago. the us was : isis was not overrunning the philippines three years ago. the us was one of several countries that aided the philippines in a 2017 battle against militant groups linked to isis; the us did not succeed singlehandedly.\n\naccording to carlos conde, the philippines researcher for human rights watch's asia division, the militant groups operated mainly on the southern island called mindanao, but even then just a small portion of mindanao. conde added that the conflict trump may have been referring to happened only in one city, marawi.\n\nthere's no way also that the us or any other foreign government can 'singlehandedly' engage in a battle like marawi because the philippine constitution forbids it, conde told cnn. foreign troops and foreign military may help by providing intel, logistics, weapons but they can't, technically, actively participate in combat.\n\nhenri barkey, adjunct senior fellow for middle east studies at the council on foreign relations, who studies isis, said trump's claim is a total fabrication.\n\njoaquín el chapo guzmán\n\nwhile complaining how paul manafort was put in solitary confinement, trump said, el chapo i don't think was placed in solitary confinement. -- february 13 radio interview with geraldo rivera\n\nfacts first: guzmán, the notorious mexican drug lord, was indeed : guzmán, the notorious mexican drug lord, was indeed held in solitary confinement at the metropolitan correctional center in manhattan before his trial. l in a 2017 court filing in which his lawyers sought to get him taken out of solitary, they said that he spent 23 hours of every weekday in a small cell with no windows and all 24 hours of weekend days in that cell. he was not allowed any contact with other prisoners.\n\nafter guzmán's conviction in 2019, he was sent to a supermax prison in colorado in which many prisoners are held in long-term solitary confinement . human rights group amnesty international has complained that the use of prolonged isolation at the prison amounts to a violation of international law.\n\npast presidents and their lawyers\n\nin an interview with geraldo rivera, trump defended having personal lawyer rudy giuliani to deal with the government of ukraine.\n\nbut also, other presidents had 'em. you know fdr had a lawyer, who was practically, you know, was totally involved with government. eisenhower had a lawyer. they all had lawyers. bill clinton had a lawyer. you know he had a very good lawyer, you know (who) that was. they all had lawyers and they do things for 'em. -- february 13 radio interview with geraldo rivera\n\nfacts first: experts on all three former presidents disputed trump's characterization that they had personal lawyers who were totally involved with government in any manner resembling the way giuliani was.\n\ntim rives, deputy director and supervisory archivist of the eisenhower presidential library, told cnn, while eisenhower employed numerous personal attorneys over the years, they were all used for routine estate planning and personal business purposes.\n\nas for franklin d. roosevelt, jeffrey engel, director of the center for presidential history, told cnn, i can think of no one that would possibly fit the description trump offers.\n\nfdr did have a right-hand do-it-all hard-jobs man: harry hopkins. but hopkins was a social worker by training, engel said. so hopkins would fit the bill, of a 'fixer' if you will, but he was no lawyer.\n\nengel added, fdr used lawyers for law stuff; so too clinton -- and his closest 'fixer,' vernon jordan, was a lawyer. but i really don't see any comparison between the type of government-engaged work by a private lawyer that giuliani seems to be (doing).\n\nclinton biographer david maraniss elaborated upon engel's point, saying, clinton used personal lawyers at various times in his own defense and to protect himself from various charges but did not assign personal lawyers to go to a foreign country to solicit dirt on a possible opponent.\n\nrepeats\n\nhere are the repeat false claims we have previously fact checked in a weekly roundup:\n\nimmigration\n\ndeportations to guatemala, honduras, el salvador and mexico\n\ntrump claimed twice that, before his presidency, guatemala, honduras, el salvador and mexico would not accept the return of criminals the us wanted to deport. he said on one of these occasions: you couldn't bring them back. they wouldn't take them. we could catch a murderer from honduras, guatemala, el salvador. we bring them back and they say, 'don't land your plane. your bus can't come in. your van can't come in. we don't want them. we don't want them back.'\n\nfacts first: trump was mixing up two separate issues. while the trump administration does have : trump was mixing up two separate issues. while the trump administration does have new agreements with all four countries , those agreements are related to the handling of people who have come or are trying to come to the us seeking asylum, not criminals the us is seeking to deport. in 2016, prior to trump's presidency, none of the four countries was on the list of countries that immigration and customs enforcement (ice) considered recalcitrant (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the us.\n\nin the 2016 fiscal year, the last full year before trump took office, ice reported that mexico, guatemala, honduras and el salvador ranked first, second, third and fourth for the country of citizenship of people being removed from the us. the same was true in the 2017 fiscal year , which encompassed the end of barack obama's presidency and the beginning of trump's. ice did not identify any widespread problems with deportations to these countries.\n\nin july 2016, ice deputy director daniel ragsdale testified to congress that there were some exceptions to the rule: it is important to note that while countries may generally be cooperative, sometimes they may delay or refuse the repatriation of certain individuals. for example, el salvador, a country that is generally cooperative, has recently delayed the issuance of a number of travel documents where there is no legal impediment to removal.\n\nso trump could have accurately made a less sweeping claim. but he was exaggerating when he declared that the four countries simply weren't taking them back.\n\nobama and daca\n\nspeaking of the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) initiative created by the obama administration in 2012 to protect dreamers, people brought illegally to the us as children, trump said, you know, president obama signed that bill. it was an executive order. and when he signed it, he said -- essentially, he said, 'i don't have the right to do this, but i'm going to do it anyway.' -- february 10 remarks at speech and question and answer session with governors\n\nfacts first: obama didn't sign daca, which was neither a bill nor an executive order; the program was created through a : obama didn't sign daca, which was neither a bill nor an executive order; the program was created through a memo by obama's then-secretary of homeland security janet napolitano. and while obama had, earlier in his presidency, said he could not unilaterally suspend the deportation of undocumented high school students, he obviously did not say at the time daca was created that he did not have the right to create it.\n\nin his speech on the day of daca's creation, obama called it a temporary stopgap measure and called again for congress to pass legislation to protect dreamers.\n\nmexican soldiers and the border\n\ntrump said three times that mexico has put 27,000 soldiers on the us border.\n\nfacts first: mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the us border in particular. cnn reported on november 2: nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to mexico's northern border, where they've set up 20 checkpoints, mexican defense minister luis cresencio sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country's security strategy. at the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints.\n\nacting us customs and border protection commissioner mark morgan has offered similar numbers, telling reporters in september that 10,000 of approximately 25,000 troops were on mexico's southern border.\n\ndemocrats and borders\n\ntrump said on two occasions that the democrats support open borders.\n\nfacts first: even 2020 democratic presidential candidates who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as trump suggests.\n\ndemocrats and the border wall\n\nbut when you want to get money for a wall that most of the people in the democrat party wanted five years ago -- they just didn't like it when i announced that we were going to build it -- they were unable to get it built. they had the money, but they were unable to get it built because it takes talent to build things, and they don't have that talent. but we got it built. -- february 14 speech to national border patrol council members\n\nfacts first: starting in 2015, about five years ago, trump was campaigning for the presidency on a controversial promise to build a border wall; there is no evidence the democrats wanted a wall at that time.\n\ntrump would have at least a slightly better case if he spoke of 2013, just shy of seven years ago, when democrats supported a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included 700 miles of border fencing. but that was fencing, not the giant wall trump has proposed -- and many democrats supported it only as part of a package that included provisions they wanted, most notably a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\nfor example, mary landrieu, then a democratic senator for louisiana, voted for the final bill that included the fencing. but she said during the debate: i'm not going to waste taxpayers' money on a dumb fence...i've been in tunnels under the fence. i've watched people climb over the fence. i'm not going to send taxpayers' money down a rat hole.\n\nsan diego and the border wall\n\ntrump told a story about how, in san diego, they were begging us to build a wall, and then as soon as it was built, they said, 'we don't want the wall,' so trump threatened to take the wall down and move it elsewhere, and they said, 'no, no, no, don't do that.' -- february 14 speech to national border patrol council members\n\nfacts first: it is possible that someone or some group from san diego told him they wanted a border wall, but there is no basis for trump's suggestion that the city itself ever begged him for a wall, let alone begged him for a wall, changed its mind, and then reversed itself again and urged him to keep the wall. san diego's city council voted 5-3 in 2017 to express opposition to a wall, and even the republican mayor, kevin faulconer, has made clear that he is opposed.\n\nukraine and impeachment\n\nzelensky and the phone call\n\na couple of things: the president, as you know, of ukraine stated very strongly that there was no pressure, there was no anything, there was nothing wrong. -- february 11 exchange with reporters at signing ceremony for the supporting veterans in stem careers act\n\nfacts first: zelensky did say there had been no pressure from trump and made other statements to that effect, but he has not gone so far as to say trump did nothing wrong.\n\nin an interview published by time magazine in early december, zelensky did say, look, i never talked to the president from the position of a quid pro quo. that's not my thing. but zelensky continued: i don't want us to look like beggars. but you have to understand. we're at war. if you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us. i think that's just about fairness. it's not about a quid pro quo. it just goes without saying.\n\nthe timing of rep. adam schiff's comments\n\n....you look at shifty schiff. take a look at what he did. he made up my conversation. and then we dropped the transcript, and he almost had a heart attack. -- february 11 exchange with reporters at signing ceremony for the supporting veterans in stem careers act\n\nfacts first: trump can reasonably criticize schiff for his comments at a house intelligence committee hearing in september; as we've written before, schiff's mix of near-quotes from trump's phone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky, his own analysis, and supposed parody was : trump can reasonably criticize schiff for his comments at a house intelligence committee hearing in september; as we've written before, schiff's mix of near-quotes from trump's phone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky, his own analysis, and supposed parody was at the very least confusing . but schiff spoke the day after trump released the rough transcript, not before trump released the document.\n\ntrump has repeatedly inverted the timing of schiff's comments in relation to the release of the rough transcript.\n\ncorrections to the rough transcript\n\nand then they all went wild when i said that we have transcripts of the calls. and they turned out to be totally accurate transcripts. and if anybody felt there was any changes, we let them make it because it didn't matter. so we had accurate — totally accurate transcripts. -- february 11 exchange with reporters at signing ceremony for the supporting veterans in stem careers act\n\nfacts first: in fact, army lt. col. alexander vindman, the national security council's top ukraine expert, testified in the house impeachment inquiry that two substantive changes he suggested to the rough transcript of trump's call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky were not made. as we have noted before, the document trump released explicitly : in fact, army lt. col. alexander vindman, the national security council's top ukraine expert, testified in the house impeachment inquiry that two substantive changes he suggested to the rough transcript of trump's call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky were not made. as we have noted before, the document trump released explicitly says on its first page that it is not a verbatim transcript.\n\nvindman testified that he had wanted to change the words the company to burisma, the company name he said zelensky had used on his call with trump. and vindman testified that he had wanted to add in trump saying there are recordings related to former vice president joe biden and a ukrainian prosecutor biden had pushed ukrainian leaders to fire. (trump was vague about what he meant; in public comments last fall, trump brought up a video of biden at a 2018 event telling the story of his effort to get the prosecutor ousted.)\n\nvindman testified that the transcript was substantively correct even without the changes he had proposed. when i first saw the transcript without the two substantive items that i had attempted to include, i didn't see that as nefarious. i just saw it as, ok, no big deal. you know, these might be meaningful, but it's not that big a deal, he told the house intelligence committee in november\n\ntrade and china\n\nthe size of the us economy and china's economy\n\nwhen i was running, and long before i was running, i'd always heard that china...was going to be the number one economy in the world during 2019. actually, it was 2018, 2019. you all heard it, that we were going to go to number two...but we are now so far ahead of china, in terms of the size of our economy...we, right now, have -- we're so far ahead of them. they're not catching us for a long time. -- february 10 remarks at speech and question and answer session with governors\n\nfacts first: the us economy remains much bigger than china's economy in terms of total output, but china has continued to close the gap even though its own growth has slowed. in other words, it's not true the us is only now so far ahead because of growth during trump's time in office. in fact, the us lead has continued to shrink under trump.\n\nchina reported 6.1% gdp growth in 2019, its slowest rate since 1990. the us reported 2.3% growth in 2019 and 2.9% growth in 2018 -- both up from 1.6% in 2016 during president barack obama's last full year in office, but the highest trump-era growth tying the 2.9% in 2015. while china's official figures are widely seen as unreliable, there is no doubt china has still grown faster than the us during trump's tenure.\n\nnonetheless, china is still nowhere near the total size of the us economy in terms of raw output. china says its 2019 gdp was about $14.4 trillion. the us says its 2019 gdp was about $21.4 trillion.\n\nit's not clear where trump heard china would pass the us as the largest economy in 2019. derek scissors, a resident scholar at the conservative american enterprise institute and an expert on the chinese economy, told cnn in 2019 that there were some predictions at the beginning of that decade that china would pass the us around 2019, but that experts were not saying this around the time trump took office.\n\nthe history of tariffs on china\n\nmassive tariff and tariff money is pouring in and has poured in, poured in by the billions and billions. we never took in 10 cents from china. -- february 10 campaign rally in manchester, new hampshire\n\nfacts first: aside from the fact that : aside from the fact that study after study has shown that americans, not china, are paying the tariff revenue that is pouring into the us treasury, it's not true that the treasury has never received 10 cents from tariffs on china. the us has had tariffs on china for more than two centuries; factcheck.org reported that the us generated an average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the u.s. international trade commission dataweb.\n\ntrump's claim also ignores china's hundreds of billions of dollars in purchases of us goods -- more than $300 billion during trump's presidency alone.\n\nchina and nuclear arms negotiations\n\nnow, at the same time, russia and china both want to negotiate with us to stop this craziness of spending billions and billions of dollars on nuclear weapons. -- february 10 remarks at speech and question and answer session with governors\n\nfacts first: there is no apparent basis for trump's claim that china wants to negotiate with the us to make a deal that would limit its nuclear spending. while we can't know what chinese officials might have said to trump in private, china has publicly expressed vehement opposition to negotiating any limits with the us and russia -- and trump's own national security adviser, robert o'brien, : there is no apparent basis for trump's claim that china wants to negotiate with the us to make a deal that would limit its nuclear spending. while we can't know what chinese officials might have said to trump in private, china has publicly expressed vehement opposition to negotiating any limits with the us and russia -- and trump's own national security adviser, robert o'brien, said at a public event earlier in february: so far -- and this is not surprising -- the chinese are not interested in arms control.\n\nafter trump previously suggested that china wanted to participate in a trilateral deal with the us and russia, a spokesperson for the chinese government said in may 2019: we oppose any country's attempt to make an issue out of china on arms control and will not participate in any negotiation for a trilateral nuclear disarmament agreement.\n\nin october 2019, bloomberg reported that fu cong, director general of the foreign ministry's arms control department, had said, china has no interest in participating in a nuclear-arms-reduction negotiation with the u.s. or russia, given the huge gap between china's nuclear arsenal and those of the u.s. and russia.\n\neconomy\n\nivanka trump and jobs\n\nshe's gotten 15 million jobs. training, that's what she does. she goes to the big companies, gets them to train people. walmart, a million people -- different companies, millions of people but...she had a goal of 500,000 jobs when she started at the beginning and she -- she beat that in about two months. and now it's 15 million jobs... -- february 13 radio interview with geraldo rivera\n\nfacts first: ivanka trump has not gotten 15 million jobs. at the time the president spoke here, roughly 7 million jobs had been created during the entire trump presidency.\n\ndonald trump was referring to the white house's pledge to america's workers initiative, in which ivanka trump has sought to get companies to commit to providing education and training opportunities for workers. as of february 21, 2020, companies had promised to create 15.7 million opportunities,including one million by walmart alone -- but many of these opportunities are internal training programs, not new jobs. also, as cnn has previously reported , many of the companies had already planned these opportunities before ivanka trump launched the initiative.\n\niran's economy\n\ntrump said of iran: their economy went down 25% last year. their gdp is down so much. nobody's ever seen anything like it. -- february 13 radio interview with geraldo rivera\n\nfacts first: while iran's economy did shrink in 2019, trump exaggerated the size of the contraction. in january 2020, the united nations : while iran's economy did shrink in 2019, trump exaggerated the size of the contraction. in january 2020, the united nations said iran's gross domestic product shrunk by 7.1% in 2019. the international monetary fund said in october 2019 that it expected a 9.5% contraction in 2019. the same month, world bank forecast an 8.7% contraction for the 2019-2020 period\n\nit's obviously not true that nobody's ever seen anything like what is happening to iran. in mid-2019, the international monetary fund forecast a 35% decline for the venezuelan economy in that year alone.\n\naid to puerto rico\n\ni'll tell you what, the best friend that puerto rico's ever had, geraldo, is me. they'd gotten $93 billion over a fairly short period of time. there's not a state in the union that's gotten that much money, not even close. -- february 13 radio interview with geraldo rivera\n\nfacts first: puerto rico has not gotten $93 billion in disaster relief funding under trump, and the relief funding for puerto rico is not a record. as of february 21, 2020, eight days after trump spoke here, the federal government's relief tracking : puerto rico has not gotten $93 billion in disaster relief funding under trump, and the relief funding for puerto rico is not a record. as of february 21, 2020, eight days after trump spoke here, the federal government's relief tracking website said $44.1 billion had been allocated to puerto rico since 2017, when hurricane maria and hurricane irma occurred, and $15.2 billion actually spent. by contrast, congress appropriated approximately $120 billion in relief money after hurricane katrina in 2005, the vast majority of which went to louisiana.\n\nas the washington post first explained , trump keeps using an approximate long-term estimate of hurricane-related obligations to puerto rico, not money actually appropriated by congress to puerto rico.\n\nthe eu and nato\n\nthe formation of the european union\n\nso, europe has been treating us very badly. european union. it was really formed so they could treat us badly. so they've done their job. that was one of the primary reasons. -- february 10 remarks at speech and question and answer session with governors\n\nfacts first: experts on the european union say it was not formed to take advantage of or mistreat the united states.\n\nthe president's claims are preposterous. the european communities (forerunner of the eu) were formed in the 1950s as part of a joint us-western european plan to stabilize and secure western europe and promote prosperity, by means of trade liberalization and economic growth, throughout the shared transatlantic space, desmond dinan, a public policy professor at george mason university who is an expert in the history of european integration, said in response to a previous version of this claim.\n\nus presidents have consistently supported european integration efforts.\n\nthe eu was launched in 1993, on the shoulders of the european communities, to promote peace and prosperity in the post-cold war era, an era also of rapid globalization. american officials may have had their doubts about the feasibility of monetary union, and about the possibility of a common (european) security and defense policy, but the us administration strongly supported further european integration in the 1990s, dinan said.\n\nthe us share of nato spending\n\ntrump said of nato: i went over, made a speech, and said, 'you got to pay more.' because the united states was paying everything. essentially, they were paying close to 100%. -- february 10 remarks at speech and question and answer session with governors\n\nfacts first: the us was not paying everything or paying close to 100% of nato before trump's presidency, whether literally or essentially.\n\nnato countries other than the us spent a total of $262 billion on defense in 2016, according to official nato figures (which use 2015 prices and exchange rates). the us spent $651 billion itself that year, about 71% of the total. that's a large percentage, but close to 100% is a significant exaggeration.\n\nnato also has its own direct budget to fund its operations. while the us was also the biggest contributor to this budget in 2016, covering about 22%, it was, clearly, not alone ; germany covered about 15%, france about 11%, the united kingdom about 10%, and so on. countries' contributions were set based on their national income.\n\nnato spending before trump\n\ntrump said that nato was going down like a rocket ship until he became president. he continued, i think my biggest fan in the whole world is secretary general stoltenberg, head of nato. and he said he can't believe it, because for 20 years it went down. it's like a roller coaster dip. no -- none of this (temporary stabilizing); just down. they paid less and less and less. -- february 10 remarks at speech and question and answer session with governors\n\nfacts first: military spending by nato members had increased for two years prior to trump's presidency. according to the nato : military spending by nato members had increased for two years prior to trump's presidency. according to the nato figures released in november, spending increased by 1.7% in 2015 and 3.0% in 2016.\n\naccomplishments\n\nveterans choice\n\ntrump said he worked with sen. jerry moran to do something that couldn't be done for 44 years, they say, and that's veterans choice. -- february 11 remarks at signing ceremony for the supporting veterans in stem careers act\n\nfacts first: the veterans choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators bernie sanders and the late john mccain, was : the veterans choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators bernie sanders and the late john mccain, was signed into law by barack obama in 2014. in 2018, trump signed the va mission act, which expanded and changed the program.\n\nempty seats\n\nif i had one empty seat here, one empty seat in this massive arena, they'd say, 'he didn't sell out.' but you know what? we have never had an empty seat from the day your future first lady and i came down the escalator. never. -- february 10 campaign rally in manchester, new hampshire\n\nfacts first: there have been empty seats at various trump rallies since he came down an escalator to launch his campaign in 2015, including an october rally minneapolis, a july rally in greenville, north carolina, an october 2018 rally in houston and an april 2017 rally in harrisburg, pennsylvania, according to journalists on the scene.\n\npre-existing conditions\n\ntrump promised twice to always safeguard protections for people with pre-existing conditions, once claiming, we left it.\n\nfacts first: we usually don't fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. it's false that trump administration and congressional republicans left protections for people with pre-existing conditions; they have repeatedly put forward : we usually don't fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. it's false that trump administration and congressional republicans left protections for people with pre-existing conditions; they have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. trump is currently supporting a republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of obamacare void. he has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.\n\nhighway approval times\n\ntrump touted a proposal to reduce the time it takes to get environmental approvals for infrastructure projects. he said, highways that were taking 12 years to get approved, 14, 15, 17, 21 years, we're trying to get it down to one year. he then added: so we have it down to two years now, but we -- i think we're going to get it down to one. -- february 10 remarks at speech and question and answer session with governors\n\nfacts first: there is no apparent basis for trump's claim that it now takes just two years to get environmental approvals for highways. according to the federal highway administration's national environmental policy act (nepa) page, the department's median environmental impact statement completion time was 47 months in 2018, up from 46 months in 2017 and 44 months in 2016.\n\nat a trump event in january, council on environmental quality chairwoman mary neumayr said , the council on environmental quality has found that the average time for federal agencies to complete environmental impact statements is four and half years. further, for highway projects, it takes over seven years on average.\n\nbrad karkkainen, a university of minnesota law professor and expert on environmental and land use law, said in an email in response to a previous version of this trump claim that he has never heard of a highway project taking 18 or 20 years, though it's certainly possible that when the median time was six or seven years, a few projects took twice as long, perhaps more.\n\nprescription drug prices\n\nwe're also ready to lower drug prices very substantially. we did -- last year was the first time in 51 years that drug prices -- prescription drug prices -- went down. first time in 51 years. -- february 10 remarks at speech and question and answer session with governors\n\nfacts first: trump was exaggerating how long it had been since there had been a decline in prescription drug prices. the consumer price index for prescription drugs showed a : trump was exaggerating how long it had been since there had been a decline in prescription drug prices. the consumer price index for prescription drugs showed a 0.6% decline between december 2017 and december 2018, which was the first calendar-year decline since 1972 -- the first decline in 46 years , not the first time in 51 years.\n\nin addition, it's not true that the decline was this year or in last year's numbers that just came in. consumer price index data for the period between december 2018 and december 2019 shows an increase of about 3% , not another decrease.\n\nthe consumer price index has limitations as a way to measure what is really happening with drug prices; it does not capture rebates paid by drug manufacturers. other sources of data have shown an increase both years.\n\nfor example, the iqvia institute for human data science, which studies drug prices, found that net drug prices in the united states increased at an estimated 1.5% in 2018. the list price of brand name drugs rose 3.2%, on average, over the 12 months ending in september 2019, after adjusting for inflation, according to ssr health, a consulting firm that captures about 90% of these medications sold in the us.\n\nair quality\n\nand you know, i always say it, we want the cleanest air, the cleanest water. you know we have our cleanest numbers in many years this year, just got released, the cleanest numbers on carbon, on water, cleanliness, on air, purity, on, you know, air cleanness. i want the cleanest air. -- february 13 radio interview with geraldo rivera\n\nfacts first: by several measures, us air was cleaner under obama than it has been : by several measures, us air was cleaner under obama than it has been under trump . three of the six types of pollutants identified by the clean air act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before trump took office, according to environmental protection agency data.\n\nadditionally, there were more unhealthy air days for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 american cities surveyed by the epa, up from 702. though there were significantly more unhealthy air days in obama's first term than there have been in trump's, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under obama.\n\nfurthermore, researchers from carnegie mellon university who studied environmental protection agency data found that air pollution increased between 2016 and 2018.\n\ntrump's approval rating\n\n95% approval rating in the republican party, a record! 53% overall (plus add 9 points?). -- february 10 tweet\n\nfacts first: trump's approval rating among republicans has crept up to : trump's approval rating among republicans has crept up to around 95% in some polls, but even 95% would not be a record. george w. bush hit 99% in gallup polling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001. also, we could not find any major poll around the day of this tweet in which his overall approval rating was 53%.\n\nas of the day of the tweet, trump was at 43.8% overall approval in fivethirtyeight's average of polls , with 51.8% disapproval. while he was higher than usual in some polls -- gallup announced on february 4 that he had hit 49%, his highest gallup reading since taking office -- no major poll showed him as high as 53%.\n\nit is possible trump was taking an actual poll result and adding nine points because of what he claims is a phenomenon in which his supporters decline to tell pollsters that they support him. but even if there are some shy trump supporters, that's just not how approval ratings work; you can't take the findings of a poll and give yourself a guessed number of additional approval points.\n\ntrump was at 94% approval with republicans in the latest gallup poll at the time of his tweet. even 95% would not be an all-time high. gallup's website features data on approval rating by party for every president since harry truman; george w. bush hit 99% in gallup polling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001. his father, george h.w. bush, hit 97% at the end of the gulf war in 1991. reagan, richard nixon, and dwight eisenhower all went higher than 90%.\n\nthe existence of obamacare\n\nbut when i took over, i had a choice. we got rid of the most unpopular thing in obamacare, almost got rid of obamacare, but essentially we did. -- february 10 remarks at speech and question and answer session with governors\n\nfacts first: the individual mandate, which required americans to obtain health insurance, was indeed a key part of obamacare -- but trump hasn't killed obamacare, essentially or otherwise. while he did eliminate the mandate, he has not eliminated obamacare's expansion of the medicaid insurance program for low-income people, the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage, or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases.\n\nthe military under trump\n\ntrump claimed to have rebuilt a military that was depleted, saying: now, it has all brand-new jets. -- february 10 campaign rally in manchester, new hampshire\n\nfacts first: this was a major exaggeration. while trump's administration has : this was a major exaggeration. while trump's administration has invested in new military planes and other equipment, it is not even close to true that the us military has all brand-new jets or that, as trump has claimed in the past, the old planes are all gone now.

(cnn) the state of the union address tuesday night gives president donald trump the chance to shift from weakness to strength by spotlighting the resilient american economy.\n\nthe president's weakness -- his insistence on crossing behavioral and ethical, if not legal, lines -- landed him in the senate impeachment trial scheduled to conclude wednesday. it has made trump the only modern president never to reach 50% job approval among the american public.\n\nbut economic performance on his watch justifies boasting on the biggest stage american presidents command. no wonder trump ahead of the super bowl previewed tuesday night's remarks as very, very positive.\n\ngrowth has slowed lately after the short-term acceleration in 2018, stimulated by tax cuts and spending increases. it remains vulnerable to external shocks, such as the coronavirus crisis that's frightening investors, and the self-inflicted wound of trade conflict, which dampened business confidence before trump called a truce with china last month\n\nyet nine months before election day, history places the trump economy squarely in territory consistent with winning another term.\n\nof his six most recent predecessors, each one who avoided an economic downturn in the last half of his first term won reelection. only bill clinton and trump, so far, avoided any brush with recession at all.\n\nunpresidential behavior notwithstanding, trump has overseen a three-year extension of the expansion he inherited from barack obama. the expansion has broken previous records to become the longest in us history.\n\nit has driven unemployment to its lowest rate in a half-century and boosted wages for average workers. the dow jones industrial average has risen 43% since his inauguration.\n\nwhat trump has and hasn't done\n\nall presidents have limited ability to shift the trajectory of america's $20 trillion economy. that hasn't stopped trump from characteristically wild exaggerations, which television viewers can expect to hear again tuesday night as he touts the great american comeback.\n\nhe has not created the greatest economy in the history of our country. the late-1990s boom under clinton produced far more robust growth.\n\nhe has not ended an economic nightmare by replacing the north american free trade agreement with the us-mexico-canada deal he signed last week. it actually represents a modest revision of nafta, much of it negotiated by the obama administration for the larger trans-pacific partnership that trump junked.\n\nhe has not delivered job gains nobody would've believed before his presidency. the 8 million jobs created during obama's last three years in office outnumbers those created in trump's first three.\n\nin fact, trump has largely surfed growth and employment trends that began in the obama-era recovery from the great recession. the 2% annual growth economists now forecast over the next decade matches forecasts from before he took office.\n\nthe potential of the us economy to produce goods and services has not fundamentally changed, observes michael strain, who directs economic policy studies at the conservative american enterprise institute.\n\nyet strain sees an opening for trump to brighten a national economic debate that has emphasized shrinking opportunities for middle- and working-class americans. his forthcoming book, the american dream is not dead, argues that both parties have overlooked improving conditions while playing to voter anxieties.\n\ntrump vs. democrats on the economy\n\ntrump's eventual democratic opponent -- bernie sanders, joe biden or anyone else -- will make those anxieties a central theme this fall. organizational bungling in the iowa caucuses temporarily delayed the first round of competition.\n\nbut presidential incumbents, as ronald reagan showed with his 1984 morning in america campaign, usually strike upbeat themes as they argue for another term.\n\nholes in trump's record complicate his case. he has not delivered better health care coverage to vulnerable americans, instead threatening benefits they gained under obamacare.\n\nhe has not upgraded american infrastructure or revived a coal industry still beset by economic and environmental pressures that drive down demand. manufacturing -- the object of his pledge to end the carnage afflicting blue-collar workers -- has fallen into recession.\n\ndespite his promises to the contrary, the 2017 tax cut has ballooned the federal budget deficit , delivered its greatest rewards to wealthy americans and failed to sustain growth of 3% or more. business investment lags even after the top corporate tax rate dropped from 35% to 21%.\n\nspending by consumers has sustained trump-era growth. and economists see their confidence as fragile.\n\nconsumers say they feel good, but have proven they've grown more susceptible to a negative news shock, notes diane swonk, chief economist for the business consulting firm grant thornton.\n\ncoronavirus fears\n\nthat raises the stakes for trump's handling of the coronavirus, which threatens to damage global economic activity. his administration has not earned a reputation for competent governance.\n\nthe coronavirus wild card could yet trigger a 2020 recession, which mark zandi of moody's analytics calls a 35% possibility. so could setbacks on trade policy.\n\nfear of economic fallout led white house advisers to dissuade trump from new tariffs on imports from china late last year. but an unpredictable president governed by impulse often bucks attempts to control him -- on the economy, national security and everything else.\n\nthe nature of 21st century polarization makes culture at least as important as the economy in driving election outcomes. no one doubts trump could return to truculent populism if he deems it necessary to motivate core supporters, whatever economic advisers say.\n\nhe's not going to listen to them, says douglas holtz-eakin, once a top economic aide to president george w. bush. who knows what he'll do?

i am going to get fuller funding of 300 million dollars for the restoration of the great lakes, which they've been trying to get for over 30 years, he said.\n\ntwo weeks ago ohio lawmakers complained that the administration was actually gutting federal funding for cleanup of toxic pollutants and removal of invasive species in the great lakes region, according to the toledo blade.\n\ntrump also said his administration is very close to getting started on the soo locks, which he said, people have wanted to build for a very, very long time. \n\nthe project, which would add a second lock and allow larger ships to access the great lakes, is expected to bring much needed construction jobs to the upper peninsula region.\n\ncnn's jeremy diamond and kevin liptak contributed to this report.

for joining us.\n\n\n\nso, president trump and his top aides at it again today. saying things that are simply false. we should just call them for what they are. they're lies. as if saying them makes them true. it doesn't.\n\n\n\nbut what is true, what is real for so many american families is that hundreds of thousands of federal employees are taking the brunt of the partial shutdown of the government, nearing its seventh day now. going without paychecks this holiday season.\n\n\n\nthese are the facts. ok? about the trump shutdown, as nancy pelosi calls it. three hundred eighty thousand federal workers have been furloughed, and there is no guarantee they'll be paid retroactively when the shutdown is over. there's no guarantee of that.\n\n\n\nin addition, 420,000 employees are deemed essential and are working without pay. that includes 41,000 federal law enforcement and correctional officers. and tens of thousands of customs and border protection agents and customs officers.\n\n\n\npresident trump's ignoring those facts. and today he tweeted this really outrageous remark. do the dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are democrats? the crassness of that statement is just stunning. and as usual, the president offers zero evidence to support it. no evidence.\n\n\n\nbut congressman gerry connolly, a virginia democrat who represents thousands of federal workers, responded this way.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nrep. gerry connolly, (d) virginia: what an outrageous thing for a president of the united states to say. i have no earthly idea whether a federal employee is a republican or a democrat or an independent. and what is the relevance of that to a shutdown to an individual federal public servant not getting paid?\n\n\n\n(end video clip) lemon: and it looks like those federal workers will be without paychecks for quite a while. both the house and the senate reconvened for just moments today, and then they adjourned until next week. so that means no progress, nothing is getting done.\n\n\n\nbut the white house lies, well, they just get better. ok? because the press secretary sarah sanders releasing a statement today claiming president trump and his team stayed in washington over christmas to negotiate a deal and that the democrats decided to go home.\n\n\n\nso, let's see what's wrong with that statement. ok? purely political. obviously not true. the president stayed at the white house because of the optics of going to his luxurious mar-a-lago estate. well, that stinks. while hundreds of thousands of employees are not being paid.\n\n\n\ntop aide jared kushner and his wife, ivanka trump, they're not in washington this week. they're in florida. along with their secret service detail, by the way, which is not being paid right now.\n\n\n\nand the idea that republican leaders stayed on capitol hill to head off a shutdown, that's laughable. mitch mcconnell and paul ryan couldn't get out of town fast enough after trump scuttled the deal to keep the government funded temporarily. and note to this white house. capitol hill is empty. negotiations said to be frozen.\n\n\n\npresident trump, meanwhile, blasting democrats as obstructionists for not giving him $5 billion for his border wall. nancy pelosi in a statement tonight reminding him that there are proposals on the table to reopen the government and they include money for border security, which is different than a border wall, which she calls immoral and expensive. but remember, it was the president who said this about a shutdown.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\ndonald trump, president of the united states: chuck, you want to put that on mine.\n\n\n\nsen. chuck schumer, (d) new york, minority leader: you said it.\n\n\n\ntrump: i'll take it.\n\n\n\nschumer: ok, good.\n\n\n\ntrump: you know what i'll say? yes. if we don't get what we want, one way or the other, whether it's through you, through a military, through anything you want to call, i will shut down the government.\n\n\n\nschumer: ok. fair enough.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ntrump: and i am proud--\n\n\n\nschumer: we disagree. we disagree. trump: and i am proud to shut down the government for border\n\n\n\nsecurity, chuck. i will take the mantle. i will be the one to shut it down. i'm not going to blame you for it.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nlemon: you can count on that, mr. president. but let's go back to 2013. ok? this is what donald trump said to fox news ahead of a government shutdown when barack obama was still president.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nunidentified female: who's going to bear the brunt of the responsibility if indeed there is a shutdown of our government?\n\n\n\ntrump: well, if you say who gets fired, it always has to be the top. i mean, problems start from the top and they have to get solved from the top. and the president is the leader. and he's got to get everybody in a room. and he's got to lead.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\n[22:04:58] lemon: it starts from the top. if anyone should get fired, the president. donald trump suggesting that president barack obama should have been fired for a government shutdown. priceless.\n\n\n\nwell, a lot to get about the government shutdown. let's begin with former republican congressman charlie dent, national security analyst, matthew rosenberg, and political analyst, rachael bade.\n\n\n\ngood evening to all of you. thank you for being bright and chipper and joining us this evening. i appreciate it.\n\n\n\nrachael, i'm going to start with you. you know, i called it. the shutdown will continue into the new year. our sources on the hill say no progress has been made towards a deal. and that is abundantly clear when you look at the sheer number of tweets the president shot off today. nothing is getting done.\n\n\n\nrachael bade, cnn political analyst: yes, that's absolutely right. i was up there all day today. and it was a ghost town. i can tell you. i think i saw maybe two lawmakers, jim mcgovern, who is a democrat from massachusetts, he tried to bring up a bill in the house at about 4 o'clock that would basically reopen the government. he tried to--\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nlemon: you saw a democrat -- the president said democrats had gone home and the republicans were still there.\n\n\n\nwell, clearly say one thing, facts clearly show another. right? and republicans are the ones who gaveled him down. they wouldn't let him bring it up for a vote. so, you know, there's a lot of talk about this.\n\n\n\nclearly lawmakers, despite the fact that this is, you know, a total disaster and people, federal workers are going to feel the brunt of this, they're not here. and you know, my sources on the hill are saying maybe january 11th becomes the new soft deadline. that is the day of the first furloughed paycheck for a bunch of government workers who are either working without pay right now or not working at all.\n\n\n\nso, we've gone a while and i think the reason you're seeing trump tweet so much right now is because he knows he's losing this war right now. and his leverage is only going to decrease as soon as nancy pelosi takes the speaker's gavel because she's going to pass over and over again a bill that will reopen the government and you know, the pressure is going to be increased tremendously on mitch mcconnell in the senate to put that on the floor and reopen the government. and it's just going to look increasingly bad for the president.\n\n\n\nlemon: yes. congressman dent, listen. i'm kind of joking about that because i just think it's -- i'm just pointing out the hypocrisy. there's nothing funny about this, you know. and the minute it came out i was like you know, there's nothing funny about it.\n\n\n\nbut there's so much -- it's so hypocritical because the president is claiming without evidence that most of the 800,000 federal workers affected by the shutdown are -- he's saying they're democrats. he is trying to play a political game here. but come on, these are real people with real bills and mortgages. it's offensive.\n\n\n\nformer rep. charlie dent (r), pennsylvania: yes. it's almost inexplicable that he would make a comment like that. it's certainly indefensible. i mean, the shutdown affects everybody negatively. there's nothing good about it.\n\n\n\nand by the way, the party that makes the policy demand owns the shutdown. and the president owns this one. when he says if i don't get my border wall funding, i'm shutting down the government. well, guess what? you own it.\n\n\n\nwhen the democrats insisted on a daca bill as a price for keeping the government open, they more or less opened that shutdown. when ted cruz insisted on defunding obamacare as the price to keep the government open, guess what. ted cruz and republicans owned that shutdown.\n\n\n\nso, the president clearly owns this one. and this is so unnecessary, as rachael said. nothing is going to happen on this until january 3rd when the democrats i think are going to probably pass one of three likely funding bills which i can get into if you'd like to hear them. but they'll have i think three options to reopen the government. then you have to send a democrat -- senate republicans to figure out how to proceed.\n\n\n\nlemon: you can tell me about the options if you can do it quickly.\n\n\n\ndent: sure. one--\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nlemon: you said if you'd like to hear that--\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ndent: yes. absolutely. the first one would be the continuing resolution that the senate passed, that same one. identical. pass that. if they don't do that then i would recommend they can pass a continuing resolution for the entire year. not recommended but they can do that.\n\n\n\nand the third one, my choice, is pass the six appropriations bills that are completed.\n\n\n\nlemon: right.\n\n\n\ndent: pass them as is and then do a continuing resolution on the homeland security appropriations bill.\n\n\n\nlemon: what do you--\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbade: and senate republicans, just to be clear, on that first option, the reason senate democrats think they actually have the upper hand on this is the senate republicans just voice voted that same bill to continue funding the government through february. so, they think they have the upper hand on that.\n\n\n\nlemon: yes. matthew two questions. first one is what are the chances do you think that anything will happen like what charlie said?\n\n\n\nmatthew rosenberg, cnn national security analyst: you know, i mean, with--\n\n\n\nlemon: ok. that was your answer right there.\n\n\n\nrosenberg: i mean, look, the guy is sitting in the white house spending the week tweeting. it's really not a president that -- presidency we've had before. so, i'm having trouble predicting what could happen here.\n\n\n\nlemon: ok. well, let me ask you this. so, house democrats take control in the new year. right? what leverage does the president have to demand $5 billion for a border wall once they take control?\n\n\n\nrosenberg: i mean, look, he can keep the government shut down. he can veto every bill they come up with. that's leverage. i don't know if it does him any good, but it's leverage.\n\n\n\n[22:09:57] bade: yes. i would -- i was just going to add, reuters just put a poll up a few minutes ago saying that 47 percent of americans blame the president for the shutdown and 33 percent blame the democrats. i think that that gap is just going to continue to grow.\n\n\n\nand you know, again, charlie dent just said it. if you're the party making the demand, you are the party that usually loses. just look back to what happened one year ago when democrats were saying we're going to shut down the government until we get a fix for dreamers. lemon: yes.\n\n\n\nbade: and they didn't get anything. they folded and they looked like fools.\n\n\n\nlemon: yes.\n\n\n\nbade: and likely that's what's going to happen here.\n\n\n\nlemon: yes. that's -- we don't use that polling but i mean, it gets the point across because i think all the polling across the board shows something at least similar to what rachael is talking about, congressman dent.\n\n\n\nhere's the other thing. the federal deficit rose to $779 billion in fiscal year 2018. that's up 17 percent from last year. where's the money coming from to build a wall, the wall that mexico was supposed to pay for?\n\n\n\ndent: well, that's why we run deficits. they're going to have to find the money. they're going to issue it. revenues are going to be obviously not sufficient to meet expenditures.\n\n\n\nthe point is look, if i were the democrats right now, i would just first move to reopen the government. once i reopen the government, then seriously negotiate with the president on border security. you know, $5 billion is a small price to pay for dreamers and maybe the mueller protection -- the mueller protection bill.\n\n\n\ni mean, they can negotiate something. i agree there's no reason to build a 2,000-mile concrete barrier on the southern border. that literally makes no sense. i voted for the secure fence act in 2006 that authorized 700 miles of fencing along the southern border. they can do a lot of things to enhance border security and maintain operational control. but what the president's talking about, he still hasn't really explained what it means, what wall means. how many miles?\n\n\n\nlemon: well, they added a trillion dollars to the deficit this year, congressman. i mean, come on. who's going to pay for all this?\n\n\n\ndent: right. by the way, deficits were projected to go up anyway. i'll just say that. sooner or later this president and the congress, whether it's democrat or republican, are going to have to get involved in a very serious fiscal reform, something along the lines of simpson- bowles, and get serious about it. the day is coming. and these deficits are only going to get worse. you're right, don. you're making a point. it's money that's going to be deficit financed.\n\n\n\nlemon: congressman, matthew, rachael, thank you very much. i appreciate your time.\n\n\n\nrosenberg: thank you.\n\n\n\nlemon: secretary of homeland security traveling tomorrow to texas to the border with mexico. two migrant children have died in u.s. border control custody this month. i'm going to talk to the incoming democratic congressman from el paso on what changes need to be made to u.s. policy along the border when we come back.\n\n\n\n[22:15:00] (commercial break)\n\n\n\nlemon: homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen heading to the border town of el paso, texas tomorrow. her department is facing intense criticism. that's after the deaths of two detained migrant children this month.\n\n\n\njoining me now is incoming democratic congresswoman veronica escobar. she will be representing el paso starting next week. congresswoman- elect, thank you so much. we appreciate you joining us.\n\n\n\nlisten, we have to talk about some serious stuff here.\n\n\n\nrep.-elect veronica escobar (d), el paso, texas: hi, don.\n\n\n\nlemon: as i said, the homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen is going to be traveling to the border in el paso tomorrow. what is she going to see when she gets down there?\n\n\n\nescobar: you know, it depends a lot on who she talks to. too frequently, people from washington, d.c. who come to experience the border and understand what's happening here really only get one side. they'll talk to federal law enforcement. they will look at what they want to look at. and then they leave.\n\n\n\nand instead of parachuting in, my hope is that not only will she talk to federal law enforcement and tour the facilities and kind of see how inadequate they are, but my hope is that she also talks to human rights advocates, to the lawyers who are on the ground, to get a real holistic view of what's happening here in el paso.\n\n\n\nlemon: you know, nielsen says moving forward, congresswoman-elect, that all children will receive a more thorough assessment as early as possible. what else needs to happen?\n\n\n\nescobar: there's actually a lot of work that needs to happen. that is the bare minimum. but part of what also needs to happen is she needs to evaluate the infrastructure. the facilities at the ports of entry. the holding facilities. she needs to talk to personnel. and i hope that they will be honest with her. i hope agents will tell her the deficiencies.\n\n\n\nyou know, she's at the very top of that food chain. it's up to her to ensure that her agents are getting the training passed that they need, that people in her custody are being treated in a way that protects their health, safety, and welfare.\n\n\n\ninstead of advocating for a $5 billion vanity project, a wall, she's going to see that a wall already exists in el paso and that those resources could be better spent in taking care of people.\n\n\n\nyou know, one of the things that we're really worried about, right behind me is the greyhound bus station where so many migrants have been dropped off in the dark of night on cold nights like tonight to essentially be homeless on the streets of el paso.\n\n\n\nlemon: wow.\n\n\n\nescobar: and i hope she sees that the federal government has an obligation to construct temporary humane facilities to house these folks until we can get them into shelters.\n\n\n\nlemon: yes.\n\n\n\nescobar: so, there's a lot that i hope that she sees and i hope that she widens and broadens her view.\n\n\n\nlemon: you're right. five hundred twenty-two migrants are scheduled to be dropped off in el paso just tonight. you say, congresswoman- elect, that this administration's immigration policy is to create chaos through cruelty. can you explain that, please?\n\n\n\nescobar: right. you know, we've known as a country since 2014, and really some of this blame lies on the shoulders of the prior administration as well, but we've known since 2014 that the new migrant is the central american families, the mamas with their babies, the fathers who are coming across our ports of entry seeking asylum.\n\n\n\nwe're no longer seeing single mexican males who are looking for work. we're seeing those families. and our government has been very slow to adapt. very slow to address the needs of those who are now on our front door.\n\n\n\n[22:20:01] and so, hopefully her tour, this information will help enlighten that. but the administration, instead of trying to actually address these problems, is wanting to build walls, wanting to stop people at the ports of entry from seeking asylum, essentially trying -- separating families, using tear gas against people.\n\n\n\nessentially creating chaos among the most vulnerable in safe communities like mine in order to try to deter people from legally, lawfully seeking asylum. that is not solving a problem. that's making a challenge far worse.\n\n\n\nlemon: you've got a lot cut out for you when you officially join congress in the new year. it's coming, i mean, it's coming very quickly. are you ready for immigration and the budget battles ahead?\n\n\n\nescobar: i am. you know, i love this community. i love the border. i love el paso. and we really have a lot of great lessons to share with the rest of the country about compassion and humanity. and i'm eager to share those lessons with congress.\n\n\n\nlemon: congresswoman-elect veronica escobar, thank you for your time. happy new year to you. ok?\n\n\n\nescobar: thank you.\n\n\n\nlemon: thank you.\n\n\n\nescobar: thanks so much. happy new year. lemon: and good luck in washington. let's hope she can get it --\n\n\n\nshe's so positive right now. i just want to see her like maybe a week after she joins congress. i hope she continues to be so.\n\n\n\nbut anyway, i digress. rudy giuliani sending conflicting messages about the president's cooperation with robert mueller's investigation. we're going to tell you what he's saying, and we're going to dig into exactly what mueller has done so far, where he's going next and how bad it could get for president trump.\n\n\n\n[22:25:00] (commercial break)\n\n\n\nlemon: so, the government is in a shutdown right now, but someone in washington is still working. and that man is special counsel robert mueller. mueller and his team are still chugging along in their investigation into possible coordination between the trump campaign and russia and any other possible crimes that have come up along the way.\n\n\n\nhere's a recap of where we are right now. ok? here you go. four people have been sentenced to prison. one person, trump's campaign chairman paul manafort, was convicted at trial. seven people had pleaded guilty including trump's former personal attorney michael cohen, and 36 people and entities have been charged, including a criminally linked social media troll farm, the internet research agency.\n\n\n\nthis year mueller's investigation and the investigations he's referred out to other prosecutors around the country have seen results. and we have learned a ton. we now know how the hush money payments were made to stormy daniels and karen mcdougal.\n\n\n\nand prosecutors in new york say that individual one, aka, donald trump, directed his fixer michael cohen to take care of those payments. we now know that conversations about developing a trump tower in moscow continued much later into the 2016 election and that trump signed a letter of intent for the project.\n\n\n\nwe learned that michael flynn was cooperating substantially with the special counsel including on investigations still unknown to the public. remember all these redactions from his sentencing memo?\n\n\n\nand we know that paul manafort continued to lie to mueller even after agreeing to cooperate. trump also turned in his take-home test, giving written answers to questions from the special counsel.\n\n\n\nand by cnn's count we know at least 16 trump associates and contacts had contacts with russians during the campaign or transition. sixteen.\n\n\n\nwhat we don't know is if there was direct coordination between the trump campaign and russia. and maybe we will find out if there was or not next year. but still the walls are closing in on the president on many fronts. his campaign, transition, inaugural committee, foundation, business,\n\n\n\nand presidency are all under investigation.\n\n\n\nonce democrats take control of the house next week the scrutiny is sure to heat up.\n\n\n\njoining me now is jack quinn, the former white house counsel to president clinton. garrett graff is here as well. author of the threat matrix: inside robert mueller's fbi and the war on global terror.\n\n\n\ngood evening to both of you gentlemen. thank you for joining us. jack, i'm going to start with you. you just heard me lay it out. all of it, right? mueller has indicted multiple members of the trump's inner circle. democrats take control of congress in a matter of days. how bad could this get?\n\n\n\njack quinn, cnn legal analyst: well, it is bad. so, it's going to only get worse from here. you know, so many of the areas on which you touch are unresolved. we don't know yet the most critical question. namely, was there, you know, per the mandate to robert mueller, a link, any kind of coordination between the trump campaign and the russian government?\n\n\n\nbut, you know, remarkably enough, when you look back on all the things you ticked off, the year started with michael flynn talking to the russian ambassador. michael flynn of course at the end of that year being indicted. the year also ended with michael cohen admitting in court that he had perjured himself when he suggested that the trump tower deal in moscow had ended much earlier than in fact it did.\n\n\n\nyou know, the one constant, don, throughout this year is that people very close to donald trump lied. and what did they lie about? they lied about russia. paul manafort. rick gates. michael flynn. michael cohen--\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nlemon: we only have so much show, jack.\n\n\n\nquinn: yes. so, there's a theme here is the point.\n\n\n\nlemon: yes.\n\n\n\nquinn: and i know there are a lot of predictions about mueller wrapping this up, getting ready to write his report. i--\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nlemon: well, that's my question to garrett.\n\n\n\nquinn: ok.\n\n\n\nlemon: don't read ahead in the textbook, if you will.\n\n\n\nquinn: ok.\n\n\n\nlemon: so, let me ask you -- because i want to ask garrett this. because garrett, you know robert mueller. do you get the sense as jack says that things are wrapping up or is it possible that this is on the beginning? garrett graff, cnn contributor: well, i think both can be true.\n\n\n\nright? you know, i think robert mueller has known where this has been going for quite some time. you can sort of see the building blocks of a pretty methodical investigation coming together.\n\n\n\nboth with what we've been shown publicly and then what we haven't been shown.\n\n\n\n[22:30:07] you know, he's laid out sort of the four corners of this conspiracy with internet research agency, the military intelligence -- gru attacks and active cyber penetrations, paul manafort and the money laundering.\n\n\n\nand then michael flynn and the sketchy campaign transition contacts. and so what we're beginning to see now is mueller painting and connecting those dots in between. and sort of showing the americans who participated, what role some of these things played in. and then, you know, the other thing is that you that mentioned is that we have these -- you know, and i have counted them up.\n\n\n\nand you and i have talked about this before, 17 total different distinct investigative avenues pursuing the president right now, by seven different sets of prosecutors, both looking at the campaign, the transition, the inaugural committee, the trump organization, the trump foundation. and that really what we're beginning to see is how these lines blur and that how donald trump sort of moved money from one place to another, and how money flowed into and out of his various entities involved and surrounding him in 2016.\n\n\n\nand that this is in some ways i think where we could begin to see pretty rapid movement, we saw very rapid movement in the month since thanksgiving. but at the same time remember this could stretch on for years. i mean people really forget how big watergate got.\n\n\n\nlemon: yeah, watergate went on for -- i forget how long it went on.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ngraff: some of those cases stretched on for the better part of a decade. and ultimately we saw 69 people charged, 48 of them pleaded guilty or were convicted at trial.\n\n\n\nlemon: yeah. hey, jack, can we talk about rudy giuliani?\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nquinn: do we have to? yes.\n\n\n\nlemon: that was good. that was good. he was asked by the hill today, thehill.com today, if trump is going to answer more mueller questions in writing. this is how he responded.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nrudy giuliani, lawyer, president trump: i think i announced about 10 days ago over my dead body. and i am not dead yet. he's not answering any more questions from these people. their outrageous activity, you know, we did enough. we did everything.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nlemon: ok, so -- but then, jack, he told the daily beast that those talks are still open. i mean this has been going on for well over a year. do you really believe they're still in negotiations?\n\n\n\nquinn: well, obviously, i don't know. i believe there's a line of communication between them. i also think that every time rudy says something intemperate like that, that there's something else going on. and he's really trying to, you know, say don't look over there, look over here. so the question every time rudy does this is what's he trying to distract us from?\n\n\n\nyou know, and i am not sure what it is here. and by the way, i don't -- i am not one who thinks that robert mueller is close to finishing his work.\n\n\n\ni think it's going to stretch out for some period of time. and i also think that a really important recent development and we've talked about it a little before. but the more i think about it, the more i focus on how angry judge sullivan was. and i think he was not just angry at michael flynn. i think he was also angry at robert mueller.\n\n\n\nand the reason may be that he's seen those redacted documents, and he's furious, i think, in part over the leniency that he thinks michael flynn was given. and that's why he's saying to robert mueller you better squeeze this orange till we get more juice out of him.\n\n\n\nlemon: interesting. sometimes i think the distraction could be maybe he's not trying to distract to something else. it's just a distraction just because -- just to confuse people. i have got to run, though, thank you, gentlemen, if i don't see you, happy new year.\n\n\n\nquinn: happy new year.\n\n\n\ngraff: happy new year.\n\n\n\nlemon: michelle obama, the former first lady, is america's most admired woman. that's according to a new poll. and you've got to see who she knocked off the top spot after a 17-year winning streak.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[22:35:00] lemon: all right. so the former first lady michelle obama tops the list of america's most admired women of 2018, knocking hillary clinton off the number one spot for the first time in 17 years. oprah winfrey or just oprah, oprah, hillary clinton and melania trump came in second, third, and fourth on the list respectively.\n\n\n\nand former president obama tops the list of america's most admired men for the 11th time in a row. let's discuss now with olivia nuzzi, nina turner, steve cortes. hello, gang. gang's all here. thank you so much for joining us. olivia, i am going to start with you. it was a big year for michelle obama. she has a best-selling book. she has a big tour around the country.\n\n\n\ni mean she's selling out arenas like a rock star. it's unbelievable. appearances on the campaign trail. what do you think is behind her rise to the top of the polls, of the gallup poll?\n\n\n\nolivia nuzzi, washington correspondent, new york magazine: well, it's not just that she had a best-selling book. she had the best-selling book of 2018. i think she sold an estimated 2 million copies in its first 15 days of release, if i am getting that correct. it's pretty staggering. she sold out places like the barclays center, which is a 19,000-seat arena. those are...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nlemon: they had to add a second date, didn't they? they had to add a second date at the barclays center.\n\n\n\nnuzzi: it's pretty incredible. and it's the type of thing that while on the campaign trail in 2016 donald trump liked to talk about his own ability to sell out large venues. he used that to say that he was going to inevitably be the winner of the election. and, of course, he was. and you have to wonder, you know, would she be garnering this much -- would she be getting this big of a crowd if she were on the campaign trail. and i think that she probably would be. she is universally it seems beloved.\n\n\n\n[22:40:18] lemon: yeah.\n\n\n\nnuzzi: and i don't think that there's anyone else occupying any space in the democratic -- you know, potential democratic field who is as popular as she is.\n\n\n\nlemon: yeah, maybe she should be the one. we're going to talk about that poll in just a minute. but i just want to stick to her, nina, and ask you, she really stepped up her criticism of this current president this year. in her book, she said that she'd never forgive him for spreading the birther lie about her husband.\n\n\n\nand remember this moment when she greets the president at the funeral of george h.w. bush, not exactly warm there. do you think her criticism of trump played a role in propelling her to the top of this list?\n\n\n\nnina turner, cnn political commentator: well, don, she's always had a down to earth nature. and that's what i think many people really do respect about her, is her down to earth nature. her commitment to her family, which certainly she articulated very strongly without equivocation in that book, and making it known that she did not appreciate how president trump really put her entire family in jeopardy by the birther statements that he continued to make.\n\n\n\nbut just down to earth truth-telling, a real -- you know, she wasn't afraid to let that mama-ness in her come out, that strength that comes out, the love and affection she has for her family, and also this country, and then also her courage and her ability to be vulnerable too. it made people be able to see a side of her that ordinarily might not get an opportunity to see in first ladies, just a stellar, stellar first lady.\n\n\n\nlemon: steve, she was very open in her criticism of the president, who isn't very popular by all accounts. do people respond to that, do you think?\n\n\n\nsteve cortes, former trump campaign adviser: you know, i hope not, i hope instead they respond to her remarkable life, that she came from modest means to get two i believe degrees, a significant career and become first lady of the united states. i would also point out, by the way, don, on a lighter note. you used to live and work in the city of chicago.\n\n\n\nit seems to me that the common denominator of this list when you look at oprah, barack, hillary, michelle, is to be from chicago if you really want to be admired in this country.\n\n\n\nlemon: well, i mean, melania trump is not from chicago, but still...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncortes: but all the rest.\n\n\n\nlemon: she's on that list as well. bill clinton is on the list, was he? no. he's not on there? yes, he is. he's on the list as well. bush is on the list.\n\n\n\ncortes: one thing too, don, and it made me think of is, you know, i grew up on the south side of chicago in a modest upbringing like michelle obama did. and that was a -- and i am roughly her age. that was a racially tinged time and place. it really was. and i think it's remarkable for our country too. it's certainly -- you know, kudos to her for getting this honor but also for our country.\n\n\n\nbecause i think when i was young i don't think a black man and a black woman could have topped that poll in the 1970s when i was growing up. so it's great for our country too that americans have progressed that much on race, that the most admired man and woman in america are black. and that's not controversial.\n\n\n\nlemon: yeah. nina, i know you want to say something...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nturner: you know i do. i mean, i am saying -- i would certainly agree with him to a point, but let's not, you know, overdramatize this moment. i mean we have a long way to go with race relations in this country.\n\n\n\nbut absolutely correct, we would not have seen this 10, 20, even 30 years ago. it is quite an accomplishment. and not just the pressure that she had to have of being the flotus, but the pressure that came with being the first african-american woman to be the first lady of the united states of america. she has blazed quite a trail.\n\n\n\nlemon: i should also point out that donald trump is number two on the list of men. so olivia, michelle obama has ruled out running. let's talk about this, ok? she's ruled out running for president. but do you think people have pushed for her to run because of her personal qualities, and do you think it's a real thing like if she actually ran do you think she could win?\n\n\n\nnuzzi: well, i think if she actually decided to run, she would be a very serious candidate. she would certainly be one of the most serious candidates who we talk about right now as being someone who might throw their hat in the ring. as steve said, she has a remarkable personal story, even taking -- leaving aside, you know, her relationship with the former president.\n\n\n\nshe has a remarkable life story. and she's a brilliant, accomplished woman in her own right. but i would go back to that video for a second of her greeting the president, the current president, at the funeral. and what i think is so remarkable about that, you were asking whether or not her criticism of donald trump has played any role in her popularity now.\n\n\n\nand i would contrast it with the way she greeted the president with the way that hillary clinton did not. hillary clinton has been similarly obviously very, very critical of the current president. and it's michelle obama who is the most admired person. it's michelle obama who's selling out 19,000-seat stadiums. so i don't think that it's as simple as, you know, she provides a sharp contrast to the person currently occupying the oval office. i think it's something more than that.\n\n\n\n[22:45:14] lemon: that was actually brilliant the way she did it because it wasn't good to see you, hello, she just said good morning. and that was a first lady good morning and then she moved on. but listen. i want to talk about it. i have got to put this poll up, all right? because there's -- this new poll is out asking democrats about how they feel about 23 presidential nominees.\n\n\n\nand here we go, ok? at top of this list wasn't a candidate at all, because 59 percent said that they would be excited by someone else entirely. what does that tell us? i mean look. it's somebody else. it's joe biden and it is bernie sanders and it is beto. and then it's kamala harris. what does that tell you, nina about the democrats now?\n\n\n\nturner: well, don, it's going to be a hell of a ride. and unlike 2016, there will be no -- you know, nobody will have a coronation. people are going to have to earn this. and even the folks who are uniquely positioned, there are plenty of folks, you know, who are on that poll who are certainly uniquely positioned, no doubt about it. but people are going to have to earn this.\n\n\n\nlemon: yeah. steve, i have got to run. who do you think it's going to be?\n\n\n\ncortes: look. right now, it's so far away. but right now, if i had to bet, i would bet on beto o'rourke. i think he has a bit of that obama factor, that charisma, that likeability. and if he can put texas in play, that alone is enough to make him the nominee.\n\n\n\nlemon: i heard you were going to flip to a democrat and run for president. is that true?\n\n\n\ncortes: gosh. i would be working very hard...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nlemon: you would be supporting beto o'rourke. that's what i hear.\n\n\n\ncortes: someday, i might be the first hispanic president. but it's not my time yet.\n\n\n\nlemon: all right. thank you, all. happy new year if i don't see you. appreciate it.\n\n\n\nturner: happy new year, don.\n\n\n\nlemon: thank you. we'll be right back.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[22:50:00] lemon: gilda radner was a comedy superstar and so much more. her iconic saturday night live characters made us laugh. her thought provoking writing broke boundaries for women. and her hard fought battle with cancer brought attention and support to cancer patients everywhere. now, the new cnn original film, love gilda, uses special access to gilda's diaries, letters, and home videos to tell gilda's story in her own words. here's a preview.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nunidentified male: i was young enough to think that if you were as clever as gilda was, and therefore blessed as gilda was, then what would ever make you unhappy about anything. you have family, money. everyone adores you. every guy falls in love with you, and every girl wants you to be her best friend. she would walk into the room and all the energy would go to her. and i think that was her comfort zone.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nlemon: wow. i still can't believe she's gone. but you know who is here? laraine newman is here, who was along with gilda radner, one of the original cast members on saturday night live. laraine, it's so good to see you. thank you so much. i still can't believe after all these years i still can't believe she's gone.\n\n\n\nlaraine newman, original cast member, saturday night live: i know. it doesn't seem like death and gilda go together because her energy was so alive.\n\n\n\nlemon: yeah. as i said, you and gilda were original cast members on saturday night live, snl as it's been come to known now. whenever i see old clips, you guys seem to be having so much fun. what was it like back then working with gilda?\n\n\n\nnewman: well, first of all, sketch comedy is the most fun thing you can imagine ever, and we all came from that background. but what was significant about working with gilda in that context is that it's live tv. things can go wrong. but then she would come up with something that really kind of saved the day. and i think we were doing a howdy doody sketch, and this is in the documentary, by the way.\n\n\n\nand, you know, in seeing the documentary, it revealed to me something that she did in that sketch that i was completely unaware of, which was the sketch was dying. and she just started to do some physical stuff to get it going and bring it to life. and it worked.\n\n\n\nlemon: you know, you, gilda, and jane curtin, the only three women on the original snl cast, and you worked alongside some really formidable male comedians, jim belushi, bill murray, chevy chase. what was it like being a woman in comedy then?\n\n\n\nnewman: well, the atmosphere, because of lorne michaels, was very supportive. i think we all kind of took it in stride that it was a meritocracy. and whatever sketch, no matter who wrote it, no matter who was in it, if it was funny, it went in the show. this whole idea that it was a boy's club just wasn't true.\n\n\n\nlemon: it's so iconic. did you know it was an iconic show when you were doing it, or you were just having fun, and you were just oh, we're popular, that's great?\n\n\n\nnewman: well, there are some people that can see the big picture. i was not one of them. i mean i just knew that i was having a lot of fun.\n\n\n\nlemon: yeah. that's probably the best way, right? so you can enjoy that in the moment instead of thinking about -- because that adds so much more pressure. listen, gilda became famous by making millions of people laugh, but she also fought and ultimately lost a terrible bat with ovarian cancer. how hard was it as her friend and her former colleague to watch her go through all that?\n\n\n\nnewman: well, i think i know from my past experience with my friends, i always going into denial. and i think, well, even though the odds are not good for this particular illness, my friend is going to beat it. my friend will survive. so -- and she did have a period of remission so we thought great, you know, everything's going to be fine.\n\n\n\n[22:55:16] and so it was that much harder, and i can only imagine what she went through for it to come back and to realize that there was nothing to be done.\n\n\n\nlemon: yeah. she had an immeasurable impact on comedy. what do you feel her legacy is in the comedy world and in the world in general?\n\n\n\nnewman: well, i think that she did break boundaries in a lot of ways. and i think comediennes can like amy schumer and sarah silverman, i think she would have loved them because they really embody that kind of brashness and bravado and anything for a laugh no matter how personal it might be. that was really something that i know appealed to her. so i think she would have loved that.\n\n\n\nlemon: well, laraine, i am deeply honored that you're on with me. thank you so much. i really appreciate it.\n\n\n\nnewman: thank you so much, don.\n\n\n\nlemon: the premier of cnn original film, love gilda airs tuesday, january 1st, 9 p.m. finally, i want to tell you about richard overton, america's oldest man and oldest world war ii veteran, died today at the age of 112. he had been hospitalized in texas with pneumonia for over a week. overton was born in 1906 and enlisted in the army in 1942, 9 months after the pearl harbor attack.\n\n\n\nhe was honored by president obama in 2013 for his serving this country with dignity. overton apparently liked to have a cigar in one hand and a glass of whiskey in another. though he credited god for his long life, overton also said that his vices helped. thank you for your service, mr. overton.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)
(cnn) is president joe biden's $1.9 trillion covid relief package too big? plenty of economists across the ideological spectrum think so.\n\nbut economics was only one of several considerations in its assembly. all come into sharper focus this week as narrow congressional democratic majorities in both chambers prepare to send it to the resolute desk for biden's signature by mid-march.\n\nif that happens, it would take the federal government's coronavirus response over the last year to nearly a staggering $6 trillion -- all of it borrowed money.\n\nbiden advisers argue nothing about current economic conditions prevents washington from spending as much as circumstances of the pandemic warrant.\n\nthe bound is what is defensible and sensible, brian deese, director of the national economic council at the white house, told cnn. but without a doubt, a sensible biden proposal could have come with a significantly smaller price tag.\n\nthe current package includes $1,400-per-person relief checks -- a residual effect of former president donald trump's scorn for senate republican leader mitch mcconnell last december. after mcconnell shepherded through a $900 billion relief proposal providing $600 per person, trump said the checks should have been $2,000. house speaker nancy pelosi, then-president-elect biden and the candidates in two crucial georgia senate runoffs swiftly embraced trump's idea -- fattening the cost of the current bill, which will top recipients up to that $2,000 level, by hundreds of billions.\n\nthe $350 billion in state and local government aid far exceeds estimates of their revenue loss from the pandemic. the aid also aims to help those governments avoid more layoffs as they struggle with added coronavirus burdens. michael strain, an economist at the conservative american enterprise institute, estimates that $100 billion would accomplish that.\n\nthe package also includes democratic spending priorities long predating the pandemic. those include more than doubling the minimum wage to $15 an hour as well as billions for expanded obamacare subsidies and tax benefits for low-income families.\n\ntoo much vs. not enough\n\nthe new proposal, combined with december's relief, approaches a quarter of the size of the entire us economy. former treasury secretary larry summers, publicly voicing concerns that other democratic economists express privately, has warned it might overheat economic activity by sparking excessive inflation.\n\neconomists less worried about inflation simply question the need for that much relief. overall personal income actually remains higher than before the pandemic, notwithstanding interruptions in economic activity. much of earlier relief checks went into americans' savings accounts.\n\nmore likely it's just really ineffective, cautioned marc goldwein of the non-partisan committee for a responsible federal budget. goldwein says $1.3 trillion would easily suffice and offer more bang for the buck.\n\nbiden, treasury secretary janet yellen, and trump-appointed federal reserve chairman jerome powell respond in unison: the risk of spending too little exceeds the risk of too much. they invoke a lesson from the obama-biden administration, that exaggerated fear of deficits kept washington's response to the great recession too small and made recovery too slow.\n\nnow is not the time to worry about inflation or high interest rates, said democratic economist diane lim. neither exist, and neither is likely to happen anytime soon.\n\nfilling in democratic priorities\n\nfollowing that advice doesn't require a package so large and sprawling. but in addition to economics, biden's plan reflects the convergence of democratic values with opportunity.\n\nthe party has long pushed to lift the $7.25 an hour federal minimum wage, which has eroded in value since congress last voted to raise it in 2007. today's soft labor market makes this a less than ideal moment to hike it. but unified control of government gives democrats their best chance in years.\n\noverall income figures mask a k-shaped recovery leaving affluent professionals unscathed and lower-income service workers badly wounded. biden's package responds not just to that short-term disparity, but also to decades of divergence between rich and poor that democrats have aimed to narrow.\n\nthe package's temporary provisions lifting low-income families are really the foundation of setting up a fairer society, explained former obama white house economist betsey stevenson.\n\ncongressional state of play\n\npolitics dictate the ultimate design constraint. no package, however elegant or transformative, has any impact without votes in congress to pass it.\n\nrepublicans oppose anything near biden's ambition. ten gop senators -- the bare minimum needed to bypass a filibuster -- propose spending just one-third as much. after watching just seven republican vote to convict at trump's senate impeachment trial, the white house doubts negotiations can produce an acceptable bipartisan compromise.\n\nthat means relying entirely on democratic votes -- and accommodating the expensive priorities required to secure them. party leaders say $1.9 trillion is not too much to hold on to all 50 democratic senators, as required for passage without republican help.\n\neven if the package passes, summers warns that spending more than necessary on covid relief may complicate biden's ability to corral votes for a second legislative priority with a yet-larger price tag. though its cost and elements remain in flux, a build back better proposal expected this spring could contain $3-trillion worth of investments in infrastructure and other investments in long-term economic growth and equity.\n\nat least that plan will likely include at least some tax increases to offset its costs. aides say biden has made clear that, unlike with emergency relief, he doesn't intend to add permanent changes in benefit programs onto america's structural budget deficit.\n\nat some point, agreed stevenson, the obama white house economist, we've got to raise revenue to pay for these things.
dr. scott hadland is a pediatrician and an addiction expert at boston medical center and associate professor of pediatrics at boston university school of medicine. follow him @drscotthadland . the views expressed in this commentary are his own. view more opinion at cnn.\n\n(cnn) congress has passed president joe biden's proposed $1.9 trillion stimulus along party lines. the package aims to not only tackle covid-19 through mass vaccination, testing, and contract tracing, but also to aggressively manage the economic devastation the pandemic leaves behind.\n\namong the enormous challenges congress and the biden administration face in addition to covid-19 is the drug addiction crisis, which, before the pandemic, had claimed more than 750,000 lives since 1999 and cost americans more than $1 trillion in 2017 alone\n\nin the last year, the covid-19 pandemic has pushed already economically vulnerable americans into even greater despair . as a result, overdose deaths are now surging to record highs . according to the us centers for disease control and prevention, 81,000 americans died during the year leading up to june 2020, an increase of 20% over the prior year and an all-time high.\n\nthough costly, members of congress and americans who opposed its passage should view the sweeping package as critical to stem the steep rise in overdose deaths the us would likely otherwise experience. not supporting its passage is to overlook the possibility of hundreds of thousands more lives being lost to addiction for years to come.\n\nwhere covid-19 spreads, quick to follow are lost jobs, worsened poverty, housing and food insecurity and lapses in education. these are the very conditions on which addiction preys . covid-19 and addiction affect people of all races, but both disproportionately harm people of color. in the years to come, already yawning health inequalities are sure to widen further.\n\nas a pediatrician and an addiction doctor, i see the coming storm and know it will echo through generations to come. doctors like me treat the infant born to a mother using heroin to cope with homelessness. we support the teen who is missing school and uses substances to manage her anxiety as her household runs short on cash for food and rent. we care for the father balancing the heroic tasks of parenting and maintaining recovery from addiction despite a recent job layoff.\n\nto prevent the wave of addiction that is likely to follow covid-19, america needs widespread investment in the social determinants of health: employment, income, housing, food, and education, among other critical supports. president biden's economic relief package will deliver $1,400 payments to americans, increase unemployment insurance, expand paid family and sick leave, increase the child tax credit, fund schools, support state and local governments, and enhance public health.\n\nthough designed to combat the economic impact of the pandemic, these interventions are precisely the same actions needed to safeguard families and communities from addiction. to be clear, although the stimulus package extends obamacare coverage for many people and ensures they can access health care, the bill does not specifically dedicate funds to expanding substance use treatment. but i assert that by investing in the social determinants of health, this bill is likely to go far towards preventing addiction and overdose deaths in the long term. the current stimulus package will build on the $4.25 billion in funding for mental health and substance use treatment in last december's pandemic relief bill. these funds will help ensure that, amid the enormous grief many in america are feeling, people can get the help they need in the short term.\n\nmany lawmakers have questioned the proposal's price tag, calling instead for a scaled-down bill narrowly focused on vaccine distribution. this approach would have been a mistake. not only would lives soon be needlessly lost to overdose, but also, dollar for dollar, preventing addiction is far less expensive than treating it.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter. join us on twitter and facebook\n\nthese recent efforts, though critical, are like only ever treating decades-long heart disease with an expensive bypass surgery when a heart attack occurs. a forward-thinking public health response is to intervene on the earlier life determinants of heart disease, such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes -- and even upstream of those, to give people resources like money for nutritious foods and safe spaces for fitness so they can maintain healthy diets and exercise.\n\ndoctors like me have long advocated for giving families what they need to maximize health and well-being. once signed, this bill will be a chance for president biden and congress to do so for many americans. this economic relief will go to the many people who have been more visibly impacted by the pandemic as well as those affected by the now boiling-over overdose epidemic who might otherwise be overlooked during this global health crisis. for anyone still unsure about the necessity of this bill, consider this: without it, long after we have mass-distributed vaccines and achieved herd immunity for covid-19, we will still be grappling with unnecessary death and despair wrought by addiction.

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nfor some in the white house, sunday seemed like the first day of the rest of donald trump's presidency. by friday, it was clear that while the cloud of robert mueller's special counsel investigation had lifted, the pervasive disarray that marked most of trump's time in office was not going anywhere.\n\na sudden health care decision made after heated oval office disagreements – along with a reversal on education funding, a confusing sanctions mystery and still-unfilled cabinet posts – revealed the chaotic practices and decision-making that have colored trump's term until this point are still ever-present.\n\ninstead of clearing the decks, the end of the mueller probe has only thrown a fractious west wing policy and messaging operation into sharper relief. that's left some white house aides expressing regret the investigation's end wasn't matched with a more effective strategy to harness the momentum into advancing trump's agenda. and gop lawmakers are scratching their heads at a health care push few believe makes political sense.\n\nthat's not exactly what republicans and administration policy aides had in mind when it was announced last weekend the mueller probe was over. many hoped the investigation's end might lead to an era of newly effective governing, a turning point for a president no longer preoccupied with an encroaching investigator.\n\nexuberant officials and a buoyant president spent the week cheering the initial results of mueller's investigation, as laid out in a letter from attorney general william barr. in a late-afternoon gathering last sunday, aides convened in press secretary sarah sanders' office for a champagne toast after the attorney general's chief of staff phoned emmet flood, in palm beach with the president, to brief him on the report.\n\nthe intimate gathering of white house staffers was a sign of the relief that flooded through the west wing after the stress of an investigation that loomed for years was lifted.\n\nbut the days that followed sunday's champagne-clinking in sanders' office came as a surprise to multiple people in the west wing, according to interviews with half a dozen officials and trump associates. there was no rose garden celebration ceremony. trump gave no speech declaring vindication in the east room. instead, he made brief remarks before he climbed the steps of air force one and was whisked away to washington.\n\nvictory laps and vengeance\n\neven as the victory laps and vows for vengeance continued apace, there were signs of confusion in trump's policy objectives.\n\ntuesday's surprising announcement the administration would ask a court to invalidate the entire health law known as obamacare came before anyone in the white house had put in place a strategy for passing a replacement. it came over the objections of senior cabinet officials, who questioned the political and legal wisdom of scrapping popular components of the measure without a clear plan to restore them during a heated oval office meeting on monday.\n\nultimately, trump followed the advice not of cabinet members most closely aligned with the issue, but of his west wing advisers – principally the acting chief of staff mick mulvaney, a former republican congressman – who regard the move as a way to force congress into acting on health care after repeal and replace efforts failed in 2017.\n\nhealth and human services secretary alex azar and barr both disagreed with the decision, according to people familiar with the matter, albeit for different reasons. barr contended the underlying legal argument being made by republican state attorneys general was flawed and wouldn't be upheld in the courts.\n\nin many ways, it's a dangerous and i believe reckless gamble on his part. he may pull it off. he's surprised us before, so we have to give him that, said david gergen, a cnn senior political analyst and adviser to four presidents. it's very similar to when presidents win a second term. they can get very arrogant. they can over-read their power and they make mistakes.\n\nthe president's own legislative affairs team had not been tasked with developing a replacement plan for obamacare, according to a white house aide, despite that office's eventual role in shepherding any plan through congress. aides were told trade – not health care – was the administration's top legislative priority heading into the summer.\n\nbut even trade seems to have faltered on the priority list. though officials once believed trump's new trade agreement with canada and mexico would be the administration's most significant economic policy victory since tax reform, it is now in jeopardy, too. the plan, which would replace the north american free trade agreement, is facing bipartisan hurdles on capitol hill and one white house official said there has been no strategy to mitigate lawmakers' concerns. trump has claimed the deal would pay for his border wall, but an administration official who spoke candidly in recent days said it had little chance of passing.\n\nmarc short, chief of staff to vice president mike pence, said wednesday on cnn that the president will be putting plans forward this year on a health care replacement plan. but a white house official said thursday that short spoke too soon because aides are still debating whether the administration will take the lead in crafting a proposal or ask congress to step in. short, who was trump's chief legislative liaison before stepping down last year, rejoined the administration two weeks ago.\n\n'waiting with bated breath'\n\none republican congressman told cnn on thursday that after trump received a political boost from the end of the special counsel probe, he spiked the football in the end zone and the damn ball came up and hit us in the nose.\n\nother lawmakers, speaking more circumspectly on-the-record, made clear it would be a white house mess to clean up.\n\nall i'm going to say about that for a while is that i'm eager to see what the administration proposes, said sen. roy blunt, r-missouri.\n\nwe are waiting with bated breath, said sen. john cornyn of texas, a member of republican leadership.\n\nthe decision came amid a week of abrupt about-faces, all with trump at the center, that did little to lessen the impression of an administration at odds with itself.\n\na three-day controversy over funding for the special olympics ended when trump himself deemed the levels spelled out in his own administration budget insufficient.\n\nthe special olympics will be funded, trump told reporters on the white house south lawn. i have overridden my people.\n\nhis education secretary betsy devos had just spent hours painfully defending the cuts, only to later declare she'd never been for them in the first place. officials at the education department described a sense of whiplash after a disastrous week.\n\nthat all followed a puzzling episode on north korea sanctions that the administration has still refused to clarify. on friday, trump abruptly tweeted that sanctions were being reversed, a message that sparked widespread confusion at the national security council, the us treasury and the state department.\n\nlater, administration officials insisted he was referring to a set of unannounced future sanctions and not measures slapped on shipping companies a day earlier. but even that explanation has come under scrutiny; officials told cnn there was not a package of sanctions in the pipeline, and that trump's directive remains a mystery to many.\n\nwhatever he meant, the move undercut his treasury secretary steven mnuchin, who a day earlier announced the set of sanctions on companies accused of facilitating trade with north korea. john bolton, trump's national security adviser, had also highlighted the new sanctions, warning other companies they could be next.\n\nthey are suffering greatly in north korea. they are having a hard time in north korea. and i just didn't think additional sanctions at this time were necessary, trump explained a week later perched atop sofa at his mar-a-lago club.\n\nit doesn't mean i don't put them on later, he said. but i didn't think additional sanctions at this time were necessary.\n\nin the week-ending news availability from the club, trump tied the education decision to the sanctions move on friday.\n\nit's a little bit of a similar situation with different parties, to put it mildly, he said, casting himself as the administration's ultimate overseer.\n\nbut he appeared no less consumed with the now-finished mueller probe than he was at the start. cast in odd late-afternoon lighting, trump responded to news barr would provide congress a redacted version of mueller's full report.\n\ni have nothing to hide, he said. this was a hoax. this was a witch hunt. i have absolutely nothing to hide, and i think a lot of things are coming out with respect to the other side. but i have a lot of confidence in the attorney general.
washington (cnn) the test for what the republican party will be in the wake of donald trump's presidency is coming in a little over 24 hours and on the heels of georgia senate runoffs that will finally determine the balance of the us senate.\n\nbut the price republicans could pay for defying trump and certifying the results of a fair and free election is already coming into clear view.\n\nthe bottom line: the divide you are seeing rip through the republican party right now isn't between conservatives and moderates. this isn't the freedom caucus vs. leadership. it's not even as simple as members who might run for president in 2024 vs. those who will not. what you are seeing right now is a gamble members are taking on whether the gop can finally shake trump going forward or whether there is no way to win the white house again without him on their side.\n\nrepublican aides and members opposed to this effort are watching this play out and hoping that voters will have moved on from trump in the next several years. the hope is that this vote does not become a litmus test for whether outside groups wage primary challenges against those who were not loyal to the president in his last days in office. only time will tell how consequential this vote will really be. still, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has warned members that for him, it is one of the most important of his career.\n\nthe heartburn for members right now\n\nthe for four years, and with exception of a few republican members who have been more outspoken against trump on a consistent basis, rank-and-file members have fallen in line behind trump.\n\nmcconnell has undoubtedly been an ally, pushing through three supreme court justices for the president, remaking the courts and orchestrating a massive tax overhaul. lawmakers gave trump money for a wall. they waited out every impulse, tried hard not to see bombastic tweets, and now, if members aren't with the president on overturning the election, they are being ridiculed and attacked by him as if they never walked the line for him in the past.\n\nrepublican members and aides who had considered themselves allies of trump on capitol hill aren't surprised the president demands loyalty, but they're clearly frustrated by the position they are in.\n\nit is disappointing this vote has become the exclusive litmus test for whether or not a member of congress stands with president trump, sen. kevin cramer, a republican from north dakota, said in a statement. one would have a hard time finding a more fervent, consistent, longstanding supporter of this president than i have been since he first announced his candidacy.\n\nas one republican aide put it to me, every member who is following trump down this path to overturn the election has to remember that it will all be for nothing if they ever disagree with trump down the line.\n\nif you get on the trump train, it's not a buffet where you get to pick and choose what to take and what to leave. you are force fed everything, the aide said.\n\nwhat we know about wednesday\n\na joint session of congress will convene at 1 p.m. et. members are being encouraged to watch the proceedings remotely given the pandemic, but it's just as likely that the chamber will be packed. leadership offices have warned there is little they can do to discourage members from showing up for what is expected to be a historic moment.\n\nthe expectation is that vice president mike pence will preside over the session. he was spotted meeting with the senate's parliamentarian sunday. then, the four tellers: republican sen. roy blunt of missouri, democratic sen. amy klobuchar of minnesota, republican rep. rodney davis of illinois and democratic rep. zoe lofgren of california will read and tally the votes from every state in alphabetical order.\n\nthis can be sped up if there is agreement: the entire process, for example, took just 40 minutes in 2017.\n\nat each state, the vice president, in his role as the president of the senate, will call to ask if there are any objections. if there is an objection it will have to come from one senator and one member of the house and be turned over in writing. at that point, the joint session breaks up, and both chambers debate separately for up to two hours. they will then vote on the objection and resume the joint session.\n\ngiven the safety protocols in the house of representatives for voting, we expect that this process will take much longer for the house to get through every time the joint session is interrupted. only twice have there been a formal senate and house objection to the the tally. once in 1969 and once in 2005. both objections were voted down.\n\nwhat we still don't know\n\nwe still don't know how many official objections there will be. sen. josh hawley, a republican of missouri, has made it clear he will object to at least pennsylvania's results, but a source familiar with his thinking has said he is still reviewing whether he will object to other states as well. there is a long list of house members willing to sign onto objections from senators, but a senator has to sign on to make it a viable debate.\n\nwithout knowing how many states might be objected to, there is no way to predict how long wednesday will go. we may get more clarity on tuesday, but we may have to watch this play out in real time. i am told by a senate gop source that sen. ted cruz of texas and the 11 members who signed a statement saturday saying they will support objections are still considering whether they will object to particular states or merely vote for the objections that hawley brings. the outcome of the georgia election could also factor into senators' thinking: if gop sens. kelly loeffler and david perdue both win, does that change the calculus for whether members want to challenge the state of georgia, for example? will members be ready to move on more quickly?\n\nthere's still a lot we don't know about how wednesday will unfold. the mechanics of the day, while clearly spelled out by law, give individual members a lot of power over how long they can drag this out.\n\none last thing to remember\n\nfor years, mcconnell has managed to keep his conference together through fights over the supreme court, a tax overhaul and even the passage of some of the largest stimulus packages in the country's history. he's legendary for his ability to use arcane senate procedures to realize his political ambitions. the failure to repeal and replace obamacare one of the only true defeats mcconnell has suffered in his senate tenure.\n\nbut the vote wednesday was always outside his control. while he privately urged his members to stay away from it, cognizant it could affect members up for reelection in 2022, mcconnell has largely told members to vote their conscience now that the vote will occur. members and aides say mcconnell has been a sounding board for members on the fence, but he realizes he cannot ultimately control the whims of every office. that's never been his style.\n\nthe breakdown in the senate\n\nthose republicans voting against a challenge:\n\nrob portman of

dam project.\n\n\n\ntapper: the money will continue to pay for this massive army corps of engineers project on the ohio river along kentucky's border. the senate conservatives fund, a political action

this morning, he fired back at critics on wvlk radio in lexington.\n\n\n\nmcconnell: there was no earmark. the army corps of engineers requested the olmsted lock funding. both the house and senate passed an authorization for it. every single member of the senate had a chance to review it and none asked for it to be taken out.\n\n\n\ntapper: mcconnell's negotiating counterpart, senate majority leader harry reid, agreed last night.\n\n\n\nsen. harry reid (d-nv), majority leader: this is not an earmark. it saves the money -- the taxpayers lots of money.\n\n\n\ntapper: it turns out, officials say, stopping and restarting the project would have cost over $200 million if the authorization had not gone through. oh, and president obama had the same provision to continue the project in his 2014 budget.\n\n\n\ntom schatz, president, citizens against government waste: rather than talking about shutting down the government, it's time to talk about shutting down the waste.\n\n\n\ntapper: tom schatz is president of citizens against government waste.\n\n\n\nschatz: adding a provision to fund a dam opens the door for similar projects in the next c.r. this project has tripled in cost. it's behind schedule and if regular order had prevailed, it's unclear whether that would have been funded at all in the normal energy and water appropriations bill.\n\n\n\ntapper: other additions to the bill to reopen the government include $175,000 which will be paid to the widow of senator frank lautenberg, who died last year. such a payment is standard practice, but it might be worth noting lautenberg was one of the wealthiest members of congress. roll call reported he was worth more than $50 million in 2011.\n\n\n\nand, finally, let's call this the edward snowden effect. the privacy and civil liberties oversight board will get $3.1 million. they are a white house oversight group set up to guard americans' right to privacy against overreach by government cyber-intelligence.\n\n\n\n(end videotape)\n\n\n\ntapper: senator john mccain did not mince words about some of these added provisions. he told the daily beast -- quote -- these people are like alcoholics. they can't resist taking a drink. it's ridiculous. it's absolutely ridiculous. it shows that there are people in this body who are willing to use any occasion to get an outrageous pork barrel project done at the cost of millions and billions of dollars. it's disgusting.\n\n\n\nso how did these extras get added on and, perhaps more importantly, where do we go from here?\n\n\n\nhere to give us an inside view on the negotiations, congressman robert pittenger, republican from north carolina. he serves on the house committee on financial services and he voted for this deal.\n\n\n\ncongressman, thanks for joining us.\n\n\n\nhow did these funds for this dam in kentucky, how did they get attached, and does that concern you at all?\n\n\n\nrep. robert pittenger (r), north carolina: well, jake, i wasn't part of that negotiation process.\n\n\n\ni will say to you that perception wise, it would be far better to go through the normal process of legislation. but, really, the big issue on the table right now that should be of concern to every american is the $17 trillion debt and $60 trillion of unfunded liabilities.\n\n\n\nthat weight has enormous implications for our future. if you were to talk to peter orszag, who was the budget writer for mr. obama for four years, or to erskine bowles, who i have known for over 20 years, or paul ryan, they will all tell you the same thing. until we get our fiscal house in order and really redirect the trajectory of our spending, we will end up collapsing like greece.\n\n\n\nthat's what we need to be about. that's what we have got to focus on.\n\n\n\ntapper: right. let's talk about that. president obama today said that he is ready to move on to some real issues. let's play some of that sound.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nobama: passing a budget, immigration reform, farm bill, those are three specific things that would make a huge difference in our economy right now.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ntapper: let's talk about passing a budget. house and senate democrats and republicans are going to meet to discuss the nation's finances. president obama has said he wants a big deal to reduce the deficit and start chipping away at the national debt. he wants -- he says he's willing to include trimming social safety net programs or entitlements, but that republicans need to be willing to raise some taxes.\n\n\n\nhe says everybody needs to be in this together. are you up for a deal like that?\n\n\n\npittenger: you know, i wrote a letter -- i co-chair a bipartisan group called united solutions of freshmen. we wrote a letter to the president right after we were sworn in imploring the president to address the debt and imploring the president to go after entitlements, which are the single biggest factor. medicare will be insolvent within a decade. social security needs to be addressed.\n\n\n\nthese are very key components. and, yes, i am totally in favor of taking real specific measures to address this so that we have a future for the next generation. we cannot allow this type of obligation to continue. unfortunately, when the president has had the megaphone to the american in his inauguration or his state of the union, he didn't bring up the debt or the deficits.\n\n\n\nwhen we met with him as house republicans, we met an hour-and-a-half. when he walked in the room, we stood and we clapped because he's president of the united states, but in that hour-and-a-half, jake, he never brought up the debt, never brought up the deficit. still, we did. he said, i'm really not that concerned about deficits.\n\n\n\nwell, that's got to change. we need a clear understanding that we cannot spend $3.5 trillion and take in $2.5 trillion. that's why we had to raise the debt ceiling.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ntapper: i hear you. i hear you and i agree with you. but i think president obama, he makes two points about why increasing taxes need to be part of this, and i would be asking a democrat the same question about trimming social safety net programs if i were interviewing one right now.\n\n\n\nbut the sticking point for republicans is increasing taxes. president obama says, one, i can't ask for seniors to make sacrifices without asking the wealthiest americans to do so as well. and then he says, two, politically, he can't ask democrats to -- in the house and the senate to vote for something that trims these programs without asking for them -- asking republicans to vote for something they don't want to do, which is raise taxes.\n\n\n\nare you willing to enter into a deal, hypothetically? i'm not saying commit to any one piece of legislation, but hypothetically, if there were cuts to some of these programs, would you be willing to contemplate, entertain the notion of tax increases?\n\n\n\npittenger: jake, the president asked for and he received a $600 billion tax increase from the wealthiest of american people.\n\n\n\nhe got that the beginning of this year. that was a major concession and commitment from realizing from many republicans that it was a hard bite to swallow, because the republicans believe that lowering the tax burden, lowering regulations stimulates the economy.\n\n\n\nwe are never going to get there, jake, by increasing the tax burden. you could double the corporate and marginal tax rates in this country and you still would barely cover the current deficits. we have got to grow our economy. when ronald reagan lowered the tax burden and lowered the regulation early in the '80s, we were creating 300,000 or 400,000 or 500,000 jobs a month. one month, we created a million jobs. that's remarkable.\n\n\n\nwe are sputtering along right now at 1.8 percent economic growth. we have unemployment is 7.45 percent. and, in reality, it's probably 13 percent if you consider the people who have quit looking for jobs. this is terrible. we have to do better. we have to grow our way out of this problem and create and generate revenue back in the federal treasury.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ntapper: i'm going to take that as a no. and i thank you so much for coming on the show. i appreciate it. say hi to the beautiful tar heel state for me.\n\n\n\npittenger: thank you. great to be with you. tapper: our money lead. just how much did this partial government shutdown end up costing us? keep in mind that this is washington, where even doing nothing is a pricey proposition.\n\n\n\nthe estimates vary widely. according to macroeconomic advisers, our economy took a $12 billion hit. the estimate from standard & poor's is twice as high, $24 billion. the atlantic suggests we split the difference at $18 billion. to wrap our heads around it, that is more than $1 billion higher than the 2014 budget for nasa, so give or take a space program. that's how much we lost in productivity, temporary layoffs, interest payments and so on.\n\n\n\nas long as we're talking numbers, i should mention, $14.7 trillion, that's the amount of our national debt as of last week, according to the treasury.\n\n\n\ncoming up next, one lobbyist is calling them the taliban minority. what are the consequences for the tea party caucus after the government shutdown, if any? our panel will weigh in next.\n\n\n\nand, later, his campaign mastered the use of technology to help lift him to presidential victory. so how did his team drop the ball on the obamacare rollout? i will ask president obama's former chief of technology ahead.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\ntapper: welcome back to the lead.\n\n\n\nnow, it's time for the politics lead.\n\n\n\nyou know him as a twitter fanatic who is quick to shovel out a snow- bound car, maybe perform a superhero act like pull a neighbor from a burning building, or show up on a late night talk show.\n\n\n\nbut now, newark's celebrity mayor, cory booker, is also new jersey's senator-elect after an 11-point special election victory over his rival, republican steve lonegan, last night.\n\n\n\nsenator-elect cory booker of new jersey now joins me from new york.\n\n\n\nsenator-elect, it's a pleasure. congratulations.\n\n\n\nsenator-elect cory booker (d), new jersey: thank you very much. it's great to be here.\n\n\n\ntapper: so, we just watched political dysfunction bring this town here that you're moving to to a screeching halt. had you been here in washington, do you think you would have done anything differently than what you saw and what will you try to do for future fiscal fights? there's probably going to be one welcoming you on your doorstep as you move here.\n\n\n\nbooker: yes. i can't say what i would have done. i'm one of those people that had a sideline seat like you did, but i did know right here in new jersey, i saw firsthand how so many people, tens and tens of thousands of new jerseyans were directly impacted, hurt, had their lives in many ways put in deep insecurity as a result of it.\n\n\n\nso, it's something that's just unacceptable. i think i agree with what the president said. there were no winners in this. there were just a lot of losers, starting with the american people.\n\n\n\ni just came from a press conference where we brought yet another development project creating hundreds of jobs in newark, it was the governor and i together, the governor, a republican and me a democrat. we built new jersey -- new jersey's biggest city, newark, back because of bipartisanship.\n\n\n\nchris christie and i disagree on more stuff than we agree on. in fact, we were going at each other with the giants versus the cowboys at the press conference. i don't have that much to defend right now at 0-6, but --\n\n\n\ntapper: right.\n\n\n\nbooker: -- the reality is this is my history. newark is coming back now because of left and right working together. people said it couldn't be done, the problems were too big.\n\n\n\ntapper: right.\n\n\n\nbooker: i'm hoping in washington i can really just join with others of both parties who share my spirit.\n\n\n\ntapper: senator, you have worked with chris christie very closely. you two are famously or infamously close both professionally and you're also friends. i assume you're not going to vote for him, however, next month when he is up for re-election.\n\n\n\nif he's so good and you preach bipartisanship, why not endorse him? he's already up 24 points in the polls. he's going to win anyway, probably.\n\n\n\nbooker: i don't necessarily agree with that. there's a large lead right now but there's still time. look, when i draw the issues up, i see issues i disagree with, whether the earned income tax credit, planned parenthood, regional greenhouse gas agreements. whether it's basic issues, frankly, when it comes to things like marriage equality.\n\n\n\nso, when i look at all the issues, barbara buono was clearly my close and she's in line with the voters of new jersey. but i tell you this. when the people elect somebody, they expect us to work with those people and the people elected chris christie. he was the governor of the state. i am the mayor of the largest city.\n\n\n\nand so, look, i love how tip o'neill and ronald reagan in days of old had a real relationship, a real friendship. would they have voted for each other? probably not.\n\n\n\ntapper: ok.\n\n\n\nbooker: but their relationship helped move america forward. and that's my philosophy. tapper: fair enough.\n\n\n\nyou have lived in public housing in new jersey to raise awareness on poverty issues and crime issues. where do you think you will live in washington, d.c.? will you consider moving to a disadvantaged neighborhood like anacostia?\n\n\n\nbooker: absolutely. i will be down there now that i won, taking a good look about where to live. you know, there's a lot of america now that --\n\n\n\ntapper: is that your phone?\n\n\n\nbooker: that was my phone. i apologize.\n\n\n\ntapper: you want to get it?\n\n\n\n(laughter)\n\n\n\nbooker: no. it's probably your producer calling me to tell me to turn off the phone.\n\n\n\ntapper: right.\n\n\n\nbooker: but look, you know, at the end of the day, i really savor living in neighborhoods where there's great people struggling to make america real for all americans. and i just want to be in a neighborhood in d.c. that keeps me focused on the urgencies that i'm fighting for.\n\n\n\nwe live in a nation now that's more stratified economically, where social mobility is an index if you measured against our peer nations is going down in america. we're losing middle class jobs and unfortunately, a lot of them are being replaced with minimum wage jobs.\n\n\n\ntapper: right.\n\n\n\nbooker: if you know areas like mine, minimum wage won't help you escape poverty.\n\n\n\nso i like being part of communities that are on the front lines of that fight, and i'm not sure where i'll live in d.c. but i'll look at the whole city. it's the city of my birth. many people don't know that. i didn't move to new jersey until i was 4 months old. butt it's where my parents met, got their first jobs, and had their first kids.\n\n\n\nso i'm looking forward to being a part of that community in the days that i'm down there and spending actually as much time as i can back in new jersey --\n\n\n\ntapper: it might have been a real estate agent on the phone calling.\n\n\n\nbooker: yes. tapper: last question, senator, is that president obama today told a reporter that he left you a message last night. let's play that sound.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nbarack obama, president of the united states: i did. i think he's going to do a great job.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ntapper: i think he's going to do a great job. what kind of advice did president obama have to offer?\n\n\n\nbooker: look, i have to say the president was my friend before he was my president. he left a message for me last night which was incredibly gracious after midnight, i'm sorry i missed his call.\n\n\n\nbut i'll never forget my first really long conversation with him which was in a hotel room in newark. he was up to give a speech. i came in to meet him. he'd just been elected senator.\n\n\n\nand we went right to talking about the unfinished business of america and the fact that there are still a lot of disadvantaged communities that we as a country need to focus on, because the truth is, when everyone just does well in america, everyone does well in america. so, i appreciate a guy like the president who seems to be concerned in many ways with those people still struggling in our nation, trying to fight to be in the middle class, who might be facing difficulties now, and i hope that we can partner on expanding this economy, growing our gdp, and making our nation more of a nation of abundance for everyone.\n\n\n\nand i'm -- let's be real and you know this probably better than i do. i will be the 100th senator in seniority. i have a great senior senator in my state, menendez. my first months down there, if not more, i look forward to learning as much as i can, trying to find ways to gain my knowledge base so that i can be a great senator in the long term.\n\n\n\nand i'll say this, and with a wonderful statement from african history, there's an old statement that goes true for the senate which i think is going to be true for me. if you want to go fast, go alone, but if you want to go far, go together. and i hope to join with other people to take that institution far in service of this nation.\n\n\n\ntapper: all right. newark mayor and new jersey's newest senator- elect, cory booker, thank you and congratulations on your win.\n\n\n\nbooker: thank you so much. thanks for having me on.\n\n\n\ntapper: coming up next, is big business really coming to speaker boehner's aid by trying to take out the tea party? our political panel will weigh in.\n\n\n\nplus, terror doesn't even begin to describe it. chilling, frightening new video obtained by cnn from inside the kenyan mall while gunmen take aim. that's coming up.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\ntapper: welcome back to the lead.\n\n\n\nsome breaking political news: cnn has confirmed that tomorrow, president obama will nominate jeh johnson to replace janet napolitano as secretary of the department of homeland security. johnson previously served as general counsel for the department of defense during president obama's first term.\n\n\n\nas to whether there will be a battle over his confirmation, well, if you thought the bipartisan slap fight in washington might finally be over, then you obviously didn't hear the president say this today.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nobama: last night, i signed legislation to reopen our government and pay america's bills, because democrats and responsible republicans came together --\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ntapper: hmm. democrats and responsible republicans.\n\n\n\none hundred forty-four republicans voted no last night and with fewer than three months to go before the next budget battle, the white house doesn't seem quite ready to make complete nice.\n\n\n\nlet's bring in our panel.\n\n\n\ntim pawlenty, president and ceo of the financial services roundtable and, of course, former governor of minnesota. cnn's chief congressional correspondent, the tireless dana bash. and former clinton white house press secretary, joe lockhart.\n\n\n\ni want to start with this washington post report. business groups stand by boehner, plot against tea party. there's a quote from a man named dirk van dongen, long-time chief lobbyist for the national association of wholesale-distributors, who has known boehner since the lawmaker's first election. he says, i don't know anybody who takes the side of the taliban minority. i assume he's referring to the tea party.\n\n\n\ntim, is that how the business world views what happened over the last three weeks, the taliban minority seized control of the house republicans?\n\n\n\ntim pawlenty, president & ceo, financial services roundtable: well, a few things.\n\n\n\nfirst, i don't think people should put a taliban label on any elected representative or public servant. i think that's over the line, just in terms of rhetoric and what that implies.\n\n\n\ntwo, the business community, of course, is more pragmatic than, say, the tea party in terms of their politics and desired outcomes. but the idea that they are going to come in and take out tea party members is probably misunderstood. the tea party members for the most part are in districts or states that lean pretty substantially in their direction and the idea that they're mostly politically vulnerable is probably not going to materialize. there will be some groups that will try that but i suggest to you, jake, it won't be successful.\n\n\n\nand then, lastly, as to the tea party, keep in mind, you know, it's one slice of a broader coalition. they overplayed their hand here. one of the adages you have to keep in mind is when you negotiate, the person with the leverage wins.\n\n\n\ntapper: right.\n\n\n\npawlenty: they didn't have the leverage here.\n\n\n\ntapper: or any -\n\n\n\npawlenty: but, you know, there's an analog in the democratic party to the tea party, when you look at groups like occupy, when you look at groups that want to just recklessly defund the department of defense. they don't represent the whole democratic party and the tea party represents only one slice of the republican party.\n\n\n\ntapper: is that a fair analogy?\n\n\n\njoe lockhart, former clinton white house press secretary: it is, but it misses an important point, which is within the republican party, the tea party does have the leverage. we just spent 16 days painfully, dana hasn't slept in 16 days, because of the leverage they had.\n\n\n\nthe business community doesn't have that much influence with the tea party. the tea party and most republicans are more worried about someone coming from their right, coming from the tea party to challenge them, than anyone on the left.\n\n\n\nso, this all has to be resolved. i think it's very fair analysis, but the difference between the tea party and occupy or a group on the left, those groups don't have leverage within the democratic party right now. the tea party does. and that's the fundamental problem for the party.\n\n\n\ntapper: and, dana, let's talk about the future of democrat, republican negotiations because that's obviously where this is going to go now. there's going to be negotiations over a budget.\n\n\n\nwhen president obama came out last night before the house vote had finished, there were a lot of house republicans who were very worried that he just was misreading house republicans all over again.
it's never been easy for reem aloul to hire a nursing director for her home health care business. she finally found someone she liked, but the interview ended soon after she told the nurse that the job didn't come with health benefits.\n\nit's a subject i know will come up and quite often it won't be a good answer, said aloul, who opened her brightstar care franchise in 2013. you do lose good candidates.\n\nsoon, however, aloul and other small business owners may have a more affordable option. the trump administration is making it easier for small firms like hers to band together and buy coverage, using their scale to secure less expensive plans much like large employers do.\n\nthese so-called association health plans have existed for decades, but haven't been very popular. companies often had to navigate complex regulations and meet strict criteria, including being in both the same industry and location, according to chris condeluci, who runs cc law & policy, a health care legal and policy practice.\n\nthe proposed regulation unveiled by the department of labor earlier this month would open up association health plans so that small firms in the same industry could join regardless of their location. also, small employers in different industries could establish an association as long as they are in the same state or metro area. the plans would also be exempt from certain obamacare provisions, allowing them to sell cheaper policies with fewer benefits.\n\nthe department is currently soliciting comments before it releases the final regulation.\n\nrelated: trump officials unveil rule that could chip away at obamacare\n\nsmall employers have long sought a way to provide health insurance to their staffs, but high premiums always proved a barrier. only half of firms with between 3 and 49 workers offer coverage, according to the 2017 kaiser/hret survey of employer-sponsored health benefits.\n\nseveral large trade associations say they and their members are eager to explore setting up association health plans once the federal government finalizes the regulations in coming months.\n\nindependent stores want to attract good employees and retain them, said neil trautwein, vice president for health policy at the national retail federation. if the larger store down the block offers coverage and they can't, they are at a disadvantage.\n\naloul knows this all too well. she has long wanted to provide health insurance for her five employees, but it was too expensive. so she offers a more flexible schedule and a higher salary, but that's often still not enough to convince some applicants to join her agency. the candidate for nursing director, for instance, is a single mom with two small children and said she could only take a position with benefits.\n\nthe proposed regulations could smooth the way for franchise firms like aloul's to offer coverage to their workers. there are several ways it could work. a franchisor could set up a plan for its franchisees nationwide. or it's possible the international franchise association, which has 743,000 members with several million employees, could create one.\n\ncatherine monson, chief executive at fastsigns international, a signage and visual graphics company that has more than 600 locations and 4,200 employees in 48 states. most of her franchisees offer coverage, but have few takers. they have been asking for years why they can't create a group health plan and offer lower-priced policies. now, they will be able to, said monson, a longtime advocate of association health plans.\n\nthey are wondering why we can't move faster, she said of her franchisees, who have an average of seven employees each.\n\nrelated: what's in trump's health care executive order?\n\nassociation health plans may not be right for all small businesses or their workers. depending on how they are set up, some plans won't be able to set premiums for a company based on its employees' health, which generally drives up rates for younger and healthier folks.\n\nhowever, the plans also won't have to cover all the services that are now required by the affordable care act. so firms with sicker or older staff may find the benefits too skimpy for their needs, as could employees who suffer accidents or come down with serious illnesses.\n\nthey will be popular until people start running out of coverage, said george stadtlander, president of consoliplex, an association plan manager in cleveland, ohio.\n\nstadtlander helps create one type of association health plan that is regulated by states and likely won't be affected by the new trump administration rules.\n\none of his most recent ones is run by the missouri chamber of commerce. though the plan is allowed to use workers' health status to calculate a firm's rate, businesses have flocked to it in droves. it covered 250 employees and their families when it opened in november. that number has now swelled to 2,500 members.\n\nthe plan provides some good insight into how banding together could help some employers. the chamber itself -- which has only 25 staffers -- saw its premiums drop 20% when it joined.\n\nwe've had tons of inquiries, said brendan cossette, the chamber's chief operating office. it's spreading like wildfire.\n\nhave you belonged to an association health plan or do you wish to join one? is a short-term health insurance policy right for you? email healthcarestories@cnn.com and you could be included in an upcoming article.

(jackson's performance at a news conference announcing the results of that physical didn't hurt either.)\n\nhe's like central casting – like a hollywood star, trump said of jackson in a speech to donors at his mar-a-lago resort in february.\n\nthen this happened on monday night:\n\nrepublicans and democrats on the senate veterans affairs committee are raising concerns about allegations involving rear adm. ronny jackson, president donald trump's nominee to lead the department of veterans affairs, and are reviewing them to determine if they are substantial enough to upend his nomination.\n\ncommittee members have been told about allegations related to improper conduct in various stages of his career, two sources said.\n\nthe white house, according to cnn reporting, has no plans to pull jackson's nomination.\n\nadmiral jackson has been on the front lines of deadly combat and saved the lives of many others in service to this country, said white house deputy press secretary hogan gidley on tuesday morning. he's served as the physician to three presidents—republican and democrat—and been praised by them all. admiral jackson's record of strong, decisive leadership is exactly what's needed at the va to ensure our veterans receive the benefits they deserve.\n\nbut, jackson's confirmation hearing – originally set for wednesday – was postponed tuesday amid the allegations.\n\nthis is what happens when you govern by personal preference and favor seat-of-the-pants decisions rather than more thought-out ones.\n\ntrump has made no secret of his unwavering belief in the rightness of his gut. he is an instinctual actor; he goes with what feels right as opposed to what conventional wisdom or the graybeards of washington tell him is right.\n\nit worked like a charm during the 2016 campaign. trump went from an asterisk to the white house by – and i am only oversimplifying slightly here – doing the opposite of what everyone said he should. (thank you george costanza!)\n\nwhen he won, trump tried to do what he thought conventional wisdom said he should. he tried to make nice with the washington establishment by hiring former republican national committee chairman reince priebus as his chief of staff. he trusted house speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell when they laid out an ambitious schedule to get rid of obamacare and replace it with a conservative alternative.\n\nbut almost none of that worked. trump chafed at being managed. health care legislation stalled. trump's poll numbers flagged. the momentum he had built coming off the biggest upset in modern presidential history waned.\n\nand so, trump went back to being, well, trump. he tweeted more. he made calls – on everything from foreign policy to staffing – on instinct. which brings us to the jackson pick.\n\ntrump didn't pick jackson because of his depth of management experience in big organizations. (jackson doesn't have that.) he didn't pick him after a long and deliberative process that included consultation with republicans (and democrats) on capitol hill. he didn't vet jackson fully to ensure that he could even be confirmed. (jackson was tapped as the top white house physician by president barack obama in 2013; that position does not require senate confirmation.)\n\ntrump picked jackson because he liked him. because he thought jackson did a good job at that news conference announcing the results of trump's physical. because it felt like the right move.\n\nall of that means that where the white house finds itself today with jackson – dead in the water unless something changes – was entirely predictable. governing by the seat of your pants is rarely a recipe for success; there's a reason, after all, that things like vetting exist.\n\ntrump wanted jackson because he liked him. well, he got him. and i bet he wishes he didn't right about now.

idaho isn't waiting for congress to repeal and replace obamacare.\n\nonly a few weeks after governor c.l. butch otter issued a controversial -- and legally questionable -- executive order allowing insurers to sell plans that do not meet all of obamacare's mandates, blue cross of idaho unveiled a set of policies that could cost half as much as those sold on the exchanges.\n\nthis is about affordability and choice, charlene maher, blue cross' ceo, said wednesday, when announcing the new plans. the current marketplace is not affordable for middle-class families.\n\notter says that he's using the flexibility provided by the trump administration to bring down costs. idaho's department of insurance is now allowing insurers who offer policies on the obamacare exchanges to also sell individual plans that base premiums on a consumer's health background, limit coverage to $1 million a year and cover fewer benefits -- all violations of the health reform law.\n\nwe have been waiting patiently while congress has been unable to find a solution and idaho families have been forced to buy products that are too expensive and loaded with benefits they don't want or need, otter said. now the door is open for states to pursue our own reasonable solutions. we believe idaho will lead the way in states taking back control of their insurance markets.\n\nblue cross, the largest insurer in the state's individual market, plans to offer five policies under the name freedom blue that will differ from its obamacare offerings. the insurer offered a comparison between one of its new plans and its most popular bronze policy on the exchange. the freedom blue plan's medical deductible and co-pays are somewhat lower, but it has a separate deductible for prescription drugs and its out-of-pocket maximum are considerably higher.\n\nrelated: despite trump's attacks, obamacare sign-ups dip only slightly\n\nalso, the premiums can vary widely. consumers will have to fill out a 20-question form about their medical history. the healthiest folks could pay roughly half of what the bronze plan would cost them -- $90 a month versus $238 a month for a 21-year-old. but the maximum rate could cost more -- particularly for older americans, who tend to have more medical issues. they might have to pay $971 a month if they have pre-existing conditions, compared to $713 a month for the bronze plan. insurers are not allowed to turn anyone away because of their health backgrounds.\n\nthe benefits, however, are roughly the same -- that's because consumers want more comprehensive coverage, said dave jeppesen, blue cross' executive vice president for consumer health care. the main differences are that the plans don't cover pediatric dental or vision, and one doesn't offer maternity benefits.\n\nthe freedom blue plans are meant to complement the obamacare policies, not to undermine them, jeppesen said. they are designed to provide less expensive options for 110,000 uninsured middle class idaho residents who don't qualify for federal premium subsidies and can't afford the policies on their own. the plans will also serve to stabilize the exchanges since they are expected to attract younger and healthier consumers, which would lower the rates for everyone.\n\nblue cross expects to start selling the freedom blue plans next month, with coverage beginning april 1.\n\nstill, the governor's move sent consumer and patient advocates into a panic, with many fearing that other states would follow. they decried it as illegal, or even crazypants illegal, as nicholas bagley, a law professor at the university of michigan, labeled it.\n\nthese idaho guidelines for health insurers are crazypants illegal. it's not even close. does idaho think the supremacy clause doesn't apply to it? https://t.co/zexbglaxq3 — nicholas bagley (@nicholas_bagley) january 25, 2018\n\nmeanwhile, 15 patient groups, including the american heart association, the march of dimes and the leukemia & lymphoma society, wrote a letter to health secretary alex azar this week asking him to declare idaho's move illegal.\n\nidaho's action — if it is permitted to stand — would seriously injure idaho patients and consumers and significantly destabilize idaho's entire health insurance market, the coalition wrote.\n\nrelated: trump officials unveil rule that could chip away at obamacare\n\nazar, however, does not appear to be in a rush to act on idaho.\n\ni'm not aware that our opinions or views have been solicited on that question yet, he told representative sandy levin, a democrat from michigan, while testifying before congress wednesday on his agency's budget request. we will look at that whenever it comes to us. of course, there's a rule of law that we need to enforce.
(cnn) affordable care act enrollees and those looking for obamacare coverage can start accessing the stimulus-enhanced premium subsidies on the federal exchange on april 1, the biden administration announced friday.\n\nbut the jobless will have to wait longer to enroll in the zero-premium plans provided by the $1.9 trillion relief package that president joe biden signed thursday, according to the department of health and human services.\n\nthe announcement comes as multiple federal agencies are racing to implement the wide range of provisions in the massive legislation. the $1,400 stimulus checks will start going out this weekend, but it will take weeks or months to get other relief to the people who need it.\n\nthe american rescue plan provides heftier federal premium subsidies for affordable care act policies for two years. about 15 million uninsured americans will be eligible for financial assistance, as will those who have obamacare coverage but earned too much to qualify for subsidies.\n\nalso, 9 million people currently in subsidized plans will receive more aid.\n\nthe relief package makes two changes to the subsidies to address long-standing complaints that obamacare plans are not affordable for many people, particularly the middle class.\n\nenrollees will pay no more than 8.5% of their income toward coverage, down from nearly 10% now. and lower-income policyholders will receive subsidies that eliminate their premiums completely.\n\nalso, those earning more than the current cap of 400% of the federal poverty level -- about $51,000 for an individual and $104,800 for a family of four in 2021 -- will become eligible for help for the first time.\n\nresidents of the 36 states that enroll through the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, will see the larger subsidies when they go to the site starting april 1. states that run their own exchanges are aiming for a similar time line, but their implementation dates could vary, according to a senior administration official.\n\nthe uninsured can sign up on the federal exchange through may 15, under a special enrollment period ordered by biden. most state-based exchanges are also allowing residents to obtain coverage for the next few weeks or months.\n\ncurrent affordable care act enrollees can return to the exchanges to obtain the larger subsidies or change their plans. those who don't will receive the more generous subsidies when they file their taxes next spring.\n\npremiums will decrease about $50 per person per month, on average. an uninsured couple making $70,000 annually could find coverage for $1,000 less per month than they would have before the law was passed. a family of four making $90,000 a year could see their premiums drop by $200 a month.\n\nspecial subsidies for the unemployed not ready yet\n\nthe stimulus package also provides new subsidies for those who lost their jobs, but those folks will likely have to wait a little longer.\n\nthe law allows those collecting unemployment benefits to sign up for obamacare coverage with no premiums in 2021. however, since this subsidy doesn't currently exist, it will take longer to set up, said the official, who did not have an estimated start date.\n\nuntil then, the jobless can still shop for plans on the exchanges and receive enhanced subsidies, though they may have to pay a premium depending on their income.\n\nalso, laid-off workers who want to remain on their employer health insurance plans through cobra will not pay any premiums from april through the end of september, under the relief law. the agency is working with the treasury and labor departments to enact this measure, but the official did not have a start date.\n\nthis story has been updated with additional details.

former united states attorney for the southern district of new york preet bharara attends the senate intelligence committee where fbi director james comey is sent to testify in the hart senate office building on capitol hill june 8, 2017 in washington, dc.\n\nus president donald trump chairs a meeting with administration and state officials on prison reform at the trump national golf club august 9, 2018 in bedminster, new jersey.\n\neditor's note: harry litman is the former us attorney for the western district of pennsylvania and deputy assistant attorney general in the department of justice. he teaches constitutional law in the political science department at the university of california, san diego, and practices at the firm constantine cannon. the views expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(cnn) —\n\ntwo prerequisites are necessary to assess the merits of the department of justice suit to block the merger of at&t and time warner – which us district judge richard leon resoundingly rejected tuesday.\n\nphoto: courtesy harry litman harry litman\n\nthe first is a thorough understanding of antitrust law, in particular the law of vertical integration, the sort of arrangement that at&t and time warner now have a green light to implement. the second is detailed knowledge of the litigation itself, including the 172-page opinion by leon and, especially, the expert testimony at trial on which the judge so thoroughly relied.\n\ni have neither. but then again, the same is true of the dozens of commentators who have been quick to pile on in the wake of the opinion, pillorying the justice department's decision to bring the case in the first place.\n\nthe prevailing commentary is that the case – the first of its kind since the nixon era – was so weak that it must have been the product of political interference by the trump administration with the antitrust division of the department of justice.\n\nat&t and time warner were quick to advance this view. a time warner spokesman excoriated the government: the court's resounding rejection of the government's arguments is confirmation that this was a case that was baseless, political in its motivation and should never have been brought in the first place.\n\ncnn analyst jeffrey toobin in fact reported on widespread suspicion about the motive behind doj's decision to stop the merger, which went against the grain of past republican administrations' hands-off approach.\n\nthe notion in many quarters was that the lawsuit may have been political payback for coverage of president donald trump by cnn (which time warner owns) after jared kushner unsuccessfully tried to get the network to go easier on trump. and it intensified when rudy giuliani, trump's ever graceless and sloppy political spokesman, blurted out to the press that the president denied the merger.\n\nbut department of justice antitrust chief makan delrahim steadfastly denied having received any political push to bring the case, and the white house said the same.\n\nit is true, the judge noted, that the action imposed staggering costs on both the defendants while delaying the merger. as he also pointed out, however, the costs to the department were mammoth, too. and the government got its hat handed to it. not the smartest of fights for a president obsessed with winning.\n\nbut these are the wages of the trump era. trump's contemptible assault on federal law enforcement, his deep state nonsense against the plainly legitimate (and effective) robert mueller probe, have had their toxic effect. they cast a pall over all high-profile actions and result in reflexive second-guessing of the department's motivations.\n\na small tragedy went largely unnoticed tuesday at the department of justice. joel mcelvain, a 20-year department veteran, and a real pro, resigned in response to attorney general jeff sessions' lawless and rankly political decision not to defend essential parts of the obamacare law. mcelvain's principled exit should sound a loud alarm bell.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nin another time, with another president, the department would enjoy the benefit of the doubt. delrahim would be taken at his word in the absence of compelling evidence to the contrary, and the debacle would be analyzed by most, as it may well have been, a principled but overaggressive litigation.\n\nbut trump has made remarkable progress in just two years to sandblast that view away, replacing it with an ever-growing perception among his supporters that the department's decisions are driven by politics, not law. the upshot is an erosion in public confidence in the justice system, and deep demoralization in the ranks of the career professionals at the department of justice. it is a nightmare from which there may be no waking so long as trump remains in office.
the 77-year-old biden notched his first-ever nominating contest win, more than three decades after he launched the first of his three campaigns for the white house.\n\nbiden drank the moment in as he took the stage in columbia, south carolina, to make victory remarks. he looked forward to the super tuesday states and the upcoming race against sanders, alluding to the vermonter's history as an independent.\n\nif democrats want to nominate someone who will build on obamacare, not scrap it; take on the nra and gun manufacturers, not protect them; stand up and give the poor a fighting chance and the middle class get restored, not raise their taxes and keep the promises we make, then join us, biden said. and if the democrats want a nominee who's a democrat. a lifelong democrat. a proud democrat. an obama-biden democrat, then join us.\n\nthe question now is whether biden can use south carolina as a launchpad, two days ahead of this week's super tuesday contests in 15 states and territories in which sanders, who finished in second, is hoping to build up an unassailable lead in the delegate count.\n\nthe contest took place in a charged political atmosphere as democrats assail president donald trump over his handling of the growing coronavirus crisis, as the stock market tumbles and fears of recession threaten to reshape the 2020 battlefield. it also marked the end of the road for businessman tom steyer, who sunk more than $20 million into south carolina and appeared headed for a distant third place finish in the race.\n\nafter anemic performances in the first three nominating clashes in iowa, new hampshire and nevada, biden bet everything on the palmetto state and its diverse, more moderate electorate. a loss would likely have meant a humiliating end to a half-century-long presidential career, but his win will unleash a comeback narrative.\n\nbiden is likely to walk away with the lion's share of 54 pledged delegates on offer on saturday — which represent more than half of the 101 delegates previously doled out in the contest.\n\ngoing into saturday, sanders led the delegate count, with buttigieg, biden, warren and klobuchar following. biden's win quickly shot him into second place after 14, just a portion, of south carolina's delegates were projected.\n\na total of 1,991 pledged delegates are needed to win the nomination at the first convention ballot.\n\nhe can now make the case that he is the only candidate who can inspire one of the most critical slices of the democratic electorate -- african american voters. and the win raises new questions about sanders' claim to have broadened his demographic appeal following his failed 2016 campaign.\n\nminority voters -- especially in cities like cleveland, philadelphia, charlotte, atlanta and detroit -- are critical to democratic hopes of winning back swing states that trump claimed in 2016 and putting new battlegrounds on the map.\n\nexit polls suggest that the south carolina electorate was far more moderate and african american than the states in which sanders has prospered. the former vice president's securing of last-minute endorsement of the state's political icon rep. james clyburn last week also appears to have been crucial.\n\non stage in columbia, biden paid tribute to that endorsement.\n\nmy buddy jim clyburn, you brought me back, he said.\n\nbiden's win was built on a base rooted in black voters, those over the age of 65 and moderates, according to preliminary results.\n\nbiden won around 3 in 5 black voters, dominating over sanders, his closest competitor who got almost 1 in 5 of the group. steyer came close to sanders, with around 1 in 7 black voters.\n\nalmost 3 in 5 voters over the age of 65 supported biden in his run in south carolina, followed by steyer and sanders with slightly more than 1 in 10.\n\nbiden led among moderate voters with more than half of the group supporting him. however, biden also won over voters who consider themselves very liberal, with around 2 in 5 of the group, surpassing sanders with 3 in 10. warren followed sanders with around 1 in 7 very liberal voters.\n\nthe former delaware senator's big win in south carolina also poses a challenge to former new york mayor michael bloomberg, who jumped into the race in the belief that biden was a weak candidate.\n\njust watched undecided voter asks biden 'what is your fire?' replay more videos ... must watch undecided voter asks biden 'what is your fire?' 01:57\n\nbloomberg has splashed half a billion dollars on the race so far. some party moderates fear he could siphon centrist votes away from biden and open the door for sanders.\n\nbiden's victory represents the most significant triumph yet in a long political career that spanned highs — including his two wins on a ticket with president barack obama — and devastating personal losses, as he buried a wife and two of his children.\n\nsaturday's result will underscore biden's resilience after an uninspiring campaign that has included a string of sub-par debate performances, but that has also opened a window into the former vice president's humanity in interactions with voters who, like him, have suffered aching personal bereavements.\n\nall of you who have been knocked down, counted out, left behind -- this is your campaign, biden said to raucous cheers in columbia.\n\nwe are very much alive.\n\nstill, the former vice president may still have his work cut out in overhauling sanders. while south carolina may provide a preview of the several state contests on tuesday, alabama and north carolina for instance, sanders is favored in delegate-rich states like texas and california.\n\nthe former vice president's victory will also spark intensifying questions about the viability of other candidates competing with him for the moderate lane in the democratic primary.\n\nthat includes minnesota sen. amy klobuchar and former south bend, indiana, mayor pete buttigieg. both candidates have failed to capitalize on encouraging performances earlier in the race.\n\nmassachusetts sen. elizabeth warren may also emerge from super tuesday primaries with no clear path to the nomination — given that sanders is beating her among the most progressive voters.\n\nboth klobuchar and warren are in danger of losing their home states to sanders, who hopes to ride his coalition of young, liberal voters to multiple victories on tuesday night. the vermont senator has also made inroads with hispanic voters over the last four years, as evidenced by his win in nevada.\n\nsanders has insisted that he should emerge as the nominee if he wins a plurality of the votes. but other candidates have not ruled out an effort to thwart him at the convention in july.\n\nsome party leaders are worried that sanders and his democratic socialism is too extreme to win a general election. but depriving him of the nomination could convince his legions of liberal voters to stay home in november.\n\nbiden told reporters saturday morning he was in good shape in south carolina, striking a balance between underlining the importance of the race and controlling expectations.\n\ni'm very optimistic, i'm optimistic not just about today, i'm optimistic about the whole process from here on out, the former vice president said.\n\nall i know is i think i'm going to do well here, and i think that's going to put me in a position to do well in north carolina and alabama and other states in the democratic primary, biden said. i think i can do well but i don't

washington (cnn) the supreme court's announcement on monday that it would livestream oral arguments in 10 cases next month, including three centered on president donald trump's financial records, is a historic breakthrough in public access to america's highest court.\n\nthe decision to make their teleconference arguments public brings some immediate transparency to an insular institution that has long prided itself on resisting technology and live broadcasts of any kind.\n\nit is, to be certain, a limited move. there will be no video pictures of the black-robed nine as they question lawyers in cases, and the court is allowing access to real-time arguments only for special may sittings during the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nthe courtroom is a very special place, chief justice john roberts has asserted. maybe part of what makes it special is that you don't see it on television.\n\noral arguments in bush v. gore , which decided the 2000 presidential election, were not broadcast live. neither were oral arguments over the fate of the affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare, same-sex marriage or abortion rights controversies. only those who waited in line for a seat in the courtroom could attend and follow in real time. for some cases, the justices made an audio recording available later in the day.\n\nthe usual practice has been for the court to put an audio link on its website each friday, useful for the historical record and legal followers, but not necessarily an exciting draw for the general public. only for a few high-profile cases have the justices even released audio recordings on the same day as an argument.\n\nnow, even the president, if he chooses, can tweet along with the action.\n\nthe announcement demonstrates, after a month of postponing any action on disputes scheduled for march and april, that the justices are willing to change their ways -- as a multitude of lower court judges already have -- to get their business done.\n\nscholars and students of the court lauded monday's announcement, even as they questioned whether it would truly modernize.\n\nthis is good for public education. it's good for the court coming into the 21st century, said barbara perry, a longtime supreme court expert at the university of virginia's miller center.\n\nperry wondered whether the justices might be against regular livestreaming when the country returns to regular ways.\n\ncould it be the tip of the camel's nose under the red velvet curtains? ... i'd say probably not, perry said, adding that televised hearings are unlikely to come in the near future.\n\namong the controversies to be heard in may are two trump challenges to us house subpoenas for financial documents from his longtime accounting and banking firms. that pair and a third case that will be heard, arising from a new york grand jury's investigation tied to trump tax records, had been scheduled for march 31.\n\nlee arbetman, executive director of street law, which helps high school teachers develop materials about the court, said airing the trump-us house document dispute would enhance civic awareness.\n\nthere's a potential for a greater understanding of democracy, on the checks and balances of government, he said. but does one oral argument an educated citizen make?\n\nfor lawyers, justices, and the public, the hour-long public sessions are an important but not crucial part of the decision-making process. lawyers put their most comprehensive arguments in written briefs. but the oral arguments allow lawyers to address tough questions about their cases and give the justices themselves an opportunity to telegraph their views and begin persuading each other.\n\nthe justices have often expressed concerns that listeners would get the wrong impression from arguments, for example, if they play devil's advocate in their questions or focus on a relatively minor issue for clarity. some justices try not to tip their hand or, perhaps, are truly uncertain about which side they favor before the case is put to a vote in their private meetings.\n\nstill, the sessions are invaluable to the public. the arguments provide the only opportunity to see all the justices wrestling with the case, in the open, and to witness their personal predilections and interactions. spectators visit the courtroom, especially, to see a newly appointed justice, such as brett kavanaugh in 2018, or to watch an enduring icon, such as ruth bader ginsburg , the notorious rbg.\n\narbetman and other educators said the value of monday's development would rest in livestreaming becoming the rule rather than the exception and in eventual televising.\n\nuntil monday, some 20 cases were in a suspended state, delayed but with no signal from the justices of whether they would resolve them before the court's usual end-of-june recess. the justices said they will hear a designated 10 cases in the first two weeks of may and the rest of the cases in early fall. it is not known whether that latter group, which could be aired in the courtroom, would be livestreamed.\n\nan institution that's always been the exception\n\nmany state courts already televise their proceedings, and plenty of state and lower us courts have already opened up teleconferences to the public during the pandemic.\n\non saturday, the kansas supreme court allowed the public to watch a zoom argument session of judges questioning lawyers in a controversy over the governor's ban on public gatherings, including for religious observances. (the court upheld the governor's order.)\n\nthe justices' initial moves to handle the pandemic were ambiguous. they issued orders regarding the allotment of argument time between parties but left open when those cases would actually be heard. until monday, lawyers, who continued to prepare filings and cautiously try to be ready for arguments, had not received any formal word about alternative methods for airing the march and april disputes.\n\nfor some of the pending march and april cases, there appeared more urgency. one dispute, relevant to the upcoming presidential election, tests whether states may fine or remove electoral college delegates who refuse to cast their ballots for candidates to whom they were pledged. that will be heard in may.\n\nand lawyers for the us house have been seeking clarity on their power to compel information from the president and scrutinize the white house. lower court judges upheld the house subpoenas issued to trump's accountants and banks. but the high court in december had accepted the trump appeal of the disputes.\n\nthe earlier high court postponement increased the likelihood that trump would not be forced to turn over personal business documents before the november election and cast doubt on the investigative authority of the house of representatives.\n\namong the cases heard in earlier arguments during this 2019-2020 term and still awaiting resolution involve whether federal law protects lgbtq workers from discrimination, whether louisiana abortion regulations infringe a woman's constitutional right to end a pregnancy, and whether the trump administration's plan to deport certain undocumented immigrants who came to the us as children can proceed.\n\nnow it appears that those earlier cases and the new select slate, including the trump controversies, would be decided by summer.\n\nstay tuned.
(cnn) the trump administration will use funds from the $2 trillion federal stimulus package to pay hospitals for treating uninsured coronavirus patients, health and human services secretary alex azar said friday.\n\nthe money will come from a $100 billion fund set up to reimburse hospitals and other health care providers for their coronavirus expenses, he said. providers, who will be paid at medicare rates, will not be allowed to send bills to the uninsured patients for the cost of their care, azar added.\n\ninsurers, democrats and at least two republican governors called upon the administration to create a special enrollment period as the number of americans falling ill or dying from the coronavirus continues to mount.\n\nread more
(cnn) donald trump's presidency has largely been defined by his disregard for political norms and his historic two impeachments .\n\ntrump purposefully sought to upend conventional domestic and foreign policy, fundamentally altering america's role in the world. and he disrupted the status quo in washington, recalibrating the federal government's role in everyday american life in ways both temporary and for a longer term effect.\n\nsome of trump's most consequential decisions, such as his judicial appointments , will dictate the ideological make-up of the courts for decades. and the physical reminder of his immigration and border security policies, in the form of a us-mexico border wall, will likely remain etched into america's landscape well past his presidency.\n\nother actions, including many issued through the use of executive authority, can be undone through the regulatory process or with the flick of joe biden's pen once he's president. still, those actions will have sometimes had a years long impact on american lives, affecting everything from their jobs to their schools to the kinds of lightbulbs they can buy.\n\nhere are some of the most significant ways trump's policies and actions changed the country:\n\ncoronavirus and public health\n\nmedical personnel move a deceased patient to a refrigerated truck serving as make shift morgues at brooklyn hospital center on april 9, 2020 in new york city.\n\nthe federal response to the coronavirus pandemic was the trump administration's biggest focus during the president's final year in office -- and its biggest failure.\n\ntrump made apparent political calculations that put optics ahead of the health of americans. he held large rallies in the final months of the election filled with throngs of unmasked crowds as the pandemic was hitting a new peak, he declined to wear a mask or social distance in front of cameras and he publicly downplayed the seriousness of the virus while privately knowing its deadliness\n\nthe us currently boasts more coronavirus cases and deaths than any other country.\n\nthe one victory was the quick development of two coronavirus vaccines that were authorized by december. but the rest of the handling on the pandemic was defined by major, and at times arguably fatal, missteps.\n\nthere's no good, specific treatment for coronavirus infection and the us efforts to help speed development of new approaches was middle by an early emphasis on drugs that were proven to be completely useless, notably hydroxychloroquine\n\nprior to the pandemic, the opioid crisis was trump's top public health focus. the president declared a public health emergency over the issue and signed congressional legislation into law that increased funding for the epidemic.\n\nhowever, the efforts have had mixed results.\n\ndrug overdose deaths fell slightly in 2018, but there has been a substantial increase in fatal drug overdoses coinciding with the covid-19 pandemic.\n\nimmigration\n\na us border patrol officer stands near artwork installed on the mexican side of the border near tecate, california.\n\ntrump's immigration policies were always going to be central to his presidency, ever since he announced his candidacy and declared that migrants coming into the us from mexico were rapists and criminals.\n\nthe administration rolled out hundreds of executive actions curtailing both legal and illegal immigration to the united states, starting with one of his first actions as president: the travel ban, which has been derided by critics as an attempt to ban muslims from the us.\n\nafter many legal battles, including some instances where the ban was blocked by courts, the supreme court upheld an iteration of the ban in 2018.\n\nsome of the trump administration's restrictive immigration efforts have been blocked by courts, including an attempt to include an immigration question in the census and end the deferred action for childhood arrivals program.\n\nthe trump administration also separated thousands of families at the us-mexico border under the controversial zero-tolerance policy and built hundreds of new barriers on the border. refugee admissions to the us plummeted. and in a pair of white house immigration moves this past spring, the administration suspended much of family-based immigration and a number of guest worker visas through the end of the year, with some exceptions, citing high unemployment caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\non day 1 of his presidency, biden is expected to quickly issue executive actions undoing trump's past immigration orders, reinstating daca and repealing the travel ban. but ultimately, the administration overhauled the us immigration system to largely bar immigrants from the us through successive changes that will be difficult for biden to undo.\n\nthe economy\n\ntraders work on the floor of the new york stock exchange on march 12, 2020.\n\nthough trump has largely leaned on stock market gains, boosted take-home pay and record low unemployment as major highlights of his presidency, his full record on the economy is mixed at best. many those economic achievements dissipated when the coronavirus hit.\n\nnearly 8 million more americans have joined the ranks of the poor since june , according to researchers from the university of chicago and university of notre dame. the poverty rate jumped to 11.7% in november, up from 9.3% in june. that's nearly double the largest annual increase in poverty since the 1960s. the rise in the poverty rate has most dramatically increased among black americans, the research indicates.\n\nand he will have overseen smaller growth in economic output than any of the previous 12 presidents.\n\nthe dow, the s&p 500 and the nasdaq have reached record highs during the trump presidency, even as unemployment increased due to covid-19, but those market gains have largely been driven by low interest rates set by the fed.\n\nand while trump can boast a higher-than-average 3.32% annual gain in real per capita disposable income, that average conceals the extent of those gains that flowed to the affluent, who benefited disproportionately from his tax cuts.\n\ntrade\n\ntrump speaks before signing the usmca on january 29, 2020.\n\ntrump cast himself as a businessman-turned-politician that would not allow the us to be taken advantage of by the rest of the world. that nationalist mindset manifested itself in several ways, but especially on trade -- impacting the cost of goods from around the world and altering the us labor market.\n\ncheese, wine and whiskey. trump exited the trans-pacific partnership during his first month in office. his administration waged a steel and aluminum tariff war against key us trading partners, causing prices of many products made with the metals to rise. his administration also threatened to issue and, sometimes, followed through with tariffs against a range of european products -- including cars\n\nhis administration renegotiated the nafta agreement with canada and mexico, renaming it usmca. the administration also struck a trade agreement with china, but after phase one of the deal was agreed upon earlier this year, relations with china were put on ice, largely due to fallout from the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nthe reasoning behind much of trump's trade moves, he and his allies asserted, was to bring back jobs from overseas. but tacking on tariffs, relaxing economic regulations and lowering taxes could have a limited effect on the repatriation of job opportunities for americans lost to cheaper labor abroad, and foreign direct investment in the us declined significantly during the first two years of trump's tenure.\n\nthe president seemed to acknowledge that his trade war hurt farmers, and that to offset their struggles, he celebrated the implementation of subsidizing tactics that ran counter to the anti-socialist principles he said he believes in.\n\nthe pandemic set off new crises for the industry, including damage to supply chains. farm bankruptcies before and during the pandemic soared.\n\ndespite trump's efforts to repatriate us companies' production to the us, american auto plants closed . and in 2020, major us car companies shifted into survival mode because new car sales entered a steep decline and production halted.\n\nthe judiciary and the justice department\n\ntrump applauds judge amy coney barrett after she was sworn in as a us supreme court associate justice.\n\nof all the president's policy legacies, his judiciary appointments promise to be the most enduring: he successfully appointed hundreds of federal judges and three supreme court justices, ensuring a strong conservative influence for decades.\n\nbut trump's approach to the justice department, a federal agency traditionally understood to work independently from the president, can best be understood by the fact that he has said he sees himself as the country's chief law enforcement officer. still, he's made history as the first us president to be impeached twice.\n\nthroughout his presidency, trump was vocal about his distrust of the justice department and fundamentally misunderstood its mission.\n\nhe refused to accept losing the 2020 presidential election for months, directing a storm of trump campaign lawsuits that largely failed in court and fomenting so much distrust in the democratic process among his supporters that it led to deadly violence at the us capitol.\n\ntrump fired fbi director james comey and publicly railed against his successor, chris wray . he fired attorney general jeff sessions and late last year, his successor, trump loyalist bill barr, resigned less than two months before the end of the presidential term after publicly splitting with the president on several high-profile issues.\n\nand the president essentially adopted a pardoning policy that put his friends, former associates and individuals with connections to the administration before other formal petitioners.\n\nthe trump administration announced in july 2019 that it was reinstating the federal death penalty. thirteen federal death row inmates have been executed in the six months since it has been reinstated.\n\ntrump faced an arguably unprecedented mountain of lawsuits challenging his policies, his business practices and his own personal behavior. many of those legal fights will follow him once he's out of office.\n\neducation\n\ntrump holds up the federal commission on school safety report while betsy devos, u.s. secretary of education, right, listens.\n\ntrump's efforts around education largely revolved around school choice and symbolic efforts appealing to culture war issues.\n\nthe administration had a few small-term successes on school choice, including the increase in annual fund for charter expansion and allowing 529 savings plans to be used for k-12 education. adding to those victories, trump also signed legislation passed in congress that secured historically black colleges and universities with permanent funding.\n\nin the wake of the marjory stoneman douglas high school shooting in florida in 2018, trump established a school safety commission that led to the rescinding of obama-era guidance meant to address racial disparities in how students are disciplined. two years after the shooting, the commission rolled out schoolsafety.gov, a federal clearinghouse of information to help schools. trump and the white house also proposed arming teachers.\n\non another culture war front, the administration also withdrew obama-era protections for transgender students in public schools. and in his final year in office, as black americans protested police brutality in widespread protests, trump issued a salvo against attempts to more accurately portray racism and slavery in school history including creating the 1776 commission to promote patriotic education. but with trump's presidency coming to an end, it's unlikely to have an impact on future us curriculums.\n\nthe bathroom guidance and executive orders can easily be reversed by biden.\n\nenergy and the environment\n\nthe buildings of downtown los angeles are partially obscured at midday on november 5, 2019.\n\ntrump announced in his first year in office that he intended to exit the paris climate agreement. he said during the announcement, which was aimed at curbing climate change, that the accord placed draconian financial burdens on the american people. it's one of many instances of trump exiting an international agreement where he felt the us was treated unfairly.\n\nbiden has said he plans to have the us rejoin the paris climate agreement on his first day in office. the us is about halfway toward achieving the accord's goal to cut emissions, but not on track to meet it, according to the new york times.\n\nbesides trump's decision to pull out of the accord, the trump administration's record on energy and the environment was largely headlined by efforts to roll back a slew of environmental protections in favor of perceived economic opportunity. much like trump reversed many of obama's environmental policy achieved through executive order, biden is expected to do much the same of trump's.\n\nthe republican's administration targeted 50-year-old clean air act protections, carbon emissions caps, methane regulations, energy efficient light bulb requirements, the length of environmental impact studies for infrastructure projects and gas pipelines, animal protections, herbicide limits and limits for auto emissions.\n\nthey've downsized major protected lands and proposed allowing logging in the nation's largest national forest. in trump's final year in office, the administration has pushed forward regulatory changes that would remove penalties for killing birds, loosen water efficiency standards for showerheads, and loosen energy conservation standards for washers and dryers.\n\nthe president has frequently touted that the us has the cleanest air and cleanest water in the world, but the us ranks 16th in air quality in the world and the us ranks 26th in quality of sanitation and drinking water, according to the environmental performance index.\n\nhowever, one analysis shows that after rising sharply in 2018, us greenhouse gas emissions reversed course and dropped an estimated 2.1% in 2019. but that drop is largely due to drops in coal power generation -- an industry the trump administration has attempted to revive.\n\nnational security, defense and foreign affairs\n\nthis photo, released by the iraqi prime minister press office, shows a burning vehicle at the baghdad international airport following the us airstrike that killed gen. qasem soleimani, the head of iran's elite quds force, on january 3.\n\ntrump's defense strategy was headlined by efforts to push the us to exit foreign wars. and his foreign affairs strategy was dominated by his belief that the us was being taken advantage of by other nations, including allies.\n\nhe approached foreign relations much like his businesses, leaning on loyalists outside official diplomatic and military channels to push his most controversial efforts while insisting that he alone had the deal making prowess to deliver wins with dictators such as kim jong un. still, those efforts consistently fell short.\n\ngermany, somalia, afghanistan and iraq. while trump was in office, the united states withdrew troops from syria\n\nthe us and the taliban signed a historic agreement setting into motion the potential full withdrawal of us forces in afghanistan.\n\ntrump increasingly isolated iran, pulling the us out of the iran nuclear deal and ordering the killing of top iranian commander qasem soleimani.\n\nhis administration brokered middle east peace agreements and moved the us embassy in israel to jerusalem.\n\nthe administration also put many of president barack obama's attempts to warm relations with cuba on ice, with the us recently naming the country a state sponsor of terrorism . his administration also targeted nicolas maduro's regime in venezuela.\n\ndespite his repeated calls for the us not to serve as the world's policemen, he also successfully sought increases to military spending. and when trump signed the national defense authorization act into law in 2019, he created the the newest military service and the first new service since the us air force came into being in 1947 -- the united states space force. his administration also repeatedly attempted to slash foreign aid.\n\nhe also went over the heads of military commanders to institute controversial policies, blindsiding the us joint chiefs when he announced via twitter that he would institute a blanket ban prohibiting transgender people from serving in the military. the ban went into effect in 2019, prohibiting transgender people from joining the military. it's likely to be reversed by the biden administration.\n\nanother hallmark of his foreign policy was his approach to russia -- namely, his hesitation to single out russian aggression and, at times, embrace its leader, vladimir putin, against his allies' and advisers' warnings.\n\nhe declined to condemn putin or his government over their role in foreign election interference and spreading misinformation, hacking federal agencies, the poisoning of dissidents, and the reported bounties on the heads of us troops in afghanistan.\n\nhealth care\n\nprotesters hold signs and shout at lawmakers walking out of the us capitol.\n\ntrump's health care efforts were largely motivated by attempting to undo his predecessor's landmark law -- the affordable care act. he also implemented a slew of regulations aimed at appeasing his evangelical base, such as religious freedom objections. in apparent efforts to appeal to seniors and his longtime nationalist focus -- fighting for the us not to get ripped off -- he also pursued policies aimed at price transparency and matching the prescription costs in other countries.\n\nthe trump administration did many things to weaken obamacare -- including cutting the open enrollment period in half to six weeks, slashing the advertising budget by 90% and severely cutting funding for enrollment assistance. also in 2017, the president eliminated federal payments that help reduce deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for low-income participants, prompting insurers to raise premiums to cover the loss of these cost-sharing subsidies.\n\nsign-ups on the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, slipped in the first three years of the trump administration before rising amid the pandemic in 2020. after the president's tumultuous first year in office, premiums edged down for three years straight and the number of participating insurers grew.\n\nmost notably, the administration is supporting a coalition of republican-led attorneys general who are seeking to overturn the landmark health reform law. they argue that congress' reducing the penalty for not having insurance to zero invalidated the individual mandate, and the entire law must fall. the challenge is currently before the supreme court\n\nthe trump administration released a 44-page blueprint of how the president would reduce drug prices in 2018, but few of the measures have taken effect or made a dent in prices. some were blocked by courts, including his recent rule to tie medicare's reimbursement of certain drugs to their cost in other countries and an attempt a few years ago to require drug makers to include list prices in television ads.\n\nthe trump administration also waged a multi-front battle looking to chip away at abortion access throughout the president's tenure.\n\nin 2019, the administration introduced a rule barring federally funded health care providers in the title x family planning program, which provides taxpayer funds to health clinics that offer sexual health services, from referring patients for abortions.\n\ntrump reinstated and expanded the so-called mexico city policy , a ban on funding for foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions, during his tenure.\n\nthe trump administration also reversed a directive which ordered that states cannot bar medicaid funds from going to qualified providers that separately provide abortions, such as planned parenthood\n\ntrump frequently celebrated signing a right to try bill passed by congress into law, which was aimed at helping terminally ill patients access drug treatments that have not been fully approved by the food and drug administration.\n\nthe social safety net\n\npeople wait in their cars for the san antonio food bank to begin distributing food on april 9, 2020.\n\nthe trump administration sought to remove millions of people from public assistance programs over the last four years, but in many cases, these efforts failed to be finalized before the end of the president's tenure or failed to hold up in court.\n\nprior to the pandemic, trump saw poverty decline during his time in office, but as the economic effects of the coronavirus pandemic have continued to ravage the us, hunger and poverty have surged.\n\nin 2019, the us department of agriculture proposed three rules that could strip an estimated 3.7 million people of their food stamp benefits.\n\nlike its efforts with food stamps, the trump administration in 2018 also began allowing states to institute work requirements in their medicaid programs , but federal courts struck down several of the approvals. the supreme court agreed last month to review the issue.\n\nseparately, the centers for medicare and medicaid services recently granted tennessee's request to turn its federal medicaid funding arrangement into a so-called modified block grant. it is the first state to receive such permission to receive a lump sum of federal support in exchange for increased flexibility in administering its medicaid program and an opportunity to share in any savings with the federal government.\n\nthe department of housing and urban development also sought to strip protections for transgender americans seeking housing in federally funded homeless shelters. the department argued that the change would better accommodate religious beliefs of shelter providers, as well as other practical concerns, but it came during the coronavirus pandemic, worrying advocates who feared that it could leave some transgender americans without housing in the middle of a public health crisis. the rule has yet to be finalized and biden will likely seek to keep the existing rule in place.
(cnn) president joe biden is expected to nominate chiquita brooks-lasure to lead the centers for medicare and medicaid services, two sources familiar with the decision told cnn.\n\nbrooks-lasure, whose nomination to be cms administrator would need senate confirmation, was a top official at the agency during the obama administration and worked to implement the 2010 affordable care act. prior to joining the obama administration, she was part of the democratic staff for the house ways and means committee, where she also worked on the landmark health reform law.\n\ncurrently a managing director at manatt health, a professional services firm, brooks-lasure also served as a co-lead of the department of health and human services agency review team during the biden-harris transition period.\n\nbrooks-lasure would be a key player in executing biden's promises to rebuild the affordable care act and strengthen medicaid -- as well as institute a government-run public option and lower medicare's eligibility age to 60, from 65. the $1 trillion agency, the largest within hhs, oversees much of obamacare and the federal exchange, healthcare.gov. in total, more than 145 million americans receive their health coverage through programs the agency administers, including medicare, medicaid, the children's health insurance program (chip) and the affordable care act.\n\nin recent years, brooks-lasure has co-authored reports on expanding coverage through state medicaid buy-in proposals and on advancing health equity. last month, she and her colleagues at manatt published a report on two potential public option models in nevada.\n\nread more
congressional republicans are having a tough enough time getting their own members to agree on repealing obamacare.\n\nnow they have a bunch of governors to deal with.\n\nstate executives are descending on washington this weekend for the annual national governors association meeting and the affordable care act is at the top of the discussion list. governors will debate repealing and replacing the health reform law on saturday, and then they will meet with president trump and congressional lawmakers to talk health care on monday.\n\nit's becoming ever clearer that what happens to obamacare will not be decided solely in washington d.c. thousands of people are attending lawmakers' town halls around the country to defend the affordable care act, while others are demanding their representatives give them a voice in the discussion.\n\nmayors are also jumping into the fray. a bipartisan group of more than 100 mayors sent a letter to congress this week with their wish list, which includes continuing protection for those with pre-existing conditions and maintaining free preventative care. they also oppose turning medicaid into a block grant program, a big part of the gop's plan that would send a fixed amount of funding to the states to cover their low-income residents.\n\nrelated: pew poll: support for obamacare at all-time high\n\ngovernors have a vested interest in obamacare, particularly in medicaid expansion, which has extended coverage to 11 million low-income adults in the 31 states that have accepted it. some 16 of those states are headed by republicans.\n\nall told, states get hundreds of billions of federal dollars each year in medicaid funding to cover a total of more than 70 million people, mainly low-income children, parents, senior citizens and those with disabilities.\n\ncongressional republicans are privately turning to four gop governors -- two from states that expanded and two from states that didn't -- in the hope that they can hammer out a deal that can win approval from their peers and from lawmakers.\n\nrelated: medicaid covers a lot more people than you might think\n\ngetting there will be a two-part task. first, governors need to decide how to handle medicaid expansion, which funneled an extra $99 billion to the states between january 2014 and september 2015, according to the kaiser family foundation.\n\nsome governors have been very vocal about keeping medicaid expansion. ohio governor john kasich says he won't sit silent and watch the program get ripped out.\n\nthat is a very, very bad idea, because we cannot turn our back on the most vulnerable, said kasich, noting the program's importance in treating those with drug addiction and mental health issues.\n\nrelated: hill gop asks governors to help save obamacare repeal\n\nand though he still supports repealing obamacare, new jersey governor chris christie told cnn's jake tapper that he doesn't want those who've gained coverage under medicaid expansion to be left uninsured.\n\nsecond, state executives have to debate the larger question of what to do with the entire medicaid program. republican lawmakers are itching for the opportunity to completely overhaul it and shift more responsibility, control and risk to the states. while governors would like more power over the program, many aren't as keen to receive only a fixed amount of funding from washington d.c.\n\nrelated: why gop governors like medicaid under obamacare. hint: $\n\nsome republican governors agree with their democratic peers that block grants could reduce the effectiveness and reach of the safety net. and leaders of non-expansion states are concerned that funding might be frozen at current levels, which would leave them at a disadvantage since they did not broaden their programs.\n\nstill, a few governors were supportive of block grants, saying the flexibility that comes with this funding can make it easier to transition able-bodied recipients to more independent living. many republican governors would like to be able to charge premiums or institute work requirements for the low-income adults in the program.\n\ngovernors also have to contend with their residents' support of medicaid.\n\na kaiser family foundation survey found that some 84%of those polled say it is either very or somewhat important for any replacement plan to ensure that states that received federal funds to expand medicaid continue to receive those funds. this includes majorities of democrats (95%), independents (84%) and republicans (69%).\n\ntwo-thirds of respondents say they don't support turning medicaid into a grant program. they prefer the status quo, they said.\n\n--cnn's manu raju contributed to this story.
we'll soon learn how the republican health care bill that passed the house last week will impact the number of uninsured and the deficit.\n\nthe congressional budget office said wednesday that it will release an updated estimate of the american health care act early in the week of may 22. the legislation was changed several times after it was introduced, and house lawmakers took the unusual step of voting on it without a fresh cbo score.\n\nthe senate is eagerly awaiting the revised report as it works to repeal and replace obamacare. the chamber is expected to make major changes to the house bill, but needs the cbo score to know how much it will cost.\n\nthe most recent agency review of the house bill found that it would reduce federal deficits by $150 billion between 2017 and 2026. (an earlier cbo score found that the legislation would reduce deficits by $337 billion, but lawmakers then changed several tax and medicaid provisions that eliminated some of the savings.)\n\nrelated: who gets hurt and who gets helped if obamacare gets repealed\n\nhowever, the most damning finding of the cbo report was that 24 million more people would be uninsured in 2026 under the gop bill than under obamacare. an estimated 52 million people under age 65 would be uninsured, compared with 28 million if obamacare remained in place.\n\nsince the last cbo report, house republicans made several changes, including adding more money to the bill to help states and insurers cover high-cost patients and giving states the option to weaken some of the provisions protecting those with pre-existing conditions.

(ap/j. scott applewhite)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthe house democrats' divide over health care will be on full display tuesday, when leaders plan to fulfill their midterm election promise by rolling out comprehensive legislation to strengthen the affordable care act.\n\nthe bill aims to protect people with pre-existing conditions, as well as lower health care costs and reverse the trump administration's moves to weaken obamacare. house speaker nancy pelosi, along with several committee chairs and freshman lawmakers, are set to unveil the legislation at a public event designed to mark the ninth anniversary of the signing of the landmark health care law.\n\nwhat's not in the bill? anything resembling a universal medicare for all plan, a version of which was introduced by reps. pramila jayapal of washington and debbie dingell of michigan last month and has more than 100 co-sponsors.\n\npelosi acknowledged the goal of universal health care in a statement over the weekend, saying: as we mark the 9th anniversary of the affordable care act, we reaffirm our commitment to this fundamental truth: that health care must be a right, not a privilege, for all americans.\n\nbut party leaders continue to slow walk the medicare for all bill through the house. no hearings are scheduled, though the rules and budget committees have said they would hold hearings on the concept of so-called single payer programs, in which the federal government would have an expanded role in health care.\n\njayapal's office didn't immediately return a request for comment.\n\nhouse leaders are taking several steps to lower costs and shore up obamacare, even as the landmark law comes under new legal threat from a lawsuit by republican-led states. on monday, the trump administration dropped its previous support for elements of the law, instead siding with a lower court judge who ruled in december that the entire law should be invalidated in a case that may make its way to the supreme court.\n\ntuesday's house bill calls for increasing subsidies and allowing more middle class americans to qualify. it would also provide additional funding for states to implement publicly-backed reinsurance programs, which reduce premiums by shielding insurance companies from high-cost enrollees.\n\nthe bill would also reverse the trump administration's rules that make it easier for americans to buy short-term policies that don't provide all of the protections required under the affordable care act. consumer advocates are concerned that these plans will draw healthy people out of the exchanges leaving sicker folks in the system – which in turn would drive up premiums.\n\nit would also curtail the administration's efforts to allow states to waive certain protections for those with pre-existing conditions, including weakening the standards for the benefits that insurers must provide, such as prescription drugs and maternity.\n\nand the legislation would restore funding for enrollment assistance and outreach for the affordable care act. the trump administration slashed the budgets for advertising and sign-up aid, which many advocates say prompted fewer people to participate.\n\nthe american people spoke loudly in november for exactly what this bill does, said leslie dach, a former obama administration official and chair of protect our care, an advocacy group seeking to strengthen the affordable care act. it's a giant step forward to providing lower-cost, better care and ending sabotage.

las vegas, nevada (cnn) michael bloomberg 's billions got him onto the debate stage -- but did nothing to spare him from the barrage he faced wednesday night here in las vegas .\n\nin the most fiery and contentious democratic primary debate yet , massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren led a non-stop barrage against the former new york city mayor who was appearing on stage for the first time. she kicked it off by calling him an arrogant billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse faced lesbians.\n\nthen everyone else jumped in.\n\nminnesota sen. amy klobuchar accused bloomberg of hiding behind his tv ads. former vice president joe biden hammered him for opposing obamacare. vermont sen. bernie sanders attacked bloomberg's support for stop-and-frisk policing in his first answer of the night. former south bend, indiana, mayor pete buttigieg called him a billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power.\n\nthe pile-on against bloomberg came three days before the nevada caucuses, as candidates trailing sanders and with nowhere near bloomberg's money are desperate to prove they deserve to remain in the race as it narrows.\n\nhere are six takeaways from the ninth democratic presidential debate:\n\nbloomberg's bad night\n\nbloomberg arrives for the ninth democratic primary debate\n\ndemocratic voters have been laser-focused on electability -- and bloomberg's willingness to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on an advertising campaign had lent him the perception of it in recent weeks, as he's jumped into double digits in national polls. that perception might have been shattered wednesday night.\n\nbloomberg had answers for none of the criticism about his previous support for stop-and-frisk policing, his opposition to obamacare, offensive remarks about women or why he hasn't yet released his tax returns.\n\nhis worst moment came when warren and biden challenged him to release women who alleged sexism and misogynistic behavior by bloomberg and at his company from non-disclosure agreements. warren said those women were being muzzled and that the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against would be a massive liability in a general election.\n\nbut bloomberg didn't address any of their criticisms, and wouldn't budge.\n\nnone of them accuse me of doing anything other than, maybe they didn't like a joke i told, bloomberg said.\n\ni'm simply not going to end these agreements because they were made consensually and they have every right to expect they will stay private, he added.\n\nwarren lights the stage on fire\n\nwarren gestures as she speaks during the ninth democratic primary debate\n\ndesperate for a return to the spotlight after disappointing finishes in iowa and new hampshire, warren installed herself as the leading attacker in the debate's opening minutes. she eviscerated bloomberg's deflection on a question about allegations of misogynistic behavior at his company after he highlighted female executives there and at his philanthropy.\n\ni hope you heard what his defense was: i've been nice to some women, she said. that just doesn't cut it.\n\nand while bloomberg got the worst of it, warren spent the whole night on offense.\n\nin a single, memorable answer, warren lambasted three of her opponents' health care plans. she called buttigieg's proposal a slogan that was thought up by his consultants. klobuchar's, she said, was like a post-it note. and she said sanders' medicare for all plan -- which warren largely backs -- is hurt because his campaign relentlessly attacks everyone who asks a question or tries to fill in details about how to actually make this work.\n\nthe front-runner is largely unscathed\n\nsanders speaks between warren and biden during the democratic presidential primary debate.\n\nfor the first time in this long primary campaign, sanders took the debate stage as its national front-runner. but unlike others who have held that unofficial mantle, and carried the target that comes with it, sanders emerged from the experience mostly unscathed.\n\nthe vermont senator faced familiar lines of attack -- that his democratic socialism makes him unelectable and that his medicare for all plan is unpractical -- but bloomberg's presence altered the dynamics of the debate enough that sanders was able to stick to his message and avoid being dragged into deeper waters by his rivals.\n\nbloomberg also gave sanders a fresh target: a real, live billionaire onstage to hammer when he spoke about income inequality.\n\nmike bloomberg owns more wealth than the bottom 125 million americans, sanders said at one point. that's wrong, that's immoral, that should not be the case when we got a half a million people sleeping out on the streets, when we kids who cannot afford to go to college, when we have 45 million people dealing with student debt.\n\nbuttigieg urges democrats to 'wake up'\n\nbuttigieg speaks during the democratic presidential primary debate\n\nbuttigieg came into the debate focused on denting the front-runner, sanders, while offering himself as a cogent moderate alternative to bloomberg. and in moments, he was able to do that -- calling on sanders to accept some responsibility for the virulent comments his supporters have made online and calling the vermont senator a socialist who thinks that capitalism is the root of all evil.\n\nbut the mayor's debate performance was also defined by attacks leveled against him from across the stage, primarily by klobuchar -- who mockingly quipped she wished everyone was as perfect as you, pete.\n\nbuttigieg's strategy of largely avoiding bloomberg, who drew most of the fire on the debate stage, was clear. but just as apparent was how buttigieg, despite leading the national delegate count after two states have voted, was searching for a moment that propels him forward as the democratic race for president goes national.\n\nwe've got to wake up as a party, buttigieg said. we could wake up two weeks from today, the day after super tuesday, and the only candidates left standing will be bernie sanders and mike bloomberg.\n\nklobuchar doesn't hide her contempt\n\nklobuchar speaks during a democratic presidential primary debate\n\nklobuchar has turned in a series of strong debate performances throughout her presidential run -- usually happy-warrior performances with jokes sprinkled in. but wednesday's was singular for another reason: the contempt she showed for buttigieg and the frustration she has for warren.\n\nklobuchar, at different points throughout the debate, turned to her left to take on buttigieg with a fire that she hadn't previously shown on the debate stage. she accused the former mayor of calling her dumb and suggested that his entire candidacy was based on him memorizing a bunch of talking points.\n\nand when warren hit klobuchar for wanting to work with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, the minnesota senator tersely said, i am willing to work with people and find common ground and that's what we want in a president, elizabeth.\n\nthere is no love lost between buttigieg and klobuchar -- a reality that was clear headed into the debate. and klobuchar showed she believes warren's style of leadership is divisive. but her fiery performance in las vegas was a divergence from the approach that had worked so well for her in new hampshire -- and highlighted how desperately she needs a memorable moment to keep her campaign going as the pace of primaries ramps up.\n\nthe stage is set for a contentious convention\n\nwith such a crowded field, there is a real possibility that democrats will go to their summer convention in milwaukee with none of the candidates having clinched the nomination.\n\nso, what then?\n\nfor five of the six candidates onstage, the answer was to roll the dice, perhaps allow superdelegates in on a second ballot and, as a couple put it, let the process play out. bloomberg, warren, biden, buttigieg and klobuchar all said that a candidate with a plurality of delegates should not automatically be handed the nomination.\n\nsanders, who could very well find himself in that position, was the lone voice of dissent. he said that the campaign with the most delegates, even if it fails to collect an outright majority, should win the nomination.\n\nif what many democrats consider a doomsday scenario occurs, and none of the hopefuls secure enough support to win the nomination on a first ballot, the contest could hinge on the preferences of nearly 800 superdelegates. and that, as anyone who remembers the controversy surrounding their impact in 2016 will recall, could be a recipe for an intra-party meltdown that would make the tough primary of four years ago look like tame.

(photo by william thomas cain/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\narizona republican sen. john mccain wanted to give the big speech he delivered last summer about senate dysfunction before he was diagnosed with brain cancer.\n\nthe senator hadn't been feeling well, and his longtime aide, speechwriter and close friend mark salter was waiting to hear from mccain about test results.\n\nbut when mccain called from arizona, he launched into a conversation about what he wanted to say in his speech, asking salter when he was coming out to work on it. salter had to stop him and ask if he had gotten the results back.\n\nit's not good, not good, salter remembers mccain saying obliquely.\n\nsalter soon learned the grim reality of mccain's cancer diagnosis, rushed to arizona, and the two men finished writing the address on the plane back to washington – just days after the senator's brain surgery. it was a trip his doctors advised against.\n\nbut the dramatic senate floor speech he returned to deliver, after voting against his party's effort to repeal the affordable care act – more commonly referred to as obamacare – became one of the most emotional, memorable events in modern senate history.\n\nas i stand here today – looking a little worse for wear, i'm sure – i have a refreshed appreciation for the protocols and customs of this body, and for the other 99 privileged souls who have been elected to this senate, mccain said, before begging his colleagues to start working across party lines and showing respect for one another again.\n\nrelated: john mccain's maverick moment\n\nthey all stayed in their chairs for his speech, salter recalled. that had never happened in his career, and it meant a great deal to him.\n\nthe final chapter\n\nmccain and salter were already working on their seventh book together, which instantly took a reflective turn.\n\nhe wanted it to be more personal, and to convey just how fortunate he believed he was for being able to serve this country for 60 years, salter told cnn about the book.\n\nwhat america means to him and what he thinks america means to the world, and what he hopes it will continue to mean to the world after he's gone.\n\nmccain in book excerpt: 'this is my last term'\n\nthe result is the restless wave, being released this week.\n\nmccain is not well enough for a book tour, so it is falling to salter – the man behind the scenes with the arizona senator for 30 years – to promote it.\n\nrestless wave is a line from the navy hymn, which perfectly describes the son and grandson of admirals, a former naval aviator who never stops moving.\n\nonly god can restrain john mccain's restlessness, that's for sure, jokes salter.\n\nlieberman for vp\n\nthis new book allows mccain to tie up some loose ends. he publicly admits for the first time that during his 2008 presidential run, his dear friend then-sen. joe lieberman was his first choice for his running mate.\n\nhis aides, among them myself, had persuaded him that it wouldn't be possible, salter explained.\n\nthey told mccain putting a democrat turned independent on a republican presidential ticket would spark a convention revolt.\n\nbut while mccain expresses his preference for lieberman, he is careful not to express any regret for picking then-alaska gov. sarah palin, which multiple close associates say he has never done – even in private.\n\nthe dossier\n\nmccain also explains in detail being approached in 2016 with the now famous dossier about president donald trump.\n\nhe got it, he read it, he put it in his safe, he told no one. he went over to see the fbi director at his earliest convenience and delivered it to him and said, 'i assume you will vet this' and was assured they would, and that they had already known about it, salter said.\n\ni discharged that obligation and i would do it again, writes mccain, in a very mccain-esque sentence. anyone who doesn't like it, can go to hell.\n\ntrump\n\nmccain spent nearly four decades in congress sparring with presidents in both parties.\n\nwhen he first arrived in the house in the early 1980s, he criticized ronald reagan for sending us troops to lebanon (he was later proved right after a marine barracks was bombed). he slammed bill clinton for not doing enough during the bosnian civil war.\n\nbut he makes clear that his concerns about trump are much more fundamental.\n\nthe world is learning to live without our active leadership, wrote mccain. that's not good for the world and it won't be good for us.\n\na chief worry about trump is a lack of interest in standing up for human rights around the world.\n\nthey're very different people salter said dryly. john himself comes from a long military tradition of service for this country. president trump is rather new at that.\n\ndefender of human rights\n\nit is clear mccain wants this book – sure to be his last – to be a guide for standing up for oppressed people around the globe, as he has done for decades.\n\none of many stories he tells is of visiting myanmar, formerly known as burma, in 2012 and meeting three men who had just been released after some 20 years in prison.\n\nthey were emotional when we were introduced. one wept when i started to speak. my disembodied voice had become familiar to him from voice of america and radio free asia broadcasts. they embraced me over and over again and thanked me profusely as if i had saved their lives when all i had done was mention their names every now and then, mccain wrote.\n\nrelated: mccain warns myanmar it risks arab-style uprising\n\nmccain added, we don't always appreciate as we should the value others place on the public statements of american officials.\n\nto be sure, mccain is no ordinary public official. he is not only outspoken on the world stage, he also has moral authority after having been brutally tortured for much of the five and a half years he was held as a prisoner of war in north vietnam.\n\nan entire chapter of his new book is dedicated to arguments against torture, profusely criticizing america's post 9/11 torture tactics, as he did in real time during the george w bush administration.\n\nfor over 30 years, salter has helped mccain convey his essence – writing thousands of words for and with mccain.\n\nwhen asked what he thinks are the most important of all, salter paused, and quoted from one of their books, why courage matters.\n\nwe were born to love, and we were born to have the courage for it. so be brave, the rest is easy, recites salter, getting understandably choked up as he does.\n\ni thought that was the most mccainesque thing he ever said, he added.\n\nlove of literature\n\nhad he not been born john sidney mccain iii, the son and grandson of four-star admirals, mccain has often said, he could have easily studied literature and become a professor rather than join the naval academy.\n\nhis favorite author is ernest hemingway, and his favorite book is for whom the bell tolls. the main reason is because of the protagonist robert jordan's romantic love of country, and fighting for a lost cause just because it was honorable\n\nafter your father and grandfather, who is your biggest hero? salter remembers asking mccain once.\n\nand the first person he named was robert jordan, and i scratched my head. it had been since high school, since i read the book. and when i finally determined who it was i said, 'well you know it's a fictional character.' 'he's as real to me as you are,' is what he told me, 'and he was important to me,' salter said.\n\nso it is no surprise that on the final full page of his final chapter, after talking about how lucky he has been to have known great passions, fight in war and make peace, mccain quotes jordan, his hero.\n\nthe world is a fine place and worth fighting for and i hate very much to leave it.

source: cnn white house moves on from health care failure\n\nkeeping the government running is an obligation – but republicans, especially the president, are eager to dispel the unflattering reviews of their performance on obamacare by moving onto another goal, tax reform.\n\nthe effort is likely to be even more complicated than health care, given the complexity of the tax code and the vested interests it touches that are vitally important to the outside lobby groups that turn the screws on lawmakers.\n\nif you think this is complicated and controversial, wait until we get into tax reform, rep. mario diaz-balart, r-florida, said of the health care process.\n\ntax reform is also going to take time – and is not therefore the kind of issue that is likely to produce a quick win to turn around a white house rough patch.\n\nnuclear over gorsuch?\n\nthe complications of tax reform and funding the government are one reason why the white house is looking for a clean win on the confirmation of gorsuch – a process that could be completed by the end of next week.\n\nyet even this victory will exert a price. if senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is forced by democratic opposition to invoke the nuclear option – changing senate rules to get around a senate filibuster for supreme court nominees – poisoned feelings could linger in the chamber for years.\n\nsuch a step would inflame passions even more in polarized washington and likely leave democrats even more resistant to crossing the aisle and working with trump. already, there was little incentive to support a struggling gop president, given his zeal in repealing the democratic legacy item, obamacare.\n\n01:05 - source: cnn poll: trump approval ratings hit new low\n\nmany democrats are still fuming over what they consider the stolen nomination of president barack obama's supreme court pick merrick garland last year. and trump's low approval rating – 36% in the latest gallup tracking poll and rock bottom reputation among democratic voters, means democrats have little political room to work with trump even if they wanted to.\n\ntrump, however, has reacted to the defeat of health care by predicting that democrats will be willing to work with him down the road, especially if obamacare spirals into decline. ryan, in turn, is using that prospect to warn his own party about the risk of remaining divided.\n\nwhat i am worried about is … that if we don't do this then he will just go work with democrats to try and change obamacare – that's hardly a conservative thing, ryan told cbs's this morning thursday.\n\nrussia isn't going away, either\n\nfrom its first hours, the administration has been hounded by the question of whether trump campaign aides cooperated with an alleged russian effort to influence the presidential election in favor of trump.\n\npressure builds week by week, as revelations emerge over meetings between people in trump's orbit and russian officials – and as the president's aides and former aides get drawn deeper into congressional probes into the affair.\n\nthis week, kushner said he would appear before the committee, after it was revealed he met the head of a russian development bank closely linked to president vladimir putin.\n\nwhile the white house is being accused of trying to knock the house investigation, led by under fire intelligence committee chairman devin nunes, off-track, it faces a greater challenge with a parallel senate probe.\n\nthe republican and democratic leaders of that effort, sens. richard burr and mark warner, appeared together on wednesday to pledge a complete and organized investigation – implicitly drawing a contrast with the chaotic effort that has been rocked by mistrust and partisan wrangling in the house.\n\n01:23 - source: cnn burr on russia: saying it doesn't make it fact\n\nit's important for us at least, and i think for all of us here to remember to not lose sight about what this investigation is about: an outside, foreign adversary effectively sought to hijack our most critical democratic process, the election of a president, warner said on thursday.\n\nwe're here to assure you and more importantly, the american people who are watching and listening, that we will get to the bottom of this.\n\nif those lofty goals are realized, the russia issue could get even more difficult for the white house, as it searches in vain for low-hanging political fruit following a fraught start to the president's tenure.
(cnn) —\n\nperhaps it's the pressure of the last weeks of the annual supreme court session, but the justices seem to suffer a fair number of broken bones as deadline season approaches.\n\nwhen justice ruth bader ginsburg was finishing up her dissenting opinion in a significant 2013 voting rights case – a 37-page protest that first inspired the notorious rbg meme – she was nursing cracked ribs. it was near the end of the term when justice stephen breyer tumbled off his bicycle and in 2011 broke his collarbone and in 2013 shattered his shoulder.\n\nnow, as the court returns to the bench on monday with new rulings and heads into its final weeks, justice sonia sotomayor is in a sling from shoulder surgery. she fell at her home last month.\n\nthe litany of justices going bandaged into june, traditionally the last month of the session, is anecdotal. certainly, justices have taken spills at other times. yet coming in the season that is also rife with retirement speculation, the late-spring pattern offers a reminder of the justices' sometimes precarious health.\n\nthe average age on this nine-member court is 69.\n\neach is appointed for life, and with the court deeply divided, the well-being of a single justice matters. currently, court observers wondering about a retirement have focused on 81-year-old anthony kennedy, who has pondered retirement in the past.\n\nsenate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley on thursday told talk show host hugh hewitt that he hopes if any justice is close to announcing a retirement, it happens soon. grassley noted that the senate, which has the power to confirm or reject a president's nominee, is already looking ahead to the busy midterm elections, where democrats could win control.\n\nso my message to any one of the nine supreme court justices, grassley said: if you're thinking about quitting this year, do it yesterday.\n\nsupreme court justices tend to serve well beyond normal retirement years. justice john paul stevens stepped down in 2010 at age 90 and remains a prolific writer.\n\nthe justices also tend to pick themselves up from health episodes and keep going. the eldest, ginsburg, has survived two bouts of cancer, colorectal in 1999 and pancreatic in 2009.\n\nthe 2013 fall at her washington, dc, home was not her first during the peak decision-writing period. she cracked her ribs in an earlier fall, as the court was resolving the contentious obamacare case in 2012.\n\nbreyer, who will be 80 in august, endured several spring bicycle accidents. the first to make headlines came in 1993 when president bill clinton was considering breyer, along with other us appeals court judges, for a high court vacancy. breyer had been hit by a car, punctured a lung and broke ribs, and was in the hospital when clinton aides interviewed him. breyer was still in a painful recovery when he met the president, who in the end opted for ginsburg in 1993. breyer became his nominee for a 1994 vacancy.\n\nin late may 2011, as the decision-writing season was heating up, breyer fell from his bicycle while riding near his home in cambridge, massachusetts. he broke his right collarbone. in late april 2013 he fell off his bike in washington as he was pedaling near the lincoln memorial. that fall required him to undergo shoulder replacement surgery.\n\nbreyer now exercises in the safer environs of a weight room.\n\nsotomayor, who will turn 64 in june, underwent similar shoulder replacement surgery this month. supreme court spokesperson kathy arberg said in a statement that sotomayor was recovering at home.\n\nsotomayor experienced another health scare earlier this year. in january, paramedics were called to her home after she suffered symptoms of low blood sugar, arberg said. sotomayor has lived with type 1 diabetes since being diagnosed at age eight.\n\ncourt officials sometimes minimize the justices' health problems, and plenty go unreported. and the justices have differed in their responses to public inquires.\n\nin july 2005, as the annual session was ending, reporters tried to find out whether chief justice william rehnquist, who had been fighting thyroid cancer for months, planned to retire. reporters and photographers camped out at his suburban virginia home, monitoring his comings and goings. when a reporter shouted a question about rehnquist's health as he left the house one day, the 80-year-old chief declared, that's for me to know and you to find out.\n\nhe died two months later, on september 3, still in office.

he tweeted.\n\nwhere does the house freedom caucus go from from here?\n\nwhite house chief strategist steve bannon had his own run-in with the freedom caucus, which features many of his fellow like-minded conservatives.\n\ni don't give a shit what you guys think, bannon exclaimed at a thursday night meeting with the caucus, a source familiar with the meeting said. the sense in the room was bannon lost his cool.\n\ntrump, for his part, would agree to concessions to the group without thinking about the impact on moderate republican votes, the same source added.\n\nafter caucus members lobbied the white house, republican leaders added a provision to eliminate an obamacare requirement that health insurers cover services such as maternity care, mental health treatment and prescription drugs. but caucus members still didn't think the revisions went far enough in repealing the law.\n\ntwo sources in the freedom caucus meeting in the white house cabinet room on thursday confirmed that the president, when pressed about some of their policy concerns with the bill, said, forget about the little shit. politico first reported the exchange.\n\nsome members wanted to talk about the policy aspect of the bill, and that wasn't something he wanted to talk about, said a freedom caucus member who was in the room. he wanted to talk about the big picture.\n\ni got the sense that he had delegated a lot of the specifics to white house personnel and/or paul ryan and/or house leadership, and he was going to support whatever they came up with regardless of good or bad, as long as it was some kind of repeal and replacement, said the caucus member, who asked not to be quoted by name in order to talk freely about the private meeting.\n\nduring a caucus meeting thursday night, in which budget director mick mulvaney told lawmakers that the negotiations were over and trump wanted a vote, members gave a series of emotional speeches about the need to stand together and fight.\n\nafter a while, south carolina republican mark sanford got up, according to two sources familiar with the meeting, said he noticed only men had spoken so far, and there had been a lot of testosterone in the room.\n\ni'm here to tell you, sometimes that testosterone can get you in trouble, sanford said.\n\nthe former south carolina governor, who had been mentioned as a possible republican presidential candidate in 2012, was alluding to an extramarital affair that led to his resignation as chairman of the republican governor's association in 2009 and his divorce a year later.\n\nbut his comments underscore some of the criticisms of the bill and of those who negotiated it in the final hours of discussions. democrats, women's groups and liberals pointed out that a meeting between trump and members of the freedom caucus on thursday, a photo of which vice president mike pence posted on twitter, didn't include any women – a fact that plays into criticisms that caucus members sought to repeal the obamacare requirement that insurers provide maternity benefits.\n\nis there something wrong with this white house photo?\n\na senior administration official also told cnn that white house officials underestimated the acrimony inside the caucus.\n\nthe official conceded it was something they should have seen clearly given the house gop's atmospherics over the past seven years, but the white house assumed, wrongly, that because the freedom caucus members represent districts where trump won big, things would be different now.\n\nit wasn't about the policy, the administration source said. it didn't matter what policy we made because they (the freedom caucus) didn't want a deal. we were captives in an internal house caucus fight. the freedom caucus had too much interest in killing this to send a message to speaker ryan: 'you have too much power.'\n\nhowever, the administration official said trump is less likely to pay the caucus much heed going forward.\n\ni think the freedom caucus made a mistake in the end, the official said. this is a president who wanted to work with them, and he is dismissive of them now.\n\ntrump expressed his disappointment with the group, but referred to them as friends after the vote was pulled friday.\n\nthey're friends of mine, he said. i'm disappointed because we could have had it. i'm a little surprised, to be honest with you.\n\non friday, caucus member justin amash, of michigan, argued the group had done nothing more than exercise its authority to improve the legislation – despite dire warnings from the white house and leaders that voting against the bill could hurt the president's agenda and threaten the party's political future.\n\nit's in dictatorships where someone just comes up with a product and that's it, he said. that's the final product. in our system, our constitutional republic, we tried something. it might fail, then we try again.

mcconnell made his promise to get her vote without ever intending to follow through. events conspired against her; mcconnell made the promise, but then just couldn't find a way to schedule the vote. he tried. he really did, but an immigration debate, a guns debate and other things just got in the way.\n\nspecifically, bipartisan agreement that the government should not just turn off its subsidy payments has turned into a fight over abortion. republicans in the house wanted to add language barring federal funding for abortions to plans offered with government help on the private market. democrats want to stick with current language that allows abortion coverage in these private plans, but requires a separate payment for such coverage.\n\nso, even though senate leaders made their promise and trump told collins in a phone call over the weekend he supports what's in her bill, for an unrelated reason – abortion rights – it will now not be in the omnibus spending bill. there's also a very real question over whether the collins proposal would result in stabilizing the market, as the portland press-herald in maine made clear.\n\nthe end result (and the lesson for any lawmaker) is the same, however. collins gave away the valuable thing she had and didn't get what she wanted in return.\n\nshe's not the only one. democrats pledged and promised they would do something to help undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children who signed up for the deferred action for childhood arrivals program.\n\nwhen he created that program, president barack obama promised the government would look out for them. when trump ended the program, democrats (and a lot of republicans) promised to do something to fix the problem.\n\nbut when it became clear that public opinion as turning away from them, democrats gave in, agreed to re-open the government in exchange for a debate later on.\n\nunlike collins, senate minority leader chuck schumer got his debate on immigration. it lasted a week and yielded no legislation, despite some bipartisan proposals. there was an opportunity to add protections for dreamers in the omnibus, too, but they were also left out.\n\nagain, the lesson here is that if you really want something in washington, you're going to have to use up everything you've got in order to get it. and you're going to have to get it in hand before you give away your leverage.\n\nbecause the days of grand bipartisan debates in which lawmakers hash things out on the senate or house floor are something of a myth at the moment.

(cnn) – catorce millones más de estadounidenses se quedarían sin seguro médico para 2018 con el proyecto de ley de salud que impulsan los republicanos. la comparación es frente al denominado obamacare, que sigue funcionando actualmente. y esta cifra aumentaría a 24 millones de personas para 2026. así lo informó este lunes la oficina de presupuesto del congreso (cbo, por sus siglas en inglés), una organización que no pertenece a ningún partido.\n\nel tan esperado resultado puso a los redactores del proyecto y partidarios del proyecto republicano sobre asistencia médica inmediatamente a la defensiva. también es cierto que complicará los esfuerzos que viene haciendo el partido de donald trump para derogar y reemplazar la ley de protección al paciente y cuidado de salud asequible, mejor conocida como obamacare.\n\nel cbo y el comité conjunto de impuestos encontraron que cinco millones menos de personas tendrían cobertura del medicaid en 2018 y otros 14 millones dejarían de inscribirse en el programa para 2026. mientras tanto, seis millones menos de estadounidenses contarían con cobertura en el mercado individual para 2018, pero esa cifra disminuiría a dos millones para 2026. eso se debe, en parte, a que menos empleadores les ofrecerán seguro a sus trabajadores, llevando a que cada vez más personas lleguen al mercado individual.\n\nen total se calcula que 52 millones de personas estarían sin seguro médico para 2026 con el plan del partido republicano, en comparación a los 28 millones que no tendrían asistencia médica bajo la ley de salud actual.\n\nel proyecto de ley republicano, llamado ley de asistencia médica estadounidense, reduciría los déficits federales en 337.000 millones de dólares durante 10 años, añadió la oficina de presupuesto del congreso.\n\npublicidad\n\nesta legislación, presentada el pasado lunes, ha despertado una profunda preocupación en los congresistas republicanos tanto de la cámara de representantes como del senado. y esta intranquilidad tiene un rango bastante amplio de causas.\n\npor ejemplo, los conservadores más importantes del capitolio han argumentado que el proyecto de ley no llegó lo suficientemente lejos. incluso lo han llamado obamacare lite (obamacare ligero). los créditos tributarios reembolsables son uno de los elementos de la propuesta que suscitaron un desprecio feroz, pues para los conservadores republicanos se trata de un programa de beneficios.\n\nlos republicanos moderados también están incómodos. especialmente por el impacto que la propuesta tendrá en la extensión del medicaid. treinta y un estados, incluyendo a los 16 con gobernadores de ese partido, eligieron expandir el medicaid bajo la ley obamacare y han encontrado que es una manera exitosa de que los adultos de bajos recursos estén asegurados y eso no salga muy caro para el gobierno estatal.\n\nel proyecto de ley del partido republicano en la cámara de representantes propone descartar el financiamiento federal mejorado para la expansión de medicaid en 2020 y ajusta todo el programa con el objetivo de que los estados reciban una cantidad fija de dinero por afiliado.\n\nlos republicanos minimizan el informe\n\nantes de que se conociera el resultado del cbo, los republicanos minimizaron su importancia de manera preventiva. algo de lo que estoy seguro que pasará es que el cbo dirá: 'bueno, dios, no tanta gente conseguirá cobertura'. ¿y sabes por qué? porque ese no es el mandato del gobierno, aseguró el presidente de la cámara de representantes, paul ryan, en una conversación con la cadena cbs durante el fin de semana. así que no hay manera de que nosotros podamos competir con, en el papel, un gobierno cuyo mandato es la cobertura, insistió.\n\nmás importante que la predicción del cbo sobre cuántas personas tendrán seguro bajo el nuevo proyecto de ley, añadió ryan, es el objetivo de disminuir el costo de la asistencia médica al aumentar la posibilidad de elección y la competencia.\n\nun asesor de la cámara de representantes lo puso de esta manera: están diciendo que las personas van a perder cobertura, pero en realidad lo que van a tener es la posibilidad de escoger y recalcó que no estamos rompiendo la cobertura.\n\nel portavoz de la casa blanca, sean spicer, incluso fue más allá y cuestionó la exactitud de la oficina de presupuesto del congreso.\n\nsi están mirando al cbo para encontrar exactitud, están buscando en el lugar equivocado, le aseguró spicer a los periodistas la semana pasada. los republicanos que apoyan el proyecto de ley también están destacando que la puntuación del cbo no consideró los efectos de otras reformas de salud que los republicanos esperan promulgar, como la legislación y los actos administrativos que vendrán del secretario de salud tom price.\n\nuna promesa en particular de price podría perseguir muy pronto a los republicanos.\n\ncreo firmemente que nadie estará peor económicamente en el proceso que estamos atravesando», dijo price en el programa «meet the press» de nbc.\n\npor su parte, doug elmendorf, exdirector de la oficina de presupuesto del congreso, dijo en cnn este lunes que la afirmación de price era «absurda».\n\nesta legislación reducirá sustancialmente los subsidios, millones de personas perderán su seguro de salud», dijo elmendorf. «ciertamente la gente estará peor.
return to transcripts main page\n\nnew day\n\ninterview with white house communications director anthony scaramucci; senate passes motion to proceed on health care reform bill. aired 8-8:30a et\n\naired july 26, 2017 - 08:00 et\n\nthis is a rush transcript. this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\n\n\nanthony scaramucci, white house communications director: thanks, chris.\n\n\n\nchris cuomo, cnn anchor: good luck, and i hope you serve the people of this country well.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: i appreciate that, chris. thank you. so go ahead. i heard the introduction so i'm ready for you. go ahead.\n\n\n\ncuomo: that's your job is to be ready. let's talk about what matters. health care -- the president says inaction is not an option. he is banging on members of his own party, most recently senator murkowski from alaska this morning, saying she did her own constituents a disservice. it raises the question, how did she do her constituents a disservice? the bill that is out there right now, these kind of bald replacements, repeal statutes without understanding what the replacement is, the president called that notion mean when it came out of the house. why is he now seeing the resistance by a senator as a failure?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: ok, so let's step back for a second. the reason the president is saying that is it if you lock at the macro-features of what's going on, the republican party for seven-and-a-half years has called for the repeal and replacement of obamacare. moreover, what we know from free market principles is that when you make something a little bit freer and you decentralize it, you get two positive benefits to the consumer and the patient. you get lower cost of delivery and you get better service. that happened in the airline industry, chris. it happened in telecommunications when it was deregulated and made freer.\n\n\n\nand what the president is trying to do is make the health care system freer. however, because it's washington, and there's a lot of webs here in washington that have to be broken up like the cobwebs in your attic, we have to get out there and start with incrementalism. all good entrepreneurs have to start somewhere with a dedicated plan to finish in a great place.\n\n\n\nand so while things may not be perfect right now, whether it's repeal and replace or repeal and delay, you are moving the process towards a freer system where you will get the technological s-curves that you've experienced in silicon valley, you've experienced in our areas of our economy. you have not been able to do that here because of the centralized nature of the way the hospitals and doctors are interacting with the insurance companies.\n\n\n\nand so the president and secretary price and other members of the administration, frankly all the members of the administration, understand that. and what he's saying like a good football coach, let's get off of the same offensive game plan, don't focus on the micro-nature of this today if you're a senator, but focus on the macro long-term effects that this bill is going to have on the society and the positive effects it's going to have on the economy.\n\n\n\nwe don't want to see health care expenses continue to go from maybe it's 18 or 19 percent now, chris, into the mid-20s. that would be disastrous for the economy. we've studied other countries where you can get it down, and we have a plan to get it down. and one of the bad news things about this, it's not going to happen overnight. you can't put something in place and expect it to be the panacea, chris, immediately. but what you can do is, working with the great leadership of the president, is move the process along to get it in a place where the american people will like in the next three, five, and 10 years.\n\n\n\ncuomo: there just seems to be a disconnect between the urgency that the president has in any particular plan. you analogize him to a football coach. i would suggest where are the x's and o's. the president doesn't have his own plan or what he seems to want. we do know that costs are a problem. we do know that the rate of increase of those costs is less since the aca. so we get what the problems are. we get that there is a need for fixes. but we don't get what the plan is to fix them. and now we have the president saying act, act, act, but with no direction on what to do.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: so i want to respectfully disagree with you. a good decentralized management and leadership structure, he would turn to the members of the house and senate who had seven-and-a-half years to come up with a plan, and he would say, ok, what's your plan. and then he would look at the plan and say ok, i now understand why this is so complicated and why we're not going to get everything done overnight just the same way you can't build a building overnight. but let's start the process, chris, let's get the ball rolling towards a patient-centered, freer, decentralized system.\n\n\n\ncuomo: but he's called their --\n\n\n\nscaramucci: those are the x's and o's right there.\n\n\n\ncuomo: he called the plan mean. he said is lacked heart and that you needed to take care of people. he said in his pre presidential life that he believed that everybody needed to be covered by health care.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: we're going to get there, chris. and so we're basically saying this is an evolutionary step toward a greater system, a more efficient system, a more cost effective system.\n\n\n\ncuomo: but how do you know that, anthony, based on what's out there. that's not what the cbo score says.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: let's go back to 1984 when the lobbyists in this community here in washington were trying to block the breakup of at&t, and it was eventually broken up into seven baby bells. it's 32 years later. we've taken data transmission effectively down to zero which led to the rise of the internet. you wouldn't have amazon, facebook, google, all of these wonderful s-curving technologies that have completely benefited not only the united states but the world without breaking up that system.\n\n\n\ncuomo: but anthony there's no correlation or causation between what happened with telecom and what's going on with health care, and even if --\n\n\n\nscaramucci: i have to push back very hard on that.\n\n\n\ncuomo: go ahead.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: there's an absolute correlation because you have to look at it as a macro-economist. i'm a trained economist, right, and i'm here to tell you that when you break things up and decentralize them, they always do better.\n\n\n\ncuomo: but teams of economists --\n\n\n\nscaramucci: we've got to start that incremental step, chris.\n\n\n\ncuomo: right i understand.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: there is a correlation.\n\n\n\ncuomo: but here's the thing. the step is only as good as the details of that step. and what is before the senate right now has been scored and found grossly lacking in terms of securing the promise of the president, which wasn't as simple as repeal and replace but to make it better. how is this better?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: chris, we're going to win so much, chris, you're actually going to get tired of winning. so let's just go over what we did yesterday. we won yesterday. good on entrepreneurial, political entrepreneurship. we win yesterday. now incrementally we're going to win over the in next two weeks once we figure out exactly what's going to be put before the major vote in the senate.\n\n\n\ncuomo: but how is it a win to force senators to vote on a procedure to move forward on a plan they don't understand? how is that a win?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: let me put it this way. suppose they didn't vote for it. then that would obviously have been a loss. you guys would be on the tv this morning saying they couldn't vote for it or they couldn't move it forward.\n\n\n\ncuomo: that's optics. that's optics. leadership would suggest that maybe you go to them and say go work a deal with the democrats. go take it to committee.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: you and you actually grew up in h a very similar neighborhood, so we want things done supido, the italian expression --\n\n\n\ncuomo: that means fast.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: you and i both want that done supido.\n\n\n\ncuomo: no, i want it done right. i want it done right. that's what the american people want is for this to be done in a way that makes it better, not just makes it a political win.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: the way the founders put the system together, you have a lot of disruptive activity inside the system.\n\n\n\ncuomo: but this is disruptive activity. this is a perversion of the normal process for political expedience.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: the way lincoln ended the war and realize how much heat and dissension there was there to do the right thing.\n\n\n\ncuomo: why would you want this to be like the civil war?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: the president wants to do the right thing, chris, he's got to operate inside this byzantine system to do the right thing, and so we're practicing political entrepreneurialism of incrementalism. let's get this done right now. we'll get it passed through the senate, and then we'll do what all good entrepreneurs do. we'll make refinements to the process and the policy and make it better for the american people.\n\n\n\ncuomo: here's the question. the president seemed to suggest that he was going to come in from the outside and do better for people. how is what's happening right now a reflection of that? it was an end-run around the procedure. you now have them voting on things his own party isn't sure about, and the only thing that seems clear is that the republicans want to make good on their promise to destroy obamacare, and they'll see that as a political win with their base. but how is that better for people?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: and again, i mean this with all due respect because you're obviously wicked smart.\n\n\n\ncuomo: we always we know that that phrase does not have anything respectful.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: you're talking like an establishmentarian journalist that's wedded to the establishment the establishmentarian, bureaucratic sclerosis in this city known as washington, d.c.\n\n\n\ncuomo: that sounds like a hollow criticism.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: no, no, no. that's exactly what you're doing.\n\n\n\ncuomo: by suggesting you need to do it the right way and make it better for people? if that's being an establishmentarian i think it's the right place to be.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: you're being an establishmentarian because you're taking about once against the sclerosis and the centralization and the bureaucracy, all of the things that the people of the united states do not like about washington, d.c., and all of the reasons why the president was elected to come down here and try to disrupt it.\n\n\n\nnow, my advice to these people here is give him the air cover, give him the opportunity, and if it you want to blame it on him or blame it on us here at the white house, go ahead, but do the right thing for the american people en masse and the society and the system will get better. if it you stay in the status quo in the lockstep of this establishmentarian, status quo, it will lead to disaster, chris. you know that and i know that. you don't have to be that good at arithmetic to understand that in 2019, 2020, obamacare is imploding. you don't have to be a math genius to see that. so why --\n\n\n\ncuomo: many experts in the field of health care disagree with that sentence and say the greatest threat to obamacare is federal subsidies being pulled by the president. all i'm saying is --\n\n\n\nscaramucci: i couldn't hear you because i was trying to talk over you. go ahead i'll let you talk. go ahead.\n\n\n\ncuomo: i'm saying that experts disagree with the notion that obama care is failing. they see the most imminent threat to it is holding these federal subsides, as the president is done, over the head of insurers, creating uncertainty. but we all know that the aca needs fixing. i'm just saying the president promised better.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: that's a completely contrived opinion. that's like the tobacco company saying that smoking is good for you.\n\n\n\ncuomo: that's like having economists give us an assessment. these are the experts on that subject.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: look at the math, chris. super healthy young people would rather pay the tax penalty than enter the system.\n\n\n\ncuomo: of course they would. they'd rather pay the least. that could tell you that the tax penalty might be not high enough, that the mandate doesn't work well enough.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: chris, that's a free market principle. do you see that? they'd rather pay the least. so why not disrupt and decentralize the system, make it more price competitive, increase competition for the insurance companies, reevaluate the way we're entering the primary care market the way secretary price wants to do it, and trust the process of the free market like in telecom, like in airlines. you will get a better product, better quality service, at a lower price. that's what america has been about.\n\n\n\ncuomo: we have the cbo score. and i'm just saying what came out of the house that they're working off of right now was called mean by this president, and with good reason based on the cbo. the facts matter.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: we're going back to the mean word, which is fine. that shows what the president's compassion and it shows you the president's heart.\n\n\n\ncuomo: and his ability to read, because the cbo score said you would have tens of millions of more people not covered. that's all i'm saying.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: so my message to you and the american people, be patient, have confidence that you've got people here that really understand what they're doing over time. if you're expecting an instant panacea or an instant cure, it's not going to be provided by anybody here in washington. but if you listen to the president, who is a great builder and has a great vision, and you have a three, five, and 10 year period of time to look out at, by the end of the decade we can actually make this dramatically better.\n\n\n\nbut we've got to start now. we've got to start right here. and i tell me fellow republicans get on side. don't fight with the president here. we need your help. it's better for the american people long-term. it's better for your constituents long term. take the incremental political heat today for a better society in the future. that's my message to my fellow republicans.\n\n\n\ncuomo: and they're saying back to you --\n\n\n\nscaramucci: and also my fellow american democrats who would have the courage to cross the line. that's another thing that happens here in washington, nobody crossing the line anymore.\n\n\n\ncuomo: you just created a process with this vote where they can't really cross the line effectively because the amendment structure is all controlled by the republicans. but let's see what they come up with and then we'll test it.\n\n\n\nlet me move on to something else while i have you, anthony.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: yes, go ahead.\n\n\n\ncuomo: what's going on with jeff sessions? you are a man who is known for dealing face-to-face with people and talking straight to people. that's not what's going on here. you've got the president openly bullying one of his earliest supporters. it's upsetting just to his own party. it wound up being a little bit of a distraction to the vote yesterday. you say you don't agree. the how is this the right thing to do by jeff sessions?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: i didn't say i don't agree. i was going to say that everybody's got a personality differences and everybody has different style affects for their personality. one of the things that i like about the president that some people in washington perhaps don't like about the president is the upfront-ness. if he's unhappy with my job and he tweets out about me that he's unhappy with my job and 113 million people hear that, i'm a pretty secure guy. i'm ok with that. i would go and talk to him and say, ok, can i improve this, can i make it better for you?\n\n\n\ncuomo: so you don't think that upfront is coming to anthony and saying, anthony, you're falling down on the job? you think tweeting about it is upfront?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: i think that's pretty upfront. he just happens to be sharing with 113 million people. cuomo: but he's not even talking to jeff sessions? he goes to twitter, one of his earliest supporters?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: jeff sessions is probably one of the 113 million people. but i get the point, and i understand what you're saying. but i'm also saying something, ok?\n\n\n\nyou remember ed koch who was a friend and sometimes not so much of a friend of your dad's. ed koch had a great line. he says hey, i'm not getting the cancer. i'm giving you the cancer. and the point is that the president is very expressive guy, and he is going to let the society know and the people of the united states know how he feels on a day-to-day basis.\n\n\n\ni'm telling my fellow teammates here in the west wing and my fellow friends that happen to be cabinet secretaries, that this is his style, this is his nature. you've got to have a very tough skin to work for and deal with the president.\n\n\n\nbut if he respects your toughness and respects your honestly and your loyalty, somebody said, as you guys were entering this eight-hour segment, that the loyalty for the president is one-sided. that is absolute nonsense. he is a symmetrical loyalist for sure. if you take care of him, he's going to take care of you. i've seen it yesterday. i can't tell you the number of people when i was sitting in the oval office with him that he was calling to thank for voting for the bill and staying onside as fellow republicans and doing the right thing for the united states.\n\n\n\ncuomo: anthony.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: when i hear the nonsense that the president is one-sided loyalty, that's a bunch of nonsense. i've experienced it myself personally.\n\n\n\n[08:15:04] i've experienced it myself personally. my family has experienced it. the american people, in ohio, and the american people in west virginia over the last two days, if it you saw those crowds, chris, you would know how much the president is loved and how much the american people in general want the nonsense to end in washington.\n\n\n\ncuomo: first of all, anthony, the president's generating the nonsense on this. and i don't know how you think it's going to engender loyalty among your team if the message to them is, hey, do right by the president, and if you don't, he's going to out you on twitter before he even talks to you face-to-face.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: we're going --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncuomo: you know fellow senators in your own party -- there's no argument, anthony, because the reality tells a very specific story. people within your own party are saying stop bullying jeff sessions. why are they saying it? scaramucci: chris, chris, chris, the results speak for themselves. you and i are going to want to argue that as managerial style and his communication style --\n\n\n\ncuomo: i don't think it's managerial. i just think it's a character issue.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: but he's worth $10 billion and he started for the presidency on june 16th of 2015 and six months into the presidency. so, we can argue about it, but i think the result and success speak for themselves.\n\n\n\ncuomo: you think that he's going to remove jeff sessions?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: so, watch over -- watch over the next -- watch over the next six to 12 months what we do here in terms of transforming the way people think about government, the way people communicate about government, and think about what we're going to do here in terms of improving the society for all americans with his policies.\n\n\n\ncuomo: we'll take it step by step. do you think he's going to get rid of jeff sessions because he seems to be injuring him in public?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: i don't -- i don't know the answer to that. and so, but what i would suggest to both the -- and again, i don't want to get in the middle of the president and one of his cabinet secretaries, but since the president has said this to 113 million people, i'll say it to your viewership, although the president said your viewership is not so good, but i know it's good, chris. don't get offensive.\n\n\n\ncuomo: it's all right. we don't rely on the president for a rendition of --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nscaramucci: here's what i would say to your viewership and i would say the same thing to both of them if they were standing here together, let's try to communicate.\n\n\n\ncuomo: have they spoken?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: and figure out directionally where we're going. but i would recommend to every cabinet secretary and every teammate that i have here on the west wing, have a tough skin.\n\n\n\ncuomo: have they spoken?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: i don't know the answer.\n\n\n\ncuomo: you don't know the answer or the answer is no they haven't spoken?\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nscaramucci: here's the other thing, i'm not one of those obfuscators where i'll tell you that i don't know the answer and i actually know the answer. i actually don't know the answer.\n\n\n\ncuomo: and so, you don't know what happens going forward on that, let's move to a different issue. the leaks. you got rid of somebody inside the staff. was it because you thought they were a leaker?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: no. i had never met the person personally. i got rid of somebody inside the staff because somebody above my rank had suggested that that person needed to be fired. now here's the problem with this whole thing, and i want to apologize. i'm not going to mention his name on the air, but i want to apologize to the person.\n\n\n\ncuomo: i didn't say his name for a reason either.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: and i understand that, and i did too because we're both compassionate people. i didn't want to fire him as much as we wanted to give him the opportunity to resign, which he did. and i talk to him last night by phone. i said to him, hey, i'm here to help you find another job, because whatever happened right or wrong inside the administration, you've got a long life. i've got a long life and let me help you build your career.\n\n\n\ni also believe in the process of redemption. so, if somebody does something wrong on a job, and then go find another job and try to do that right. i wrote that in my book. so, people are fallible people, myself included. i have a whole phone book of fallibility about myself.\n\n\n\nso, i called him last night and i said to him, the reason you were let go is somebody above my rank, i'm not going to say who, said that you needed to be let go. and you weren't being let go and so, i had to send a managerial message to the people that are working for me and i'm going to do what i say.\n\n\n\nand i also report to somebody, if he asked me to do something i'm actually going to go do it.\n\n\n\ncuomo: two points --\n\n\n\nscaramucci: i'm not a politician, chris. and i'm never going to be a politician. what i'm going to be an entrepreneurial business executive that's going to try to inject some accountability into the system, and what i told the people that work for me in the communications department, i would like the leaks to stop.\n\n\n\nnow all of the cynics around here and the tweets and all these other nonsense saying the leaks are never to going to stop. and i say to those people, you are correct. i know the leaks will never stop, but if i can dial back the leaks in the department that i am representing and the department that i am running, then i will feel that i've accomplished something on behalf of our president.\n\n\n\ncuomo: all right. a couple of questions on this --\n\n\n\nscaramucci: i don't think i can stop the leaks interagency, or there are some senior people in here --\n\n\n\ncuomo: understood.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: -- for unexplicable reasons that are leaking on each other, i would tell my colleagues to stop doing that. it doesn't help the president. it's embarrassing to the institution of the presidency, and it makes you look very small when you're leaking on your colleagues. it's not a good -- that's not good team sports.\n\n\n\nand i also told the guys in the communications department that you will never hear me say, hey, go leak x, y, z, on so and so i want to influence the president's decision about firing the guy.\n\n\n\ncuomo: right, you shouldn't.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: i will never do that. i'll go right to the president and say, this guy is terrible, he's got to be fired.\n\n\n\n[08:20:03] cuomo: a few questions. one, you said somebody above your rank wanted him out. was that the president?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: i didn't answer the question, chris. you see, i'm getting so subtle and surgical in terms of the way i talked --\n\n\n\ncuomo: you're as subtle as a heart attack. you report directly to the president.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: just remember what koch said, i'm going to give you the heart attack, chris. you're not going to give the heart attack.\n\n\n\ncuomo: you want to bring up ed koch, may he rest in peace.\n\n\n\nlet's talk about him. you know what he did? he called you on the phone. and he said, mario, i got a problem with you. or whoever it was i have a problem with you. here it is.\n\n\n\nhe dealt man to man, face-to-face, because he believed people deserved the dignity of that respect and not to hear from someone else or somewhere else how he felt about you.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: look, i mean --\n\n\n\ncuomo: so, this is not an ed koch model. this is something else.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: it's not an ed koch model, but this is a guy that's made $10 billion for himself and his family, and this is a guy that ascended to the american presidency. but since we're talking about ed koch, let's talk about --\n\n\n\ncuomo: doing well and doing it the right way could be very different things in business, anthony.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: hey, chris, let's talk about ed koch. he once said if you believe in nine out of the 12 things that i'm saying, you should vote for me.\n\n\n\ncuomo: then you're doing great.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: and then he said, if you believe 12 out of the 12 things, you need a psychiatrist.\n\n\n\ncuomo: right. look, ed koch --\n\n\n\nscaramucci: that's what i would say to my fellow republicans.\n\n\n\ncuomo: ed koch isn't the president right now.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: we got a plan in place, vote for us.\n\n\n\ncuomo: ed koch isn't the president right now.\n\n\n\ndid the president tell you get rid of this guy, he's one of those leakers?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: i'm not going to answer that question because --\n\n\n\ncuomo: why?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: because you just said i wasn't going answer it.\n\n\n\ncuomo: i know. but what happened to being straight? what happened to i'm not going to obfuscate?\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nscaramucci: i'm straightly, straightly not answering your question.\n\n\n\ncuomo: and you know what that suggests, right?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: you know, what does it suggest?\n\n\n\ncuomo: well, if you don't want to answer the question, it suggests that yes, it was him who told you not to do it, because otherwise, you'd say, no, it wasn't him, because it clarifies it.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: chris, i've already answered it. you're just not really a derivative thinker. i said somebody above my rank, go read the press release, chris.\n\n\n\ncuomo: you're hurting my feelings, anthony.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nscaramucci: you know what's funny about you was when i tease you, you're very upset.\n\n\n\ncuomo: i'm never upset. i've got a big smile on my face.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: when you tease me, i have to stay here and not be upset.\n\n\n\ncuomo: anthony, it's never personal for me except for the fact i have a little bit of affection for you. but it's --\n\n\n\nscaramucci: same here, but let me say this to you, ok? whether it's cnn or any other news organization that is here at the white house, we are open for business. and i believe -- cuomo: good.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: -- in the first amendment, as does the president. and i'm here to tell you that i just would like fair treatment and objective coverage. i always respect you for asking tough questions. but what we really got to do now, let's give the president an opportunity to get his agenda out.\n\n\n\ncuomo: the president has been invited on new day a regular basis. sometimes i look right into the camera and i say to him, you are the best advocate. come on the show and make the case to the people. he's always welcome to be tested.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: and when the time is right, when the time is right and the president wants to do that or doesn't want to that, that will be up to him. what i want to do for all of these news outlets here is create the environment and create an exposure and relax some of the tension and anxiety. we're going to be open for business --\n\n\n\ncuomo: good.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: -- with the cameras this afternoon and let's try to create at least a relationship between ourselves and the fourth estate, where we hold each other accountable.\n\n\n\ncuomo: good.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: -- but you give us the opportunity to explain ourselves to the american people of what we're trying to do to help the country.\n\n\n\ncuomo: you will get just that.\n\n\n\nlet me ask you a couple more questions -- jeff sessions, is it true he's putting together a plan to investigate leakers in the white house and beyond?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: well, i wouldn't say just the white house. he's putting a plan together for the inter-agencies and i want to work very closely with him as the director of communications and i want to work with the other agencies and departments to get our message coordinated amongst ourselves and we want to uproot some of these leakers, because yes, i'm not naive, i know that we're never going to end all the leaking. i didn't suggest that, but i want to put a culture in place where people trust each other.\n\n\n\nhere's why --\n\n\n\ncuomo: isn't that instilling a culture of fear if you're chasing people who leak? i mean, if they're not leaking classified information --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nscaramucci: no, no, no, hold on a second, hold a second. i'm a very upfront guy. i sat in an office with a group of 40 people and said, listen, i will do anything i can to help your careers ant further your opportunities in future, but for right now, we serve one person and his agenda. that's the president of the united states.\n\n\n\nyou are not serving the president's agenda if you're nefariously leaking on people. you're not being loyal to him. they're not being loyal --\n\n\n\ncuomo: but a leak isn't necessarily nefarious. this white house leaks more than most because of a collective insecurity.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: well, ok, so let's talk about that, ok? if you take the psychological equation of insecurity, plus under confidence, i've run two successful businesses. insecurity plus under confidence always equals paranoia and backstabbing. it always does.\n\n\n\nso, what we have to do is go step by step, person to person and figure out if we can fortify their confidence and fortify their security. if we can't do that, we've got to ask them to leave because nefarious leaking is disloyal to the president, is disloyal to the institution of presidency and it's bad for america, chris.\n\n\n\ncuomo: but doesn't that start at the top? the president staying on message, not saying things that are outrageous? not going after his own?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: hold on a second, ok? now, you're talking about two different things, do you want to stay on the leaking or you want to go to the president's --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\n[08:25:00] cuomo: i think there's correlation and causation to the two, but explain it the way you like.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: i don't agree with that at all. i totally disagree with that.\n\n\n\nthe president has a very unique communications style. i would argue people will say i'm being sycophantic, i'm not. i'm just being objective.\n\n\n\nhe's arguably the most media savvy person in history, but certainly of our times. and so, he's hopped right over the mainstream media and use the social media mechanisms like twitter, and facebook and instagram to hit directly to the american people. it's the reason why we spent less money and less staff during the campaign and won the election.\n\n\n\nand so, you got to just look at it for what it is. so, there are vagaries on the bell curve of his media style that some of you guys in the media don't like. and maybe some of the elites in washington really don't like.\n\n\n\ncuomo: ok.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: but if you go down the base, if you look at the statistical base, you'll see that the base and the majority of the american people, certainly all the american people that voted for him either don't care about the tweets, they find them funny. they find them refreshing. they don't overreact and micro --\n\n\n\ncuomo: it's actually not what the surveys show.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: they don't overreact and micro-analyze them the way you guys do.\n\n\n\ncuomo: it's actually not what the survey shows. its shows most people don't think they're appropriate and aren't big fans of him, but he is playing to his base, i'll give you that.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: ok. but you know what? they're still voting for him. he's still the president.\n\n\n\ncuomo: they voted for him. let's see if the same style as a president works as an insurgent candidate.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nscaramucci: last time i checked, he's living in the residence up here.\n\n\n\ncuomo: true.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: and the elites aren't. that's the last time i checked. so, he's doing something right.\n\n\n\ncuomo: i mean, i would say that, you know, what definition of elite donald trump not fit? you know, he's one of the wealthiest people in the country. he's always been on the outside. he'd been working with the insiders in washington since you and i were born.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nscaramucci: that is the --\n\n\n\ncuomo: i just don't know how you call him an outsider and not an elitist when he checks every box.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: you know what? i may bring you on the communications team because you're articulating better than me. isn't that the best thing about him that he's wickedly wealthy and that he's able to, you know, play golf in all these unbelievable golf courses and he's able to have a connection to the elites?\n\n\n\ncuomo: i hope not. i hope not. i hope that how much money he has isn't the best thing about him.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nscaramucci: no, you won't let me finish.\n\n\n\ncuomo: go ahead.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: i'm giving you the whole bandwidth, chris. and then all of that, and he's still able to relate to regular people and regular people are cheering and identifying with him. and he's able to identify systemic problems in the middle class and the lower class despite his wealth. how about that for emotional quotient and intelligence and empathy?\n\n\n\ncuomo: he's got a great ear. he had a great gut during the campaign and now he has the mandate to make those problems that he identified so well better. we'll see how he does.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: we should end the interview right here.\n\n\n\ncuomo: last question now, i only have more and i'll let you go.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: he had a great ear and he had a great gut. and that could be the most positive thing that's been said about the president on cnn in six months.\n\n\n\ncuomo: listen --\n\n\n\nscaramucci: so, being italian, i would actually hug you but i'm in- between you and this camera.\n\n\n\ncuomo: you can give me -- i feel the affection, anthony. that's good enough.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: let's work -- let's build the habit of saying nice things about the president, i'll bring mom (ph).\n\n\n\ncuomo: when due, he gets the praise. he gets what he gives. he gets what he deserves. that is the job of testing power.\n\n\n\nlast question: is the president going to sign the sanctions bill?\n\n\n\nscaramucci: ok. so, there was -- and again, i want to explain this to you. sarah said one thing that he likes most of the elements of that bill. apparently, i said that i didn't know. so, it was a little bit of confusion and one of the new york times reporters called me and i said, look, go with what sarah's saying, it's my second or third day here.\n\n\n\nso, i have to sit down with the president and ask him that and then i have to ask the president, how would you like me to communicate that to the media? so, what i'm going to say to you at this point, i personally don't know. but i don't want people reading into that saying, oh, you know, the communication director said the president's not signing it.\n\n\n\ni think i've got to understand it better. and i would rather tell you with great truth that i'm not up to speed on the issue rather than make something up.\n\n\n\ncuomo: all right. i accept you at your word.\n\n\n\nanthony scaramucci, good luck going forward. you're always welcome on new day to make the case.\n\n\n\nscaramucci: i appreciate it. thank you for letting me be here. thank you. cuomo: all right. be well.\n\n\n\nalisyn?\n\n\n\ncamerota: ok, you've given us a lot to gnaw on there. there's some even new phrases, symmetrical loyalists. i look forward to exploring and defining a lot of stuff to talk about. thank goodness, we have all of our political heavyweights here on our panel are going to weigh in on everything that they've just heard from the white house.\n\n\n\nstay with us. we'll be right back.\n\n\n\ncuomo: he said he wanted to hug me. that's different.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)

(photo by chip somodevilla/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nseeking to show republicans' commitment to protecting those with pre-existing conditions, a group of gop senators led by sen. thom tillis of north carolina is reviving and expanding a bill that would retain at least some of the protections built into obamacare.\n\nthe move is an attempt to address concerns that the popular and ironclad provisions secured by the affordable care act may disappear amid president donald trump's renewed drive to overturn the landmark health reform law. it comes as democrats offer up an array of new proposals for universal, government-backed health coverage.\n\nthe bill's introduction comes less than two weeks after the trump administration said in a federal appeals filing that the entire affordable care act should be struck down, a surprising shift from its earlier position that only key pre-existing conditions protections were unconstitutional. the justice department now says it agrees with a texas federal judge's ruling that invalidated obamacare because congress effectively eliminated penalties for not having insurance.\n\nthe administration's new stance put the gop back on the defensive against claims that it is not committed to making sure that people with complicated medical histories can still get comprehensive insurance. and it placed a spotlight on the fact that the party still has no solid plan to replace law should it fall.\n\ntrump has said republicans would unveil a new health care plan, but senate majority leader mitch mcconnell quickly tamped down any expectations that the chamber would pursue such legislation.\n\nmcconnell has made clear, both privately to trump, and publicly, that he has no plans to take up broad health care reform legislation until after the 2020 election. but he did say he was open to smaller-bore measures related to prescription drug prices – and the tillis bill may become a more palatable gop backstop if the courts do end up striking down obamacare in full.\n\nlike last year's version, the tillis bill doesn't have the votes to move forward in the senate. democrats have dismissed gop health care efforts, which they view as a way to undermine obamacare, and it's an open question whether all republicans in the chamber to support it. fifteen senate republicans co-sponsored a similar tillis measure in the last congress. house democrats, now in control of the chamber, have focused their energy on defending obamacare or more expansive health care overhauls, making it exceedingly unlikely they'd ever consider the bill.\n\ntillis first introduced the legislation shortly after the justice department announced it would not defend obamacare's pre-existing protections in the texas case. the senators marketed that bill as ensuring that those with imperfect health histories would be able to get insurance. it became a talking point for some republicans on the midterm campaign trail.\n\nhowever, experts quickly pointed out that the bill would allow insurers to exclude coverage of the pre-existing conditions and to adjust premiums based on gender, which could increase rates for women, especially those of child-bearing age. obamacare, on the other hand, requires insurers to provide comprehensive policies and bars them from using gender as a factor in rates.\n\na new bill would require insurers to guarantee access for people with pre-existing conditions and prohibit premiums based on health. but, it would allow insurers to exclude any coverage of the pre-existing conditions. a bit of a catch.https://t.co/dgc1dnor0b — larry levitt (@larry_levitt) august 24, 2018\n\nthis year's legislation would bar insurers from excluding such coverage, according to the wall street journal, which first reported the new tillis bill.\n\ntillis is up for re-election next year in a state that has politically swung back and forth between democrats and republicans over the last decade.

the damage to virginia gov. ralph northam's credibility is so beyond repair that some critics say he has to go.\n\nbut here's an uncomfortable truth that photo won't reveal:\n\nsome of the biggest champions for black people in america's past have been white politicians who were racists.\n\nsome of our best friends were racist\n\na pop history quiz:\n\nwho was the white southerner who used the n-word almost like a connoisseur and routinely called a landmark civil rights law the n—– bill.\n\nthat was president lyndon baines johnson, the greatest civil rights champion of any modern-day president.\n\nwho was the white judge who joined the kkk, marched in their parades and spoke at nearly 150 klan meetings in his white-hooded uniform?\n\nthat was supreme court justice hugo black, who incurred the wrath of his fellow southerners when he voted to abolish jim crow segregation in the court's landmark brown v. board of education decision.\n\nand who was the white politician who also used the n-word freely, told racist jokes and said african-americans were biologically inferior to whites?\n\nthat's abraham lincoln, the great emancipator and arguably the nation's greatest president.\n\nthe point of these examples is not to offer a historical loophole for any leader caught being blatantly racist. what happens to northam is ultimately up to the people he serves and to his conscience.\n\nbut what i'm saying is that what matters to some black people – not all, maybe not even most – is not what a white politician did 30 years ago.\n\nit's what he's doing for them today.\n\nwho would pass the racist abstinence pledge?\n\ni'm wary of those commentators who say they speak for an entire race of people. when a white friend sometimes asks what black people think of an issue, i sometimes tell them, i don't know, i missed the weekly meeting for all black people in america.\n\nyet i feel confident in saying this: most are not shocked to hear that a white politician who is a purported ally is accused of doing something racist.\n\nwe expect racism from many white people. even among liberals.\n\nit's buried so deep that many white liberals don't see it, george sachs said in a recent essay, 10 ways white liberals perpetuate racism.\n\nit's automatic and hidden. binding and resistant to change, the psychologist wrote. no matter how well-meaning we are, no matter how open-minded. like the 'root kit' on a computer, racism is hidden and operating without our knowledge.\n\nthat's why we're sometimes able to accept a political leader caught being racist. and i'm not just talking an abstract acceptance of politicians from another era like lincoln or johnson.\n\ni'm talking about contemporary politics.\n\nphoto: paul j. richards/afp/getty images president bill clinton once did something that infuriated so many blacks that some called it racist.\n\npresident bill clinton infuriated plenty of black people in 1992 with his sister souljah moment. the then-arkansas governor was running for president when he compared the rapper sister souljah's angry comments about recent riots in los angeles to david duke, a former grand wizard of the kkk.\n\nbut the black community still largely accepted clinton because they didn't define him by that one remark. he was so beloved at one point that he was called the nation's first black president.\n\nand then there's former vice president joe biden.\n\nremember when he and obama were competing for the democratic nomination for the presidency in 2007? biden called obama articulate and bright and clean, as if that was a rarity for a black leader.\n\nbut obama went on to choose biden as his running mate, and biden is still so popular in the black community that he is considering another run for the presidency.\n\neven obama learned to accept such flaws from a white person who was more than a political ally.\n\nit was his white grandmother.\n\nin the famous race speech he gave in 2008 when his candidacy was threatened by the release of his former pastor's angry condemnation of america, obama invoked her.\n\ni can no more disown him than i can disown my white grandmother, a woman who helped raise me … but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that make me cringe.\n\nif black people only worked with white allies free of any racism, bias or past mistakes, we would be alone.\n\nbefore the yearbook incident, northam won the support of virginia's black community. he forcefully denounced the 2017 white supremacist rally in charlottesville that took the life of a young woman. he successfully pushed for the expansion of obamacare in virginia. former president barack obama campaigned for him. he won almost 90% of the black vote in his successful run for governor in 2017.\n\nthat might help him, or it may not be enough.\n\nwhat matters for some is not one act from a person's life but the entire play. do they push for equality in the end?\n\nwhat matters, too, is how they respond when they're caught in the act. do they try to deny it, rationalize it with lines like, that's not who i am today? or do they own up to their racism, make no excuses and vow to do better?\n\nlbj, the racist civil rights hero\n\npresident lyndon johnson is a prime example of someone who was able to rise above his racism.\n\nin staff meetings, johnson would routinely use the word nigra and negra, according to the author adam serwer in an essay entitled, lyndon johnson was a civil rights hero. but also a racist.\n\nhe shares a painful story from a biography on johnson, when johnson asked his chauffeur if he'd prefer to be called by his name instead of boy or the n-word.\n\nwhen the chauffeur said he preferred to be called by his name, johnson grew angry and told him, no one's gonna call you by your goddamn name. … so no matter what you are called, n—–, you just let it roll off your back like water, and you'll make it.\n\nbut johnson was the same man who smashed jim crow by championing the landmark civil rights bill that formally ended american apartheid, serwer notes.\n\nphoto: national archives/newsmakers president lyndon johnson was both a champion of civil rights and someone who displayed shocking racism.\n\njohnson's passion for civil rights was so heartfelt that the historian doris kearns goodwin tells a remarkable story in a recent book. it took place when johnson confronted a southern senator who was leading the opposition against what would become the 1964 civil rights act.\n\nsen. richard russell told johnson that if he pushed the bill, he would lose the upcoming presidential election, and the democratic party would lose the south forever.\n\ndick, you may be right. but if that's the price i've gotta pay, i'm going to gladly do it, johnson says, according to goodwin's book, leadership: in turbulent times.\n\nno room for redemption\n\nbut could johnson even survive as a leader today?\n\nin the church of the modern-day media, there is no room for redemption. we have a zero-tolerance policy against anyone caught being a racist. they can apologize profusely without any denials or rationalizations, but they will most likely be banished from public life.\n\nand no doubt this policy is good. we can't return to the days when politicians freely used the n-word in public. but i think we lose something when we don't allow any politicians to grow past their mistakes.\n\none of the reasons johnson was such an effective champion for blacks is that he understood the southern mind better than most. he was fighting against the same demons that he grappled with. he knew what buttons to push against the racist politicians who stood in his way.\n\nyet there is not much room for a politician to evolve in today's environment. there is a rage industrial complex that fixates on the latest racial flashpoint: an outrageous video, remark or image that's passed around social media like a viral grenade.\n\nmeanwhile those banal acts of racism that don't get caught in a photo or a tweet go by unremarked.\n\nhere's when i know there's genuine racial progress.\n\nit's not when a white politician is caught being racist and people demand his or her head. it's when people show the same amount of public outrage over the everyday acts of racism – voter suppression, racial profiling, redlining – that define so much of our everyday lives.\n\nnow that would be shocking.

anyone looking for clues as to what president trump might include in his much-promised revamp of his tax reform proposal may have gotten a clue over the weekend.\n\nor not.\n\nin an interview with jesse watters of fox news, trump reiterated his oft-stated desire to cut taxes for everyone -- both businesses and individuals. he also noted that the number of tax brackets would be reduced from seven to three or four.\n\nthat might signal a change from his latest proposal in which he called for just three brackets -- a 12% bracket, a 25% bracket and a 33% bracket -- just as the house republican's tax reform blueprint does.\n\nrelated: how paul ryan and donald trump differ on tax reform\n\ntrump then went on to say, i'd like to see 0[%] if you don't make much, like 0. that's what it's going to be, it's going to be 0 up to a level.\n\nin other words, the first $x you earn would be taxed at 0%. and that 0% is possibly the fourth bracket to which trump alluded.\n\nbut here's the thing: under today's code, the standard deduction effectively serves as a 0% rate, said len burman, a former deputy assistant secretary for tax analysis at treasury.\n\nthat is, your adjusted gross income is automatically reduced by $6,300 if you're single, or by $12,600 if you're married filing jointly. so it removes that amount from your federal taxable income.\n\nboth trump and the house gop blueprint have already proposed greatly increasing the standard deduction. house republicans would nearly double it while trump would go farther -- raising it to $15,000 for singles and $30,000 for married couples.\n\nhaving both (a 0% bracket and a standard deduction) wouldn't make much sense, said roberton williams, a senior fellow at the tax policy center.\n\nso perhaps the president was suggesting that the newest iteration of his tax reform proposal would offer a 0% bracket in place of a bigger standard deduction. or maybe he was merely emphasizing the effect a larger standard deduction would have for those who don't earn much. or maybe he was just hinting that his next plan will do a better job of not increasing taxes for some low- and moderate income parents, who might be hurt by various other changes he called for, such as a repeal of certain exemptions and the head of household status.\n\ntrump also suggested that in his next tax proposal the first rate above 0% might be different than in his latest version. but he wasn't specific on what the final numbers would be.\n\nthen it's going to be 12.5%, 15%, it's going to be 10%. we're working on the different numbers.\n\nrelated: 6 reasons tax reform may not happen this year\n\nit's not clear when the white house will put forth a new proposal.\n\nwhat seems increasingly evident, however, is that tax reform will not be completed this summer as originally promised and possibly not even this year. true tax reform is always harder than it seems. plus, the process of repealing and replacing obamacare is taking longer than expected and will push aside tax reform until lawmakers can come to some agreement.
president-elect donald trump walks from a meeting with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell at the u.s. capitol november 10, 2016 in washington, dc. earlier in the day president-elect trump met with u.s. president barack obama at the white house.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell reached a key senate milestone tuesday, surpassing former sen. robert dole of kansas to become the longest-serving republican leader in the chamber's history.\n\nlawmakers from both praised mcconnell's leadership since 2007, including senate majority whip john cornyn, the second-ranking gop member in the chamber.\n\nwe all know he's whip smart. he is an impressive strategist. he understands the senate better than anyone else here, said cornyn, who praised mcconnell for not seeking out the spotlight and working behind the scenes for the betterment of his party and country.\n\nthat takes a remarkable sense of self-confidence and team spirit that not everybody has, said cornyn, who would like to replace him as gop leader when mcconnell eventually gives up the post, on the senate floor tuesday.\n\nthe milestone elicited kind words even from his democratic counterpart.\n\nit's no secret we disagree on a whole lot of issues, both political and philosophical, but that doesn't mean we can't or don't work together or that i don't admire the qualities that have helped make him the longest serving republican leader, senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york said on the chamber floor.\n\nhe understands his caucus and represents them well, schumer said. he know how to fight and he knows how to cooperate. the job is not an easy one. so it's a testament to his qualities that he has done it longer that anyone in the history of the senate.\n\nmcconnell, who is 76, has been determined and willing to take tough steps to achieve his political and legislative goals. he did that when he boldly blocked merrick garland, president barack obama's choice for the supreme court, and worked to install trump's pick neil gorsuch instead.\n\nhe's also patient and willing to doing the plodding groundwork needed for legislative victories, like the ones he's trying to set up this summer when he canceled the august recess, a step he believes will give voters reasons to keep republicans in control of the senate. they include clearing a backlog of nominations and passing several lower-profile bills that mcconnell says are evidence of good governing.\n\nhe's a terrific leader, said utah republican sen. orrin hatch, an ally of mcconnell's, last week. he's very intelligent. he pays attention to the rules. he's very good at the rules.\n\nmcconnell said last week he wants cornyn, to stay in the republican leadership ranks once term limits force the texan to give up the no. 2 job at the end of the year. cornyn said thursday he will stay and use that position to launch an eventual run for gop leader once mcconnell leaves the post.\n\nmcconnell certainly has his critics even from within his own party. wisconsin republican sen. ron johnson has been one of the few members of the gop conference to publicly challenge him.\n\ni've primarily been a critic of this place, johnson told cnn. i don't envy the (house speaker) or any leader around here. you are literally trying to herd cats.\n\nbut johnson said there is a real level of disgust with some conservatives across the country because the gop-led senate hasn't carried out its promises.\n\nin general, what i hear from the conservative base in wisconsin is, why aren't you guys supporting trump? where's the funding for the wall? but specifically, why didn't you fix obamacare, johnson said. the problem we had – and this wasn't the leader's fault – we had republican senators who didn't honor their promise to repeal it.\n\nfreshman louisiana republican sen. john kennedy expressed frustration that mcconnell hasn't made it possible for there to be more votes on amendments in the senate. but he also praised mcconnell for doing a tough job well.\n\nmcconnell tries to make the mules plow, kennedy said, adding that the kentucky republican is tougher than a two-dollar steak.
president donald trump and his administration are taking steps to lower premiums, increase choice and foster competition in the health insurance market. all of that sounds good -- until one realizes that the changes are coming largely at the expense of millions of americans with pre-existing conditions.\n\nthe administration has issued two proposed rules in recent months that will allow more people to sign up for alternatives to obamacare. but the actions are expected to mainly help younger and healthier consumers, while hurting those with spottier health histories.\n\nthat's because the proposed regulations, combined with congress' elimination of the individual mandate next year, will whittle away at obamacare's sweeping protections for those with pre-existing conditions. this will leave those who are or who have been sick at risk of paying higher premiums, losing their comprehensive coverage or being left without an insurer on the affordable care act exchanges.\n\nthe end result is that you will have two markets, said sabrina corlette, research professor at georgetown university's health policy institute. one that's for young and healthy individuals who don't need a lot of health care, and another that will provide comprehensive coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, but will be much more expensive.\n\nobamacare revolutionized health insurance for people with pre-existing conditions. under the health reform law, insurers could no longer deny coverage to consumers because of their medical history or base premiums on it. also, carriers were required to cover 10 essential health benefits, including maternity care, mental health services and prescription drugs.\n\nthese provisions were among obamacare's most popular reforms, but they were also one of the main reasons why coverage on the individual market became so pricey. that has made these protections a target.\n\nshortly after congress abandoned its attempt to repeal and replace obamacare in late september, trump issued an executive order that he said would give millions of americans more access to affordable coverage. the president's directive laid the foundations for the two proposed rules.\n\nsince congress can't get its act together on healthcare, i will be using the power of the pen to give great healthcare to many people - fast — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) october 10, 2017\n\nthe first one, unveiled in early january, would make it easier for small businesses to band together based on their industry or location and buy coverage through so-called association health plans.\n\nthe proposal would allow association plans to be regulated in the same way as large employer plans. that would free them from having to adhere to all of obamacare's rules, particularly the one requiring insurers to offer comprehensive coverage. so these plans would likely have lower premiums, but also provide fewer benefits -- which could leave sicker and older workers out in the cold. also, the offerings could be less attractive to young women if they don't cover maternity benefits.\n\nrelated: trump officials unveil rule that could chip away at obamacare\n\nthe proposed regulation would also allow associations to base rates on gender and age, which could leave younger men paying less but older workers and women saddled with higher rates. currently, the affordable care act bans basing premiums on gender and limits the amount that can be based on age. however, plans would not be allowed to set premiums based on workers' health status.\n\nif the proposed rule is finalized in coming weeks, premiums for obamacare policies would rise 3.5% to an average of $15,000 a year, largely because healthier enrollees would opt for association plans, according to a new study by avalere health, a consulting firm. those buying the new small business plans would pay $5,300, on average.\n\nthe proposed rule would lead to millions of individuals and small businesses shifting into a new form of coverage, likely reducing their premiums, but leading to higher premiums in the markets they leave behind, said chris sloan, senior manager at avalere.\n\nthe administration's second proposed regulation, which was released last week, will make it easier to obtain coverage through short-term health insurance plans by allowing insurers to sell policies that last just under a year. the proposal would reverse an obama administration decision to limit the duration of short-term health plans to no more than 90 days in order to make them less attractive.\n\nshort-term plans are allowed to exclude those with pre-existing conditions and can base rates on an applicant's medical history. they don't have to offer comprehensive coverage and they can impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits, meaning they may only pay out a set amount -- often $1 million or less -- leaving the policyholder on the hook for the rest. also, they don't have to cap the amount consumers have to pay in deductibles and co-pays every year.\n\nrelated: trump administration unveils alternative to obamacare\n\nconsumers today can find short-term plans that cost as little as 20% of the least expensive obamacare plan, according to the kaiser family foundation. once short-term plans are available, healthy people may turn to them instead of obamacare policies, pushing up the rates for those who remain on the exchanges.\n\ncongress' elimination of the individual mandate could also hurt those with pre-existing conditions, particularly those who don't qualify for federal premium subsidies, health policy experts say. without the mandate, which requires nearly all americans to get coverage or pay a penalty, healthy people will have less incentive to enroll. so premiums for those left on the exchanges are likely to rise.\n\neven more concerning, experts are waiting to see whether insurers want to remain on the exchanges in 2019 if policyholders are older and sicker. for a while last year, it looked like tens of thousands of people could have had no choice of insurer in 2018 as carriers dropped out amid all the uncertainty in washington d.c. however, state officials were able to convince insurers to cover all the so-called bare counties before open enrollment began in november.
alphabet is pouring $375 million into oscar health, a small insurer that thinks it can use big data to revolutionize its industry.\n\nthe investment by google's parent company, announced tuesday, follows its participation in a $165 million infusion earlier this year. that round included investments from verily life sciences, a division of alphabet focused on using technology to prevent, detect and manage disease. google also has invested in the company through its capital g venture capital fund.\n\noscar also announced tuesday that salar kamangar, a longtime google executive and former ceo of youtube, will join its board.\n\nthe health insurer was co-founded in 2012 by joshua kushner, whose brother, jared kushner, is president trump's son-in-law.\n\noscar is one of several startup insurers that hoped to capitalize on the affordable care act and the millions of americans flooding the individual health insurance market. however, the company struggled in its early years as obamacare got off to a rough start.\n\nrelated: cleveland clinic partners with startup oscar to offer insurance in ohio\n\nits outlook has since brightened. oscar expanded into new geographic areas last year and this year, and it plans to enter the medicare advantage business in 2020.\n\noscar declined to comment beyond its statement. an alphabet spokesperson said the company has invested in the insurer over many years and is thrilled to invest further to help oscar in its next phase of growth.\n\nin an interview with wired on monday, oscar co-founder and ceo mario schlosser said the company will invest more heavily in data, which it believes can make health care cheaper and more efficient. it plans to use alphabet's infusion to, among other things, hire more engineers, data scientists, product designers and clinicians.\n\n...pretty much everything that we do internally to manage people's health care was reinvented and rebuilt from a technology perspective. and so that's what we can now go faster toward, schlosser told wired.
leah millis/pool/getty images\n\npresident trump has repeatedly promised to protect those with pre-existing conditions, even as he has sought to kill the affordable care act, which greatly expanded those safeguards.\n\ni've also made an ironclad pledge to american families. we will also protect patients with pre-existing conditions, he said during his state of the union address.\n\nfacts first: trump's claim about protecting those with pre-existing conditions is false. though trump says he would do this, his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the affordable care act — including joining a lawsuit aimed at striking down the law — without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits.\n\nthe affordable care act barred insurers in the individual market from denying people coverage or charging them higher premiums because of their health histories. also, carriers had to provide comprehensive coverage -- offering 10 essential health benefits, including maternity, mental health and prescription drugs.\n\ntrump has worked to undermine the affordable care act from his first day in office, when he issued an executive order directing agencies to interpret its regulations as loosely as possible. he championed congressional republicans' bills in 2017 that would have weakened the law's protections.\n\nand his justice department is siding with a coalition of republican states that are fighting in federal court to invalidate the affordable care act. an appellate panel in december upheld a lower court ruling that found obamacare's individual mandate unconstitutional but sent the case back to the lower court to decide whether the entire law must fall.\n\nthe president has said repeatedly that he would roll out a new health care plan that would protect those with pre-existing conditions, but he has yet to do so. last april, he backed away from pushing for a vote on a replacement plan until after the 2020 election.\n\nmeanwhile, he issued another executive order in late 2017 that would make it easier for americans to buy alternatives to the affordable care act that are cheaper, but offer fewer protections, such as short-term health plans. the law's defenders, however, fear that such plans could siphon off younger and healthier people, which could cause premiums to rise for those left buying policies in the obamacare exchanges.\n\ntrump's administration is also allowing states to make major changes to their obamacare markets, which could also leave low-income, older or sicker residents with few choices and higher costs. few states have taken the federal government up on this offer so far.

i'm doing pretty well, all things considered, clinton said, when kristof asked how she was doing. the past few months, she said, have been filled with long walks in the woods, spending quality time with friends and family, and at times, convincing herself to get out of bed.\n\nthe aftermath of the election was so devastating, she said.\n\nshe reflected on what it has been like to observe the climate that has surrounded her former political opponent: as a person i'm ok. as an american, i'm pretty worried.\n\ni don't take any pleasure in seeing the kind of chaotic functioning, she said.\n\nbut one moment of dysfunction for the republican party was an exception: the gop's failure to take a vote on a bill to repeal and replace obamacare.\n\nyou know, health care is complicated. right? clinton said in a jab at trump. that was somewhat gratifying.\n\nclinton also had sharp words on the situation in syria, where a chemical attack – believed to be perpetrated by bashar al-assad – killed more than 70 people earlier this week.\n\ni really believe that we should have and still should take out (assad's) air fields and prevent him from being able to use them to bomb innocent people and drop sarin gas on them.\n\nthe lingering disappointment among her supporters in the room was clear. comedian samantha bee, who introduced clinton onto the stage, said, it's actually hard to know what to say today. i should be lauding hillary for making time to be here despite her busy schedule as president.\n\nin the immediate aftermath of her loss to trump in november, the two-time presidential candidate largely stayed away from the limelight.\n\nbut in recent weeks, clinton has appeared increasingly willing to speak out in public, even wading into politics.\n\nat a diversity conference hosted by the professional businesswomen of california last week, clinton took on what she said were indignities, sexism and structural barriers that women confront today.\n\none person clinton singled out in that speech: sean spicer. the white house press secretary had had a contentious back-and-forth with american urban radio networks correspondent and cnn political analyst april ryan, culminating in a condescending request for ryan to please stop shaking your head.\n\nshe was patronized and cut off as she tried to ask a question, clinton said of spicer's comment to ryan.\n\ndays after the california appearance, clinton delivered pointed criticism of the trump administration. in remarks at georgetown university, she blasted the president's budget blueprint, which proposed deep domestic spending cuts and reductions in foreign aid.\n\nwhile clinton's closest associates are inclined to reject speculation of the former candidate's interest in pursuing public office again, rumors have continued to swirl nonetheless. local media have floated her name as a possible new york city mayoral candidate.\n\nclinton aides say that she is still mulling over what she would like to do in the coming years, and has been reaching out to friends, donors and other associates to keep the lines of communication open.\n\nasked if she would ever run for office again, clinton said more than once that she is set on finding interesting things to do with her life – without outright rejecting the suggestion of another political campaign.\n\ni am looking at doing interesting things. i don't think that will ever include running for office again, clinton said. i have no plans. i have no plans at all other than trying to find some interesting things to do.

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nhours after unveiling his new medicare for all proposal, sen. bernie sanders said wednesday he would do what it takes – even if it meant busting senate norms – to pass his signature health care policy.\n\nsanders has frequently raised doubts over breaking with lawmaking customs to advance his big-ticket policy agenda, but in a statement to cnn, he said his medicare for all push would not be halted by current filibuster rules, which effectively require 60 votes to advance a bill. he is also floating a path to passage by way of budget reconciliation.\n\nthe two options would only require a simple majority of senators to sign on.\n\nin terms of medicare for all, before we even get to the issue of the filibuster, we need 51 senators who are prepared to do what polls show that rank and file democrats want – and that is a medicare-for-all, single-payer system, sanders said. once we have, and i believe it will be sooner than later, a democratic majority who are prepared to vote for medicare for all in the house and senate, we will pass it.\n\nsanders noted that his medicare for all plan, which was cosponsored by four fellow 2020 democratic presidential rivals, currently has only 15 publicly stated backers in the senate. that has got to change, he said, pushing his liberal colleagues and issuing a warning in the process. in my view, democratic elected officials and candidates should do what grassroots democrats want them to do.\n\nthe goal would not wipe out the filibuster entirely, sanders' office said, but weaken it as part of a broader strategy that would employ unconventional means to deliver on his aggressive agenda.\n\nbernie would support reforming the current filibuster rules to maintain the talking filibuster while eventually allowing legislation like medicare for all to pass with a simple majority, sanders aide josh miller-lewis told cnn.\n\nin his statement, sanders also suggested that he would consider using budget reconciliation – an arcane process employed by senate republicans in their failed attempt to wipe out obamacare – that also allows for some legislation, potentially including medicare for all, to pass with 51 votes.\n\nit is the vice president who determines what is and is not permissible under budget reconciliation, sanders said, suggesting that he would be willing to go over the head of a skeptical senate parliamentarian. i can tell you that a vice president in a bernie sanders administration will determine that medicare for all can pass through the senate under reconciliation and is not in violation of the rules.\n\nexpected to stoke debate on 2020 trail\n\nsanders – an independent who caucuses with the democrats and is again seeking their party's nomination – introduced the revamped proposal in the midst of a charged political moment, as the presidential primary heats up and the trump administration makes a fresh push to topple obamacare in the courts. but even as they circle the wagons around the current law, democrats are eyeing the future – and the prospects of enacting a single-payer system that would fundamentally re-order american life well beyond doctors' offices and emergency rooms.\n\nthe decision to move forward now is also expected to stoke a more pointed debate on the 2020 presidential primary circuit, where top contenders – including sens. kamala harris, elizabeth warren, kirsten gillibrand and cory booker, who all cosponsored the medicare for all bill – are being faced with a high-stakes new question over the role of private insurance companies. sanders, through this legislation, is determined to put the industry out of business. the other four, and a raft more who do not support the bill, have all said the private insurers are either inescapable or, as many moderates argue, vital cogs in america's health care system.\n\nat a wednesday morning event on capitol hill, sanders cast the movement supporting the legislation in historical terms.\n\nwe are involved in a great struggle not unlike, to be honest with you, the struggles of the labor movement, the struggles of the civil rights movement, the struggles of the women's movement, the struggles of the gay community, the struggles of the environmental movement, sanders said. this is what we're about.\n\nasked earlier if sanders is priming for a showdown with his 2020 opponents, including the bill's candidate-cosponsors, campaign manager faiz shakir laid down a marker.\n\nwhether it's a fight that he's going to have with them is up to them, shakir said. this is a core pillar of why (sanders) is running for president, a core pillar of what he would do as president. it's up to other people to determine for themselves whether and how much, how core it is for them. i will let other people decide for themselves how they'll go about it.\n\nmuch like sanders has on the stump, shakir predicted a sharp and expensive fight with private insurance interests to come.\n\nyou aren't going to upend that system easily, he said. so there's going to be a bunch of lobbying groups out there (spending) hundreds of millions of dollars and you can be damn sure that they're going to decide that an advertising campaign against bernie sanders is a worthwhile expenditure for them – rather than providing health care coverage for people.\n\nat the wednesday rally in washington, gillibrand, the only cosponsor in attendance, said that universal, government-guaranteed coverage needs to become the next social safety net, to become something that is there for you no matter what.\n\nthe new york senator, who has supported single-payer for more than a decade and wrote the sanders legislation's four-year transition plan, said the path to building support for the bill could be greased by allowing americans to first buy-in to a government-run public option – a move, she argued, that would ultimately wipe out the private insurance industry.\n\ni dare any insurance company to just try to compete. they won't, gillibrand said. the insurance industry wants to make money. they are a for-profit industry. their goals are not aligned with ours.\n\nbooker, who was not at the rally, also discussed the bill – and the roadblocks facing it in congress – during a new york radio interview.\n\ni think the best way to do (reach full coverage) would be to design a medicare for all system, he said. but anybody who says those words, 'medicare for all,' who's running for president, the next thing out of their mouth should be talking to people about, in a split congress, what are you going to actually do in your first year to make healthcare more accessible and affordable?\n\nhe has not discussed in detail his plan for moving it through a senate in which democrats lack that 60-vote supermajority. in a divided congress, the legislation would likely be dead on arrival.\n\nsoon after sanders' announcement, white house press secretary sarah sanders offered another preview of the pushback awaiting democratic candidates who back medicare for all.\n\ndemocrats just announced their government takeover of healthcare plan, she tweeted, claiming the plan confiscates every american's private health insurance.\n\nwould effectively eliminate private insurance\n\nin addition to sanders, gillibrand and the other three presidential hopefuls, the bill's cosponsors also include sens. tammy baldwin, richard blumenthal, patrick leahy, mazie hirono, ed markey, jeff merkley, brian schatz, tom udall, sheldon whitehouse and martin heinrich. a number of them, like the five candidates, have also signed on to less radical bills, some of which would create a medicare buy-in system or expand previously existing programs.\n\nthe 2019 legislation would go further than sanders' previous plans by covering more long-term care services, bringing it closer in line with a broader house version sponsored by washington democratic rep. pramila jayapal. nursing home and other institutional coverage would still fall to medicaid under the new bill, as it had before, while long-term care at home and in the community would be expanded.\n\napart from its new measures to cover long-term care, much of sanders' proposal remains the same as what he introduced in 2017. he wants to create a federal universal health insurance program that would cover medically necessary services, prescription drugs, dental and vision services. premiums, deductibles and co-pays would disappear, except for a potential $200 co-pay for brand-name drugs.\n\nthough many of his rivals have said they would maintain a role for private insurance, sanders' bill would effectively eliminate the industry. insurers would only be allowed to provide services not covered by the universal plan, such as cosmetic surgery.\n\nas for how to foot the bill, sanders describes a litany of ways americans are already spending billions on health care, particularly because of high administrative costs, executive pay packages and prescription drug prices. he maintains that medicare for all, despite its cost, would save many people money.\n\nthe new legislation also lists several ways to raise additional funds, including levying premiums on workers and employers; boosting income and estate tax rates; and establishing a wealth tax.\n\nthe decision to extend coverage for home- and community-based long-term care was predicated on a need to help the elderly and the disabled, while extending care to rural communities, shakir told cnn.\n\nit's a really critical part of whether you're going to be able to sustain life (among the elderly), he said. home care means so much to the disability community because it is literally liberty and freedom to be able to still run their own lives and not be committed to institutions or have to travel far distances to get basic care.\n\ncnn's rebecca buck contributed to this report.
(cnn) democratic presidential candidate mike bloomberg strongly suggested on wednesday at his cnn presidential town hall he had supported barack obama in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential election.\n\nbloomberg made the comments in response to a question from cnn's anderson cooper about why democratic voters should trust bloomberg, who only rejoined the party in 2018 after tenures as both a republican and independent.\n\nbloomberg misleadingly cited comments he made in support of healthcare reform in march 2009 to show he supported obamacare, a bill he later harshly criticized.\n\nif you want to know my democratic credentials, i spoke for hillary clinton at the dnc convention in philadelphia in 2016, bloomberg said. i certainly supported barack obama and joe biden. he says 'no,' but i was there both times for them, thank you very much. i campaigned among the conference of mayors for the affordable care act, obamacare.\n\nbloomberg also tweeted a video of his answer on wednesday, if you want my democratic credentials here they are.\n\nfacts first: bloomberg supported obama in 2012, not 2008. at a private event in 2016 he called his 2012 endorsement backhanded, saying he thought romney could have done a better job as president. during his speech at the democratic national committee in 2016, bloomberg four times said he was there as an independent, and not there to endorse the party's platform. bloomberg did make comments in support of healthcare reform in 2009, but he later sharply criticized obamacare, calling the final bill a disgrace.\n\nbloomberg's campaign claims him being there for obama was defending obama once from false claims he was a muslim, but his comments at his town hall didn't make this clear.\n\nhere are the facts:\n\nbloomberg did support president barack obama in 2012, writing an endorsement for him on bloomberg view's website in 2012 . but in private remarks allegedly from a closed goldman sachs event at yankee stadium in 2016, bloomberg downplayed the endorsement calling it backhanded.\n\nthe second obama election i wrote a very backhanded endorsement of obama, bloomberg said. saying i thought he hadn't done the right thing, hadn't done, hadn't been good at things that i think are important and romney would be a better person at doing that. but romney did not stick with the values that he had when he was governor of massachusetts.\n\nhe added he did not support obama in 2008.\n\njohn mccain campaigned for me on the streets of brooklyn back in 2001, bloomberg said. i don't know who set it up, but he did. and i wasn't going to go against him, but i quite honestly, i would've never voted for him because of sarah palin on the ticket. so i stayed out of that election.\n\nbloomberg's campaign spokesman stu loeser, did not dispute that bloomberg did not support obama in the 2008 election. instead, loeser cited remarks that bloomberg made in 2008 where he said that rumors obama was a muslim were lies. the comments came at during a fight over delegates between clinton and obama.\n\nto be clear, we are not saying that mike helped obama win, but he did support senator obama in florida when the clinton campaign was still fighting him, loeser emailed cnn.\n\nbloomberg's past comments on the affordable care act were covered in a kfile article earlier this month.\n\nbloomberg did speak in favor of health care reform in march 2009 , as he mentioned at the town hall.\n\nbut in comments made months after obamacare was passed in april 2010, bloomberg said the bill would do absolutely nothing to fix the big health care problems and also called the program a disgrace. he added it was another program that's going to cost a lot more money.\n\nit was just one of several comments from bloomberg identified by cnn's kfile criticizing the landmark affordable care act in the years following its passage, including saying the bill was really dysfunctional and did nothing to solve rising health care costs.\n\nbloomberg has now fully embraced the affordable care act, even proposing an additional medicare-like public option that builds on the law.\n\nand while bloomberg did speak at the democratic national convention for clinton, here's what he said in his opening remarks.\n\ni'm not here as a member of any party, or to endorse any party platform, he said. i am here for one reason, and one reason only: to explain why i believe it is my imperative that we elect hillary clinton as the next president of the united states. and to ask you to join with me in supporting her this november.'

progress)\n\n\n\n[22:00:00] chris cuomo, cnn host: thank you for watching. cnn tonight with d. lemon starts right now. there is a lot of news to unpack.\n\n\n\ndon lemon, cnn host: what a week. this is like maybe two weeks in one day with everything that came out today, don't you think?\n\n\n\ncuomo: i know. i looked younger at the beginning of this week.\n\n\n\nlemon: you don't really want me to go there.\n\n\n\ncuomo: you can't bring yourself to say something nice, can you? you're still upset about the handshake thing, aren't you?\n\n\n\nlemon: what handshake? no, no, no, no.\n\n\n\ncuomo: that's how long the week has been.\n\n\n\nlemon: i know that i'm right. i just didn't want to -- i just didn't -- look, i didn't want to get too heavy about performative grace, right? taking, putting the onus on the victim to be cordial to the oppressor or the abuser. that was my bigger point. it is not incumbent upon the obamas to be cordial to the people who have oppressed them over racism.\n\n\n\ncuomo: it's true, but boy does it say a lot about them that they were.\n\n\n\nlemon: it does. it says a lot about them but i'm just saying -- listen, it says a lot about them because they are in a position of power and privilege because michelle obama can go out and again, this is -- can go out and sell a million books in one week.\n\n\n\ncuomo: yes.\n\n\n\nlemon: the average person who is the victim of racism the way the obamas were and other-ism the way the obamas were cannot do it. they are dying in their own communities. they're being discriminated against. they're not getting jobs. so, in the same way that you would expect a woman who may be a victim\n\n\n\nof the me too movement, and i'm not talking about, you know, abuse, physical abuse, that's another level, but someone who may be in their workplace, you wouldn't expect her to be cordial to the person who perpetrated it. so why do you expect the obamas should -- they didn't have to. they did. -- should be cordial to someone who abused them in that way.\n\n\n\ncuomo: your analysis is spot-on.\n\n\n\nlemon: yes.\n\n\n\ncuomo: and the only thing i ever added on it which is the right thing to add on, is that obama acts a certain way in deference to the fact he is president of the united states.\n\n\n\nlemon: right.\n\n\n\ncuomo: and he treats trump in a way because of the office that he holds.\n\n\n\nlemon: yes.\n\n\n\ncuomo: and he put that above himself and that shows his selfishness that we don't see in the current president. let me ask you this.\n\n\n\nlemon: wait, wait, wait. before you go on, why would you for an office, for something that is inanimate, why for an office for a person who has denigrated the office invited someone in who said the m.f. the person who's done the same -- the things about. you know, this president, another president who was accused of having an affair in the office? why do we put so much, you know, clout into, everyone has held this office to a certain standard? no.\n\n\n\nuntil people are outraged by that treatment, until you stop -- because you take them -- they're off the hook for their behavior, and it allows them to continue without any ramifications.\n\n\n\nso, if you tell someone you are not going to treat me that way. i do not have to accept it. i don't care about an inanimate office or something some --some notion that you have about what this office is when you're not treating -- i don't really -- i don't really understand that, and i don't buy that argument. i just -- i just don't.\n\n\n\ncuomo: i get it.\n\n\n\nlemon: it's a false argument.\n\n\n\ncuomo: i do.\n\n\n\nlemon: yes.\n\n\n\ncuomo: i believe in the presidency. i believe in the respect for it. but maybe it's because i went to military school. and you know, there were a lot of guys i hated who were superior officers of mine, but i had to respect the rank--\n\n\n\nlemon: well.\n\n\n\ncuomo: -- because that was the formation of the layers of respect and efficiency of the organization.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nlemon: it's not the same thing. it's not the same thing, chris.\n\n\n\ncuomo: but the presidency of the united states, you have to respect it because it has so much power and so much influence in our government.\n\n\n\nlemon: yes.\n\n\n\ncuomo: and if you don't respect it--\n\n\n\nlemon: you do.\n\n\n\ncuomo: -- if you debase it even the way the individual who occupies it does.\n\n\n\nlemon: they're not in the oval office, chris. that's not disrespecting the office. disrespecting the office is what this president does on a daily basis. it is not trying to make someone who has abused you, to make them comfortable.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncuomo: i totally get. what i'm saying is--\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nlemon: and so, that's it. and i think it's easy for you to be able to sit there and say that because maybe this president only offends your sensibilities. he hasn't offended you as a person who is lgbtq.\n\n\n\ncuomo: true.\n\n\n\nlemon: he hasn't offended you as a person who happens to be a person of color.\n\n\n\ncuomo: true.\n\n\n\nlemon: he hasn't offended you as an immigrant in this country. he offends your sensibilities.\n\n\n\ncuomo: true.\n\n\n\nlemon: but for you, you can sit there and say that because this whole idea about an office, that doesn't matter when people are in real-life danger every way -- every day. and so, again, the obamas, i commend what they did. i absolutely do. but the average person does not have--\n\n\n\n(crosstalk) cuomo: would not have to do that--\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nlemon: -- they couldn't do that.\n\n\n\ncuomo: i totally get it. i totally get it.\n\n\n\nlemon: yes.\n\n\n\ncuomo: i'm just saying they were at george h.w. bush's funeral.\n\n\n\nlemon: right.\n\n\n\ncuomo: and to make it about something like that, to make it about something else other than that was also another layer of the assessment of where respect was supposed to be accorded. i want to ask you about something else. it's your show.\n\n\n\nlemon: yes. by the way, before you go, if they had not done it, that's what the story would have been about.\n\n\n\ncuomo: yes.\n\n\n\nlemon: so, they know it. obviously, they had talked about it. so i think they made the right decision. but that was -- that was just right.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncuomo: you never give people who do you wrong--\n\n\n\nlemon: right.\n\n\n\ncuomo: -- something to hold over you when they're supposed to be beneath you.\n\n\n\nlemon: right. go on. so, what do you want to know?\n\n\n\ncuomo: how surprised were you by how tough the southern district was on michael cohen today?\n\n\n\n[22:04:56] lemon: i was very surprised because i thought when they said that he was -- and i think they wrote a letter, something of the sort, when they said that the information that he gave was so significant, that they recommended, you know, no prison time or what have you. that was for--\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncuomo: the special counsel.\n\n\n\nlemon: yes. that was for flynn. but was it for -- yes, for flynn. i get them all confused, there's so many. but i thought that because they recommended that, you know -- because they said that he had helped them out, they wouldn't give him a lot of prison time or wouldn't recommend a lot of prison time. i was actually surprised by that.\n\n\n\ncuomo: yes. the special counsel. it's interesting because it showed us that while i've always assumed that the special counsel and the southern district are going to be on the same page all the way down the line, they're not.\n\n\n\nlemon: they're not.\n\n\n\ncuomo: the special counsel said cohen has been helpful to them. they want whatever sentence he gets for his crime of lying before the congress to be concurrent, which means it runs at the same time so he doesn't get extra time. and they were a little lukewarm about not taking a position on his sentence the way they did in flynn. but the special -- the southern district threw the book at him.\n\n\n\nlemon: well, and we should know that the southern district is not playing, and that's where -- you know, we may think that mueller holds the cards. maybe it's the southern district. maybe there was a strategy in handing the cohen thing off because then there are no pardons. people can be prosecuted in ways that they can't be federally. so, i would pay close attention to what happens in the southern district.\n\n\n\ncuomo: true. but southern district is still federal, so he could pardon him for it. if they were state charges brought up by the state of new york--\n\n\n\nlemon: yes.\n\n\n\ncuomo: -- the president wouldn't be able to pardon. and even if he does pardon somebody, someone is leaving out in the analysis, you can't self-pardon.\n\n\n\nlemon: yes.\n\n\n\ncuomo: you can't pardon somebody to help you in an overt quid pro quo on an understood one. it's not as simple as some people may think.\n\n\n\nlemon: well, i got to go because, you know, we got a lot of show.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncuomo: all right, my friend.\n\n\n\nlemon: but let me just say i think you were right when you were talking about the president. listen, i think people who think this president is going to go to jail, they're going to realize, like, i'm not going to talk about santa claus. you know what i mean. maybe they're not going to get everything on their christmas wish list. let's put it that way.\n\n\n\ncuomo: i don't think they will.\n\n\n\nlemon: yes.\n\n\n\ncuomo: but i do just by getting to be with you, my brother. i love you, and i wish you a very good weekend.\n\n\n\nlemon: have a good weekend. i'll see you on monday.\n\n\n\nthis is cnn tonight. i'm don lemon.\n\n\n\nmaybe it's the cover-up and the crime all at the same time. at the end of a week of bad news and worse news for this president, the walls are really closing in tonight on one of the biggest days so far in this mueller investigation with one huge development after another rocking the white house.\n\n\n\nbut what may be the most stunning of all comes from the sdny, the southern district of new york, in its sentencing memo for former trump fixer and keeper of secrets, michael cohen. ok? so please listen to this. this is from page 13. it's referring to the schemes to pay hush money to stormy daniels and karen mcdougal, and here's a quote that i have here.\n\n\n\nin particular, and as cohen himself has now admitted with respect to both payments, he acted in coordination with, and at the direction of individual one. you know who individual one is? donald trump. prosecutors say those payments were meant to influence the campaign, which is a violation of campaign finance law. that's a felony. listen to what former acting solicitor general neal katyal said just said to chris.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nneal katyal, former acting solicitor general: tonight, the southern district of new york prosecutors, career prosecutors, and trump's own justice department said, you know, in no uncertain terms, cohen, you committed a felony, and the man who directed you to commit that felony is donald j. trump.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nlemon: it is impossible to overstate how important that is. here's the question. now the question is what are they going to do about it? what are they going to do about it? and there's more.\n\n\n\nin cohen's sentencing memorandum from robert mueller, the special counsel makes it clear that his interest in the trump tower moscow project is not just about cohen's lies. it's about russia's influence in our presidential election.\n\n\n\nanother quote for you. the fact that cohen continued to work on the project and discuss it with individual one, remember individual one is the president, well into the campaign was material to the ongoing congressional and sco, special counsel's office, investigations, particularly because it occurred at a time of sustained efforts by the russian government to interfere with the u.s. presidential election.\n\n\n\nand then there's today's heavily redacted manafort filing. mueller's office says that paul manafort testified to a federal grand jury twice in the past six weeks. twice, which suggests prosecutors were using manafort to build a criminal case against someone else. and then there's this from page nine of the filing.\n\n\n\n[22:09:52] quote, the evidence demonstrates that manafort had contacts with administration officials. manafort said in february 2018 that he had been in communication with a senior administration official up through february 2018, which raises a very significant question.\n\n\n\nwhy is paul manafort talking to people in the white house as recently as this year? but that's not the only thing we learned about the mueller investigation today.\n\n\n\nsources telling cnn that white house chief of staff john kelly has been interviewed by mueller's team. the questions centering on kelly's recollection of the president's reaction to reporting about how he had tried to fire mueller.\n\n\n\nnow sources say kelly, who is widely believed to have one foot out the door, is not on speaking terms with his boss. you know who else doesn't appear to be on speaking terms with his former boss? the ex- secretary of state, rex tillerson.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nrex tillerson, former united states secretary of state: it's challenging for me coming from the disciplined, highly process- oriented exxonmobil corporation to go to work for a man who is pretty undisciplined, doesn't like to read, doesn't read briefing reports, doesn't like to get into the details of a lot of things, but rather just kind of says, look, this is what i believe.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nlemon: and there's more.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\ntillerson: the president would say, well, here's what i want to do, and here's how i want to do it. and i'd have to say to him, well, mr. president, i understand what you want to do, but you can't do it that way. it violates the law.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nlemon: don't forget, the president certainly hasn't -- tillerson privately called him a moron. the president tweeting of course, tweeting, an attack on tillerson, calling him dumb as a rock, lazy as hell. remember the president saying that he'd hire all the best people?\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\ndonald trump, president of the united states: we're going to make america great again. we're going to use our best people.\n\n\n\ni'm going to get the best people. we're going to deliver. we're going to get the best people in the world. (end video clip)\n\n\n\nlemon: i wonder what like the worst people would be. i mean, can you imagine? what are the worst people? these are the best people.\n\n\n\nthe president hired rex tillerson, the man he now calls dumb as a rock and lazy as hell. he hired john kelly, the man who won't even speak to him now. he hired paul manafort to run his campaign at the most crucial moment when he won the nomination.\n\n\n\nhe hired michael flynn, his former national security adviser, who pleaded guilty to lying to the fbi about his contacts with the russian ambassador. he hired michael cohen who pleaded guilty to making false statements to congress in his testimony about the russia investigation.\n\n\n\ndo you want me to go on? or, i mean, there are so -- i mean, i only have two hours tonight if there isn't more breaking news by the end of this. on and on and on. that tells you a lot about donald trump's judgment about people.\n\n\n\nand here is something else, something else that calls his judgment into question. remember what he said after the deadly violence in charlottesville?\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\ntrump: you also had people that were very fine people on both sides. you had people in that group -- excuse me. excuse me. i saw the same pictures as you did.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nlemon: look at me. very fine people on both sides. very fine people on both sides. one of those very fine people was found guilty today of first-degree murder in the death of heather heyer.\n\n\n\nso, when this president talks about very fine people, all the best people, think about that. lots to talk about on our big stories tonight. the revelations from sentencing memos tonight for michael cohen and paul manafort.\n\n\n\nmr. shimon prokupecz is here as well as ms. sara murray. good evening to both of you. i'm glad you're on, and i'm glad you're all safe and we're in the building tonight.\n\n\n\nso, first of all, let's talk about michael cohen, shimon. a major takeaway from the sdny filing, is that he, the president is now directly implicated in a crime of illegal campaign contributions.\n\n\n\nshimon prokupecz, cnn crime and justice reporter: and you know why the president, donald trump, is not charged in anything here? it's because he's the president, and the department of justice, as we all know by now, has essentially a governing rule, a governing law that you cannot indict a sitting president. if donald trump is not the president and he was a citizen, a regular\n\n\n\ncitizen, the u.s. attorney's offices of the southern district would probably have indicted him.\n\n\n\nthe fbi agents who have been doing this investigation are political corruption folks, and they've been digging in on this for quite some time now.\n\n\n\n[22:15:03] lemon: yes\n\n\n\nprokupecz: and you know, you talked about what the southern district said. look, michael cohen came into court essentially and said as much last time when he pleaded guilty. and when you look at what the southern district -- you know, and we can show it again on the screen, and how they describe what the president here did in saying that in particular, and as cohen himself has now admitted -- this is when cohen stood up in court, sworn testimony -- with respect to both payments, that is, the hush money, he acted in coordination with and at the direction of individual one. individual one, of course, is donald trump.\n\n\n\nso, now this becomes a question of, as you said, what happens next. and really, ultimately, you know, up to members of congress if they want to pursue this and where this goes next. but in terms of where the fbi can take this or where the department of justice could take this, it's really no further at this point.\n\n\n\nlemon: sara, i want to bring you in now because president trump's attorney rudy giuliani of course is saying something tonight. he's speaking, he's telling cnn this. this is a quote. when you look at what was revealed today, there's nothing that links the president to collusion with the russians. so maybe that should fold up their tent -- they should fold up their tent, give a report to the justice department, and go home.\n\n\n\nnothing to see here. move along. let's get this over with. let's go home. there's nothing here. ok. so, sara, correct the record for us because we learned a lot of ways--\n\n\n\nsara murray, cnn white house correspondent: yes.\n\n\n\nlemon: -- that trump is how he is connected to russia in these filings.\n\n\n\nmurray: nothing to see here except kind of a lot. i mean, when we were looking at the paul manafort filing, for instance, you're looking at all the different things paul manafort allegedly lied to investigators about, and one of the big things he lied about was this guy konstantin kilimnik that he did work with.\n\n\n\nthis is a russian national, someone that prosecutors believe has ties to russian military intelligence and someone who is working closely with the former trump campaign chairman.\n\n\n\nand when you dig into the cohen filing, when he eventually came clean with the special counsel's office, you know, came clean about lying to congress, he shared that they had this trump tower moscow project in the works for much longer than they were previously honest about.\n\n\n\nand he also comes clean about the fact that he spoke to donald trump about his contacts with the russian government as well as potentially planning a time for donald trump, then about to become the republican nominee, to go and visit moscow.\n\n\n\nand there was another russian national that just got sprinkled into this cohen filing that we saw from the special counsel's office that apparently reached out to michael cohen in november of 2015, don.\n\n\n\nthink about how early that is in the campaign, saying they wanted to help create some political synergy with the trump campaign and the russian government, and this person, who is not identified in the filing, even offered to set up a meeting with then-candidate donald trump and russian president vladimir putin. and it says cohen didn't follow up on that invitation.\n\n\n\nbut you know, that's just an inkling of the ways that the people surrounding donald trump were in contact with the russians. and of course, what we saw from candidate trump and then president trump was, no, nothing to see here. i have no ties to the russians. no one in my campaign was in touch with the russians. i have no business deals with the russians. not entirely truthful or accurate there, don.\n\n\n\nlemon: all right. i appreciate both of you, guys, both of your reports tonight. thank you so much. lots more to come on tonight's revelation of the michael cohen and manafort investigation. new york prosecutors, not robert mueller, the first to implicate the president in a crime. what does that mean for the investigation?\n\n\n\n[22:20:00] (commercial break)\n\n\n\nlemon: an extraordinary court filing today ahead of michael cohen's sentencing next week for tax fraud and campaign finance crimes. the prosecutors saying cohen made illegal campaign contributions to influence the 2016 presidential election in coordination and at the direction of president trump.\n\n\n\ni want to talk about this now with jack quinn, garrett graff. garrett is the author of the threat matrix. also with us, renato mariotti. good evening.\n\n\n\nso, let's start with mr. mariotti. you know, you say that federal prosecutors are essentially saying the president committed felonies by directing the payments to stormy daniels, karen mcdougal -- and karen mcdougal during the campaign. does this mean they have the corroborating evidence to back that up?\n\n\n\nrenato mariotti, cnn legal analyst: it certainly means they have more evidence than just the say-so of michael cohen. so, if you read that full document, the prosecutors trash michael cohen, make it crystal clear that they do not necessarily trust him or think he's the most truthful and upright person ever.\n\n\n\nbut then they very definitively make clear that michael cohen was directed by trump to commit these crimes, crimes by the way that cohen pled guilty for. he was charged and pled guilty for. and they also have citations in there that make it clear that the probation department, a totally separate arm of the government, also came to the same conclusion.\n\n\n\nso, that's big news. now it doesn't mean that they could necessarily prove it beyond a reasonable doubt at trial. but what it does mean is that that is where the evidence points to. that is their conclusion. and that is not mueller. that is the trump justice department making that conclusion.\n\n\n\nlemon: ok. so, you're a federal prosecutor. we have the southern district of new york implicating the president in a crime. so, what do they do about it, because they answer, as you said, to the trump justice department, to the attorney general. and the a.g. answers to the president.\n\n\n\nmariotti: yes. it's pretty astounding, and you have to imagine right now that if donald trump is watching this, his steam is coming out of his ears, and he wants matt whitaker to do something about this.\n\n\n\nbut u.s. attorney's offices are pretty independent. and here you have the southern district of new york, a very distinguished office that is doing its job and prosecuting this without interference. frankly, that's a good thing for the rule of law, but there have been a lot of pretty unprecedented efforts by the president and his allies to obstruct and to undermine this investigation.\n\n\n\nso, it will be interesting to see if that happens. i wouldn't put it past him once trump realizes -- and his tweet didn't suggest that, but i think he has to have realized that things are starting to look really bad for him.\n\n\n\nlemon: so, jack, what does it say? what does it say to you that the first accusation of a crime by president trump is coming from new york prosecutors, not by, not from mueller?\n\n\n\n[22:25:03] jack quinn, cnn legal analyst: i don't attach any particular importance to it. it does underscore a point renato made that the southern district of new york, perhaps more so than any other u.s. attorney's office, operates independently. it has historically been recognized as quite independent. it regards itself as independent of main justice.\n\n\n\ni think the most remarkable thing about the filings regarding michael cohen were embedded in the special counsel's memorandum to the court. which identified four separate areas of cooperation the special counsel is getting from mr. cohen.\n\n\n\nand if you look at them, they're really quite remarkable in that each and every one of them should send shivers through the white house because they all identify different forms of connections to people who were in the administration, are in the administration, and talk about how mr. cohen is providing important information.\n\n\n\nfor example, at one point he talks about getting information from mr. cohen regarding matters core to the investigation. core to the investigation must mean russia/trump campaign connections obtained from company executives, trump company executives during the campaign. what trump company executives were deeply involved in the campaign? that can only mean, i believe, the trump family.\n\n\n\nlemon: got it.\n\n\n\nquinn: and so, all four of these have signals like that, that have to be keeping people awake tonight.\n\n\n\nlemon: if you haven't read garrett graff's latest article in wired, you've really missed it because here's a headline. it says, the mueller investigation nears the worst-case scenario. nears the worst- case scenario. and you write how the innocent explanations from president trump over the last two years are steadily being stripped away. talk to me about that.\n\n\n\ngarrett graff, cnn contributor: yes. particularly when you look at the cohen filings today and the manafort filings, what we see are continued, extensive contacts between the russians and the trump campaign over a period that is even longer than what we had previously believed.\n\n\n\nas sara was saying, you know, as early as november 2015, you had russians with connections to the kremlin showing up and offering political synergy between donald trump and vladimir putin.\n\n\n\nand one of the things that this sort of begins to fill in some of the details of, that has always puzzled us, is that in the e-mails setting up that june 2016 trump tower meeting --\n\n\n\nlemon: don junior.\n\n\n\ngraff: with don junior, the e-mail to don junior says, this is part of the russian government support for the campaign. and we've never really understood what that meant, but it seemed to imply that there had been some ongoing support and that that wouldn't be news to don junior. and this begins to potentially fill in some of that.\n\n\n\nand so what we have, i think, is we are steadily into worst-case scenario territory where it appears at the very least russian intelligence was deeply involved and embedded and active on the periphery of the trump campaign.\n\n\n\nand, you know, the next couple of steps make it seem like there is no real difference between the business collusion that was taking place and the election collusion that was taking place as jack just outlined.\n\n\n\nlemon: i want everybody to stick around. michael cohen isn't the only one in the spotlight today. the special counsel explaining in a filing why cooperation with former trump campaign chairman paul manafort fell apart. we're going to break it down next.\n\n\n\n[22:30:00] (commercial break)\n\n\n\nlemon: in court documents filed today, robert mueller saying, paul manafort lied about five major issues after agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors. that includes lying about contacts with trump administration officials this year. back with me, jack quinn, garret graff, and renato mariotti. it's almost so much -- like the players say ok, this person -- wait -- which person who was accused of lying am i talking about here? it's hard to get -- keep up with it.\n\n\n\nanyway, i digress. jack, let's talk about manafort, this filing, about why his cooperation agreement fell apart, ok? mueller's office is saying that manafort lied about his, quote, contact with administration officials. why is he in touch with folks at the white house as recently as this year?\n\n\n\njack quinn, former clinton white house counsel: that is a really important question. why there were all these ongoing contacts and not just by paul manafort? but, you know, look. i think paul manafort was trying to have it both ways. i think, he was dancing with the special counsel at the same time that he was trying to keep his illicit affair with the president of the united states going.\n\n\n\nlemon: you know that never works, right?\n\n\n\nquinn: it never works. but, listen, to me, another really big curiosity in this whole thing is, why was paul manafort lying to protect konstantin kilimnik? why was he resisting acknowledging that kilimnik was his co-conspirator? this is just remarkable. this is a guy who, as garrett said earlier, has been identified by our government as likely to be connected to russian military intelligence. so why is paul manafort protecting him? and, you know, that question begs an answer.\n\n\n\nlemon: garrett, president trump likes to say that manafort didn't have a big role in the campaign. i'm not sure if he was exactly a coffee boy. but he only, he is saying, you know, he worked for just a very short time and you know, didn't really do that much. that is not true. he was campaign chairman, played a critical role at the convention. so when we learn that he is talking to the white house this year that is a big deal.\n\n\n\ngarrett graft, cnn contributor: well, it's a big deal, especially when you begin to realize that he is been under indictment for about a year now.\n\n\n\nlemon: yes.\n\n\n\ngraft: which means that for months after he was indicted as part of a $65 million money laundering scheme, even as he was engaging in other witness tampering involving, again, konstantin kilimnik, which jack rightly points out is an incredibly odd, but very consistent pattern of lies stemming from paul manafort through this entire enterprise, that he is still engaging in conversations with the administration.\n\n\n\n[22:35:22] that is surprising, and i think if i was someone in the administration and paul manafort was calling me, i'd be hanging up on him pretty quickly. so the fact that those conversations were ongoing is -- is troubling.\n\n\n\n(laughter)\n\n\n\nlemon: you would give them a new phone who (inaudible). so listen, renato, let us explain this konstantin kilimnik thing a little bit, ok? so, they say that they lied about the interactions with him. his russian associate, who has ties to the russian military intelligence accused of hacking the democrats. and then they go on to say that they may have worked together to tamper with witnesses. so talk to me about the significance of this, renato.\n\n\n\nrenato mariotti, former federal prosecutor: well, here you have an american and a russian, an american being the former chair of trump's campaign, you know, conspiring with a russian to commit a crime. it's obviously serious, and it begs the question, what did they have to hide? why does this russian intelligence operative care so much about paul manafort that he is willing to risk himself getting in trouble to aid paul manafort? it doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\n\n\nalso it doesn't make a lot of sense to me, why paul manafort felt the need to reach out to people in the trump administration directly when his attorneys were talking to trump's team. i mean the safe way to communicate when you're under investigation and certainly when you're under indictment is through your attorney to other attorneys. those conversations could have been protected by common interest privilege.\n\n\n\ninstead, he is going out of his way to talk to people in the trump administration, about what? like what are they talking about? are they talking about a pardon? are they talking about secrets that they didn't want the attorneys to know? you know, that is the obvious implication to me. so there's a lot of interesting questions raised here as to what he is talking about and why.\n\n\n\nlemon: gentlemen, thank you. have a good weekend. i appreciate it.\n\n\n\nmariotti: you too.\n\n\n\nlemon: filings today giving greater detail about the trump campaign's links to russia. a big question now, what will the incoming congress do about it? we're going to talk to a member of the house intelligence committee next.\n\n\n\n[22:40:00] (commercial break)\n\n\n\nlemon: well, prosecutors say michael cohen has committed two crimes in coordination and at the direction of donald trump. what does this mean for the president of the united states? joining me now is democratic congressman denny heck of washington. he sits on the house intelligence and financial services committees. good to see you. did i do something? you hadn't come on in a while. everything ok?\n\n\n\nrep. denny heck (d), washington: i don't know if you heard about that general election that we had. we're all a little tied up there for a few weeks.\n\n\n\nlemon: you were just a little busy. listen, it's going to have you on. give me your takeaways from the filings today, will you? heck: well, aside from the obvious bombshell that the president is\n\n\n\nnow essentially an unindicted coconspirator in not one, but two felonies, there was the obvious reference to the ways in which michael cohen is cooperating, which suggests that a lot more is to come. and i think that anybody that thinks director mueller is near the completion of his task, probably isn't reading between the lines of the sentencing memos. i think there's a lot more to come. i think there are more indictments and i think there are more bombshells.\n\n\n\nlemon: ok. more specifically, do you think there's now enough evidence to prove that president trump committed a crime, possibly even a felony?\n\n\n\nheck: yes.\n\n\n\nlemon: ok. why?\n\n\n\nheck: well, because michael cohen pleaded guilty to it and because they named the president individual one, which i don't think they would have done in any way, shape, or form. they weren't required to reference the president, but they did so. and i have to assume that that is on the basis of significant and material corroborating evidence that they have collected.\n\n\n\nlemon: there is today stunning news through the michael flynn revelations that came out, so much new information about the russia investigation. your party is taking charge of the house come january. you will have subpoena power. what do you plan to do first?\n\n\n\nheck: well, we're going to fully exercise our responsibility under article 1 of the united states constitution to provide a check and balance on the administration and to hold him accountable where appropriate. you'll see the judiciary committee and the intelligence committee on which i have the honor to sit, i think, try and tie up some loose ends that were left undone.\n\n\n\nthere are some pretty significant outstanding questions that we never got answers to. for example, we all now know about the june 2016 meeting between trump operatives and family members and the russian operatives. and we also know that there was a phone call made shortly thereafter between a member of the family and a blocked number. we've been trying to determine the source of that number for quite some time, but we received no cooperation either from the witnesses or from the majority party. and i'm just using that, don, as one example of where we may be able to follow up and provide some information that is relevant to this investigation.\n\n\n\nlemon: yes. let me tell you something. this is about what your colleague on the house intelligence committee, democratic congresswoman jackie speier said. she told my colleague brianna keilar today that she believes donald trump jr. lied to congress on two occasions. do you agree that he lied?\n\n\n\nheck: i certainly would like to have him back and compare and contrast some of the things he said then with some of what we know now. lemon: so what did he lie about?\n\n\n\nheck: but to say i'm suspicious is an understatement. well, listen, as i have said before with respect to that meeting, it is prima facie collusion. it's hiding in plain sight.\n\n\n\n[22:45:00] the very fact that they would take a meeting and talk with russian operatives on the promise that they would be provided dirt against mr. trump's opponent at the time, secretary clinton, is in and of itself collusion. and mr. trump jr. repeatedly indicated that that wasn't the case. and yet we've had continuing indications that there may, in fact, have been continuing conversations and other evidence that would bear on this very question.\n\n\n\nlemon: i always appreciate your time and your input. thank you so much. i appreciate it, congressman heck.\n\n\n\nheck: thank you, don.\n\n\n\nlemon: you know, with bad news from the mueller investigation and a former cabinet official making harsh comments about his time in the administration, it's been a bad day for president trump. and if his twitter is any indication, he is feeling the heat.\n\n\n\n[22:50:00] (commercial break)\n\n\n\nlemon: so with the mueller investigation flexing its muscles today revealing just how much they know about the trump campaign and how much former trump aides have told them, it was another bad day for the president. let's discuss now. michael d'antonio, he is the author of the truth about trump. also susan glasser of the new yorker. good evening.\n\n\n\nsusan, i'm going to start with you. when you step back and you read these documents and you think about the fact that we are talking about actions taken by and involving the president of the united states, it is jaw-dropping. have we become inured to the muck that this country has been dragged through for the last two years?\n\n\n\nsusan glasser, cnn global affairs analyst, the new yorker: well, i don't know if we can be into inured and have our jaws dropped. i mean, i'll tell you that i was just reading this document, and in a way.\n\n\n\nlemon: well played, by the way.\n\n\n\n(laughter)\n\n\n\nglasser: i found a certain comfort in the legal probes, right? you know, the idea, i've always felt this way that, you know, there's a -- the legal system that we have in this country, it's like an armor protecting us from the twitter news cycle, from the blandishment of these folks. it's laid out there in this sort of dry compelling probe, reading actually some of these legal filings tonight, and you are this stirring defense of the american political system. you have you at one point in the michael cohen -- one of the michael\n\n\n\ncohen filings, you know, the justice department, whoever wrote this, the anonymous lawyer and author of this document has talked about how other americans spend the lead up to the 2016 election volunteering in their community and helping to make democracy work, while michael cohen was working to subvert it and the basic principles of our campaign law.\n\n\n\nit was a very stirring sentence to find in the middle of a legal document. so, i think that is something to take comfort in, but then you have this unfolding spectacle of the tweets and you know, even by the standards we've been living with of the last few years to have the president attacking his former secretary of state, you know what that is like. he used the same epithet actually applied to rex tillerson that he is applied to you before.\n\n\n\nlemon: i know, i was surprised. i was like wow, i'm up there with rex tillerson.\n\n\n\nglasser: you know. i mean, hey, you know, ceo of exxon and former secretary of state. think about the bush funeral.\n\n\n\nlemon: i'll take everything. i'll take the money, but everything else rex tillerson can have, including his time working in this administration. listen, let's -- michael, i printed out all the tweets from today, right? but the -- it ended with totally clears the president. thank you.\n\n\n\nmichael d'antonio, cnn contributor: well, right.\n\n\n\nlemon: what's he talking about?\n\n\n\nd'antonio: i'm 6'4, i've got a nice head of hair and i'm very athletic. i mean, this is crazy.\n\n\n\nlemon: the television today adds pounds and inches in hair. so, there you go.\n\n\n\nd'antonio: this is -- this is a collision of reality represented by the southern district of new york and robert mueller and abject lying in the part of donald trump, but also all the people around him, and this is one of the shocking things that you alluded to at the start of this segment is that, we now have five major associates of the president of the united states, who have been found guilty or pled guilty to serious crimes.\n\n\n\nand we've almost forgotten how to add this up and i think what susan said about how we're blessed with this justice system is really true. we've got somebody keeping track of it all, because you need a team of attorneys to follow this president's craziness, and not only the lies, but also the suggestion of crimes, because we now have with the paperwork related to michael cohen. a very strong suggestion that the president participated in criminal activity.\n\n\n\nlemon: with campaign finance violations and on, but you know, there's campaign finance violations. ok, fine, but susan, i mean, isn't there a real national security concern here? because michael cohen told the special counsel about contacts between team trump, the russians going back to 2015, a trusted person in the russian federation offering synergy on a government level. we're talking about serious national security situation here, right?\n\n\n\nglasser: well, that is right. and in fact, actually, there's a tantalizing i think and significant sentence in one of the filings today in which the special counsel's office says that cohen has provided information that relates to the core part of the investigation involving russia and the questions surrounding the 2016 election.\n\n\n\n[22:55:07] the convergence between two different story lines is pretty striking. in the last couple weeks, remember, we found out that essentially the president was seeking to leverage his presidential campaign to do business in russia. and he had pursued for years the idea of a major project, a major building project in moscow. it hadn't panned out and the fact that michael cohen is now admitting, admitting under oath, you know, to the special counsel that he called vladimir putin's office seeking help in that real estate deal while donald trump was campaigning for president. remains to me, i think one of the signal breakthroughs in terms of our knowledge of this campaign.\n\n\n\nthat came out a couple weeks ago. so you add in the details today, but one other thing, i've got to point out, the level of breathtaking corruption by those surrounding the president of the united states is something that should be remarked upon. you know, these people were not just like petty criminals. paul manafort and mr. cohen, michael cohen were ripping people off in a massive scale. tax fraud is alleged that he is now pleaded guilty to. michael cohen, you know, monetizing his relationship with the president and the trump administration, $4 million essentially was paid to him after trump became president, he was elected president, and he apparently it was all a con, according to the prosecutors in their filing today.\n\n\n\nhe was basically ripping these companies off and saying i'm going to provide you information and then not -- he didn't have anything to say about the repeal of obamacare. again, these are the people that the

(cnn) the latest house coronavirus relief legislation would make more people eligible for affordable care act subsidies for two years, temporarily fulfilling one of president joe biden's campaign promises.\n\nthe bill, introduced this week by house ways and means committee chair rep. richard neal, would make the federal premium subsidy more generous and would eliminate the maximum income cap.\n\npart of biden's $1.9 trillion relief package , the two moves would make buying policies on obamacare exchanges more affordable for many middle class americans, who have long been shut out of federal premium assistance because they earn too much.\n\nenrollees would pay no more than 8.5% of their income towards coverage, down from nearly 10% now. also, those earning more than the current cap of 400% of the federal poverty level -- about $51,000 for an individual and $104,800 for a family of four in 2021 -- would become eligible for help.\n\nin addition, the legislation would bolster subsidies for lower-income enrollees, eliminating their premiums completely. and it would create subsidies for unemployed workers who are ineligible to continue their job-based coverage through cobra.\n\nread more

trump's state of the union address tuesday night. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors. view more opinion articles on cnn.\n\nana navarro: dr. jekyll, meet mr. hyde\n\nana navarro\n\npresident donald trump's speech tonight was like watching dr. jekyll and mr. hyde give the state of the union. if you had been in a coma for the last three years, and suddenly awoke in time to hear just the opening minutes and closing minutes, you would think trump was a unifying, bipartisan, gracious leader.\n\nbut alas, we have seen, heard, and read the tweets of the unscripted trump. just a few hours before this speech, he hosted a lunch with tv anchors where he, according to a new york times report, attacked joe biden, chuck schumer, elizabeth warren and john mccain – a national hero who has been dead for over five months.\n\nthen there was the part during the speech where he railed against illegal immigration, which he said results in lower wages for the american working class. has he no shame? just in recent weeks, the trump organization had to fire many undocumented employees who've worked in at least five of his properties for years. some of those workers were sitting in the audience.\n\ndr. jekyll found some common ground and points of unity – criminal justice reform, lowering the price of drugs, celebrating the achievements of women, celebrating little grace eline's fight against cancer. but at times, mr. hyde took over. he demonized immigrants, fanned the flames of hysteria over a caravan carrying migrants and wrongly claimed democrats want open borders.\n\nbottom line: though there were moments of unity and optimism, we've all seen this movie before. tomorrow, trump will be back to using executive time to watch cable news, tweet attacks at his political foes and the free press while eating hamberders. some things never change.\n\nana navarro is a republican strategist and cnn political commentator. follow her on twitter @ananavarro.\n\nse cupp: trump and the women in white\n\nse cupp\n\namong the many remarkable moments at tonight's state of the union, one stood out to me. president donald trump's seeming magnanimity in a spontaneous moment was full of intriguing layers.\n\nwhen the president boasted about creating new jobs, 58% of which he said had gone to women, many of the newly elected women democrats in the house looked around at each other as if to say, yeah — like us!\n\nthey stood and clapped, earning the applause of the room, and indeed the president, who joked, you weren't supposed to do that.\n\nas he went on, saying that all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before, he told them not to sit down yet — they would like the next part.\n\nexactly one century after congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in congress than ever before.\n\nafter more applause, the president congratulated those women — democrats, many of whom had sat with crossed arms and puckered faces throughout most of trump's speech.\n\none way to view this is with pleasant surprise — that in an unscripted moment in which trump's detractors were stealing the spotlight away from him, he reacted with atypical poise, good humor and graciousness. as opposed to the alternative, which we've all witnessed at his rallies and on twitter, this was certainly preferable.\n\nanother way to view this, more cynically, is to wonder aloud if the president doesn't realize or perhaps doesn't believe that many of those democratic women were elected as a direct response to his own first two years in office. they were, in fact, in that very building on this very night for the first time because enough voters — significantly suburban women — decided to turn out in support of democrats instead of republicans, or to simply stay home.\n\nmore importantly, though, their presence reflected the wresting away from republicans the majority control of congress, trump's autonomy, and his near-unilateral influence over policy over the past two years. it is because of them, the women he gamely congratulated, that he will now face oversight and investigations into accusations of corruption , that he's been denied a victory on his signature policy proposal, and that he will likely face continued obstacles to advancing his agenda.\n\nwhether trump doesn't equate the two things — his presidency with the women's midterm election wins — or whether he's simply accepted defeat is something only he knows. but it made for some truly remarkable theater.\n\nse cupp is a cnn political commentator and the host of se cupp unfiltered.\n\nerrol louis: a sunny speech turned sour\n\nphoto: cnn errol louis\n\nwhile president trump's speech at the state of the union address promised and pleaded for cooperation between republicans and democrats, his core message often veered into areas where little common ground exists. that bodes ill for the chances of resolving the current standoff over immigration policy generally and trump's proposed southern border wall in particular.\n\nwhat began as a sunny, confident speech about america's surging economy – we have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs, trump said – turned sour when he brought up the issue of immigration.\n\nno issue better illustrates the divide between america's working class and america's political class than illegal immigration, said trump. wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. meanwhile, working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration – reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.\n\nan audible chorus of groans and murmurs by members of congress signaled the fight that lies ahead.\n\nand trump waded into the always-bitter abortion debate by attacking a recently-passed new york law that allows for the termination of pregnancies at any point to protect the mother's health. trump called it legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments from birth and asked congress to pass a law overturning it.\n\ntoward the end of his speech, trump offered more healing oratory: we must choose whether we are defined by our differences – or whether we dare to transcend them.\n\nbut the spell was broken by then.\n\nthose who hoped the state of the union speech might unify america's warring tribes went home disappointed. as the battle continues, the prospect of another government shutdown looms. trump has suggested he might close the government again if he doesn't get funding for a border wall.\n\ngiven an opportunity to walk back the threat, trump chose to dig in deeper during the state of the union. federal workers, and the rest of us, should be worried.\n\nerrol louis is the host of inside city hall, a nightly political show on ny1, a new york all-news channel.\n\nmark bauerlein: the truth democrats didn't want to hear\n\nphoto: courtesy mark bauerlein mark bauerlein\n\nliberals think stacey abrams is the perfect foil for donald trump, that it's right to follow a rich white male who, they might allege, colluded his way into office with a thoughtful black female who was cheated out of office – and whose response to his state of the union address was largely one long complaint. and the women in congress who donned white to connect mr. trump's failings with women to a movement that ended 100 years ago – more empty symbolism.\n\nby contrast, the president said, choose greatness … america is winning each and every day … walls work, and walls save lives … four beautiful words: made in the usa … it's nice to hear good things about the country instead of endless accusations of racism, transphobia etc. unemployment is down, manufacturing up, the us is now the no. 1 producer of oil and natural gas in the world.\n\nthe discussion of immigration was tense. it would have been hard for the democrats to point at the ice officer whom mr. trump praised as he stood and call him a demon. harder still to brand the wall an outrage when an angel family rose and mr. trump described the murder of their parents. hard for republicans, too, to gainsay great nations do not fight endless wars.\n\nthe fact is that the economic trends validate the working class, america first vision of the president. we're tired of foreign half-wars, too, and we want borders. and we want to keep faith in america's destiny, to find the truth of it in the holocaust survivor's memory of when he was rescued: it's the americans!\n\nmark bauerlein is a professor of english at emory university, senior editor of the journal first things and author of the dumbest generation: how the digital age stupefies young

to a joint session of congress been in the tenor and tone of the speech donald trump delivered tuesday night, he might now enjoy broader support in the country. sure this state of the union once again had plenty of red meat for his base; sure he again made some outrageous arguments (e.g., his claim that had he not been elected, we would now be at war with north korea). but this speech for the first time tried hard to reach out beyond his base and showed some heart.\n\nwhen have we ever heard trump so fully embrace paid family leave? a serious effort to end hiv-aids in the next 10 years? call to conquer childhood cancer? or revive his commitment to lowering drug prices and renewing our infrastructure?\n\ndid it work? that is a tougher question. this effort to rebrand himself comes very late. millions of americans have now made up their minds about trump, believing he is unfit for the presidency. many will see the speech as an exercise in cynicism coming from a soulless leader who will say and do whatever is needed to keep a firm grip on power. this was a night of the big lie, they will say — just wait and see his tweets in the next several days.\n\ntrump kept arguing that it was up to others to choose greatness. the truth is that it is really up to him to persuade voters of who he truly is.\n\ndavid gergen has been a white house adviser to four presidents and is a senior political

and afghanistan, a president headed for the exits\n\nphoto: courtesy aaron david miller aaron david miller\n\nif there is a consistent theme in an otherwise disjointed trump foreign policy, it's the president's risk-aversion when it comes to getting america involved in new trillion dollar nation-building exercises, and his desire to get out of old ones. and this was on display again tuesday night with a bumper sticker takeaway on syria and afghanistan. great nations do not fight endless wars.\n\nin appearing to praise the taliban (in afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of afghan groups, including the taliban,) – with no similar nod to the afghan government – trump seemed to suggest not only did the taliban want to negotiate but desired peace too.\n\nwhile this trope brings him perilously close to being unfavorably compared to his risk-averse predecessor, barack obama, it plays well with a base that sees little value in expanding us commitments abroad. and with an eye on 2020, trump countered any charges of obama-like weakness by claiming credit for nearly destroying isis and toughening up iran policy by withdrawing from the iran nuclear agreement, imposing sanctions and pledging not to avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to america and threatens genocide against the jewish people. but even on iran, he called cautiously for more watching than confronting.\n\nand further to his self-proclaimed desire to avoid a new war, trump claimed that had he not been elected president, the us would have already have been at war rather than negotiating with north korea.\n\nclearly, committing to withdraw from endless wars is a bold commitment to make in a state of the union address, especially for a country that prides itself on engagement and leadership abroad. and there's significant opposition in the senate, which only last week–in a stinging rebuke–passed a resolution hammering trump's decision to withdraw from syria and afghanistan.\n\nboth secretary of state mike pompeo and national security adviser john bolton are also uncomfortable with the president's desire to draw down quickly, particularly in syria where both would like to use us leverage to constrain and ultimately push iran out of syria.\n\nand they will look for ways to ensure the withdrawals are well-organized, structured and, if possible, conditions-based. but make no mistake, based on his performance tonight, this president seems determined to draw down american forces in syria and afghanistan and head for the exits.\n\naaron david miller, a former middle east analyst at the state department and adviser in republican and democratic administrations, is a vice president and director of the middle east

what i saw when i watched president trump's state of the union speech. and from the moment he spoke, i understood – again – that trump's america does not include me. if not for the rebuttal address by stacey abrams, who spoke of our nation's diversity and unity, i would not have recognized the america trump spoke of last night.\n\nin trump's fantasy world, white men are the heroes. they have single-handedly built this nation, won our wars, built our economy. they've even been compassionate, handing out second chances to former black inmates who've spent decades in prison for nonviolent, minor crimes. they protect us from evil immigrants who are coming to kill us and take our jobs.\n\nhow nice, except it's all one big lie.\n\nlet's not forget that those former inmates were imprisoned by an unequal justice system — created by those benevolent white men to systemically mass incarcerate black and brown bodies. according to the naacp, though blacks and hispanics were roughly 32% of the us population, they comprised 56% of all incarcerated people in 2015. this systemic racism is why prison reform is necessary today.\n\nand the immigrants fleeing central america trump wants us to fear? don't fall for it. do we need immigration reform? yes, but as for me, it's not immigrants i fear when i think of my personal safety – it's irresponsible, unstable american gun owners. any quick search of us homicide rates will tell you that gun-crazed american citizens – not violent immigrants – are doing a fine job killing one another all by themselves.\n\nso, mr. president, i reject your whitewashed world. take a tip from abrams: next time you address america, please include me.\n\nroxanne jones, a founding editor of espn magazine and former vice president at espn, has been a

policy and passion. with a hint of 2020 on the horizon, the president spoke to a divided congress about his economic successes while driving home the need to choose greatness over gridlock.\n\nhe reiterated his case for building a wall to secure our southern border, re-enforced his commitment to the sanctity of life and touted his progress in rebuilding our military. the president raised a few democratic eyebrows when he said america will never be a socialist country.\n\npassion often trumps policy in grandiose speeches. it was evident when republicans chanted usa! usa! in response to the president declaring that the state of our union is strong. democrats followed suit upon hearing there are more women in congress than ever before.\n\nlike it or not, trump is a leader who evokes intense emotions. his state of the union address is a perfect example. the challenge now – for both sides - is on the follow-through.\n\nalice stewart is a cnn political commentator and former

rowe-finkbeiner\n\ni sat there in the chamber last night watching the state of the union and my stomach dropped as president trump dropped lie after misleading lie. he dangerously lied about women's health. he lied about immigrant families. he lied about the state of our union.\n\nwalking out, women who were watching together in the galley above talked in whispers out of deference to the venue, did you hear that? he lied. others whispered back, he did. and then the murmur slowly built as details were shared.\n\nthese lies are dangerous. because trump's words have real world impacts. hate crimes are rising under his leadership, children are being separated from their parents, lives and basic human rights are being lost.\n\nbut forget about all the lies for a moment.\n\nthere are two very real top takeaways from the state of the union.\n\nfirst, the women of america aren't falling for trump's lies, instead we're fact checking him in real time – and we are talking above whispers, marching in the streets and in the us capitol, rising to protect our national economy, families, and communities.\n\nsecond: momentum is on our side. we are greater than the fear that trump is spreading and we are united. visual proof of this last night was in the sea of congressional women – many newly elected in a wave of change – listening to the state of the union from so many backgrounds and communities all wearing white dresses, white blazers, white suits, and white shirts with speaker nancy pelosi at the helm as trump spoke. and then stacey abrams had the exact right words at the right time to keep the momentum going as the official responder to the state of the union for the democrats.\n\nwe are coming out to town halls, we're making calls to leaders, we're speaking out to our elected officials, more of us are running for office (and winning!), we're marching, and we know that our country is much better than the country that trump has been projecting.\n\nmake no mistake, trump's state of the union was horrifying and wrong, but the rise of women's leadership is a beacon of hope that together we can make our nation a place where freedom and community are for everyone. no exceptions.\n\nthe state of our union is strong.\n\nkristin rowe-finkbeiner is executive director and co-founder of momsrising.org, a nonprofit national organization

picture\n\njulian zelizer\n\nthe state of the union is not good, to borrow a phrase from president gerald ford, and we should not pretend that things are about to get better.\n\nthe drama over tonight's speech ignores the realities of this presidency.\n\npresident trump is a divider, he is a fierce partisan, and he has repeatedly said things that are not true. he consistently plays to the nation's fears, not its hopes.\n\nbefore the pundits speculate about a possible pivot, with trump telling the nation that we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution, it is worth remembering that just today, during a lunch with tv anchors, the president reportedly insulted former vice president joe biden, saying he was dumb and he dismissed senate minority leader chuck schumer as a nasty son of a bitch, according to a report in the new york times, citing the accounts of multiple people in the room.\n\nduring tuesday night's speech, he quickly abandoned an opening theme of unity to issue a dire warning over a caravan of immigrants surging to america's southern border – a manufactured crisis that has stoked nativist sentiment and been the centerpiece of his drive for a multi-billion dollar wall.\n\nto give any weight to those portions of the speech that included messages of unity is to be blind to the clear patterns that we have seen from this white house every day. there is almost no evidence to support the possibility of true bipartisanship or his putting aside the politics of anger.\n\nthe president's address must be seen as political theater put on by a commander-in-chief who faces historically low approval ratings and who is trying to restore a modicum of strength after his party was battered in the midterms and soundly defeated in the recent battle over the budget.\n\ntrump wanted to present an image that is at odds with who he is, but convenient for the moment. most democrats, after two years of brutal partisan attacks and disinformation, cannot trust this president in any kind of serious alliance.\n\njulian zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at princeton university and the author, with kevin kruse, of

what you're going to get when donald trump gets behind a podium. he often breaks from presidential norms in cringeworthy ways. however, his state of the union speeches have operated within relatively normal boundaries. and tuesday night bore that out.\n\nof course there were some ad-libs and a laundry list of self-promotional claims that had to be fact checked in real time. and the speech was not well delivered. it felt disjointed, low energy, contradictory. teleprompter trump is never as entertaining as twitter trump or rally trump.\n\non the other hand ,there were touching, powerful moments. the fierce partisan divide, often spearheaded by trump himself, melted away as the chamber honored a holocaust survivor and celebrated his liberation by american soldiers; sympathized with a brave young cancer survivor; and recognized the lives put back together as a result of bipartisan support for criminal justice reform. it was refreshing to see, even if it was only for a few minutes.\n\nbut there were also times throughout the speech where trump threw catnip to his base by demagoguing issues like immigration, border security and the investigation of his campaign and administration at the expense of the bipartisan unity he claimed he sought in the earlier portions of the speech.\n\ntrump's sotu remarks may have included a few overtures of bipartisanship but this was just one night. his ad hominem attacks, twitter rantings and falsehoods thus far during his presidency have been closer to art of the con man than art of the deal. he has given us no reason to think that will change when tomorrow comes.\n\ntara setmayer, a cnn political commentator, is the host of the honestly speaking with tara podcast. follow her on twitter @tarasetmayer.\n\nscott jennings: a speech in search of swing voters\n\nphoto: courtesy of scott jennings scott jennings\n\ni was watching the state of the union tuesday night through a political lens, as this event effectively kicked off the president's two-year campaign for reelection and democratic challengers have been joining the race. and what was particularly interesting was how president trump presented himself as above the political fray, framing his solutions to problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades. he argued his agenda is that of the american people, and not owned by one party or the other. he said that victory is not winning for our party, victory is winning for our country, a clear smack at what he sees as partisan democrats who are trying to effectively end his presidency through intransigence and investigations.\n\nthat construct – portraying himself as something of an independent who stands against the swamp no matter which alligators are in charge – could work for him in 2020 as he seeks to regain trust from middle class swing voters who voted for him in 2016 but swung against him in the 2018 midterm. tackling drug prices will work for the president politically, especially if he can churn out results. as he did in last year's state of the union, the president struck a mostly unifying tone.\n\nwhile there were likely no receptive democratic ears in the room, perhaps there were a few watching at home who feel their party is lunging too far into a fringe culture war and not enough toward finding areas of agreement with a president who is talking about policies that appeal to working class americans (infrastructure, health care, and border security). people do want politicians to cooperate, so trump casting himself as willing to work cooperatively puts the onus on house speaker nancy pelosi to reciprocate (which she is unlikely to do). this opens a good line of messaging for the president's campaign in 2020.\n\ni also noticed a clear attempt to speak to women voters tonight, which must be in response to the midterm results. trump will need to stay with that for the next two years; one speech won't cut it, but i was heartened by the beginning of a pivot on that

theme in president trump's state of the union about america's engagement in the world you could sum it up in one word: withdrawal.\n\ntrump pointed to the nearly 7,000 american servicemen killed in the united states' long post-9/11 wars and the more than 50,000 who have been badly wounded. he also asserted an exaggerated figure that the us has spent more than 7 trillion dollars in the middle east.\n\nthe president said that some 2,000 us soldiers in syria are being withdrawn now that isis has been largely been evicted from the territory it held there.\n\ntrump also confirmed that his administration is holding constructive talks with…the taliban. progress in those negotiations, trump said, would enable a drawdown of the estimated 14,000 us troops in afghanistan, leaving some kind of residual force to focus on counterterrorism.\n\nall of this is consistent with what trump said during the presidential campaign when he repeatedly complained about the trillion of dollars that the us. had spent on its post-9/11 wars in the greater middle east.\n\neven before he started campaigning, trump had tweeted in 2013, let's get out of afghanistan. our troops are being killed by the afghanis we train and we waste billions there. nonsense! rebuild the usa.\n\nonce you get past their rhetorically quite different styles this is an important commonality between president barack obama

the union address. he spoke of a shared desire for cooperation, compromise and the common good. in laying out his work on job creation, regulatory reform, repealing an onerous obamacare individual mandate, praising america's new position as a net exporter of energy, standing up to china, decimating isis, combating socialism and more, the president reminded us why he won.\n\nin speaking out against pro-choice governors in new york and virginia, president trump reminded conservatives why they overwhelmingly support his administration's pro-life agenda to protect innocent life and the dreams of unborn children. president trump also called out congressional democrats for their intransigence in moving judicial and administration nominees and stood firm against iran's threats of genocide against the jewish people.\n\nthe president spoke movingly of the case of alice johnson, sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. she became a face for bipartisan criminal justice reforms signed into law last year in the first step act.\n\nin her sotu response, i applaud democrat stacey abrams for saying she didn't want president trump to fail – this

take us back to the imaginary past of his youth wants us to unlock the extraordinary promise of america's future.\n\npresident trump's state of the union speech included much bragging about the economy and some ordinary calls for unity, but was most notable for his demonizing of undocumented immigrants and his anti-abortion extremism. for example, he distorted the reality of conditions on the border with mexico. no matter how often trump says it—and as real-time fact-checkers pointed out tuesday night–no new state of emergency exists there, and no crisis justifies his demand for huge sums to build a wall there.\n\njust as familiar was trump's whining about the troubles he faces as congress joins prosecutors in investigating whether there was collusion between russian operatives and trump associates during the presidential campaign and transition, as well as other matters. if there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation, he said, echoing richard nixon's 1974 complaint about investigations into the watergate burglary and coverup.\n\na more generous observer, or one who hasn't been paying close attention, might credit warm notes he struck about the number of women in congress and bipartisan cooperation on criminal justice reform. however, criminal justice reform was the exception not the rule amid the extreme partisanship in washington, and most of the new women in congress were elected to stand up to him.\n\ntough opposition, culminating in the shellacking he experienced at the polls last november, have left trump weakened. this means the state of the union, which is much more than its economy, is strong. with little thanks to him.\n\nmichael d'antonio is the author of the book never enough: donald trump and

(cnn) president joe biden has been in office for less than two weeks, but a looming question is when, not whether, his justice department will change the federal government's position before the supreme court on the affordable care act.\n\nfor four years the law remained a consistent target at the center of former president's donald trump's political dart board.\n\nhis ire culminated a little more than three months ago, when acting solicitor general jeffrey b. wall told the justices that they should invalidate the entire 900-page law.\n\nthe challenge for biden's justice department is not only telling the justices it manifestly opposes the position taken by the trump administration in the case, but how to pull off the task. changing its position on the affordable care act wouldn't end the lawsuit, which was brought by texas and other republican-led states, but could inform how the justices look at the case.\n\nbiden's new acting solicitor general is elizabeth prelogar , who is likely recused from the issue because as a private lawyer she filed a brief on behalf of 47 senators in support of the law. that means if the solicitor general's office files a supplemental brief, or a missive to the court, it will likely be handled by a career employee.\n\nalready, prelogar has asked the supreme court to remove two cases from the court's february calendar because they concern trump policies on the issue of funding for the border wall as well as immigration that biden has vowed to change.\n\njust watched conservative justices question gop obamacare challenge replay more videos ... must watch conservative justices question gop obamacare challenge 02:16\n\nwhen to change positions\n\nrecently, three powerful former members of the office of solicitor general, a small cadre of top-notch appellate lawyers who argue the government's position before the supreme court, have made clear that there are times when the head or acting head of the office should not shy away from a change of position.\n\nto be sure, the solicitor general's office, comprised of political and career lawyers, prides itself in representing long-term institutional interests of the united states, not the political whim of a particular president. as such, its interest in the stability of the law and its own credibility before the justices is paramount and a change of position based on a new administration has been institutionally considered a rare move. but trump may have pushed that norm.\n\nthe heart of the affordable care act dispute dates back to 2012 when chief justice john roberts stunned conservatives by upholding the law under congress' taxing power , even though that justification for the law had hardly came up during oral arguments. at the time, paul clement, who had served as solicitor general for former president george w. bush, was in private practice representing 26 states opposed to the law. clement's side lost.\n\nasked later at a 2013 speech before marquette university law school if he would have done anything differently clement joked: sure, i'd start with the taxing power.\n\nflash forward to 2017 when congress brought the tax penalty down to zero. critics of the affordable care act raced to court and argued that congress had gotten rid of the legal underpinning of the individual mandate, so the rest of the law should fall with it.\n\na district court judge invalidated the mandate, and said it was inseverable from the rest of the law. his decision was put on hold, but it emboldened the trump administration to dig in and escalate its case against the law. instead of continuing to argue that the mandate and other closely related provisions should fall, the trump administration endorsed most of the position taken by texas and other states that the whole fall should fall.\n\nthe individual mandate cannot be severed from the remainder of the affordable care act, trump's doj said in court briefs.\n\nthe case, argued on november 10, is now pending before the justices.\n\nin a talk hosted by georgetown law last week, clement -- the man who argued against the law for a very different challenge in 2012-- expressed concern about the position taken by trump's doj when it comes to the legal doctrine of severability, a key component of the challenge at hand.\n\njust watched kamala harris grills amy coney barrett on obamacare replay more videos ... must watch kamala harris grills amy coney barrett on obamacare 05:53\n\nit has been the long-term position of the justice department to defend the constitutionality of statutes whenever reasonable arguments can be made, clement said. he was quick to add that it has also been understood that even if you think that part of the statute is unconstitutional, it would be in the long-term tradition of the office to have as little of the statute as possible fall.\n\nthe justice department in my view tends to get itself in trouble when it deviates from that tradition, clement said in comments that amounted to repudiation of the trump administration's legal position in the case.\n\nneal katyal, a former acting solicitor general during the obama administration agreed with clement's take on severability during the same talk .\n\nchanging position is not something you do lightly, he said, but this case, you and i are agreeing on this, i mean i think it fits it to a t.\n\ninstead of just focusing on the individual mandate, katyal noted, the trump administration argued the entire kit and caboodle should be struck.\n\nhe added: i can't think of any solicitor general living or dead who would take that position, and yet they did.\n\nmichael r. dreeben, who served in the office of the solicitor general for more than 30 years, including 24 years as the as the deputy solicitor general in charge of the government's criminal docket in the supreme court had a slightly less conservative take than clement and katyal when it comes to switching positions. dreeben's tenure spanned 14 solicitors general and acting solicitors general, and he now works for o'melveny. in a recent piece for the yale law journal, he spoke up about the practice of changing positions, but never mentioned the affordable care act directly.\n\nhe suggested that reversals could not be done lightly or frequently but he noted that trump's solicitor general had taken dramatic shifts in position and often prevailed before the justices.\n\ndreeben noted that in its first full term at the supreme court during the trump administration the office of solicitor general made four major shifts in high profile cases. these reversals were abrupt and appeared strikingly at odds with institutional norms, he wrote. but the trump administration prevailed in all of the cases including one concerning public sector unions that overturned some 40-year old precedent.\n\nconsistency is a virtue -- up to a point, dreeben said.
(cnn) —\n\nrepublican sen. susan collins said tuesday she will vote against chad readler, president donald trump's nominee for the sixth circuit court of appeals who has come under fire from democrats for being a lead lawyer for the justice department when it declined to defend key provisions of the affordable care act in response to a lawsuit filed by republican state attorneys general.\n\ncollins, a rare gop defender of obamacare, cited in her statement announcing her decision readler's role in the case as reason for opposing him.\n\nas the acting assistant attorney general of the justice department's civil division, mr. readler was both a lead attorney and policy advisor in the department's decision not to defend the affordable care act, including its provisions protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions, she said. rather than defend the law and its protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions – such as asthma, arthritis, cancer, diabetes, and heart disease – mr. readler's brief in texas v. united states argued that they should be invalidated.\n\nreadler faces a key procedural vote at 4 p.m. et on tuesday when republicans will try to break a democratic filibuster of him. it's not clear if any other gop senators will join her in opposing readler. when sen. john thune of south dakota, the republican whip, was asked if republicans would hold together to advance the nominee, he replied, hopefully we'll have enough.\n\nhe later said he expects to get the simple majority needed.\n\nall democrats are expected to oppose readler.\n\none of the most dangerous decision to come out of the trump administration in the last two years, was to not defend the constitutionality of protecting pre-existing conditions in court, said senate minority leader chuck schumer, a democrat of new york, at a news conference.\n\nschumer warned republicans who argue they support coverage for pre-existing conditions will pay a price on election day if they vote for readler.\n\na vote to confirm mr. readler is very simply an endorsement of the law suit to eliminate pre-existing conditions, he said.\n\nschumer was asked if he regrets that democrats used the nuclear option in 2013 to lower the 60-vote threshold to break a filibuster for most judicial picks – except those for the supreme court – because it's unlikely readler could get 60 votes right now.\n\ni think without question this nominee would not get on the bench, schumer said. the 60-vote threshold brought parties together and picked more judges to be moderate.\n\nbut he said then-senate majority leader harry reid resorted to that rule change – forced over the objections of republicans – because republicans, led by then-senate minority leader mitch mcconnell, were blocking president barack obama's picks to the dc circuit court of appeals.\n\nschumer added that senate comity was further damaged when mcconnell's refused to consider merrick garland for the supreme court and when he allowed the blue slip tradition, which fosters bipartisan judicial picks, to wane.\n\nmcconnell, who later used the nuclear option to make it easier to confirm supreme court nominees, is now considering using it to speed debate of all but the most senior executive and judicial branch appointees. schumer said he might be open to reducing debate time but only after the blue slips were restored.\n\nthis story has been updated with additional developments tuesday.
stimulus check tracker: why you may see 'payment status not available'—or a pending direct deposit in your bank account
between january 13 and january 19, trump made eight false claims related to the economy, eight related to the military, seven related to impeachment, seven related to democrats, and six about energy.\n\nwhile 49 false claims across seven days is by no means trivial, it's below trump's weekly average of 60 per week for the period starting july 8, when we started counting at cnn.\n\ntrump is now up to 1,685 false claims since july 8.\n\nthe most egregious false claim: pre-existing conditions\n\ntrump keeps simultaneously promising to protect people with pre-existing conditions and attempting to reduce protections for people with pre-existing conditions. as we've repeatedly noted , trump has supported unsuccessful republican legislation that would weaken protections offered by obamacare -- and he is currently backing a republican lawsuit that has asked the courts to kill obamacare in full.\n\nlast week, he turned the empty pledge about the future into egregious nonsense about the past. criticizing an ad from democratic presidential candidate michael bloomberg, trump tweeted , i was the person who saved pre-existing conditions in your healthcare, you have it now...\n\nthat's absurd. people have it only because trump's opponents have blocked his attempts to get rid of it.\n\nthe most revealing false claim: vindman and the rough transcript\n\ntrump got at least a little bit of helpful testimony in november from lt. col. alexander vindman, the national security council expert on ukraine who was critical of trump's july phone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky.\n\nvindman testified that there were some words missing from the rough transcript of the call, and that his requests to add these words to the document were unsuccessful. but vindman also emphasized that the document was still substantively correct, that there was nothing nefarious about the words being left out, and that the omissions were not that big a deal.\n\ninstead of mentioning this truth, trump falsely claimed last week that the omissions had been fixed at vindman's request. the transcript was perfectly accurate. and now everybody agrees because it went through a lot and they said, 'well, could you add one word here?' our lieutenant colonel said, 'well, i think they should add...' -- they added the word, he told reporters\n\nthe most absurd false claim: mexico and the wall\n\none of trump's most memorable 2016 rally shticks was a call-and-response segment.\n\ntrump would ask his crowds who was going to pay for his wall on the mexico border. the crowds would respond with trump's implausible promise: mexico!\n\nmexico has not paid for the wall, though it has helped trump thwart migrants in other ways . needing billions more for the project than congress has been willing to appropriate, trump has been diverting taxpayer funds from the military.\n\nso, naturally, trump told a rally crowd last week: and by the way, they think they caught me -- they never catch us -- because, you know: mexico's paying for the wall. you know that. you'll see that. it's all worked out. mexico spent -- it's driving them crazy.\n\nhe then pivoted to a promise that mexico will pay. then, reverting to his reality tv past, he vaguely promised a dramatic reveal at some future point: and here's the thing, here's the thing, you'll see that. it'll come out. we'll do it sometime during the debate or maybe before our debate, the real debate that people are going to watch.\n\nwe will await the big moment.\n\nhere is the full list of 49 false claims, starting with the ones we haven't previously included in one of these weekly roundups:\n\nukraine and impeachment\n\nvindman and the rough transcript\n\nfortunately, i released the transcript of the call. the transcript was perfectly accurate. and now everybody agrees because it went through a lot and they said, 'well, could you add one word here?' our lieutenant colonel said, 'well, i think they should add...' -- they added the word. everything -- everyone agrees the transcript is perfecto, done by total professionals, right? -- january 16 exchange with reporters after remarks on prayer in public schools\n\nfacts first: in fact, army lt. col. alexander vindman, the national security council's top ukraine expert, testified in the house impeachment inquiry that two substantive changes he suggested to the rough transcript of trump's call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky were not made. as we have noted : in fact, army lt. col. alexander vindman, the national security council's top ukraine expert, testified in the house impeachment inquiry that two substantive changes he suggested to the rough transcript of trump's call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky were not made. as we have noted before , the document trump released explicitly says on its first page that it is not a verbatim transcript.\n\nvindman testified that he had wanted to change the words the company to burisma, the company name he said zelensky had used on his call with trump. and vindman testified that he had wanted to add in trump saying there are recordings related to former vice president joe biden and a ukrainian prosecutor biden had pushed ukrainian leaders to fire. (trump was vague about what he meant; in public comments last fall, trump brought up a video of biden at a 2018 event telling the story of his effort to get the prosecutor ousted.)\n\nvindman testified that the transcript was substantively correct even without the changes he had proposed. when i first saw the transcript without the two substantive items that i had attempted to include, i didn't see that as nefarious. i just saw it as, ok, no big deal. you know, these might be meaningful, but it's not that big a deal, he told the house intelligence committee in november.\n\nwhat ukraine's foreign minister said\n\ndefending his july call with zelensky, trump said: the foreign minister said, 'they want to impeach, impeach the president of the united states over a perfect phone call.' -- january 14 campaign rally in milwaukee, wisconsin\n\nyou have now the ukrainian president and the foreign minister of ukraine saying there was nothing done wrong. in fact, they said there was absolutely no pressure whatsoever. everything was perfect. -- january 16 exchange with reporters after remarks on prayer in public schools\n\nfacts first: ukraine's president and foreign minister have made comments that bolster trump's argument that he did not pressure ukraine to investigate his opponents in order to receive us military aid -- but the foreign minister has never called the phone call perfect or complained that trump's opponents were trying to impeach him over a perfect call, and the president has not said that trump did nothing wrong.\n\nthe foreign minister, vadym prystaiko, has said i have never seen a direct relationship between investigations and security assistance, according to reuters , citing russian news service interfax. and prystaiko has said trump's july phone call with zelensky was friendly and that i think there was no pressure.\n\nzelensky said had been no pressure from trump and made other statements to that effect, but he has not gone so far as to say trump did nothing wrong or that everything was perfect. in an interview published by time magazine in early december, zelensky did say, look, i never talked to the president from the position of a quid pro quo. that's not my thing. but zelensky continued: i don't want us to look like beggars. but you have to understand. we're at war. if you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us. i think that's just about fairness. it's not about a quid pro quo. it just goes without saying.\n\ntrump could tout these comments. instead, he touted a comment they did not make.\n\nthe public response to trump's ukraine calls\n\nnow, so you have these perfect calls, and everybody says it now. before they knew they were so good -- because, fortunately, they were transcribed -- you had other people saying terrible things about the calls. -- january 16 exchange with reporters after remarks on prayer in public schools\n\nfacts first: this is an obvious exaggeration. it is clearly not true that everybody says trump's phone calls with zelensky were perfect or even good. democratic members of the congress continue to cite the july call as key evidence supporting trump's impeachment.\n\nmedia\n\na very stable genius\n\nanother fake book by two third rate washington post reporters, has already proven to be inaccurately reported, to their great embarrassment, all for the purpose of demeaning and belittling a president who is getting great things done for our country, at a record clip. -- january 18 tweet\n\nfacts first: trump was almost certainly referring to a very stable genius, a new book by washington post journalists philip rucker and carol leonnig. the book has not been proven to be inaccurately reported, nor has there been any sign that the authors are embarrassed about anything they included.\n\nthe new york times\n\ntrump said the new york times is a newspaper that was going broke until i came along. -- january 18 tweet\n\nfacts first: there was no sign the new york times was going broke prior to trump launching his presidential candidacy in mid-2015. (trump didn't specify what he meant by until i came along, but that seems like the earliest reasonable starting point.) the new york times company was : there was no sign the new york times was going broke prior to trump launching his presidential candidacy in mid-2015. (trump didn't specify what he meant by until i came along, but that seems like the earliest reasonable starting point.) the new york times company was profitable in 2013 and 2014. while the company reported a $14 million loss in the first quarter of 2015, it reported a $16 million gain in the second quarter of 2015, more than two thirds of which occurred before trump began his campaign in mid-june.\n\ndemocrats\n\npelosi, sanders and impeachment\n\nthey are rigging the election again against bernie sanders, just like last time, only even more obviously. they are bringing him out of so important iowa in order that, as a senator, he sit through the impeachment hoax trial. crazy nancy thereby gives the strong edge to sleepy joe biden, and bernie is shut out again. very unfair, but that's the way the democrats play the game. anyway, it's a lot of fun to watch! -- january 17 tweet\n\nthey are taking the democrat nomination away from crazy bernie, just like last time. some things never change! -- january 18 tweet\n\nfacts first: there is no evidence for either trump's general claim that they are rigging the democratic presidential primary to hurt the chances of vermont sen. bernie sanders, nor for the specific claim that house speaker nancy pelosi scheduled trump's impeachment trial to damage sanders' chances in iowa.\n\nsanders responded to trump's claim with his own tweet : let's be clear about who is rigging what: it is donald trump's action to use the power of the federal government for his own political benefit that is the cause of the impeachment trial. democrats are going to unite to sweep him out of the white house in november.\n\nthe new york times reported that pelosi deputy chief of staff drew hammill said , senator sanders isn't the only senator running, so this doesn't make any sense.\n\nsens. elizabeth warren of massachusetts, amy klobuchar of minnesota and michael bennet of colorado are also candidates.\n\nchuck schumer and the china deal\n\nthey asked one of our democratic -- cryin' chuck schumer -- 'what do you think of the deal?' -- two weeks ago. he had no idea what the deal was. never saw the deal; it's totally guarded. 'i don't like it. i don't like the deal,' he said. 'well, have you seen it?' yeah, i think i know what...' 'well, why don't you like it?' 'well, they took the tariffs off.' actually, we didn't. he didn't know anything about the deal. he just said exactly what probably you should say, as a politician. 'how do you like the deal?' 'i don't like the deal.' 'do you know the deal?' 'uh, uh, sort of.' he never saw the deal. he knew nothing about it. -- january 15 speech on signing of phase one trade agreement with china\n\nfacts first: there was no exchange in which schumer, the democrats' senate leader, said, uh, uh, sort of when asked if he knows the contents of trump's china deal, or that he conceded he merely thinks he knows what's in it. also, the deal does : there was no exchange in which schumer, the democrats' senate leader, said, uh, uh, sort of when asked if he knows the contents of trump's china deal, or that he conceded he merely thinks he knows what's in it. also, the deal does reduce , though not eliminate, some of the us tariffs on imported chinese products.\n\nafter trump made this accusation on january 15, schumer responded the same day: i know what's in the deal. i'm not sure the president does. if he knows what's in the deal -- he should throw it away and take china back to the negotiating table. i will cheer him on if he does.\n\nforeign affairs\n\nlocating baghdadi\n\nrecounting the us military raid that resulted in the death of isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi, trump said, we found him about a month-and-a-half ago. again, a person walks in from the cia and says, 'sir, we have him.' i said, 'you have who.' 'al-baghdadi.' i said, 'you got to be kidding.' -- january 17 fundraiser (audio obtained by cnn's kevin liptak)\n\nfacts first: we don't know when trump was informed that baghdadi's location in syria had been identified, but it was clearly more than a month-and-a-half ago. he died on october 26, more than two-and-a-half months prior to this claim, so trump would have been inaccurate even if he was talking about the raid itself.\n\nwe might let this go if it was a one-time slip, but it wasn't. intentionally or unintentionally, trump has repeatedly moved the dates of his accomplishments closer to the present.\n\nsoleimani and hezbollah\n\ntrump spoke about the january 3 airstrike in baghdad that killed iranian military commander qasem soleimani and associate abu mahdi al-muhandis, deputy leader of iraq's popular mobilization forces, an umbrella organization of iraqi militant groups. he said, he [soleimani] got off the plane and they said, 'sir, and he met the head of hezbollah, we get two for the price of one. he met the head of hezbollah.' -- january 17 fundraiser (audio obtained by cnn's kevin liptak)\n\nfacts first: trump referred inaccurately to muhandis -- a : trump referred inaccurately to muhandis -- a founder of iraq-based militant group kataib hezbollah, which is separate from the lebanon-based militant group hezbollah. the head of hezbollah, hassan nasrallah, was not with soleimani and is still alive. it's possible that trump was confused because soleimani had met with nasrallah in beirut in the days before the airstrike, according to nasrallah\n\nthe difference between hezbollah (which means party of god) and kataib hezbollah (which means brigades of the party of god) is not trivial. though both groups are backed by iran, and though kataib hezbollah is known to have received support from hezbollah, they are entirely independent entities, said journalist hala jaber, author of the 1997 book hezbollah: born with a vengeance. the groups do have shared, common interests and ideologies, no question, and do support each other, but they are distinct organizations with their own country-specific reasons for existing, jaber said.\n\ntrade\n\nthe size of trump's trade deals\n\ntrump called the us-mexico-canada agreement (usmca) and the phase one trade deal with china the two biggest trade deals in the world ever done. he specified that the china deal is the biggest deal ever done in the history of our country. -- january 16 exchange with reporters after remarks on prayer in public schools\n\nwe just made the two largest trade deals in history: one with china and the other one with mexico, canada. -- january 17 speech at event for college football champion louisiana state university\n\nfacts first: biggest can be defined in different ways, but trade experts say neither deal is among the two biggest trade deals in us history. since 'biggest trade deal' has no standard meaning, it may be possible to justify his statements by constructing a measure that fits it and by limiting the number of trade agreements that one compares to. but by any sensible interpretation, he's wrong, said : biggest can be defined in different ways, but trade experts say neither deal is among the two biggest trade deals in us history. since 'biggest trade deal' has no standard meaning, it may be possible to justify his statements by constructing a measure that fits it and by limiting the number of trade agreements that one compares to. but by any sensible interpretation, he's wrong, said alan deardorff , a university of michigan professor of international economics who focuses on trade. deardorff said: both deals, measured in terms of the volume of trade that they cover, are smaller than the trans-pacific partnership that obama negotiated, and much smaller than the uruguay round that created the world trade organization.\n\nthe usmca includes the us, canada and mexico. the trans-pacific partnership, from which trump withdrew the us, included all three of those countries but also nine others . also, the usmca is a modification to the north american free trade agreement (nafta) rather than a deal created from scratch; many of its changes are small.\n\ngary clyde hufbauer, a nonresident senior fellow at the peterson institute for international economics, said that george w. bush granting china the status of permanent normal trade relations in 2001 was far bigger than trump's preliminary deal with china, covering a far greater number of subjects (tariffs, non-tariff barriers, investment and others). hufbauer also noted that it is not clear if the china deal's pledged increase in purchases of us exports -- $200 billion in additional purchases over two years -- will actually materialize.\n\nwashing machine tariffs\n\ntrump said that south korean companies are building washing machine factories in the united states because they don't want to pay the 25% tariff. -- january 14 campaign rally in milwaukee, wisconsin\n\nfacts first: there is : there is no trump washing machine tariff of 25% . in the first year of his tariffs on washing machines, which took effect in 2018, the tariff was 20% on the first 1.2 million imports, then 50% on additional imports. in the second year, it is 18% on the first 1.2 million imports, then 45% on additional imports. in the third year, it is 16% on the first 1.2 million, then 40% on additional imports.\n\ntrump might well have made an innocent slip rather than an intentional falsehood, but this was at least the sixth time he has cited an inaccurate percentage for these tariffs.\n\ntrump's 2016 crowds in texas\n\ni remember 2016 -- the election. and the fake news -- these people back here -- they were going -- they were saying, 'trump: going to have a hard time winning texas.' and we came. we made speeches...remember? we'd have 25-, 30,000 people standing on line. can't get in. and i said, 'why am i going to have a hard time with texas?' -- january 19 speech to the american farm bureau federation\n\nfacts first: there is no evidence to support this claim. trump has : there is no evidence to support this claim. trump has repeatedly exaggerated the number of supporters stuck outside his events unable to get in.\n\nafter his rally in dallas in 2015 during the republican primary, the dallas news reported that up to 20,000 people were expected, but the upper levels of the arena were largely empty...arena personnel estimated attendance at about 15,000. the texas tribune reported that trump's february 2016 rally in fort worth did not have a capacity crowd, either.\n\nwhen trump claimed that thousands of supporters were stuck outside a june 2016 rally at a dallas entertainment venue with a capacity under 5,000, local radio station kera news said it was really 100 to 200. nbc reported that several thousand were turned away from a june 2016 rally in the woodlands, but there were no reports that the number was anywhere near 25,000; that venue had a capacity of about 5,000.\n\nmexico and the wall\n\nyou know with the wall: we're building a wall. you know that, right?... and by the way, they think they caught me -- they never catch us -- because, you know: mexico's paying for the wall. you know that. you'll see that. it's all worked out. mexico spent -- it's driving them crazy. now they say, 'ok, he's building the wall, but mexico didn't pay.' mexico will pay. and here's the thing, here's the thing, you'll see that. it'll come out. we'll do it sometime during the debate or maybe before our debate, the real debate that people are going to watch. -- january 14 campaign rally in milwaukee, wisconsin\n\nfacts first: mexico is still not paying for trump's border wall, which his administration is seeking to fund in part with taxpayer money appropriated by congress and in part with taxpayer money : mexico is still not paying for trump's border wall, which his administration is seeking to fund in part with taxpayer money appropriated by congress and in part with taxpayer money taken from the military\n\nmexico is spending a significant amount of money to help the us on migration issues, deploying thousands of troops to both its guatemala border and its us border to thwart would-be asylum seekers. it's possible to argue that this is like mexico paying for a kind of human wall . but trump's wall is an actual, physical project that mexico is not funding.\n\nthe trump administration says that about 101 miles of wall had been built on the mexican border as of january 10. only one of these miles was built in places where no barriers had existed before; the other 100 miles replaced or reinforced previously existing barriers.\n\nchuck grassley and james comey\n\ntrump said of republican sen. chuck grassley: this guy is the toughest guy. he can say something in a nice manner and everybody is afraid. right? he made comey choke during the hearing. he said, 'did you leak anything to the press?' 'what? what? what? what?' comey choked like a dog, and he was being nice when he said it. -- january 15 speech on signing of phase one trade agreement with china\n\nfacts first: james comey did not say anything like what? what? what? what? when grassley : james comey did not say anything like what? what? what? what? when grassley asked him at a may 2017 senate judiciary committee hearing about whether he had any role in leaks to the media.\n\ngrassley said, it is frustrating when the fbi refuses to answer this committee's questions, but leaks relevant information to the media. in other words, they don't talk to us, but somebody talks to the media. director comey, have you ever been an anonymous source in news reports about matters relating to the trump investigation or the clinton investigation?\n\ncomey responded, never.\n\ngrassley: question two, relatively related: have you ever authorized someone else at the fbi to be an anonymous source in news reports about the trump investigation or the clinton investigation?\n\ncomey: no.\n\ngrassley: has any classified information relating to president trump or his association -- associates been declassified and shared with the media?\n\ncomey: not to my knowledge.\n\nrepeats\n\nhere are the repeat false claims we have previously fact checked in a weekly roundup:\n\nukraine and impeachment\n\nthe accuracy of the whistleblower\n\nyou had a fake whistleblower that wrote a report that bore no relationship to what was said. everything was false. -- january 16 exchange with reporters after remarks on prayer in public schools\n\nfacts first: the whistleblower's account of trump's july call with zelensky has been proven highly accurate. in fact, the : the whistleblower's account of trump's july call with zelensky has been proven highly accurate. in fact, the rough transcript released by trump himself showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. you can read a full fact check here\n\nthe house impeachment proceedings\n\ncryin' chuck schumer just said, 'the american people want a fair trial in the senate.' true, but why didn't nervous nancy and corrupt politician adam 'shifty' schiff give us a fair trial in the house. it was the most lopsided & unfair basement hearing in the history of congress! -- january 14 tweet\n\nfacts first: the house did not hold a trial at all. under the constitution, it is the : the house did not hold a trial at all. under the constitution, it is the senate that has the sole power to try impeachments.\n\nthis is not merely a matter of semantics. during the house impeachment process, republicans complained that trump was being denied constitutional rights afforded to criminal defendants -- wrongly suggesting to the public that the house process was tantamount to a trial.\n\nthe house proceedings did involve closed-door hearings in a secure room in a capitol basement, but there were also, of course, subsequent public hearings.\n\ntrump's approval with republicans\n\n95% approval rating in the republican party, a record. thank you! - january 18 tweet\n\nfacts first: trump's approval rating among republicans is very high, regularly in the 80s and sometimes creeping into the 90s, but it has not been 95% in any recent major poll we could find.\n\ntrump was at 89% approval with republicans in a npr/pbs newshour/marist poll conducted january 7-12, 93% in a quinnipiac university poll conducted january 8-12, 88% in an ipsos/reuters poll conducted january 6-7, 89% in a gallup poll conducted december 2-15.\n\nthe quinnipiac poll at which he was at 93% had an overall margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, and a larger margin of error for the smaller sub-sample of republican voters, so that poll found that it's possible trump's true number is indeed 95% -- but it's not accurate to make leaps from the numbers the polls actually found without explaining that this is what you are doing.\n\nregardless, trump's approval rating is not a record. gallup's website features data on approval rating by party for every president since harry truman; george w. bush hit 99% in gallup polling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001. his father, george h.w. bush, hit 97% at the end of the gulf war in 1991. ronald reagan, richard nixon, and dwight eisenhower all went higher than 90%.\n\ntrade\n\nchina's agricultural spending, part 1\n\nbut then we started doing the big tariffs -- taking in literally tens of billions of dollars. and we started giving money back. i went to sonny perdue. i said, 'sonny, what did china -- what was the number that china did last year?' he said, 'sir, they bought $16 billion.' i said, 'oh, that's good. what did they do the year before?' 'sir, they bought $12 billion worth of product.' i said, 'good.' so it's $12 billion. we gave you the $12 billion. then, $16 billion. we gave you the $16 billion so you weren't hurt. -- january 19 speech to the american farm bureau federation\n\nfacts first: trump was significantly understating chinese agricultural purchases. in 2017, the year before the trade war began, china spent $19.5 billion, according to department of agriculture figures. in 2016, it was $21.4 billion. chinese purchases plummeted to $9.1 billion in 2018.\n\nchina's agricultural spending, part 2\n\ntrump said the most china has ever spent on us agricultural products is $20 billion. -- january 19 speech to the american farm bureau federation\n\nfacts first: china spent $25.9 billion on american agricultural products in 2012, according to figures from the department of agriculture.\n\neconomy\n\nenergy production\n\ntrump claimed three times that the us is now the world's number one energy producer. on two of these occasions, he claimed the us had not previously held this status. (on one of these two, he said, we weren't even close.) and he claimed the achievement had happened because he ended the war on american energy.\n\nfacts first: the us has not just now become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot : the us has not just now become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012 , according to the us government's energy information administration -- under the very obama administration trump is accusing of perpetrating a war on the industry.\n\nthe us became the top producer of crude oil in particular during trump's tenure. the united states has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when us natural gas production surpassed that of russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded saudi arabia's, the energy information administration says\n\nhousehold income\n\ntrump claimed twice that real median household income has increased by $10,000 during his presidency. in addition to $5,000 in wage gains, he added $3,100 from regulatory cuts and $2,500 for energy savings.\n\nfacts first: it's not true that household income gains under trump have already hit $10,000 in less than three years. a firm called sentier research found pre-tax income gains of about $5,000 between january 2017 and november 2019. savings from energy or from regulation would be included in the pre-tax gains, not added over top of them.\n\nyou can read a longer fact check here\n\nthe estate tax\n\ntrump twice claimed to have eliminated the estate tax, emphasizing that this would benefit small farmers.\n\nfacts first: trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. his 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but : trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. his 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but did not get rid of the tax entirely\n\nit's also misleading to suggest that the estate tax had been a particular burden on small farms and small businesses; very few of them were paying the tax even before trump's changes came into effect. according to the tax policy center, a mere 50 farms and closely held businesses were among the 5,190 estates to pay the estate tax in 2017, before trump's tax law. the center wrote on its website: the tax policy center estimates that small farms and businesses will pay $20 million in estate tax in 2017, one-tenth of 1 percentage of the total estate tax revenue.\n\nthe wotus rule and puddles\n\nso, this rule gave bureaucrats virtually unlimited authority to regulate stock tanks, drainage ditches, and isolated ponds as navigable waterways and navigable water. you believe that? sometimes, you'd have a puddle -- a little puddle. and they'd consider that a lake. -- january 19 speech to the american farm bureau federation\n\nfacts first: puddles were not covered by the obama-era waters of the united states environmental regulation; the rule explicitly : puddles were not covered by the obama-era waters of the united states environmental regulation; the rule explicitly said puddles do not qualify as one of the waters in question.\n\na preamble to the rule explained : the final rule adds an exclusion for puddles. the proposed rule did not explicitly exclude puddles because the agencies have never considered puddles to meet the minimum standard for being a 'water of the united states,' and it is an inexact term...however, numerous commenters asked that the agencies expressly exclude them in a rule. the final rule does so.\n\nmanufacturing jobs\n\ntrump claimed to have added 600,000 manufacturing jobs.\n\nfacts first: trump was exaggerating. the economy added 487,000 manufacturing jobs between january 2017, when trump took office, and december 2019, official data : trump was exaggerating. the economy added 487,000 manufacturing jobs between january 2017, when trump took office, and december 2019, official data shows . the number is 514,000 jobs added if you go back to november 2016, the month of trump's election, as trump often likes to do.\n\nwhat obama said about manufacturing jobs\n\nand our manufacturing numbers are fantastic. you see that. remember? manufacturing. phil, you remember? 'there's no more manufacturing.' and then we have almost 600,000 jobs. they said, the last administration, 'you'd need a magic wand to bring back manufacturing.' so i guess we found the magic wand. we found the magic wand. -- january 19 speech to the american farm bureau federation\n\nfacts first: trump's magic wand comment was a reference to a remark president barack obama made at a pbs : trump's magic wand comment was a reference to a remark president barack obama made at a pbs town hall in 2016 -- but he was inaccurately describing what obama said. obama never said, there's no more manufacturing. rather, obama scoffed at trump's promises to bring back what obama called jobs of the past without providing specifics on how he would do so. contrary to trump's repeated claims, obama didn't say manufacturing was dead or that new manufacturing jobs could not be created; obama boasted of how many manufacturing jobs were being created during his presidency, saying, we actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we've had in most of our history.\n\nthe unemployment rate\n\nthe unemployment rate is now 3.5% -- the lowest in over 51 years, half a century. -- january 19 speech to the american farm bureau federation\n\nfacts first: trump's over 51 years is one of his usual slight exaggerations of an already-impressive number. the 3.5% : trump's over 51 years is one of his usual slight exaggerations of an already-impressive number. the 3.5% unemployment rate for december 2019 was the lowest since december 1969, exactly 50 years prior. (if you ignore the fact that it was the same 3.5% in november and september).\n\nimmigration\n\ndeportations to latin america\n\ntrump said that, prior to his presidency, guatemala, honduras and el salvador refused to take back criminals the us wanted to deport, but now they do.\n\nfacts first: trump was mixing up two separate issues. while the trump administration does have : trump was mixing up two separate issues. while the trump administration does have new agreements with all three of guatemala, honduras and el salvador, those agreements are related to the handling of people who come to the us seeking asylum, not criminals the us is seeking to deport. in 2016, just prior to trump's presidency, none of the three countries was on the list of countries that immigration and customs enforcement considered recalcitrant (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the us.\n\ndemocrats and borders\n\ntrump claimed twice that democrats support open borders.\n\nfacts first: even the democratic presidential candidates who have advocated the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren and former housing and urban development secretary julián castro (who dropped out of the race earlier this month), do not support completely unrestricted migration, as trump suggests.\n\na quote about illegal immigration\n\ntrump said this is what happened when he claimed that democrats would give undocumented immigrants rolls-royce luxury cars: you know, i one time said, 'we're going to get everybody a rolls-royce,' and cnn or one of them said, 'they never said -- and they never promised -- a rolls-royce, donald trump lied tonight.' i said, 'every illegal alien will have a rolls-royce.' they said, 'he lied tonight.' -- january 14 campaign rally in milwaukee, wisconsin\n\nfacts first: that is not exactly what happened.\n\ntrump did make a joke at a 2018 campaign rally in arizona about democrats wanting to give undocumented immigrants a free rolls-royce -- but then, at a rally the next day in nevada, he made a non-joking claim that democrats want to give them cars. he continued to joke about a rolls-royce in particular, but he was challenged on the assertion of fact. he said in nevada: they want to open your borders, let people in, illegally. and then they want to pay for those people for health care, for education. they want to give them cars, they want to give them driver's licenses. i said last night, we did a great -- we did a great, great rally in arizona last night, and i said -- i said last night, 'what kind of car will they supply them? will it be a rolls-royce?'\n\nmilitary and foreign affairs\n\nmilitary spending\n\nit's rebuilt completely. we spent $2.5 trillion. -- january 17 fundraiser (audio obtained by cnn's kevin liptak)\n\nfacts first: trump was exaggerating. defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion, and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of obama's tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in october 2016.\n\ntodd harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the center for strategic and international studies, said he thinks trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to the $2.5 trillion figure -- but the 2020 fiscal year just started on october 1, and harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by congress.\n\nammunition\n\nand we have the best military in the world. when i came in it was totally depleted, it was gone. we had fighter jets that were 54 years old. and it was terrible...we didn't have ammunition, and now we have so much ammunition we don't know what the hell to do with it. -- january 17 fundraiser (audio obtained by cnn's kevin liptak)\n\nfacts first: according to military leaders, there was a shortfall in certain kinds of munitions, particularly precision-guided bombs, late in the obama presidency and early in the trump presidency. but the claim that we didn't have ammunition is a significant exaggeration. military leaders did not say that they had completely run out of any kind of bomb, let alone ammunition in general.\n\nyou can read a full fact check of trump's claims about munitions levels here\n\nveterans choice\n\nour military is rebuilt. our -- if you see the va, you know how well that's doing now. we have veterans choice. that was a big difference where you can go out, get a doctor if they can't take care of you immediately. so our vets are taken care of for the first time, really. -- january 13 interview with wwl-tv in new orleans\n\nfacts first: the veterans choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by sens. bernie sanders and the late john mccain, was : the veterans choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by sens. bernie sanders and the late john mccain, was signed into law by obama in 2014. in 2018, trump signed the va mission act, which expanded and changed the program.\n\ncomplaints about the va\n\nyou don't hear complaints about the va anymore. do you notice? -- january 15 speech on signing of phase one trade agreement with china\n\nfacts first: we can't be sure of what trump himself has heard about conditions at the va, but it's just not true that the rest of us no longer hear complaints.\n\nmerely since august 2019, there have been news stories about  11 suspicious deaths at the louis a. johnson va medical center, how veterans affairs failed to stop a pathologist who misdiagnosed 3,000 cases and wasn't fired until 2018, how a veterans affairs medical center in west virginia is being investigated over allegations that one of its physicians sexually assaulted more than a dozen patients, and how a veteran at a va facility in georgia was allegedly bitten by ants 100 times before his death.\n\nthe turkey-syria border\n\n...we did something in syria. we were guarding their border. at one point, we had thousands of people -- the syrian border, between turkey and syria. it's been there for a thousand years. -- january 14 campaign rally in milwaukee, wisconsin\n\nfacts first: there is no basis for the claim that there has been fighting over the turkey-syria border for 1,000 years; modern-day turkey and syria were both part of the ottoman empire that was only dissolved after world war i, and the border between them is less than 100 years old.\n\nthe border he refers to -- the turkish-syria border -- was established in 1923 with the treaty of lausanne and the founding of the republic of turkey. the exception to this is the province of hatay, which passed from syrian to turkish control following a referendum, said lisel hintz, assistant professor of international relations and european studies at johns hopkins, who called a previous version of trump's claim -- in which trump said there had been fighting for 2,000 years -- patently and irresponsibly false.\n\nsoldiers in syria\n\nso they said, 'trump stayed in syria. trump stayed.' so people said to me, 'why are you staying in syria?' because i kept the oil. which frankly, we should have done in iraq, ok, a long time ago. you have no idea the things and the decisions i've seen. so they say, 'trump stayed in syria,' i didn't pull out. i did pull out. we have the oil really secure. -- january 14 campaign rally in milwaukee, wisconsin\n\nfacts first: trump did not pull out of syria; regardless of why he has kept some troops there, they are there. while he did withdraw us troops from the northeastern region in advance of a turkish offensive in that region, he has kept hundreds of troops in the country.\n\ngen. mark milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said in november that there would be probably in the 500-ish frame. maybe 600 soldiers left in northeast syria (he said the number would definitely be less than 1,000), in addition to the separate force of more than 100 soldiers stationed in southern syria near jordan.\n\nmilitary leaders have said that the us will not keep any revenue from the syrian oil fields they are securing, but trump has continued to suggest that the us is seizing the oil for itself.\n\ndemocrats and soleimani\n\nthe democrats and the fake news are trying to make terrorist soleimani into a wonderful guy, only because i did what should have been done for 20 years. -- january 13 tweet\n\nfacts first: the democrats were not trying to make the iranian commander, whom trump had killed in a us airstrike, sound wonderful. prominent democrats, such as the party's presidential candidates and congressional leaders, criticized trump's decision to order the killing of soleimani, but they offered no defense of soleimani's actions or personality.\n\npelosi, for example, called soleimani a terrible person who did bad things, explicitly emphasizing that her opposition to killing him was not based in any sympathy for him or for iran. you can read a longer fact check here\n\nmoney and the iran deal\n\nobama gave them $150 billion, $1.8 billion in cash. -- january 14 campaign rally in milwaukee, wisconsin\n\nfacts first: the sum in question was iranian money frozen in foreign financial institutions because of sanctions, not us government money -- and experts say the total was significantly lower than $150 billion. you can read a fuller fact check : the sum in question was iranian money frozen in foreign financial institutions because of sanctions, not us government money -- and experts say the total was significantly lower than $150 billion. you can read a fuller fact check here\n\npre-existing conditions\n\ni stand stronger than anyone in protecting your healthcare with pre-existing conditions. -- january 13 tweet\n\nmini mike bloomberg is spending a lot of money on false advertising. i was the person who saved pre-existing conditions in your healthcare, you have it now, while at the same time winning the fight to rid you of the expensive, unfair and very unpopular individual mandate... -- january 13 tweet\n\nwe will protect patients with pre-existing conditions like nobody else... -- january 14 campaign rally in milwaukee, wisconsin\n\nfacts first: trump is not the person who saved protections for people with pre-existing conditions. the opposite is true: the trump administration and congressional republicans have repeatedly put forward : trump is not the person who saved protections for people with pre-existing conditions. the opposite is true: the trump administration and congressional republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. trump is currently supporting a republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of obamacare void. he has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.\n\npeople crying\n\ni terminated one of the most ridiculous regulations of all: the last administration's disastrous waters of the united states rule. thank you. it's gone. that was a rule that basically took your property away from you. i'll never forget: at the white house signing, i had probably 30, 35 people behind me -- farmers and homebuilders and others -- people that haven't cried in many years. people that weren't -- some of them were so tough, they never cried. they didn't cry when they were babies. and they were crying. no, we gave them their life back. -- january 19 speech to the american farm bureau federation
general lloyd austin testifies before the senate armed services committee during his conformation hearing to be the next secretary of defense on january 19 in washington. jim lo scalzo/pool/getty images\n\ndefense secretary lloyd austin has dismissed hundreds of members of 42 pentagon advisory boards, including controversial late appointments by the trump administration, as the pentagon announced a review of the membership of the boards tuesday.\n\nthe announcement comes after the trump administration appointed several loyalists to advisory boards in the final months of his administration, including former trump campaign manager corey lewandowski and david bossie who served as trump's deputy campaign manager.\n\nthe pentagon took no pains to hide the fact austin took the action because of concerns the trump administration had openly packing some boards with loyalists.\n\nthe secretary was deeply concerned with the pace and the extent of recent changes to advisory committees and this review will allow him to get his arms around the purpose of those boards and to ensure that these boards are providing the best advice to department policies, chief pentagon spokesperson john kirby said.\n\nthe wall street journal was first to report austin's decision.\n\ncurrent members being told to step down are only those appointed by the pentagon and not those appointed by the white house or congress. for example four people appointed by the department of defense to a congressionally mandated commission on stripping the names of confederate generals from military bases will be removed but others on that panel to be appointed by congress will remain.\n\na review of all the boards, and whether they are still needed, will now be the focus before new members are named.\n\nthere's no question that the frenetic activity that occurred to the composition of so many boards in just the period of november to january deeply concerned the secretary and certainly helped drive him to this decision, kirby added.\n\nour stewardship responsibilities require that we continually assess to ensure each advisory committee provides appropriate value today and in the future, as times and requirements change, austin said in a memo to the department.\n\nthe 42 advisory boards cost taxpayers potentially millions of dollars each year and some of their work is believed to be potentially redundant which added to the need for the review.\n\nthe action effectively removes, for now, several hundred people serving on boards who advise on everything from defense policy, science, innovation, health issues, coastal engineering, sexual misconduct and diversity and inclusion.\n\nmore background: in december, cnn reported that former president trump purged a pentagon business advisory board and replaced its members with his former campaign manager and deputy campaign manager, neither of whom have served in the military or have any apparent experience with the defense industry.\n\none trump loyalist expected to keep her advisory role is kellyanne conway who trump named to the air force academy of visitors. seats on that board are controlled by the president so the austin memo does not cover those panels where the white house names members.
(cnn) — a medida que pasó de hazmerreír a candidato en las primarias, de favorito a nominado, y luego de candidato aparentemente condenado en las elecciones generales a presidente electo, donald trump ofreció un paquete de promesas sorprendentemente consistente.\n\nahora, menos de una semana después de haberse posesionado, está comenzando a cumplirlas.\n\nla afilada maquinaria del gobierno federal todavía no se ha puesto a trabajar para realizar sus ambiciones más extremas, como predijeron muchos observadores expertos, y el peso del cargo tampoco lo ha hecho sentir más humilde ni ha despertado en él una especie de reflexión interna.\n\nen cambio, como vimos durante las primarias (mientras los republicanos quedaban detrás de trump solo para ser ridiculizados o ignorados), el poder lo ha envalentonado.\n\nel viernes, el mismo día en que prestó juramento, firmó un decreto para que las agencias federales comiencen a aliviar la carga del obamacare.\n\npublicidad\n\nmira: fin de obamacare dejaría a millones sin seguro médico en nueva york\n\ntras una semana de atacar a los medios -y conseguir que su nuevo secretario de prensa siga su ejemplo- por reportar de manera precisa sobre la cantidad de personas que asistieron a su toma de posesión, el lunes pasado trump decidió restablecer la llamada política de ciudad de méxico, que prohíbe a las organizaciones internacionales no gubernamentales que realizan o promueven abortos y campañas de planificación familiar que reciban financiamiento del gobierno de estados unidos.\n\nel acuerdo transpacífico (tpp, por sus siglas en inglés) está muerto. el tratado de libre comercio de américa del norte (tlcan o nafta, por sus siglas en inglés) está contra las cuerdas.\n\nalgunas cuentas de redes sociales del gobierno que discuten o se refieren a temas básicos de ciencias ambientales han sido reprimidas.\n\neste martes, trump firmó dos decretos que autorizan avanzar en la construcción de los oleoductos keystone xl y dakota, detenida en diciembre pasado por el entonces presidente barack obama.\n\nel muro fue lo siguiente. este miércoles llegó con la firma de un decreto para designar fondos federales para la construcción del muro fronterizo, aunque no pronunció palabra sobre cómo obligará a méxico a pagar la cuenta. ese mismo día, le dijo a abc news que espera comenzar la construcción del muro muy rápido, aunque hacer que méxico pague por él puede complicar el asunto.\n\nlee: lo que se necesita para construir el muro de trump\n\nacciones simultáneas buscan aumentar las deportaciones y obligar a las llamadas ciudades santuario a colaborar con agentes federales para deportar a migrantes indocumentados, además de asfixiarlas quitándoles millonarias subvenciones de fondos federales.\n\nmira: nueva york desafiará decreto de trump contra ciudades santuario\n\nen las palabras que pronunció en el departamento de seguridad nacional, trump socavó cualquier noción de que a su gobierno le falta astucia para implementar de manera efectiva su agenda, con o sin el consentimiento del congreso.\n\nla gente está sorprendida de escuchar que no necesitamos nuevas leyes, dijo. trabajaremos con el sistema y la estructura que ya existen.\n\nel esfuerzo está programado para continuar a lo largo de la semana. aunque no será llamada oficialmente expulsión musulmana, la orden de dilatar o bloquear la entrada a estados unidos de personas provenientes de países de mayoría musulmana, naciones propensas al terror, es la conclusión lógica de una política que trump presentó en diciembre del 2015, antes de las primeras elecciones de las primarias.\n\npero ahí no termina. se espera que esta semana trump también ordene la interrupción del programa de refugiados de estados unidos, al menos cerrándoles temporalmente la puerta a los sirios que huyen de la guerra civil y de la catástrofe humanitaria en su país.\n\ntambién se está concentrando en lo que ha llamado una carnicería que se está produciendo en casa. el lenguaje alarmista es parecido al de su campaña, cuando solía describir a las ciudades estadounidenses como zonas de guerra empapadas de sangre. el martes, hacia el final del día, trump amenazó con intervenir en chicago, a través de un mensaje de twitter en el que dijo que si no detiene esta horrible carnicería con 228 tiroteos y 42 asesinatos en el 2017, les enviará a los (agentes) federales.\n\nif chicago doesn't fix the horrible carnage going on, 228 shootings in 2017 with 42 killings (up 24% from 2016), i will send in the feds! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) january 25, 2017\n\nhoras después, hacia las 7 de la mañana de este miércoles, pidió una gran investigación sobre lo que ha calificado como una masiva conspiración de fraude electoral, que ha vendido como una explicación de su derrota en el voto popular en las elecciones presidenciales. todo ello aunque, de nuevo, no exista ninguna evidencia de que eso haya ocurrido.\n\ni will be asking for a major investigation into voter fraud, including those registered to vote in two states, those who are illegal and…. — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) january 25, 2017\n\neven, those registered to vote who are dead (and many for a long time). depending on results, we will strengthen up voting procedures! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) january 25, 2017\n\ny si todo lo anterior suena descabellado, o como algo que nunca sucederá realmente, no debería. ya no debería sonar así. trump prometió aplastar la estructura de poder de washington y ha demostrado que desafiará todas las normas, sociales y políticas. sus primeras acciones han opuesto a los republicanos a proyectos de comercio que alguna vez defendieron y tienen a los demócratas tambaleándose por un mensaje.\n\nmira: así se ve la frontera entre ee.uu. y méxico (antes del muro de trump)\n\nno hay que olvidar que trump es nuevo en la ciudad y que su partido controla ahora el capitolio. lo que ha hecho esta semana requiere un bolígrafo para firmar y no mucho más. pero todavía no está clara la efectividad que tendrá cuando necesite 60 votos del senado para pasar una ley de gastos.\n\ntanto el congreso como las cortes tendrán que decir cómo pagar por estas cosas. menos de una semana después del comienzo de la era trump, él todavía no ha tenido que entenderse con una tectónica burocracia gubernamental que ralentiza todas las propuestas.\n\nrecuerda: uno de los primeros decretos firmados por el hoy expresidente barack obama durante su gobierno buscaba cerrar la prisión de guantánamo y los centros secretos de detención.\n\nun congreso hostil mantuvo viva la base de guantánamo, aunque obama haya logrado reducir el número de presos allí. trump está ahora preparado para reconstruirla una y otra vez y, según informes de the new york times y the washington post, el equipo de trump estaría planeando revivir las cárceles clandestinas de la cia.\n\ncnn no ha confirmado esa información y el secretario de prensa de la casa blanca, sean spicer, dice que los planes no provienen de la casa blanca. pero se alinean con otra de las promesas que trump hizo repetidamente en la campaña: utilizar de nuevo técnicas de tortura como el waterboarding (ahogamiento simulado o submarino) y otras mucho peores.\n\nlee: trump asegura que la tortura funciona en los interrogatorios\n\n¿y por qué tendrías que dudar de él?
the 17-year-old son of mexican immigrants, who was diagnosed with stage four hodgkin's lymphoma in 2018, is voting for the vermont senator largely because of medicare for all.\n\ntrejo-ibarra, after going into remission, decided to get more politically involved and will serve as a precinct captain for sanders in saturday's nevada caucuses . it fills a dual purpose for him: he wants to fight for people who can't afford insurance, which covered his own cancer treatments. and he wants to help those who can't speak english participate in the upcoming caucuses.\n\nsanders is counting on young latino voters like trejo-ibarra, who can participate in the caucuses because he'll turn 18 before election day, to carry him to victory in nevada.\n\nnevada will be the first real test of whether sanders has been able to expand his appeal in the diverse universe of democratic voters, particularly within the latino community, where the sanders campaign made a huge push to connect with voters more than eight months ago.\n\nwe believe health care is a human right for all people, sanders said at a saturday rally. we are going to take on the greed of the insurance companies and the drug companies and we are going to pass a medicare for all single-payer program.\n\nsanders will have to contend with the powerful culinary union, which fought for and negotiated excellent health benefits, because of its opposition to medicare for all. the organization says it represents 60,000 hotel and casino workers in nevada and provides health insurance coverage for more than 130,000 people. it is unclear how much the union's opposition to medicare for all will hurt sanders, as the union decided to not endorse any 2020 candidate before the caucuses.\n\nand sanders' presidential rivals are looking to halt the senator's momentum following his win in new hampshire and strong showing in iowa. businessman tom steyer has invested heavily in the state, and former south bend, indiana, mayor pete buttigieg and minnesota sen. amy klobuchar are also running ads in spanish as they look to court latino voters.\n\nbut in interviews with more than two dozen latino voters in spanish and english over the last few days in predominantly latino areas of las vegas, sanders' came up most often, with younger latino voters describing a particularly passionate desire to elect sanders. voters of all ages said they liked sanders' plans on health care, education, the environment and tuition-free college.\n\nas of today, it's very predictable that bernie is going to come in first. i would say that it's unsure who is going to come in second, andres ramirez, a democratic strategist in las vegas, said in an interview with cnn on friday.\n\n'99% of the latino vote hasn't spoken yet'\n\nat the same time that sanders was rallying voters and leading a march to an early voting location, former vice president joe biden took the microphone at a middle school gymnasium just a 10-minute drive away. attendance at his latino-focused phone-banking event was sparse, filled in part with footsoldiers from california who had come to the state to help canvass for him.\n\nbut among them was rafael garcia, who made up his mind to vote for biden that day. this man has done so much for this country, garcia said.\n\nthe 59-year-old boxing trainer said he wasn't worried about biden's losses in iowa and new hampshire, where the former vice president placed fourth and fifth respectively.\n\nit could have been the weather out there, or that new people wanted to be heard, garcia said, noting that voters have many choices this cycle. there were women running. a war hero in pete (buttigieg). i love bernie (sanders). but i'd like to see everybody come out for joe (biden).\n\nthere, biden reminded the crowd, 99% of the latino vote hasn't spoken yet.\n\nbiden led the vermont senator in two january polls from suffolk university and fox news, with sanders coming in second. but polling has been consistently off the mark in nevada, not only because it's difficult to predict who will participate in a caucus, but because many casino workers work unusual hours and the state has a constantly changing population with movement in and out of the state.\n\nage composition of saturday's turnout will also be a factor. sanders has a huge edge among younger voters, while biden does better among older ones. the sanders' team hopes to see a robust turnout among young voters. the fact that 56% of early voters this weekend were first time caucusgoers was a good sign for the vermont senator.\n\nsanders had the edge among latinos nationally in a pew research center poll of democratic and democratic-leaning voters last month: 30% favored the vermont senator, 22% supported biden, 11% backed massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren. all of the other candidates were in low single digits.\n\nmonths of targeted outreach\n\nthe caucuses will be a test of the sanders' campaign's heavy investments in latino outreach. gleaning their data from voter files, sanders' team estimates more than 101,000 nevada latinos have registered to vote since the last caucuses. that number is huge considering only 84,000 democrats caucused in nevada in 2016.\n\nmore than 26,000 nevadans participated in the first two days of early voting over the weekend, according to the party, which estimated that 56 percent were first time caucusgoers.\n\nin 2016, the campaign recognized sanders' popularity among latinos, senior sanders adviser chuck rocha said, but we learned it too late to capitalize on it, because we were building the airplane and flying it at the same time.\n\nthis time, it started investing resources eight months ago, hiring from within the community through what rocha describes as a multi-layered communications operation.\n\nif you can think of any way possible for a latino of any age to consume information to learn about the election, we were talking to them on that platform, rocha said in an interview with cnn.\n\nbeyond television, that included mailers, newspapers, instagram, facebook, spanish-language radio, panel trucks, texts, phone and ads on music streaming services like pandora and spotify.\n\nit helped us reconnect with a young group of latinos who've been following bernie since the last election. it helped us to start building a relationship with an older demographic of latinos, who always vote, but may not have known or trusted bernie in the beginning—but their children did, rocha said.\n\nso we had eight months to talk to them about bernie when nobody else was talking to them, he said. it also helped us start reaching out to a new group of latinos, which is the largest group who are newly registered, who nobody is talking to.\n\nthe sanders campaign says it now has more than 250 staff members on the ground in nevada. it opened the first of their 11 nevada offices in the predominantly latino area of east las vegas last july. in december, new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez co-hosted the first spanish-language town hall for sanders and the campaign has led caucus trainings in spanish, as well as in languages such as tagalog, mandarin and vietnamese.\n\ncandidates build up their nevada operations\n\nsanders isn't alone in investing in nevada. buttigieg recently doubled his staff on the ground and steyer ramped up his operation late last year, putting together a team of latino senior aides to lead his operation.\n\nsteyer, who has spent $14.7 million on ads in nevada to sanders' $1.9 million, also came up frequently in interviews with latino voters, with a majority of people saying they had seen or heard an ad from the campaign.\n\nsanders, steyer, buttigieg and klobuchar are all running ads in spanish in nevada. buttigieg, who speaks spanish, narrates his own ad in spanish. and steyer was the first to go negative in nevada, targeting sanders on his support for medicare for all.\n\nthere's a reason people are nervous about bernie sanders scrapping obamacare, the narrator says in steyer's ad. unions don't like it ... and bernie can't or won't give us a price tag.\n\narmando arciga, a 51-year-old construction worker in las vegas, said outside of a cardenas supermarket that he is voting for steyer because the climate crisis is the number one issue arciga cares about.\n\nnick maldonado, 37, is the ceo of the latino franchise toro taxes, and told cnn at an event hosted by the league of united latin american citizens that his company endorsed steyer.\n\ni appreciate the fact that (steyer's) a businessman, but still a democrat, and still focused on local issues, maldonado said. he touted steyer's latino-run staff in nevada, and said steyer's campaign reached out and asked for an endorsement.\n\nbuttigieg, who is looking to build on his strong performance in iowa and new hampshire, now has more than 100 staff members on the ground in nevada and more than 40% of them speak spanish, according to the campaign.\n\nthe former mayor was quick to criticize klobuchar sunday after both she and steyer were unable to name the president of mexico, andrés manuel lópez obrador, during interviews with telemundo in nevada last week. during a town hall sunday in las vegas, buttigieg was asked what it says about washington experience that a sitting us senator could not name mexico's president?\n\nguess what? it says is that there is more to being prepared than how many years you spent in washington, said buttigieg, who had answered the question correctly in his own interview with telemundo.\n\nbuttigieg's operation began pushing out spanish-language digital ads in december, as well as spanish-language radio ads, which were also narrated by the former mayor. it opened it's east las vegas office in mid-september, conducting caucus trainings in spanish, and providing spanish-language canvassing tools to their volunteers—including their relational organizing tool that allows a volunteer to contact their own contacts on behalf of buttigieg.\n\nstill, several nevada political strategists noted in interviews that sanders' volunteer footprint in nevada was unmatched, while biden's organizing infrastructure has been lighter than expected. despite sanders' apparent edge, it remains unclear whether the friction over his health care plan with the culinary union will benefit more moderate candidates like buttigieg, biden and klobuchar.\n\nbernie has tremendous volunteer investments in nevada, said kristian ramos, a political consultant who works with latino groups like mi familia vota, which is focused on expanding the voting population in nevada.\n\nbut he noted that latino voters over 45 have tended to dominate the caucuses in the past, so the age of voters who turn out will be a major determining factor.\n\nthe question becomes 'can pete buttigieg take all this momentum and turn it into something real in nevada, ramos said, and is that enough to overcome bernie's youth volunteer army?\n\n'he's a go-getter'\n\nwhile sanders is counting on younger voters, he has appealed to latino voters of all ages.\n\nwilliam chavez, 62, said he is voting for sanders and cited the senator's support of the green new deal, tuition-free colleges, and medicare for all as reasons why he supports him.\n\n(sanders) is at that age, he could have just retired and relaxed and enjoy life, but no, he's fighting for the people. and he's trying to unite us, not divide us, chavez, a retired casino worker who lives in las vegas, told cnn at a sanders rally.\n\nhe's a go-getter, chavez said. he had a heart attack, right? i've had two. nothing stops me. nothing stops him.\n\nrosie beltren, a 65-year-old housekeeper who works on the las vegas strip and supports sanders because she believes he will raise the minimum wage and help the many immigrants working in nevada who don't have a pathway to citizenship.\n\nmost important for me: health care. a lot of people need it, beltren said while talking with a friend who was selling tamales in the parking lot of a cardenas supermarket last week. last week i bought one medicine, only one. $248, said beltran, who needed three medications to treat her cancer. i need more than one, but i didn't have the money.\n\nthere are a lot of people who need their papers for work -- they are good people, they work so hard, but they can't get papers, beltren said.\n\nsanders has also drawn the support of keila eustaquio, a 24-year-old deferred action for childhood arrivals recipient who plans to volunteer for his campaign even though she cannot legally vote for him.\n\na lot of people i know are rooting for bernie; we were rooting for him last time ... he just has a lot of plans to do a lot of good things for our community—as far as giving everyone citizenship, healthcare, said eustaquio, who was born in mexico and runs her own business in las vegas. she cited biden as her second choice because i feel safe with him.\n\neustaquio, after a shopping trip at the cardenas market with friends last week, acknowledged that some of sanders' plans are unlikely to pass through congress, a fact that she knows will be used against him if he faces a general election matchup with trump.\n\ntrump has realistic goals and sanders doesn't, she said, but what (sanders) wants to do is life-changing for all of the people.\n\ncorrection: this story has been updated to correct chuck rocha's name.

will be known as the 'party of health care'\n\n(cnn) —\n\nfallout from special counsel robert mueller's report is far from over, but house democratic leaders showed on tuesday that they want to focus attention on defending the affordable care act after the trump administration said that the entire health care law should be struck down.\n\nduring a closed-door house democratic caucus meeting, house speaker nancy pelosi talked about strengthening the health care law, according to an aide in the room, and urged house democrats to remain focused on their agenda of pushing for lower health care costs along with other policy priorities.\n\nin what has been a chaotic series of days since mueller's investigation wrapped, the fight to protect obamacare on tuesday offered house democrats a unifying issue for a diverse caucus that has some members calling for the party to move on with the democratic agenda and others – albeit a small faction – repeating calls for president donald trump's impeachment.\n\na large portion of tuesday's meeting was focused on health care, which democrats are eager to move onto, according to four sources present in the meeting, with rep. adam schiff, chairman of the influential house intelligence committee, saying that the most important thing that happened in the past 24 hours was the administration's attack on former president barack obama's signature health care law.\n\nthe focus on health care comes just days after attorney general william barr sent shock waves through washington by sending lawmakers a summary of the findings of the mueller report. it also comes as democrats are demanding a public release of the report itself.\n\nthe summary stated that the inquiry did not find that the trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 us presidential election and that the special counsel did not draw a conclusion on the question of obstruction of justice. barr further stated that he and deputy attorney general rod rosenstein came to the conclusion that there was not sufficient evidence to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offense.\n\ncongressional democrats, who have been on high alert anticipating the results of the investigation, argue that the american public must have a chance to see what the special counsel wrote in his report, rather than being forced to rely solely on a summary from a trump administration political appointee.\n\nbarr has said that he intends to release as much as possible from the report. in his letter to congress, he said that he is working to determine what can be publicly released, noting that mueller will be involved in scrubbing the report to identify grand jury material that must remain secret.\n\nas they wait to see what will be publicly released, democrats must now grapple with how to navigate a post-mueller political landscape.\n\n'we are going to hammer them on this'\n\ndemocratic leaders made clear during the closed-door house democratic caucus meeting on tuesday that as they wait, they want their members to pivot sharply back to health care.\n\nmultiple democratic committee chairs, including frank pallone, the chair of the house energy and commerce committee, richard neal, the chair of the house ways and means committee, and bobby scott, the chair of the house education and labor committee, all got up during the meeting to speak about both the department of justice filing last night and the legislative package of obamacare fixes and rollbacks of trump administration health care policies that house democrats unveiled on tuesday.\n\nin a filing with a federal appeals court, the justice department said it agreed with the ruling of a federal judge in texas that invalidated the obama-era health care law.\n\nthe message was we are going to hammer them on this, one person inside the room of the democratic caucus meeting said of the justice department filing and republicans. and we should – it's exactly what we campaigned on.\n\ntalking points circulated to house democrats underscored the focus, stating in part trump declares war on health care.\n\nmany members leaving the democrats' caucus meeting on tuesday morning said that while there was discussion in the wake of the mueller report, there was talk in the closed-door meeting about needing to be refocused on their legislative priorities — like health care — while also fulfilling their oversight responsibilities.\n\nrep. david cicilline, a member of the house judiciary committee, said that many democrats believe it's really important to remind the american people the work that we're doing on their behalf. we won an election by focusing on an agenda that focuses on the urgent needs of the american people getting good paying jobs, protecting access to quality affordable health care, taking on the corruption in washington.\n\nwe have to do a better job of talking about it and not allowing all of the attention to be about the oversight responsibilities and russia investigation, cicilline said.\n\nwe can walk and chew gum at the same time, said democratic rep. rosa delauro of connecticut. you can do what we are required to do by way of oversight and investigation and at the same time look at the challenges and the issues that are facing the american people they cried out for us to do something about that last november and let's precisely what we're doing.\n\nas democrats spotlight health care, trump arrived on capitol hill on tuesday with his own message, arguing that the republican party is the party of health care.\n\nasked what his message to americans is following his administration's announcement taking aim at the aca, trump said, let me

breath that we have'\n\npelosi and senate democratic leader chuck schumer countered the president's message on tuesday by arguing that the gop agenda harms americans with pre-existing

the senate floor.\n\npelosi said at an event touting legislation to strengthen the affordable care act that the gop will never stop trying to destroy the affordable health care for america's

collins: i think obamacare ruling will be overturned\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthe house adopted the second part of a rules package friday proposed by democrats that shapes the way the house will conduct business over the next two years.\n\nthe legislation creates a select committee to improve and modernize congress and was passed with overwhelming support, 418-12.\n\nthe vast majority of the rules package was adopted on thursday but in a largely party-line vote, with only three republicans joining democrats to pass it. that's because the package backs democratic priorities, such as defending obamacare in court and creating a select committee on climate change.\n\nhere are a few of the provisions in the overall rules package:\n\nrequires the text of a bill to be public for 72 hours before the house votes on it.\n\nmakes slight changes to the names of the oversight and education committees.\n\nrequires support from a majority of democrats for a motion to vacate the speaker, rather than just one lawmaker.\n\nexpedites consideration of measures with broad bipartisan support.\n\ncreates a bipartisan select committee to modernize and improve congress.\n\nallows congress to suspend the debt limit by passing a budget – also known as the gephardt rule.\n\nbans discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\nallows people to wear religious headgear in the house chamber.\n\nrequires a pay-as-you-go provision, designed to make it harder for legislation to pass if it raises the budget deficit or reduces the surplus (the rule can be waived).\n\nbans members of congress and employees from sitting on corporate boards.\n\nthis story has been updated with additional developments from friday.

(cnn) as democrats push forward in the fight for the party's presidential nomination , one issue is at the top of voters' minds: health care.\n\nboth the new hampshire primary exit polls on tuesday and the iowa caucus entrance polls last week showed that health care has been a key priority. but these voters remain divided over what the future of health care should be -- shifting to a government-run medicare-for-all-style system or shoring up the current programs, primarily obamacare.\n\nthat split is a key reason the party is fracturing over the question of who should be the democratic nominee against president donald trump , who continues to undermine the affordable care act and medicaid.\n\nmore than one-third of democratic voters going to the polls in new hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary said health care was the most important issue in determining their vote, beating out climate change, income equality and foreign policy.\n\nvermont sen. bernie sanders was the clear favorite among this group, drawing support from about one-third of voters, according to exit polls.\n\nformer south bend, indiana, mayor pete buttigieg and minnesota sen. amy klobuchar each attracted about 1 in 5 of these voters, while former vice president joe biden and massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, who have also campaigned on health care, landed in the single digits.\n\nsix in 10 voters supported a single-payer system -- with sanders attracting close to 40% of those voters and buttigieg attracting more than 2 in 10. among those who oppose single-payer, more than 3 in 10 backed buttigieg and more than a quarter voted for klobuchar. biden received 13% of the vote, while sanders and warren were in the single digits.\n\nthe granite state vote came a week after iowa caucusgoers affirmed that health care was the most important issue for choosing a nominee. but the 42% of respondents who picked health care in iowa were split between sanders and buttigieg, with about a quarter supporting each. almost 2 in 5 supported warren while 1 in 6 backed biden and the same for klobuchar.\n\nalmost 3 in 5 iowa democratic caucusgoers supported replacing private health insurance with a government plan, with the rest opposing it.\n\nshaping 2020 from the start\n\nhealth care has been at the forefront of the campaign since the beginning, but the party is split between radically overhauling the nation's health insurance system or taking smaller steps.\n\nsanders, an independent, has led the fight to create a national, single-payer government plan, called medicare for all. it would essentially replace private insurance, providing sweeping benefits at no cost to patients.\n\nbut its price tag -- estimated at around $32 trillion over 10 years -- has spooked many people, providing a line of attack by rivals biden and buttigieg.\n\nwhile sanders has acknowledged he'd have to raise taxes on the middle class, he hasn't laid out specifically how he would cover the tab.\n\nproviding a detailed financing plan for medicare for all may have contributed to the decline of warren's popularity. her poll numbers took a nose dive after she laid out a proposal in november that called for states, employers, corporations and the wealthy to pay for the single-payer system, which she also supports.\n\nmeanwhile, moderates such as biden, buttigieg and klobuchar favor building on the affordable care act. they would add to the obamacare exchanges a government-backed public option, which would presumably have lower premiums and would compete with the private insurers. they would also boost federal subsidies so more people could afford coverage.\n\nwhat happens next\n\nlooking ahead, the candidates are entering very different terrain. the next stop is nevada, which has a large unionized casino industry. sanders and warren have had some trouble garnering support from certain unions, who typically fight hard for premium health benefits. they aren't as eager to give them up in exchange for a government plan, even though the senators have said they'd press employers to give workers higher wages in exchange.\n\nthe culinary union , which represents 60,000 hotel and casino workers and has a long history fighting for their health care, is circulating fliers that warn against supporting sanders and warren, saying they will end or replace culinary healthcare, while the other candidates will protect it.\n\nbiden, in particular, has hit sanders on the impact of medicare for all on union plans.\n\nwhile the path ahead for the democratic candidates remains in flux, there's one party leader who is maintaining a steady course ahead of the november election.\n\nhouse speaker nancy pelosi is setting up her lawmakers as protectors of the affordable care act and of people with pre-existing conditions, following the program laid out in 2018, when democrats' defense of the law helped them take back control of the house amid republican efforts to repeal it.\n\nthe house has since joined a coalition of democratic state attorneys general who are defending the landmark health reform law in a lawsuit filed by a group of republican state attorneys general and backed by trump's justice department.
washington (cnn) here are the stories our panel of top political reporters have on their radar, in this week's inside politics forecast.\n\n1. war powers act vote\n\nsenators get back to president donald trump's impeachment trial on tuesday afternoon -- but first they may vote to limit the president's ability to take military action against iran.\n\nas early as next week, they may vote to rebuke president trump for using military action in iran without congressional authorization,said, referring to the us strike on iranian military general qasem soleimani\n\ntim kaine, the virginia senator, has a resolution to essentially force the president to come back to congress before going ahead with any further military action in iran, davis said. so it may be that they may vote to essentially rein in the president's war powers at the very same time they are weighing whether to remove him from office.\n\na similar measure already passed in the house . davis said there appear to be enough votes for it to pass in the senate too, although likely not enough to override a presidential veto.\n\n2. is trump worried about bloomberg?\n\nit's not just impeachment on trump's mind -- he's also keeping his eye on the democratic primary race. and wall street journal white house correspondent michael bender said a certain billionaire former mayor is at the front of his mind.\n\nthe trump campaign is looking at a lengthy list of things they view as big threats to his reelection, bender said. one of them is mike bloomberg and the billion dollars he has to spend on this race.\n\ntrump tweet ( bender said campaign officials don't necessarily see a path for bloomberg to actually win the democratic nomination. but one thing he's very good at is getting under the president's skin. and the campaign knows that every about bloomberg ) has the chance of lifting him into the central conversation. that's something the former new york mayor has not been able to do for himself.\n\n3. the weather in iowa\n\nnearly all democrats left in the race have spent months positioning themselves for wins in the early states. but there's one thing they can't control: the weather.\n\ntime magazine national political reporter molly ball said. it's always going to be something campaigns have to take into account. there was a big blizzard in iowa this weekend that forced multiple candidates to cancel campaign events,said. it's always going to be something campaigns have to take into account.\n\nand it's not just a matter of inconvenience -- it could actually change the results, ball said.\n\nthe more intense the support, the more advantage that you have in the event of extreme weather on caucus night, ball said -- meaning a candidate with a bigger but less passionate base of support could lose out to one with fewer, but more engaged, supporters.\n\n4. eye on governors' races\n\ncnn senior political reporter nia-malika henderson said. eleven states will hold gubernatorial elections this year -- with democrats hoping to build on the gains they made in 2018. but the map makes that unlikely,said.\n\nthe gop comes in with something of an advantage -- they've got 26 governors' mansions, compared to 24 for democrats, henderson said. and the gop has really paid attention to state races in a way that democrats haven't. we saw the democrats make up some ground in 2018, but it's going to be much harder for them this go-around.\n\nsix of the 11 races are in deep-red states, and only two are in purple states: new hampshire and north carolina.\n\nnorth carolina is a big race that people are going to be watching, henderson said. incumbent democrat roy cooper is facing a tough republican challenger.\n\nand what makes that and other contests especially important? one word.\n\n5. supreme court weighs electoral college\n\nand from cnn chief national correspondent john king:\n\nthe supreme court is destined to have something its justices insist they don't relish: a potentially very big role in the presidential campaign debate.\n\nalready, chief justice john roberts is presiding over the impeachment trial. plus we are waiting to hear if the high court will fast track a federal challenge to the validity of obamacare.\n\nand we now know the court will weigh in this year -- before the election -- on constitutional questions about the electoral college\n\nthe key question is whether states have the power to mandate that electors follow their state's results when they cast their ballots, or whether they are free to vote as they please.\n\nthe issue of so-called rogue or faithless electors is not new, but the court's decision to take the case comes at a time of renewed debate about the merits of the electoral college.\n\nin 2016, trump lost the popular vote to hillary clinton. but the state-by-state results suggested a split of 306 electoral votes for trump and 232 for clinton.

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nrobin mead had a brain tumor, but no health insurance. and when doctors discovered it, she was defiant.\n\nthey made it sound like a simple surgery – we're just going to pop a baseball size chunk out of your skull right here, mead says pointing to her head. no you're not. i don't have any insurance. they said well, it's not an option, it's a brain tumor. and i said, you're not understanding what i'm saying. i don't have any insurance; i can't afford it.\n\nthe 47-year-old mother of three worked a full-time job, but didn't receive benefits. doctors warned her that leaving the benign brain tumor in place would impair her hearing, vision, and balance, and might even endanger her life.\n\nshe was superwoman, mead's 28-year old daughter shellby says. it was scary. we didn't know if she was going to get better.\n\nbut still, mead couldn't fathom going bankrupt to pay for the surgery.\n\nmedical staff searched for a solution. they told her about a program in michigan made possible by obamacare, and enacted by the state's republican governor. healthy michigan expanded the pool of people eligible to receive medicaid benefits. it was open to anyone who made $16,000 per year or less, or $33,000 per year or less for a family of four.\n\nmead swiftly cut back her hours at work to meet the threshold, filled out the paperwork, and eight months later she underwent surgery to get that brain tumor removed. she credits healthy michigan and her newfound insurance plan as the reason i'm still here today.\n\nthe fear of losing 'healthy michigan'\n\nmead's story is just one of the many inspiring governor rick snyder in his fight to keep parts of obamacare. snyder is one of 16 republican governors in states that have expanded medicaid in their states, even though the supreme court ruled it wasn't mandatory under obamacare.\n\ngovernor snyder describes it as a win-win for all sides; more people are receiving health care benefits, and there is a 44% drop in uncompensated care days at hospitals around the state. michigan now has 646,745 people signed up for healthy michigan, despite only expecting 470,000 to enroll.\n\nthe federal government began funding 100% of the cost of the expanded enrollment nationwide, but it will be stepping down to 90% by 2020. but, with the trump administration and republicans in congress on course to repeal, and potentially replace, obamacare, all of that funding for medicaid expansion could go out the window.\n\nwhere trump support and obamacare use soar\n\nsnyder and eight other republican governors met with the senate finance committee the day before donald trump's inauguration to stress the importance of keeping healthy michigan, and other programs like it across the country, funded.\n\nthis is the best case i've ever seen in terms of congress wanting to listen and actually have a positive dialogue with the states, snyder says, expressing optimism about the meeting.\n\nstates may have to take fight up with trump\n\nif medicaid expansion remains, the real fight could be over funding. president trump's senior adviser kellyanne conway has said part of the new administration's plans for repealing and replacing obamacare would include converting federal funds for medicaid into block grants.\n\nblock grants have long been favored by republicans, but they could create a number of additional hurdles, like how much each state would receive, how to regulate the way states spend the funds, and how to cover changes in enrollment.\n\ngovernor snyder, however, doesn't agree with the concept of block grants, saying handing states a chunk of money without any preconditions won't work.\n\nthere needs to be some degree of accountability. it should be accountability based on outcomes. hold us accountable for having healthier people.\n\nprogressive critics have expressed concern that budget hawks could target block grants to cut federal health care. snyder says he has not spoken to president trump about his state's needs, but has spoken with congressman tom price, nominee for health and human services secretary.\n\ntrump issues executive order to start rolling back obamacare\n\njia ireland is hopeful governor snyder's pleas to the federal government are successful. as a 24-year-old graduate student working part-time, but focused on receiving her master's degree in april, she too is enrolled in healthy michigan.\n\nireland lives in flint, where she's been affected by the water crisis, and for years she was unable to afford health insurance. when michigan's expanded medicaid was enacted, she enrolled and now receives annual physicals and preventative care. she is counting on snyder to save medicaid expansion in michigan, and worries about the trump administration's planned repeal of obamacare.\n\nto have that just snatched away from you because a different president and a different administration comes in, it's really sad, ireland lamented. i deserve to have access to affordable health insurance. i deserve to be able to go to the doctor if i have an issue or go to the hospital and not have to go into massive debt.
(cnn) —\n\nit's not a new interview, exactly, since it was conducted in 1999 by dan rather, then with cbs news.\n\nit's not exactly newsy, either, since donald trump doesn't say anything in the interview he hasn't said repeatedly since.\n\nbut it would certainly be right to say a newly surfaced nearly 13-minute 60 minutes ii segment (remember that show?) proves the vast majority of trump's political strategy, down to his exact criticism of john mccain, was very much formed nearly 20 years ago, back when he was selling a book, his name and a possible run for president.\n\nhe just broke the glass and went with it in 2016.\n\ndid not realize that trump brought up mccain being captured in 1999 in an interview w dan rather https://t.co/myfqu69ic7 — jake sherman (@jakesherman) august 7, 2018\n\nthere are similar quotes, like those about mccain.\n\ntrump '99 on john mccain: does being captured make you a hero? i don't know, i'm not sure.\n\ntrump '15 on mccain: he's not a war hero, said trump. he was a war hero because he was captured. i like people who weren't captured.\n\nthe trump/mccain feud has been one of the main storylines of trump's time in office as mccain, though ailing in arizona, has not been afraid to criticize trump, particularly on foreign affairs, and also foiled his plan to repeal obamacare.\n\ntrump '99 on financing his campaign: i'd be prepared to spend $100 million on the race if necessary.\n\ntrump '16 on financing his campaign: i will have over $100 million in the campaign, and i'm prepared to go much more than that.\n\nhe made the 2016 comment in october, not long before election day. he ended up spending less than $100 million, by the way.\n\nthere are similar cast members, including melania trump, who declines to humor rather and criticize her now-husband. there's a shot of trump consigliere roger stone, yes that roger stone, standing next to her at an appearance.\n\nthere are similar locations, including a walk through mar-a-lago.\n\nthere are boasts about crowd sizes and then a fact check of them by cbs, not completely unlike the ones that anger trump to this day.\n\nthere's a lot of talk in the piece about how trump could do well among blue-collar men — the very people who helped him take the rust belt from democrats.\n\nthere's a hefty amount of media skepticism that he could be a serious candidate.\n\nthe list goes on.\n\nbut in addition to the many similarities, there's a lot that's not in the '99 video clip, including that trump was talking about running on the reform party ticket, not the republican one. there also was no talk of immigration, which was arguably his top issue in 2016.\n\nthat trump had thought about running for president in the past isn't news. in 1999, contemporaneous to this cbs interview, he told larry king on cnn he would form a presidential exploratory committee. he also teased campaigns on other shows, other networks, and in other presidential cycles. but watching that cbs clip in the context of how he eventually did run — and win — is quite interesting indeed.

why don't you just take the phone from, you know, your cell phone back and you say, mr. president, you're brilliant.\n\n\n\nand -- but we're losing contact, and i think we're going to lose you now, so good-bye. and that's what he did and he hung up. and we went back to having the kind of conversation that we needed to, where they ask a question, looking for consensus, looking for common ground, and we -- i think we've identified a little bit. berman: sir, are you saying that gary cohn faked a bad connection to\n\n\n\nget the president off the phone?\n\n\n\ncarper: i'm sorry, say again?\n\n\n\nberman: are you saying gary cohn faked a bad connection to get the president off the phone?\n\n\n\ncarper: well, i wouldn't -- i don't want to throw him under the bus, but yes.\n\n\n\nharlow: i think you just did.\n\n\n\nberman: yes, that's the bus. i think the bus just --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncarper: he was interested in a greater good.\n\n\n\nharlow: the bus has passed.\n\n\n\ncarper: he wanted to make sure he could have the kind of conversation, and that's what we need to do. there's areas where we can agree --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nberman: all right, gary cohn --\n\n\n\ncarper: -- and be a good listener.\n\n\n\nberman: gary cohn, call your office right now, because you might be getting a call from florida shortly.\n\n\n\nlet me ask you, sir, lisa murkowski says she supports the repeal of the individual mandate. do you think this puts the republican plan closer to passing in the senate?\n\n\n\n[10:35:05] carper: i don't know. what really starts off as tax reform has ended up being in part some more repeal of the affordable care act. one of the keys in the affordable care act is establishing exchanges in every state for people who don't have access to health care through their employer, through medicaid, through medicare. so it's the republican idea to have the exchanges.\n\n\n\none of the keys for success in the exchanges is you have to have a healthy mix of people to insure. and one of the ways that we do that is through the individual mandate. other ways, as well. but this administration has spent the last eight, nine months trying to destabilize the exchanges. so they're driving insurers out of the marketplaces.\n\n\n\nwe have not enough competition in a lot of counties, a lot of states, and as a result, prices have gone up, which is not what we want to do.\n\n\n\nharlow: senator, republicans we have on this show constantly talking about the need for corporate tax cuts. and to be honest so do a number of democrats. i mean, they see 35 percent corporate taxes as anti-competitive and they see inversions that are happening and companies leaving the united states. do you agree the corporate tax rate needs to be lower?\n\n\n\ncarper: there are a couple of things i think we can agree with, democrats and republicans. the idea of doubling the standard deduction. that will actually help a lot of people who don't have to file -- they would have to file, but they wouldn't have to itemize their taxes.\n\n\n\ni think that's a good idea we can agree on. i think the effective tax rate for corporations in this country is between 15 percent and say, 20 percent. a number of companies do pay 35 percent. that's not very competitive with the rest of the world. so to the extent that we can bring -- ratchet down a bit is good.\n\n\n\nwhat is not good is this. we're looking at essentially tax cuts that help more wealthy people than not help the corporations, bigger corporations, than middle-sized corporations. and there's a fear that a lot of people have that corporations, what they'll do if they have more money to spend, they won't necessarily invest it in plant and equipment, in their workers. they'll actually use it for stock buybacks and drive up the stock and the value of the companies and help actually boost compensation for very senior members of the company.\n\n\n\nberman: that is something we have heard in some cases from these corporate boards.\n\n\n\nsenator, i want to ask you a little bit about what's going on right now in alabama. senator roy moore, judge roy moore running for senate there. the president all but backed him yesterday. i want to get your reaction to that.\n\n\n\ncarper: believe it or not, this is one -- it's up to the people in alabama to make the decision of who they're going to choose like it is in delaware and other places. but on matter of sexual harassment, whether it's alabama or whether it's state fair or whether it's capitol hill, whether it's hollywood, sexual harassment has no place.\n\n\n\nand i'm a big golden rule guy, treat other people the way we want to be treated. and i always like to say, how would you want to treat this woman if this was your sister that was involved or your mother was involved? and we use it as a standard, as a rule, as a guide.\n\n\n\nberman: but you think -- just to be clear, you're saying, you know, it's up to the people of alabama. does that mean if he is elected that you would vote against removing him from the senate?\n\n\n\ncarper: well, actually, we have the right, as members of the senate, once the people of a state have spoken, so whether or not we believe that person is actually made out of the right stuff. and we almost never say no. almost never say no. and in this case, we need to find out more of the details and make sure that we know what actually did happen, actually listen to the witness. harlow: well --\n\n\n\ncarper: and maybe even meet with the witnesses.\n\n\n\nharlow: hold on. hold on, senator.\n\n\n\ncarper: and then make a decision. but we're getting ahead of ourselves.\n\n\n\nharlow: but on that --\n\n\n\ncarper: let's have an election first and let the people of alabama say what they think. i just think sexual harassment doesn't have an appropriate place anywhere in this country.\n\n\n\nharlow: on that point, you say we need to figure out what happened. there may be no more that you find out. you have the accounts of these women, eight of them, against roy moore, and you have the accounts of roy moore. and this is far passed a place where it can be litigated in court. but it's ultimately going to come down to, isn't it, do you believe these women or not?\n\n\n\ncarper: mm-hmm. well, believe it or not, we have other issues that we are working on, tax reform is just one of many of them, budgets and stuff like that. so we don't spend every minute of every day looking at what's going on in the election in alabama.\n\n\n\ni have to say, clearly, sexual harassment, bad. make it very clear. it's not acceptable where i work, it's not acceptable any place in this country.\n\n\n\nlet the people of alabama, if they want to make their choice, i hope they -- they have a very good candidate, a democratic candidate.\n\n\n\nharlow: yes.\n\n\n\ncarper: he's a centrist. he's a moderate. he's i think very highly regarded. my hope is he'll be elected. and if he's not, then we'll see what follows.\n\n\n\nharlow: ok. i get that. we did spend the first five minutes talking about the issues, like tax reform. and we do that all the time. but sexual harassment and child molestation accusations are also an issue here and what we're asking is you're someone who has power to vote to remove someone from the senate, if he is elected, and we're just asking you, would you do that?\n\n\n\ncarper: my inclination would be, and i'm one of those people who actually says, let sort of regular order, regular order here, and regular order is for them to have primaries in alabama, runoffs in alabama, elections in alabama.\n\n\n\n[10:40:08] if they want to send somebody who we think is unfit to serve, that person, man or woman, will not be allowed to serve.\n\n\n\nberman: all right, senator tom carper of delaware, thanks for your time, sir.\n\n\n\ncarper: yes. thanks. happy thanksgiving to you and to all your viewers.\n\n\n\nberman: happy thanksgiving to you.\n\n\n\ncarper: god bless you.\n\n\n\nharlow: you, as well.\n\n\n\nberman: and we know to be careful whenever you say there's a bad connection from now on. appreciate it.\n\n\n\n(laughter)\n\n\n\nharlow: thank you.\n\n\n\nberman: i've got a very serious story to tell you about now. women and children raped and killed, entire villages burned to the ground. the violence against muslims in myanmar worsens and the refugee crisis widens. today the u.s. takes steps that could help put an end to the violence. that's next.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[10:45:01] harlow: the u.s. state department has just made a major move, classifying the violence against rohingya muslims in myanmar as, quote, ethnic cleansing. this is a major step in pressuring the burmese government to do something about the deadly attacks on that country's muslim minority.\n\n\n\nberman: now cnn has been following this crisis. nearly 1 million rohingya muslims have fled myanmar and they're finding they have nowhere to go.\n\n\n\nour clarissa ward literally waded into the water off the coast of bangladesh to talk to refugees when the coast guard in bangladesh refused to let their rafts reach the shore.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nclarissa ward, cnn senior international correspondent: how are you? how many hours have you been on the boat? since early in the morning? do you know how to swim?\n\n\n\n(voice-over): no one does. yet the raft is full of children.\n\n\n\nof course we are worried. look, she has two babies, this woman tells us. the kids were practically slipping off the raft.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nberman: all right. our senior diplomatic correspondent michelle kosinski is at the state department.\n\n\n\nmichelle, aside from the fact that declaring it ethnic cleansing is on its face apparently true, what's the diplomatic significance here?\n\n\n\nmichelle kosinski, cnn senior diplomatic correspondent: yes. a very strong statement, the strongest one yet from the state department. but you could also see this as a way of saying something very strong in the nicest way possible. i mean, calling it ethnic cleansing doesn't carry any implications under either international or domestic law.\n\n\n\nthe state department isn't blaming anybody in particular. they're just referring to some elements of the military security forces and other vigilante groups. and the state department also isn't blaming the civilian government in burma. under the current way the government structures its power sharing between the civilian government and the military, they feel like the government doesn't have a lot of power anyway, but the state department says it's still pushing that government to do more.\n\n\n\nso what then is the purpose of this designation? well, they say it's a way to pressure both the government and the military to control the situation better and reach an agreement so that people can start returning to their homes. they want the military to respond more quickly to situations on the ground. and they say it highlights the urgency of the situation.\n\n\n\nbut on urgency, keep in mind, it has been a full two months since the u.n. secretary-general called this a textbook case of ethnic cleansing. it has been three months since the violence started. and even though it's complicated, i mean, the u.s. believes that the violence started with an attack by a rohingya militant group, that today the state department referred to as terrorists.\n\n\n\nbut what this still highlights, you have to keep in mind is the fact that in today's world, ethnic cleansing does still happen, and the world can't come up with an acceptable way to intervene, at least often until after the fact, although the state department pushed back and said, it's not as if governments were just standing by. they said there's been a lot of effort by a lot of different countries. and on the u.s.'s part, that effort continues -- john and poppy.\n\n\n\nharlow: michelle --\n\n\n\nberman: all right. michelle kosinski for us following the story for us, which is very important, to say the least.\n\n\n\nwe'll be right back.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[10:52:45] harlow: the president tweeted this morning that the idea of nfl players staying in the locker room during the national anthem is almost as bad as kneeling.\n\n\n\nberman: now coy wire just spoke with cowboys owner jerry jones, a controversial soul, who gave his thoughts about president trump.\n\n\n\ncoy, what did he say? coy wire, cnn sports correspondent: spoken like a true patriots fan\n\n\n\nthere, john. good to see you and poppy.\n\n\n\nnow jerry jones explained why perhaps with everything going on in the world, president trump is commenting on the nfl.\n\n\n\nthis bleacher report presented by the new 2018 ford f-150. here's jerry jones.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\njerry jones, cowboys owner: donald trump is a longtime fan of sport and longtime fan of football, and has been involved as owner in professional football. so he has some knowledge. i certainly think that the thing that he is addressing is certainly a part of how we want to make our game better.\n\n\n\nthere's no question because of our visibility, our (inaudible), that we are looked to for social responsibility, as well. this is all a part of what i've been talking about with the commissioner.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nwire: now i asked jones about commissioner goodell because president trump tweeted earlier this morning about his handling of the player protests during the national anthem, saying in part, quote, when will the highly paid commissioner finally get tough and smart? this issue is killing your league, unquote.\n\n\n\nnow jerry jones has been holding back the reins on extending the commissioner's contract, so i asked him why.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\njones: well, asking for accountability, asking for looking at some changes that have occurred while we've been in this discussion. that's not necessarily against bringing roger goodell back. what i do want to do is, when he comes back, have a good understanding of the direction that we're going. this is when you do those things.\n\n\n\nbecause of the power that we give the commissioner, the time to get the pot right is when you either hire him or extend him. and so i'm wanting the owners to get the pot right.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nwire: all right. well, president trump has been overly critical of goodell and the nfl, he has tweeted praise for jerry jones twice, calling him a winner for his handling of the protests. he told his players that they would be benched if they knelt.\n\n\n\n[10:55:08] now the nfl owners are set to meet, john, poppy, on december 13th. where? that will be just outside of dallas.\n\n\n\nharlow: all right. coy wire, have a good thanksgiving. thank you.\n\n\n\nwire: you too.\n\n\n\nharlow: all right, speaking of sports, that's president trump's topic de jure, just a day after appearing to clearly endorse roy moore. why a pivot to the feud, the ongoing feud with the father of that ucla basketball player? much more of that, ahead.
(cnn) —\n\ndonald trump isn't a big policy guy. or a big respect guy.\n\nthis anecdote, from a book set for release next week by former trump white house aide cliff sims and first reported in the washington post, is illustrative of both of those facts:\n\nsims recounts one time when (paul) ryan was in the oval office explaining the ins and outs of the republican health-care bill to the president. as ryan droned on for 15 minutes, trump sipped on a glass of diet coke, peered out at the rose garden, stared aimlessly at the walls and, finally, walked out.\n\nryan kept talking as the president wandered down the hall to his private dining room, where he flicked on his giant flat-screen tv. apparently, he had had enough of ryan's talk. it fell to vice president pence to retrieve trump and convince him to return to the oval office so they could continue their strategy session.\n\nwhaaaaaaat?\n\njust to provide some context here: the republican speaker of the house is talking to the republican president of the united states about a republican effort to repeal and replace the affordable care act, a law that trump had railed against for the better part of two years on the campaign trail. this is not a small deal. nor is ryan a person who has no power over trump's agenda.\n\nand yet, trump treated ryan, according to sims' book, like a sub-human. can you imagine someone – in a meeting – simply wandering off to watch tv in another room while you were talking? no, right? and, if they did, you would think a) is something wrong with them or b) that dude is the rudest person i have ever met.\n\nexcept that in this instance the dude in question is the president of the united states – which is all the more revealing, and concerning.\n\nrevealing in that it's clear from the episode that trump had zero interest in the details of a policy on which, theoretically, much of his political fate rested. trump decried obamacare as the worst law ever and insisted that if he got into the white house, he would personally ensure its removal and replacement. and yet, once in office, trump apparently couldn't be bothered to, you know, pay attention to ryan for 15(!) minutes. because policy details carry no interest for him.\n\nthis is nothing new, of course. as a candidate, trump wasn't even willing to fake interest in policy specifics. this, from a july 2016 politico piece, is indicative of his broader approach:\n\nthe trump campaign is untraditional in almost every way, but considering the real possibility of a president trump, the candidate's flagrant indifference to the details of public policy is particularly remarkable. he has said he forms his views through instinct and intuition rather than 'deep analysis.' he has boasted that his main policy adviser is himself and the advisers he does have say he doesn't read briefing papers. he has mocked hillary clinton for surrounding herself with 'eggheads' and churning out reams of wonky government reform proposals. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, who will be speaking on trump's behalf at this week's republican convention in cleveland, recently said 'it's pretty obvious he doesn't know a lot about the issues.'\n\ntrump doesn't believe details really matter. what matters is winning – or at least the ability to declare yourself the winner. the policy points are something, in his mind, for the nerds to work out.\n\nhe's a closer. and closers don't worry too much about every niggling little detail.\n\nwhat's concerning in all of this is how trump treated another prominent leader within his own party. the utter disrespect of simply walking away when someone is talking – and turning on a tv in another room – is colossal. that the vice president of the united states had to be called on to convince trump to come back into the room and talk to ryan is startling stuff. (nota bene: yes, ryan had been very wary of trump as a candidate and had distanced himself from trump in the wake of the release of the access hollywood tape. but still…)\n\nand for me, it raises this question: if trump treats his supposed political friends this way behind closed doors, how must he talk about – and treat – his political rivals? and what does allowing – and enabling – behavior like that from the president of the united states mean about the temperament and mindset of the most powerful man in the country?\n\nthe answer is: nothing good.

almost shaking when he was telling me about it, saying it's very under the radar that it's not entirely clear who or how many people will show up, but this delegate in particular is a vice-chair of the republican party in his home state and he said he will lose that as designation once he does this, but he says he doesn't feel like he has a choice.\n\n\n\nwolf blitzer, cnn anchor: well dana, you know, jake that's a huge challenge for reince priebus, the chairman of the republican party who is about to speak.\n\n\n\njake tapper, cnn anchor: yeah, to unite the republican party and no one knows this challenge more than reince priebus. he's been bruised and battered during this election process, this campaign process. he had fought with donald trump's campaign very openly. they fought with him. he tried to calm things down.\n\n\n\nthey said that the republican national committee was cooking the books, they were not fair to him, and conversely, he has also been criticized by non-trump loving republicans for being too nice to donald trump, for being too accepting. he is somebody who is trying to, he has been trying to push donald trump more to the mainstream in his rhetoric, being more inclusive.\n\n\n\nremember, reince priebus is the one had made sure there was that so- called autopsy after the 2012 electoral defeat of mitt romney running and the autopsy, if you read it, it said bunch of things donald trump clearly has not spent much time taking very seriously outreach to latinos, being more inclusive in language, being warmer, being more positive and donald trump got here doing it his way, not the republican national committee way. reince priebus has been in a very tough spot.\n\n\n\nblitzer: earlier trump said the system was rigged. he has strong words against the rnc but now that by all accounts their relationship between donald trump and reince priebus who is about to speak right now is excellent. they speak several times a day.\n\n\n\nlet's listen in, reince priebus, who's chairman of the republican national committee.\n\n\n\nreince priebus, republican national committee chairman: thank you. thank you. thank you. to the people of cleveland, we say thank you for your hospitality. and to my wife, sally and my son, jack, and daughter grace, i love you, thank you for everything you do for me.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: i love you too (inaudible).\n\n\n\npriebus: i stand before this convention tonight as the chairman of a party that is carrying the torch of liberty. we are the party of the open door. to some people and some presidents, america is just another country. to republicans, america is the greatest nation on earth. we don't apologize for america. we celebrate america at every level. republicans stand for aspiration and achievement. we stand for peace and prosperity. we stand for freedom and fairness.\n\n\n\nthese values have inspired people the world over, ever since we won our freedom two centuries ago. these values fueled the sacrifices for freedom at gettysburg and normandy and fallujah. these values spurred the fight for equality in birmingham and selma.\n\n\n\nit is clear the republican party is the only party willing to fight for these values and lead america to greatness in the 21st century. you see, the dirty little secret democrats don't want you to know is that they are the same party doing the same old thing.\n\n\n\nnext week, they're going to trot out the same old democrats with the same old message running the same old candidate. we are the party of new ideas in a changing and faster world than ever before. democrats depend on super delegates and bureaucrats to sneak their agenda through the back door. we are the party of the grassroots. we honor what the voters say.\n\n\n\ndemocrats want to put labor union bosses in charge of our schools, limit our choices and feed our kids a steady diet of the left-wing propaganda. we know every child matters and a classroom is not an assembly line. it's time to give power back to parents, embrace school choice, equip our children with the skills they need for college, career and life.\n\n\n\n[21:05:17] democrats want health care choices in the hands of politicians. we want health care choices in the hands of patients. democrats want washington to impose a one size fits all policy on everybody. we say, an independent people deserves individual solutions.\n\n\n\nwhat separates republicans from democrats is our belief in better. we believe in better schools, a better health care system, a better economy which rewards hard work, no matter where or when you punch the clock, and most of all, we believe in a better chance at the american dream for everyone.\n\n\n\nthe republican party will not stop until that becomes a reality. and that's why we need to stop hillary clinton. a clinton presidency only means more debt, more obamacare, and more hard-working families never seeing a raise. if hillary clinton is given the chance, she'll stack the deck with the supreme court, with activist left wing judges who will treat the constitution like a doormat. you can kiss your gun rights good-bye if she ever finds her way into the white house. in foreign policy, a clinton presidency means forgetting our friends and enabling our enemies. just look, just look at her disastrous iran nuclear deal which lined the pockets of the world's number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money while abandoning our greatest ally in the middle east, the nation of israel.\n\n\n\nit was on her watch isis began to spread its wings of evil over the middle east, and she has spent the last 16 months looking in the eyes of the american people and lying about how recklessly she jeopardized the american people, our national security, with her secret e-mail server. she lied. and she lied over and over and over and over. she lied. she lied.\n\n\n\nperhaps, perhaps, perhaps worst of all, perhaps worst of all, hillary clinton has perfected the art of politics for personal gain. she reads ethics rules as carefully as americans read their junk mail. just look at her track record. she used her post as secretary of state to grease the wheels for democrat lobbyists, special interests and political insiders connected to the corrupt clinton machine. her family foundation took millions of dollars in donations from countries notorious for human rights abuses and funneling money to radical islamic terrorists.\n\n\n\nfor hillary clinton, the oval office is just another cash cow. well, i have one word for all of this hypocrisy and corruption. enough. americans have had enough of a government that plays favorites to the well-connected. they have had enough of the clintons' excuses, cronyism and cover-ups. they have had enough of the corrupt deals americans have had enough.\n\n\n\nthis election, this election is our chance to stop it and donald trump is the right man to lead that charge.\n\n\n\n[21:10:03] you all know he's brought millions of new voters in our party because he's listening to americans who are anxious about a country which has lost its wing. donald trump wants to bring jobs back from overseas and hold companies who want to send them abroad accountable.\n\n\n\nhe's finally going to stop illegal immigration and make sure our government puts american citizens first. working families, working families are the lifeblood of our country. and we can't thrive as a nation unless they are thriving. a lot of them haven't seen a bigger paycheck in a very long time.\n\n\n\ndonald trump wants to make sure you can pay the mortgage, put gas in the car, and buy new clothes for the first day of school. donald trump is committed to hitting terrorists hard and making the safety of every man, woman and child in america his number one priority.\n\n\n\nno more negotiating with terrorists. if they want to take us down, we're going to take them down. and he will protect the second amendment and every other right guaranteed in the constitution by approving and appointing conservative justices to the supreme court. and importantly, he's going to protect the lives of the unborn. so, i have a message to america, hold on, help is coming with donald trump and mike pence, america's ready for a comeback after almost a decade of clinton/obama failures.\n\n\n\ni want to close by telling you a little-known story of american greatness. william knudsen was a danish immigrant who started out working in a shipyard and living in a boardinghouse. he knew america promised limitless opportunity and was determined to make the most of it.\n\n\n\nhe developed his talents for industrial engineering and worked his way up at general motors. by 1937, he'd become the president of the company. in 1940, the government asked him to get america's factories on a wartime footing. instead of cars and trucks, america's great manufacturers were now proudly making tanks and planes.\n\n\n\nfor this enormous responsibility, knudsen was paid $1 per year. he didn't do it for the money. he was motivated by a duty to keep america free from tyranny. he set aside the job of leading one of the largest companies in america so he could help save the world.\n\n\n\nat the end of the war, a war department official told him you have never done anything for yourself, only for your country. you have never spared yourself. like william knudsen, we cannot spare ourselves either. economic freedom, belief in the american dream, a strong defense, putting country first, those values are under assault from hillary clinton and the rest of the democrat party.\n\n\n\nlife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness is not just a tag line for a bumper sticker. it is our american legacy and it's our responsibility to save it and strengthen it for our children and grandchildren. listen, god didn't put us here not -- he didn't put us here by accident.\n\n\n\nthis is our moment to set a new course for an america as strong and confident as we have ever been. let's stand united as republicans. let's stop hillary clinton. let's get to work. expand our republican majorities and let's elect donald trump president.\n\n\n\nthank you and god bless you. thank you.\n\n\n\nanderson cooper, cnn anchor: still ahead tonight, a tech tycoon ready to do something that's never been done at a republican convention. stand onstage, publicly declare that he's gay.\n\n\n\nlater, we'll also hear what kind of tone donald trump takes and what kind of message he sends to america in his speech tonight.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[21:18:40] cooper: and i want to show you, donald trump is just arriving with his wife, melania and their young son, baron, and just a few seconds ago while we were in commercial break.\n\n\n\nobviously, donald trump looks like perhaps he has the speech or copy of the speech in his hand. as you know, he often reads from a page like that which has bullet points on it. we're told, that he is going to be reading off the teleprompter tonight for a speech that is going to be very closely watched, perhaps the most important, without a doubt the most important speech of his career.\n\n\n\nthus far, he will be introduced by his daughter ivanka trump and also what is billed as a very important speech for her and the entire trump family and trump campaign. in just a matter of minutes though, peter thiel, a silicon valley billionaire, one of the early, i guess founders of facebook, paypal, is going to be speaking.\n\n\n\nhe is the second openly gay man ever to address for republican convention. the first time it happened was in 2000. jim cole, the congressman, but he didn't address actually being gay or acknowledge it or talk anything about the fight for equality for gay and lesbian in americans. we are told peter thiel will address some of those issues. we are not exactly sure how.\n\n\n\ns.e. cupp, what do you make of the fact that peter thiel is being allowed to speak tonight? what do you think the reception is going to be?\n\n\n\n[21:20:00] s.e. cupp, cnn political commentator: it is the speech i am most looking forward tonight. if i had a dime for every millennial i met instead i would be conservative not for the gay issue. i'd be a billionaire. and it's usually disappointing to me that so much anti- gay rhetoric was added into a platform when the candidate himself is far more progressive on those issues.\n\n\n\ncooper: many of the gay community believe this is probably the most anti-gay of republican platform they have seen.\n\n\n\ncupp: without a doubt it is. that's deeply disappointing. i hope peter here changes some hearts and minds, right now.\n\n\n\ncooper: let's listen in to peter thiel.\n\n\n\npeter thiel, entrepreneur: good evening. i'm peter thiel. i build companies and i support people who are building new things from social networks to rocket ships.\n\n\n\ni'm not a politician. but neither is donald trump. he is a builder and it's time to rebuild america. where i work in silicon valley, it's hard to see where america has gone wrong.\n\n\n\nmy industry has made a lot of progress in computers and in software and of course, it's made a lot of money. but silicon valley is a small place. drive out to sacramento or even across the bridge to oakland, and you won't see the same prosperity. that's just how small it is. across the country, wages are flat. americans get paid less today than 10 years ago. but healthcare and college tuition costs more every year.\n\n\n\nmeanwhile, wall street bankers inflate bubbles in everything from government bonds to hillary clinton's speaking fees. our economy is broken. if you are watching me right now, you understand this better than any politician in washington, d.c. and you know this isn't the dream we looked forward to.\n\n\n\nback when my parents came to america looking for that dream, they found it right here in cleveland. they brought me here as a 1-year- old and this is where i became an american.\n\n\n\nopportunity was everywhere. my dad studied engineering at case western reserve university just down the road from where we are now. because in 1968, the world's high tech capital wasn't just one city.\n\n\n\nall of america was high tech. it's hard to remember this, but our government once -- was once high tech, too. when i moved to cleveland, defense research was laying the foundations for the internet.\n\n\n\nthe apollo program was just about to put a man on the moon. and it was neil armstrong from right here in ohio. the future felt limitless. but today, our government is broken. our nuclear bases still use floppy discs.\n\n\n\nour newest fighter jets can't even fly in the rain. and it would be kind to say the government software works poorly, because much of the time, it doesn't even work at all.\n\n\n\nthat is a staggering decline for the country that completed the manhattan project. we don't accept such incompetence in silicon valley and we must not accept it from our government.\n\n\n\ninstead of going to mars, we have invaded the middle east. we don't need to see hillary clinton's deleted e-mails. her incompetence is in plain sight. she pushed for a war in libya and today it's a training ground for isis. on this most important issue, donald trump is right. it's time, it's time to end the eras of stupid wars and rebuild our country.\n\n\n\nwhen i was a kid, the great debate was about how to defeat the soviet union, and we won. now we are told -- now we are told that the great debate is about who gets to use which bathroom. this is a distraction from our real problems. who cares?\n\n\n\n[21:25:05] of course, every american has a unique identity. i am proud to be gay. i am proud to be a republican. but most of all, i am proud to be an american.\n\n\n\ni don't pretend to agree with every plank in our party's platform, but fake culture wars only distract us from our economic decline, and nobody in this race is being honest about it except donald trump.\n\n\n\nwhile it is fitting to talk about who we are, today it's even more important to remember where we came from. for me, that is cleveland and the bright future it promised.\n\n\n\nwhen donald trump asked us to make america great again, he's not suggesting a return to the past. he is running to lead us back to that bright future.\n\n\n\ntonight, i urge all of my fellow americans to stand up and vote for donald trump. thank you. thank you very much. thank you.\n\n\n\ncooper: the speech you were most looking forward to, to live up to, any expectations are less (ph)?\n\n\n\ncupp: it definitely did to see that man get a standing ovation in this hall and say to america i'm proud to be gay, i'm proud to be a republican, i'm proud to be an american, was everything to me. it was important for people to see. i hope a lot of millennials in particular were tuning in.\n\n\n\njeffrey lord, cnn political commentator: welcome to the party of donald trump.\n\n\n\ncupp: yeah. i'm not crediting donald trump for his own convictions. jeffrey, that's ridiculous, but it was really nice to see at that moment here onstage.\n\n\n\nkayleigh mcenany, cnn political commentator: but donald trump has opened up this party, he has a differed from the platform in various ways and then where all of these for voting mornings that does that -- his speech wouldn't be accepted in this room and that was difficult because his speech was accepted in this room.\n\n\n\nhe got a standing ovation. and i'm tired of caricaturing republicans in a certain way, caricaturing donald trump in a certain way with all those caricatures have been incorrect.\n\n\n\ncooper: does the platform, though, which donald trump frankly stayed out of and didn't try to influence at all, is against equality of marriage, attempting to repeal supreme court ruling against gay people being allowed to adopt in this country?\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nvan jones, cnn political commentator: the platform is horrible. i think the pick of pence is very disturbing because of his position on lgbt. but what we just saw was beautiful. what we just saw was history. what we just saw was something that if you had told us hey, donald trump was unlikely, but this was unlikely.\n\n\n\ni was terrified that young gay people watching this tonight were going to see a man either booed or met with silence and he was not met with silence. he was met with applause. and we can be proud of that. that's bigger than donald trump.\n\n\n\nit's something that's happened in this country that shows that positive change is possible and every kid watching tonight and every parent watching tonight can be proud of this party and of this country. that was beautiful.\n\n\n\ngloria borger, cnn chief political analyst: you know ...\n\n\n\nlord: one of the things he said that i thought would be most important, which we had talked about many times in context of race. he said i'm proud to be gay, but i'm proud to be an american. that is the point. this is the country of 300 million people, gay and straight and black and white, hispanic, whatever. the point is the country is about the principles of freedom and liberty. it isn't about your identity of any kind.\n\n\n\nborger: but he was talking about the republican party i think when he said that fake culture wars distract us from the -- our economy decline.\n\n\n\nin other words guys, cut it out. stop having this fake culture, of these culture wars over issues that the demography of the country has changed, the party has changed, the platform hasn't changed, but he's right. but he's saying stop it, we have other more important things to do.\n\n\n\ncooper: he was also referencing the war over transgender people using bathrooms ...\n\n\n\ncupp: bathroom, right, right.\n\n\n\ncooper: ... just saying who cares. a lot of people in this room though do care and certainly a lot of people on the platform committee chair because it's actually in this republican party platform.\n\n\n\ncupp: and donald trump says of their -- the correction which is that they should use whatever bathroom they want.\n\n\n\ncooper: he said that initially, but then he backtracked in, he said it should be up to states.\n\n\n\naxelrod: i'm trying, i'm trying to pick through. i'm trying to -- i'm trying to pick through all this.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\n[21:30:00] axelrod: look, i certainly agree that it is progress and it is heartening to see the response that he got. it's really hard, though, to reconcile these things, so what does it mean in terms of policy if donald trump becomes president? is the platform going to be in the force? is the pence view going to be enforced? what's going to happen?\n\n\n\ncooper: tom barrack ceo of colony capital.\n\n\n\ntom barrack, ceo colony capital: ... wow, i have to tell you, i feel like the anchovy on ivanka's caesar salad. i know you are salivating for that and you are going to get it but before i start, i just have to tell you a funny story. i was driving over here and for sure i was a little bit nervous. so i picked up the phone and i have a great uncle in beirut who is an unbelievable international lawyer and orator.\n\n\n\nso i called him up and i said, uncle, you got to help me. i'm speaking right before ivanka and donald at the republican national convention and i'm a little bit nervous. so can you give me some advice? he said why would they have you? i said no, that's not exactly what i need. i need to be pumped up. i'm nervous, and i need some confidence. don't do this to me. so he said ok, ok, give me two minutes and let me think. he says i've got it. i've got it. you're just like a deceased in an irish wake. i said you mean i'm that good? he said no, you need to be there to get things started but nobody really expects you to say very much.\n\n\n\nso with that, i want to start in and i'm here because donald trump is one of my closest friends for 40 years, and i'm the son of the very humble lebanese grocer from culver city, california. where's california?\n\n\n\nyes, and i'm here because of the amazing magic elixir that happened between the dna of a thousand civilizations from the levant and the beauty and the wonder and the opportunity of america that puts all of us here in this rapture of the american dream for me to be here tonight to talk about my friend, my partner and the future president of the united states, donald trump.\n\n\n\nbut what i'm going to do is something different and you're going to hate me for it because you're not going to hear one negative thing out of my mouth. i have nothing negative to say about hillary. i have only amazing things to tell you about donald, because this man is good enough, he's tough enough, he's smart enough and he's well-versed enough to do it on his own merits.\n\n\n\nwe don't need to go anyplace else, so what i want to do is spend a little time talking to you about the messenger, the man. without his armor, without his weaponry, walking down the tunnel into the arena, who is he? what is he made out of?\n\n\n\nso if we start at an easy place to find him is in his children. and you've all had the great opportunity to see his kids over the last couple days. what do you think of that?\n\n\n\nand the litmus test for any parent as we all know is in the children, and my mother used to say you learn what a man is by listening to your mother but you learn how to be a man by watching your father. you watch this man, you get it.\n\n\n\nthose of us who are married or have a partner understand that the best reflection on us is our wives. in my case, for sure it's my wife, rochelle. and in donald's case for sure it's his wife melania.\n\n\n\nand melania, i want to tell you on behalf of the 10,000 people that are in this stadium and the 50 million people who are watching, you are a timeless tribute to beauty, grace and elegance under pressure. you're amazing. you're awesome.\n\n\n\nso i'm going to use words that you probably haven't heard about donald. i started my relationship with him in a funny way. i had the great fortune of working for a man named bob bass in fortworth, texas.\n\n\n\n[21:35:04] in the '80s we bought a hotel company and the hotel company in addition to lots of other things happened to own the hotel that was right behind donald's window in his office. so, you know, donald well enough by now they know that he needed that hotel. i was a young pup. he was a big guy in new york at the time and he wanted to buy the hotel. long story short, we end up having 30 lawyers, 50 accountants, we can't get to a deal. i'm scared to death because my boss is going to fire me for selling to trump, who's smarter, who's brighter, who's better, and who will end up getting a much better deal.\n\n\n\nso donald in the midst of this, and this is really what started my friendship, did something i had never seen before and that i have used consecutively after, he said look, i want to do this. i don't know what i should know so i will pay your boss the price that he wants and i'll close it in one week on one condition. you, tom barrack, tell me everything i should know that i don't know. i said look, i just told you, i'm not doing that. we're not entering into this kind of a coverage and that no contract. no contract. you and i shake hands right here, no lawyers, no contract, no nothing. you just tell me the things that i should know and how to fix it and i'll do this deal.\n\n\n\nhe played me like a steinway piano. i then spent four months fixing everything in the hotel, a little rent-controlled tenant named fanny lowenstein, who was the smartest woman in the world, 83 years old, he had me buy her a piano, do the carpet. that it was one of the most amazing things i had ever seen.\n\n\n\nhe was incredible, but he practices an unbelievable set of disciplines. so everybody says ok, that the man is rich, he's a celebrity, he's powerful. but what is he going to do, how does he do it? and he has relentless habits, relentless beautiful habits. he shows up on time. he believes that punctuality is the courtesy of kings. he doesn't confuse effort with results.\n\n\n\nhe befriends the bewildered. he pushes everybody around him including you through comfort barriers that they never thought that they could ever, ever shatter. and he does all this with the discipline of an animal in the jungle, you know, his motto is that a lion wakes up every morning and knows one thing that it has to run faster than the fastest gazelle and a gazelle wakes up and she knows that she needs to run faster than the fastest lion. but whether you are a gazelle or lion, you wake up in the morning, you get the hell going. and that is donald.\n\n\n\nbut i want to share with you two little vignettes that really stuck in my mind. and it's not financial, it's not how rich he is or what a great deal guy he is and so, you know, all those things. and i'm telling you after 35 years of being with the man through the valleys and up the mountains, he really is better than the billing that you see. just as an administrator, as an executive, as a guy who can actually take care of the people that work for him and build teams.\n\n\n\nbut it was 1989, i know many of you, especially you girls, were not alive then. and it was a tyson fight and this time, donald was big in atlantic city and he called me up and said ok, let's go to the tyson fight. i said i had one of my little sons with me. he said no problem, i'll bring donny, let's go. of course, in typical trump style we hop in the trump helicopter, we fly into atlantic city and it's a zoo. we land, thousands of paparazzi, thousands of people everywhere, whisked to his limo, go to the front of the convention center and there's 10,000 cameras. he said let's go back to back of the convention center. we go to the back of the convention center. we start walking in and people harassing him like mad.\n\n\n\nat the side of the door there's a little nondescript man and he says mr. trump, mr. trump and donald stops, he walks over to the door, he says louie. he says mr. trump, i'm so happy to see you, and thank you for what you've done for my employees and thank you for what you do for me. and i just want you to know that my critically ill son thinks you're the greatest man in the world.\n\n\n\nmeanwhile, every thing's going crazy, we are late to get to the fight and donald's just focused, eye to eye with this man who at that moment, thought that he was the only star in donald's universe. he said louie, i'm not the greatest man in the world, you are.\n\n\n\nso we take the kids, we roll in. its five minutes to the fight. i think it was tyson-holmes, probably lasted four seconds. it can it was one of tyson's longer fights.\n\n\n\n[21:40:06] we get to the floor and he's fidgety and i can't figure what's happening, i've got the boys and i said what's wrong? he said give me your program. i give you my program, he write something on it, he brings a lot of security guards over and sends it back to the doorman. i said what was that? he said i just wrote a note. i said, what did the note say? he said it was to his son and said, i came here tonight to see two champions, mike tyson and your dad, true story.\n\n\n\nnow, what kind of man in the middle of his celebrity ship has the presence to focus on the littlest guy in the shop, and that is donald trump.\n\n\n\nten years later, ten years later, one of the greatest men in donald's life passed away, fred trump. and the funeral was being held the night before at the frank campbell funeral, 82nd in madison.\n\n\n\nso, donald called me up evening because i can't stand it, i'm going to go over early, why don't you come over early with me? i said fine. we get to the funeral hall and we're sitting as kind of, you know, two middle-aged guys that go through that debate when your father leaves of what's the difference between relevancy and mortality, right?\n\n\n\nthat loss where you're really questioning what's important and what's not important and it's not about money and it's not about power and it's not about stuff, and all the agony that you have with your father at that instant just evaporates, and you're sitting there with something.\n\n\n\nso we sat there, just keep it saying, musing, and i said, how do you feel? he said well, i'm thankful that i have my dad's strength and my mom's sensitivity and all i want to do is leave the legacy of the trump name that they built brick by brick a little bit better than i found it. he's done it.\n\n\n\nbut look, we're at a tipping point. the world is in a mess. this necklace of globalism that we've all talked about has crumbled and shattered into a thousand shards.\n\n\n\nit needs a jeweler to take each of those jewels one by one, starting with america its own diamond and polish. then slowly, find seamless strength -- them all back together.\n\n\n\nso what we look at is the necklace of prosperity and tolerance around the world. so, we've been on an adventure and people say wow, donald trump, it's like a mission or tale from businessman, celebrity, father, to potentially president of the united states.\n\n\n\nand i say to you, it is a tale but it's up to you, all of you tonight to unite in one pen, one hand, and make once upon a time, once upon in this time. thank you.\n\n\n\ncooper: tom barrack, ceo of colony capital and founder approach on trump super pac. it really interesting, i mean, this is probably the first time where we have heard intimate details of somebody who has an ongoing long-term relationship with donald trump.\n\n\n\nmcenany: that are consistent with the stories that donald trump jr. told. we heard him say, heard tom barrack say that donald trump cares about the littlest man in the shop.\n\n\n\nthe time he took to spent with dully (ph) and write that beautiful note when he was there with his son and this is a night of entertainment.\n\n\n\nthose are reflective of the stories we heard from donald trump jr. saying we were there, pouring concrete, we were there when they were putting up sheet metal.\n\n\n\nthat is consistent that donald trump has consistently reached the bottom of his company and uplifted the people who hard a work to be at the top.\n\n\n\nborger: i spent some time with tom barrack, who when you ask people who is donald trump's best friend, people often try and say i don't know.\n\n\n\nbut one of the names that comes up and there are only a few, is tom barrack. and tom barrack, you know, it may sound like a chapter from the art of the deal and, you know, in some ways.\n\n\n\nbut he goes back with him 40 years and he goes back with his kids which is why he's speaking before ivanka because he raised his children with the trump kids.\n\n\n\nand he went through trump's divorces with donald trump and so, you know, it's interesting to me that this evening, instead about political speaker and you have somebody from the business world and just a close personal friend of donald would tune. [21:45:00] cooper: it was also, michael so interesting to have him say from at the get-go, i'm not going to be talking about hillary clinton. we don't need to do that.\n\n\n\nmcenany: right.\n\n\n\ncooper: i'm focusing on donald trump.\n\n\n\nmichael smerconish, cnn anchor: i'm not sure whether i just saw a home run or i saw clint eastwood without the chair. but, what i do know is that the tone that was struck by him answers my question from earlier in the night, which is, is this intended to play to this hall or to the nation at large?\n\n\n\npeter thiel in combination with tom barrack answered that question. they are trying to expand the tent, i think for the first time decisively since the entire convention began.\n\n\n\nlord: about the kind of friends that he has. when you think that he has some friends with peter thiel and tom barrack and the doorman, that says a lot about someone. that's one of the messages.\n\n\n\ncooper: we got to take a quick break. when we come back, ivanka trump and then donald trump. stay with me.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[21:50:10] blitzer: we're back at the republican national convention. we're getting ready jake, for the definitive moments, the final moments of this night, we're going to see a video first of, a video narrated by the actor jon voight telling the story of donald trump put together by this convention.\n\n\n\nthen ivanka trump, the daughter will introduce donald trump the republican presidential nominee and he's got a very lengthy speech is going to be delivering, you see the podium there, the lecture that they're putting up there right now.\n\n\n\ntapper: yeah, the a new lecture in a -- it has the gold trump's signature style and it might be curious for people who have been watching this race trump fans and post the like that there are so many million americans who have not really tuned in all that much. this of course in a few minutes will be a moment that a lot of americans start paying their first real attention and with millions of undecided voters because this is a big moment for donald trump.\n\n\n\ni don't think i'm exaggerating when i say it is the most important moment of the presidential campaign, so far he has an opportunity to rise above the candidate and the campaign that has been so decisive -- successful that also very off putting to know youths of americans. he has an opportunity here to present a new quote unquote presidential donald trump.\n\n\n\nand of course he's going to be introduced by perhaps the best person that there is to introduce him to america, his daughter ivanka trump, who is by almost all accounts that it take lovely and very, very bright and warm person.\n\n\n\nblitzer: very poised. we say she's got a really excellent speech that she's been working out for a long time, it's been a challenge, the story, the personal story of her relationship with her father, but this video that is about to, that we're going to show a video put together by this convention.\n\n\n\nthey worked really hard because they also believe that they going to use this video to relax the remainder of these campaign, to tell the story, they want people out there, voters out, out there to know who this man is. you see the family at the vip and melania is there. you see 10-year-old baron the son, we see him here first time parents ...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nblitzer: melania. we haven't seen her here since she gave that speech monday night.\n\n\n\ntapper: you know, that's right and as you say that the video will be narrated by the actor jon voight, not the dentist jon voight, the anchor jon voight who has been acted the republican presidential politics for few years. i remember him campaigning for rudy giuliani, and this will be a narrative that they want the american people to see especially the american people who are considering voting for donald trump and those who are undecided.\n\n\n\nthis is the donald trump they want you, if you're among those voters right now watching, that they want you to think of when you think of donald trump. they don't want you to think of the negative news coverage, they don't want to take negative of ted cruz's speech last night, they want to think of this very positive and narrative and the video we're going to see and what ivanka trump has to say about her father.\n\n\n\nblitzer: that's melania and her son and donald trump son baron who's only 10 years old. first time he's been here at this convention. the entire family is there in that vip section. right now, they're there and after the speech i'm sure all of them will get up on that stage for the traditional moment, the whole family will celebrate his acceptance of this republican presidential nomination.\n\n\n\ntapper: traditional moment for a very non-traditional candidate and i'm sure a nontraditional speech. we're told it's more of a greatest hits of what he is been saying on the campaign trail for months and months and not anything new but a lot of new delivery in how he presents it to the american people.\n\n\n\nblitzer: and the video is about to begin right now.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\njon voight, actor: i want to share with you the story of my friend donald trump.\n\n\n\nas you know, he is running for president of the united states. and as you know, when he gets elected, he will make our country great again. the story begins in new york in the early '70s. the city was on the verge of bankruptcy, but donald looked across the river and saw not a troubled city but a city that symbolized america's greatness and he was committed to making it great again.\n\n\n\ndonald was born in queens to fred and mary ann trump. his father was a builder and was the greatest influence in young donald's life. he learned about a leadership early at new york military academy. he became captain of the baseball team and captain of the cadets. he learned that building business at father's side while working on his degree at the wharton school of finance.\n\n\n\nafter college donald faced a decision, joined his father in queens to dream big and make it in the greatest city in the world. the decision was easy.\n\n\n\n[21:55:08] donald's first notable project was less about renovating a building than helping the city rediscovering its soul.\n\n\n\nthe once great commodore hotel languished in a rundown neighborhood next to grand central station. the hotel was sold to the one developer who showed that he had the kind of the drive packing an imagination that would be necessary. they chose donald trump.\n\n\n\ndonald convinced the banks that they had a moral obligation to invest in new york and negotiated a tax abatement with the city jump starting a project and creating new construction and hotel jobs. donald's striking new building revitalized the neighborhood.\n\n\n\nhoward lorber, entrepreneur: he single handedly changed the grand central in midtown area by himself by doing that project.\n\n\n\nvoight: before long, more trump buildings helped change the skyline of new york. building in new york was not easy, but donald was never more frustrated than watching the city waste six years and $13 million trying to rebuild central park's wollman ice rink. donald was astounded. it took him only two years to build trump tower. so he stepped in and took over the project.\n\n\n\nhe finished in three months and under budget. he took over another city project, tied up in red tape since 1978. donald transformed a land fill into a championship public golf course and saved the city millions. donald will tell you his secret for success is a strong team.\n\n\n\nmichelle griffith, former broker specialist: he just has that knack of finding the right person, the qualified person, who will really excel in that position.\n\n\n\nvoight: like his father before him, he taught his children the business and now they're important members of the trump team.\n\n\n\namanda miller, vp the trump organization: mr. trump and his children, they love what they do and they're incredibly good at it. i think that breeds the same type passion for all those that work for him and are around him. donald trump jr., donald trump's son: from day one, my father trained us really well, whether it was in a board room, whether was on the job site. we spend time learning the business and he make sure we understood the value of a dollar and what it meant to really work.\n\n\n\nivanka trump, donald trump's daughter: he'd send me renderings when i was a little girl with hundred and notes on them of buildings that were under construction or in the planning stage, and say i can't wait for you to grow up and help me build these. now it's fun to stand shoulder to shoulder with my father.\n\n\n\nvoight: over the years donald has created tens of thousands of new jobs, many of them for women.\n\n\n\npeter kalikow, new york city builder: when i was building my building on park avenue and he was building the trump tower, he had the first female construction superintendent on the job.\n\n\n\nsuzie mills, general manager trump international hoterl & tower: when he made me general manager nine years ago, there were only three female general managers of five star hotels in the whole of north america.\n\n\n\nvoight: after a long career accomplishing much of what others said couldn't be done, donald trump has set his sights on a new rebuilding project.\n\n\n\ndonald trump, (r) presidential nominee: i am officially running for president of the united states, and we are going to make our country great again.\n\n\n\nvoight: donald has said he admires people who put themselves directly on the line. today he's not only putting himself on the line but under fire. donald could have continued himself successful career and spent more time with his family, but instead he chose to run for president.\n\n\n\neric trump, donald trump's son: he doesn't need to do this. but what's been happening over the last eight years has been so tragic for the course of our nation, he simply had to do this.\n\n\n\ni. trump: for my father to step away from a company that he's deeply committed to in favor of running for elected office was a real sacrifice for him.\n\n\n\nvoight: it's donald's nature to help others.\n\n\n\nlynne patton, the trump organization: a lot of times he comes across a story or meets a person that touches him and he'll make sure that that person is taken care of privately for the rest of their lives.\n\n\n\nrudy guiliani, former mayor new york: donald trump has a very big heart. when police officers or firefighters or even sanitation workers, correction officers, i can remember a teacher got injured or died, he would step forward and he would make an anonymous contribution. voight: for donald it all begins with our young people.\n\n\n\ndarrel scott, pastor: donald trump believes that higher education and more job opportunities will enhance the quality of american living.\n\n\n\nvoight: donald has committed to protecting our families and keeping our cities safe.\n\n\n\ndavid clark jr., sheriff: what i see out of donald trump, it starts with a message, it starts with a positive message of respect for the american law enforcement officers. what we need from our national leaders and that's for when i'm getting it right now.\n\n\n\nvoight: he used the one candidate, the non-politician, who can fix our broken economy and get america working again.
patients in obamacare are sicker and need significantly more medical care than those in employer-sponsored plans, according to a new blue cross blue shield association report.\n\nthis raises fresh concerns about the possibility of steep rate hikes for 2017 and of insurers leaving the obamacare exchanges.\n\nthe study, the first of its kind to look at millions of enrollees across the country, found that obamacare members have higher rates of costly illnesses such as diabetes, depression, hypertension, heart disease, hiv and hepatitis c.\n\nthey also use more medical services -- including emergency rooms, in-patient hospital care, doctors and prescriptions than patients in employer-sponsored plans. their cost of care was 22% higher than those in work-based health plans in 2015, or $559 a month, on average, for obamacare enrollees versus $457 for those in employer plans.\n\nwhat we don't know is where we go from here, said alissa fox, senior vice president at the blue cross association, which represents 36 independent blue cross blue shield insurers.\n\nthe obama administration said it expected initial enrollees to be sicker because they were previously denied policies due to preexisting conditions.\n\nit's no surprise that people who newly gained access to coverage under the affordable care act needed health care; that's why they were locked out of coverage before, said ben wakana, national press secretary, health department.\n\nhe also took issue with the study's methodology, saying comparing newly insured obamacare enrollees with those who've long been covered in the employer market makes the former look sicker.\n\nstill, the fact that these patients are sicker than expected is putting some insurers in a financial bind. several have reported big losses and have questioned whether they can afford to remain in the obamacare market. this group includes unitedhealth (unh), the nation's largest insurer, which expects to lose nearly $1 billion on obamacare in 2015 and 2016 and may not participate in 2017.\n\nrelated: unitedhealth expects to lose nearly $1 billion on obamacare\n\nsome blue cross plans have also come under pressure.\n\nhighmark, the nation's fourth-largest blue cross plan with members in pennsylvania, west virginia and delaware, said its obamacare members are older, have more chronic conditions and consume more health care services than its employer plan members. as a result, the company has lost more than $773 million in its first two years on the exchanges. it called the losses unsustainable.\n\nmeanwhile, blue cross blue shield of north carolina reported $282 million in obamacare losses in 2015. to counter this, the company raised its rates an average of 32.5% for 2016. its ceo, brad wilson, has said the insurer may exit the market in 2017.\n\nrelated: 12.7 million americans sign up for obamacare 3.0\n\nto stem the losses, insurers are ramping up their preventative care and chronic disease management programs.\n\nhowever, they also want the federal government to clamp down on the so-called special enrollment periods, which are intended to allow those under going life changes -- such as marriage or job loss -- to apply for coverage after open enrollment has ended. insurers say that people are abusing the system, signing up only when they get sick. the obama administration has proposed guidelines that include requiring applicants to prove they qualify for special enrollment, but those rules have yet to be finalized.
(cnn) president joe biden's choice for the nation's top health official largely avoided hostile fire from republicans while testifying before the senate health committee tuesday, though several gop senators expressed concerns about his lack of direct health care experience as well as his support for abortion rights.\n\nbecerra, who would be the first latino hhs secretary if confirmed, defended his health care experience in his current job and in his long tenure in the house of representatives.\n\ni understand the enormous challenges before us and our solemn responsibility to faithfully steward this agency that touches almost every aspect of our lives. i'm humbled by the task. and i'm ready for it, becerra said. the mission of hhs -- to enhance the health and well being of all americans -- is core to who i am.\n\nhe is also set to testify wednesday before the senate finance committee, which will vote on his nomination.\n\nas secretary, becerra would play a key role in combating the pandemic, which has now claimed more than 500,000 american lives, up from more than 283,000 when he nominated . the biden administration has been operating without anyone in the post for more than a month.\n\nstressing that the nation's coronavirus response must be guided by science and by experts, he said backed biden's covid strategy and supported the president's plan to broaden health care access by building on the affordable care act. and in largely amicable exchanges, he promised lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to work with them on health care issues in their states.\n\nbecerra, who referenced his upbringing as a son of a mexican immigrant, also brought up his father's recent passing and his mother's access to health insurance when she fell ill.\n\nrepublican pushback\n\nseveral republicans on the committee focused on becerra's lack of experience in the health care field and his support for abortion and other liberal policies.\n\nmembers of congress do not become subject matter experts just because they are members of congress, just because they sit on a committee that has health responsibilities, said north carolina sen. richard burr, the committee's ranking member. i'm not sold yet. i'm not sure that you have the necessary experience or skills to do this job at this moment.\n\nburr also argued that becerra undervalues the input of the private sector and has called for policies that would undo decades of investment in american biomedical research.\n\namong the most heated moments of the two-and-a-half-hour hearing was utah republican sen. mitt romney's questioning of becerra's vote against a ban on partial birth abortion. the nominee responded that as attorney general, my job has been to follow the law and make sure others are following the law.\n\nwe may not always agree on where to go, but i think we can find some common ground on these issues, becerra said.\n\nromney responded: i think we can reach common ground on many issues, but on partial birth abortion, it sounds like we are not going to reach common ground there.\n\nobamacare defender\n\none of becerra's highest-profile health care roles recently has been chief defender of the affordable care act in court.\n\nhe has also battled the health care industry to keep costs down for consumers. in 2018, he filed a lawsuit against sutter health, a system of 24 hospitals and more than 12,000 doctors in northern california, for using anti-competitive practices to consolidate market power, resulting in higher health care prices. the attorney general secured a $575 million settlement that requires sutter to change some of its practices.\n\nin addition, becerra has been outspoken on the fight for women's health, the rights of undocumented immigrants and his support for medicare for all.\n\nother confirmation battles\n\nbecerra has so far avoided the fate of neera tanden , biden's nominee for the office of management and budget, who is facing public rejection from lawmakers in both parties. the white house said tuesday it is standing behind her.\n\nrepublicans have been targeting becerra since his selection was announced. arkansas sen. tom cotton on monday launched a digital advertisement in georgia and new hampshire tying becerra to california's response to the pandemic -- while pressuring any lawmakers up for election next cycle.\n\ncotton has been campaigning against becerra for months, highlighting multiple issues with the nominee, from keeping california's schools, churches and small businesses closed to his support for abortion rights.\n\nxavier becerra is a radical liberal with no real public health experience besides enforcing california's disastrous lockdowns, according to a statement released by cotton's office. if confirmed, xavier becerra will put the health insurance we get at our jobs at risk. any senator who votes for xavier becerra will face a reckoning from voters in the next election.\n\ncorrection: an earlier version of this story misstated arkansas sen. tom cotton's home state.\n\nthis story has been updated with details from the hearing.
washington (cnn) president donald trump said wednesday his administration will continue to push the supreme court to invalidate the affordable care act, defying a last-minute request from attorney general william barr to modify the administration's position.\n\nwe're not doing anything. in other words, we're staying with the group, with texas and the group, trump told reporters in the oval office.\n\nas it stands now, the trump administration position fully backs the lawsuit filed by a group of republican states seeking to invalidate the entire affordable care act.\n\nobamacare is a disaster, but we've run it very well, and we've made it barely acceptable, trump said. it was a disaster under president obama, and it's very bad health care. what we want to do is terminate it and give health care. we'll have great health care, including preexisting conditions.\n\ntrump said the administration had already pretty much killed it because we got rid of the individual mandate.\n\nread more

(cnn) president donald trump was impeached in december by the democratic-controlled house of representatives, but now it's up to the republican-led senate to decide whether to remove him from office.\n\nunder the rules, it takes two-thirds of the senate -- 67 votes -- to remove an impeached president. that means 20 republicans would have to turn on trump, an idea that seems fanciful, since no republicans have suggested the abuse of power that led to his impeachment should cost him the white house.\n\nhowever, that doesn't mean gop senators are not under pressure. in particular, they are facing a choice on the issue of whether witnesses should be called during the trial. democrats need four republicans to vote in favor of subpoenas for witnesses or new evidence in order to extend the trial and gather new information. getting that many will be difficult.\n\nrealistically, there are only perhaps four who would vote in favor of calling witnesses who could testify against the president. that short list includes relative moderates sens. susan collins of maine and lisa murkowski of alaska, trump-frustrated conservatives like sen. mitt romney of utah and endangered senators up for reelection like sen. cory gardner of colorado.\n\nbut there are democrats who could, feasibly, break with their party — giving republicans a bigger cushion to work with. and even if democrats can get four gop votes to approve witnesses broadly, there will be a separate fight over which specific witnesses get called and it could be that they never get enough votes to compel anyone to testify in the end.\n\nplus, trump is likely to try to exert executive privilege over witnesses, prompting some republicans to suggest they don't even want to bother trying. it's a pragmatic approach, maybe, but one which doesn't do much for the constitutional idea of separation of powers.\n\nhere's a larger list of senators to watch and why they're facing pressure to break with their party.\n\na conservative who has criticized trump\n\nconservatives once viewed trump skeptically. now the gop is united behind him. that doesn't mean there isn't frustration with his behavior.\n\nsen. mitt romney of utah (r)\n\nnext reelection: 2024\n\n2016 presidential winner: trump\n\n2020 rating: solid republican\n\nwhy he's important: romney is a conservative republican but he's no friend of trump and has flashed his independence at times. romney tried to sabotage trump's campaign in 2016 and then trump embarrassed him by pretending to consider romney as his secretary of state. but romney has also complained about how democrats went about impeachment.\n\nquote: i've already indicated that i'm interested to hear from john bolton, perhaps among others, he said.\n\nwill he flip? he's keeping everyone guessing\n\nfighting for reelection\n\nsenators in tough reelection fights are either appealing to the middle in their state, or to the base.\n\nsen. susan collins of maine (r)\n\nnext reelection: 2020\n\n2016 presidential winner: hillary clinton, but trump got 1 electoral vote under maine's split system\n\n2020 rating: leans democratic\n\nwhy she's important: collins is the only republican to side with democrats, albeit in a single vote on a minor point, on a portion of rules for the trial. if there's one republican likely to vote for witnesses, it's collins. she's in a tough reelection battle in a state that supported trump. she likes to portray herself as a moderate. she has broken with trump at key moments (obamacare) and helped him in others (voting to confirm supreme court justice brett kavanaugh).\n\nquote: i've worked very hard to make sure we vote on witnesses and documents at the appropriate stage of the trial. ... i tend to like information and would anticipate i would vote for more, she said i've worked very hard to make sure we vote on witnesses and documents at the appropriate stage of the trial. ... i tend to like information and would anticipate i would vote for more, she said this week\n\nwill she flip? it's a good bet she'll vote with democrats on something. but probably not on everything.\n\nsen. cory gardner of colorado (r)\n\nnext reelection: 2020\n\n2016 presidential winner: clinton\n\n2020 rating: leans democratic\n\nwhy he's important: perhaps the most endangered republican senator, gardner will have trouble keeping his seat against former gov. john hickenlooper, his likely democratic rival. his desk, which is usually situation towards the back of the chamber, is situated prominently in the front row on the republican side of the aisle during the impeachment trial and he's listened intently and taken lots of notes.\n\nquote: gardner has stayed extremely quiet recently, but did call impeachment a circus gardner has stayed extremely quiet recently, but did call impeachment a circus last year\n\nwill he flip? doubtful. gardner has not played to moderates like collins. he's trying to win in coloroado with a focus on the gop base.\n\nsen. martha mcsally of arizona (r)\n\nnext reelection: 2020\n\n2016 presidential winner: trump\n\n2020 rating: leans republican\n\nwhy she's important: mcsally lost a race for senate in 2018 to sen. kyrsten sinema, but she was appointed to fill out the term of sen. john mccain. now she's running for election to that seat in 2020. she faces a tough fight against former astronaut mark kelly. the fact that she bragged to her supporters about calling cnn's manu raju a hack suggests she's focused on the trump base in her state.\n\nquote: manu, you're a liberal hack. i'm not talking to you, she said when raju asked her if she was open to witnesses. manu, you're a liberal hack. i'm not talking to you, she said when raju asked her if she was open to witnesses. watch that moment here.\n\nwill she flip? clearly not\n\nsen. thom tillis of north carolina (r)\n\nnext reelection: 2020\n\n2016 presidential winner: trump\n\n2020 rating: tossup\n\nwhy he's important: barack obama won north carolina in 2008 and democrats have been trying to reclaim it ever since with no luck. it's a key state again in 2020.\n\nquote: it's time to get back to work on issues that are important to north carolinians, he said.\n\nwill he flip? nope.\n\nsen. joni ernst of iowa (r)\n\nnext reelection: 2020\n\n2016 presidential winner: trump\n\n2020 rating: leans republican\n\nwhy she's important: ernst is a stretch. iowa is less and less a swing state and she's pretty reliably in trump's corner on political issues. her statements have been very dismissive of impeachment and the need for more information.\n\nquote: in the house's own brief, they state numerous times that they have overwhelming evidence and if that's the case there shouldn't be any reason to bring forth any more documents or witnesses purely for political purposes, in the house's own brief, they state numerous times that they have overwhelming evidence and if that's the case there shouldn't be any reason to bring forth any more documents or witnesses purely for political purposes, she told a tv station in iowa\n\nwill she flip? doesn't seem likely.\n\nsen. doug jones of alabama (d)\n\nnext reelection: 2020\n\n2016 presidential winner: trump\n\n2020 rating: solid republican\n\nwhy he's important: jones was lucky to win a special election in 2017 to take the senate seat left vacant when jeff sessions left to become trump's first attorney general. now jones could face sessions, who is running for his old seat, in 2020. if there's a pickup opportunity for republicans, this is it. while jones has broken with democrats on some key issues, he's all in on impeachment.\n\nquote: a real trial has witnesses, a real trial has documents, a real trial has cross-examination, but because of senator mcconnell's rules, we're not really in a real trial.\n\nwill he flip? nope. he's committed to witnesses.\n\nmoderates not up for reelection\n\nthere are still some fans of bipartisanship in washington. but impeachment is a very partisan affair.\n\nsen. lisa murkowski of alaska (r)\n\nnext reelection: 2022\n\n2016 presidential winner: trump\n\n2020 rating: solid republican\n\nwhy she's important: murkowski is often lumped in with collins as a moderate, but that's a relative term in today's washington. she's part of a political dynasty in alaska that exists independent of the gop. in 2010 she lost a primary race there only to win a a write-in campaign, which is the politics equivalent of a murkowski is often lumped in with collins as a moderate, but that's a relative term in today's washington. she's part of a political dynasty in alaska that exists independent of the gop. in 2010 she lost a primary race there only to win a a write-in campaign, which is the politics equivalent of a triple lindy\n\nquote: the house made a decision that they didn't want to slow things down by having to go through the courts, murkowski told cnn. and yet now they're basically saying you guys gotta go through the courts. we didn't, but we need you to.\n\nwill she flip? we shall see. her frustrations with the impeachment process are already clear.\n\nsen. kyrsten sinema of arizona (d)\n\nnext reelection: 2024\n\n2016 presidential winner: trump\n\n2020 rating: leans republican\n\nwhy she's important: sinema won as a democrat in arizona, a state democrats have been trying to claim. she did it by evolving from an anti-war protester to a full-fledged moderate. but she's already on the record wanting witnesses at the trial.\n\nquote: she's been very quiet.\n\nwill she flip? not on this.\n\nsen. rob portman of ohio\n\nnext reelection: 2022\n\n2016 presidential winner: trump\n\n2020 rating: leans republican\n\nwhy he's important: portman is a fan of bipartisanship and he's projected that he has an open mind. but he rarely votes with democrats.\n\nquote: there will be an opportunity for us to seek new information or new witnesses, there will be an opportunity for us to seek new information or new witnesses, he told the associated press recently\n\nwill he flip?

political correspondent dana bash, and salem radio's hugh hewitt.\n\ncandidates, you have one minute and 15 seconds to answer each question, and 45 seconds to respond to followups or for rebuttals if your name is invoked. that's longer than you've had in previous debates.\n\ntiming lights will be visible. those lights will warn you when time is up. and as you requested, a bell will also sound, like this.\n\n(bell sound)\n\nwe know that each of you wants to debate these important issues, but please wait until you are called upon and please do not talk over one another. these are the rules to which all of you agreed.\n\nour goal this evening is a serious debate on the issues.\n\nit's time now for opening statements. you'll each have 30 seconds.\n\ngovernor kasich, we will start with you.\n\nkasich: well, thank you. you know, i look in the faces of people all across this country, and i know they want to be hopeful. and many are hopeful. look, i can take conservative policies to the white house, to washington, to restore the strength of our economy. but i also want to transfer power, money and influence to where you live, because i believe the strength in this country rests in the neighborhoods, the families, the communities and our states.\n\nand i believe it's a new partnership - a partnership that can allow us to restore the spirit of america and strengthen america for the best century we've ever had.\n\nthank you.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: senator rubio?\n\nrubio: every election is important. i believe this is the most important election in a generation. because what's at stake in this election is not simply what party is going to be in charge or which candidate wins. what's at stake is our identity as a nation and as a people.\n\nrubio: for over two centuries, america has been an exceptional nation. and now the time has come for this generation to do what it must do to keep it that way. if we make the right choice in this election, our children are going to be the freest and most prosperous americans that have ever lived. and the 21st century is going to be a new american century.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: senator cruz?\n\ncruz: fifty-nine years ago, florida welcomed my father to america as he stepped off the ferry boat from cuba onto key west. he was 18. he was filled with hopes and dreams, and yet he was in the freest land on the face of the earth.\n\nthis election, this debate is not about insults. it's not about attacks. it's not about any of the individuals on this stage. this election is about you and your children. it's about the freedom america has always had and making sure that that freedom is there for the next generation, that we stop washington from standing in the way of the hard-working taxpayers of america.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: mr. trump?\n\ntrump: one of the biggest political events anywhere in the world is happening right now with the republican party. millions and millions of people are going out to the polls and they're voting. they're voting out of enthusiasm. they're voting out of love. some of these people, frankly, have never voted before - 50 years old, 60 years old, 70 years old - never voted before.\n\nwe're taking people from the democrat party. we're taking people as independents, and they're all coming out and the whole world is talking about it. it's very exciting. i think, frankly, the republican establishment, or whatever you want to call it, should embrace what's happening.\n\nwe're having millions of extra people join. we are going to beat the democrats. we are going to beat hillary or whoever it may be. and we're going to beat them soundly.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: thank you. thank you.\n\nlet's begin with jobs and the economy, which republican voters say is the most important issue to them in this election. there have been some real differences expressed in - on this stage on whether trade deals have been good for the american workers. one of mr. trump's, the front runner's, signature issues is ending what he calls disastrous trade deals in order to bring jobs back to america.\n\ngovernor kasich, i'd like to start with you. you've been a strong advocate for these trade deals over the years. critics say these deals are great for corporate america's bottom line, but have cost the u.s. at least 1 million jobs. how do you respond to the criticism that you've been catering to board rooms at the expense of the american middle class?\n\nkasich: well, jake, i grew up in a blue collar family. and the simple fact of the matter is that of course we're sensitive about trade. one out of five americans works in a job connected to trade; 38 million americans are connected to it.\n\nbut my position has always been we want to have free trade, but fair trade. and i've been arguing all along that it is absolutely critical that when other countries break those agreements, we don't turn the process over to some international bureaucrat who comes back a couple years later and says, oh, america was right, and people are out of work.\n\nthe fact of the matter is we have to have an expedited process. when people cheat, when countries cheat and they take advantage of us, we need to blow the whistle. and as president of the united states, i absolutely will blow the whistle and begin to stand up for the american worker.\n\nbut we don't want to lock the doors and pull down the blinds and leave the world. because frankly, if we do that, prices will go up. people will buy less. other people will be out of work. and we don't want to see that happen.\n\ntrade, though, has to be balanced and we have to make sure that when we see a violation, like some country dumping their products into this country, believe me as president, i will stand up and i will shut down those imports because they're a violation of the agreement we have and the american worker expects us to stand up.\n\nand jake, my family worked in the steel industry, not with a white collar. i understand their plight.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: mr. trump, your critics say your campaign platform is inconsistent with how you run your businesses, noting that you've brought in foreign workers instead of hiring americans, and your companies manufacture clothing in china and mexico.\n\nwhy should voters trust that you will run the country differently from how you run your businesses? trump: because nobody knows the system better than me. i know the h1b. i know the h2b. nobody knows it better than me. i'm a businessman. these are laws. these are regulations. these are rules. we're allowed to do it. and frankly, because of the devaluations that other countries - the monetary devaluations that other countries are constantly doing and brilliantly doing against us, it's very, very hard for our companies in this country, in our country, to compete.\n\nso i will take advantage of it; they're the laws. but i'm the one that knows how to change it. nobody else on this dais knows how to change it like i do, believe me.\n\ntapper: senator rubio, last october, you said that you're, quote, generally very much in favor of free trade. more recently, you backed a away from your support of some trade deals. if elected, will you support free trade deals even if it means the inevitable loss of u.s. jobs?\n\nrubio: no, i support free trade deals that are good for america. we're 5 percent of the world's population. if all we do is sell things to each other, we can only sell to 5 percent of the people on earth. we have to have access to the hundreds of millions of people in the world today who can afford to buy things.\n\nthe problem is we're a low-tariff country. to import something into the united states is not very expensive, but many of these countries we can't export to because their tariffs are too high. and so i am in favor of deals that allow us to bring down those tariffs so that america can sell things to all these people around the world.\n\nthere are good trade deals and there are bad ones. so for example, here in florida, we have benefited from the free trade deal with colombia. it's allowed flower exporters to come into the united states but it's created jobs for hundreds of people who are now delivering those flowers and working in that industry. we have a surplus with colombia.\n\non the other hand, you've seen trade deals like in mexico that have been less than promising in some aspects, better in others. bottom line is i believe that america, if given access to foreign markets, our workers are the most productive in the world, our people are the most innovative on this planet. if it is a free and fair trade deal, we can compete against anyone in the world, and we need to in the 21st century.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: senator cruz, you were a supporter of the pacific trade deal, but after taking some heat from conservatives, you changed your position. why should these voters who don't like these trade deals trust that you will fight for them all the time and not just in election years?\n\ncruz: actually that's incorrect. there are two different agreements. there's tpa and tpp. i opposed tpp and have always opposed tpp, which is what you asked about. and when it comes to trade, look, free trade, when we open up foreign markets, helps americans. but we're getting killed in international trade right now. and we're getting killed because we have an administration that's doesn't look out for american workers and jobs are going overseas. we're driving jobs overseas.\n\nand the people who are losing out are in manufacturing jobs, or the steel industry or the auto industry. but i'll tell you who else is going to be losing out, which is the service industry. this obama administration is negotiating the trade in services agreement which is another treaty to allow services to come in and take jobs from americans as well.\n\nand you've got to understand. trade and immigration are interwoven, and they are hurting the working men and women of this country. so the question is, what's the solution? it's easy to talk about the problems. but do you have a solution to fix it? and i think the solution is several things.\n\nnumber one, we need to negotiate trade deals protecting american workers first, not the corporate board room. number two, we need to lift the regulations on american businesses here so we see jobs coming back. and number three, we need a tax plan like the tax plan i've introduced that will not tax exports and that will tax imports, and that will bring millions of high-paying jobs back to america.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: let's talk more about how american jobs are impacted by foreign workers. let's go to stephen dinan of the washington times. stephen.\n\ndinan: senator rubio in late 2014, disney laid off 250 tech workers in orlando, replacing many of them with foreign workers. some of the americans even had to train their own replacements. you support increasing the h-1b visa program that made it possible to bring in these foreign workers. doesn't this program take jobs away from americans?\n\nrubio: if it's being abused the way disney did. understand that program, it is illegal now under that program to use it to replace american workers. under that program, you have to prove not only that you're not replacing americans, but that you've tried to hire americans. and if a company is caught abusing that process, they should never be allowed to use it again.\n\nthe second problem with the current structure of the program that people perhaps don't understand is a lot of these companies are not directly hiring employees from abroad. they are hiring a consulting company like tata, for example, out of india. that company then hoards up all of these visas. they hire workers. you hire - disney or some other company hires this company.\n\nwhat they're basically doing is they are insourcing and outsourcing. they are bringing in workers from abroad that are not direct employees of a disney or someone else, they're employees of this consulting business. and what i argue is that no consulting business such as that should be allowed to hoard up all of these visas, that the visas should only be available for companies to use to directly hire workers and that we should be stricter in how he enforce it.\n\nit is illegal now, it is a violation of the law now to use that program to replace americans. and if a company is caught doing that, whether it be disney or anyone else, they should be barred from using the program in the future.\n\ndinan: senator rubio, real quick follow-up on this.\n\n(applause)\n\nyou've - in the - in the context of illegal immigration, you've called for basically putting off any legalization process until we get the border secured.\n\nrubio: correct.\n\ndinan: why not call for a pause on h1bs until those abuses you've talked about are solved.\n\nrubio: well first, i think - well, i'd be open to it if it takes a pause. but i don't think it takes a pause to enforce the law. what they are doing is they are in fact using that program to replace an american.\n\nif there's an american working at disney and they bring someone from another country using h1b to replace their direct job, that's in violation of the law. and what i'm explaining to you is, what they are doing now is they are not - what they are doing is they are eliminating the job.\n\nthey are outsourcing the entire tech division to a consulting company. they are making the argument that we didn't replace you. we just replaced the whole unit by hiring a company to do it instead. and that company that they're hiring is bringing their workers from abroad. it's a loophole they've figured out that we need to close so they can no longer continue to do it that way.\n\n(applause)\n\ndinan: governor kasich, i want to come to you next. mr. trump says that legal immigration is producing quote, lower wages and higher unemployment for u.s. workers. he's calling for a pause on green cards issued to foreign workers. wouldn't that help workers in the u.s.?\n\nkaisch: well look, i believe in immigration, but it has to be controlled. the simple fact of the matter is i wouldn't be standing here. i'd be maybe running for president of croatia if we didn't have immigration.\n\nimmigration is something that brings youth and vibrance and energy to our country. but we clearly have to control our borders. we can't have people just walking in. look, we lock our doors at night in our homes. the country has to be able to lock its doors as well. so, we - i have a comprehensive plan to deal with this problem of immigration.\n\ni would say we have to absolutely finish the wall and guard the border. and if anybody were to come in after that, they are going to have to go back. no excuses because we can't continue this problem. i think we ought to have a guest worker program, where people come in, work and go home.\n\nand i think at the same time, for the 11 and a half million who are here, then in my view if they have not committed a crime since they've been here, they get a path to legalization. not to citizenship. i believe that program can pass the congress in the first 100 days.\n\nbut let's not lose sight of the fact that the whole key to the future of america is strong economic growth with common sense regulation, lower taxes and a balanced budget.\n\nwe can have a rising tide that lifts all the workers in america, all the people who are citizens of america, if we'll just follow the formula that works, that i used in washington. and guess what, i've used it in ohio to grow over 400 private sector jobs since i've been governor\n\ndinan: mr. trump, i do want to come to you. will you also in your answer, address how long you think that pause would be and what that pause would look like.\n\ntrump: i will. first of all, i think and i know the h1b very well. and it's something that i frankly use and i shouldn't be allowed to use it. we shouldn't have it. very, very bad for workers. and second of all, i think it's very important to say, well, i'm a businessman and i have to do what i have to do.\n\nwhen it's sitting there waiting for you, but it's very bad. it's very bad for business in terms of - and it's very bad for our workers and it's unfair for our workers. and we should end it. very importantly, the disney workers endorsed me, as you probably read.\n\nand i got a full endorsement because they are the ones that said, and they had a news conference, and they said, he's the only one that's going to be able to fix it. because it is a mess. i think for a period of a year to two years we have to look back and we have to see, just to answer the second part of your question, where we are, where we stand, what's going on.\n\nwe have to sort of take a strong, good, hard look and come up with plans that work. and we're rushing into things, and we're just - we're leading with the chin.\n\n(bell rings)\n\nwe're leading with people that don't know what they are doing in terms of our leadership. i'd say a minimum of one year, maybe two years.\n\ndinan: senator cruz, i want to bring you in very quickly on this.\n\n(applause)\n\ndinan: the united states averages about a million new permanent legal immigrants a year and hundreds of thousands more guest workers. what should the right level be?\n\ncruz: well, we need to redefine our legal immigration system so that it meets the needs of the american economy. right now, we're bringing in far too many low skilled workers. what that is doing is driving down the wages of hard-working americans. our system isn't working. and then on top of that, we've got a system that's allowing in millions of people to be here illegally.\n\nand the answer to that, i've laid out a very, very detailed immigration plan on my website. we're going to build a wall, triple the border patrol. we're going to end sanctuary cities. and let me tell you how we're going to do that.\n\nwe're going to cut off federal taxpayer funds to any city that defies federal immigration laws.\n\n(applause)\n\ncruz: we're going to end welfare benefits for anyone who is here illegally. and the thing to understand, stephen, we can solve these problems. it's not that we don't know how to do it. it's that we're lacking the political will. neither of the parties in washington wants to do this.\n\nthe democrats support illegal immigration because they view those illegal immigrants as potential voters and far too many of the republicans are doing the bidding of wall street and the special interest and they view it as cheap labor.\n\ncruz: we need instead leadership that works for the working men and women of this country. we need an immigration system that takes care of the jobs of the working men and women of this country.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: senator rubio, did you want to weigh in?\n\nrubio: well, i would add when you talk about the millions of green cards that are coming in, those aren't actually workers at all. they are just coming in primarily based on family connection. and ;let me tell you, when my parents came in 1956, i acknowledge that my parents came to the u.s. on a family-based system.\n\nthe problem is nothing looks like it did 60 years ago. the 21st century economy simply is not creating enough jobs for people that don't have skills. when my parents came, they had a very limited education. my father stopped going to school when he was 9 years old because his mother died and he had to work. and he would work the next 70 years of his life and never go back to school. and i'm grateful every day that america welcomed them.\n\nbut today in the 21st century, 60 years later, finding jobs when you don't have skills is very difficult. we need to move to a merit- based system of immigration, not just on h-1b, particularly on green cards. the primary criteria for bringing someone from abroad in the 21st century should be, what skills do you have? what business are you going to open? what investment are you going to make? what job are you going to be able to do when you arrive in the united states?\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: education obviously plays a large role when it comes to jobs and the economy. the united states has long been falling behind others in the industrialized world. american students currently rank 27th out of 34 countries in math and 17th in reading.\n\nmr. trump, you've called the education standards known as common core a disaster. what are your specific objections to common core?\n\ntrump: education through washington, d.c. i don't want that. i want local education. i want the parents, and i want all of the teachers, and i want everybody to get together around a school and to make education great.\n\nand it was very interesting, i was with dr. ben carson today, who is endorsing me, by the way, tomorrow morning, and he is…\n\n(applause)\n\ntrump: we were talking. we spoke for over an hour on education. and he has such a great handle on it. he wants competitive schools. he wants a lot of different things that are terrific, including charter schools, by the way, that the unions are fighting like crazy. but charter schools work and they work very well.\n\nso there are a lot of things. but i'm going to have ben very involved with education, something that's an expertise of his.\n\ntapper: ok. but just to clarify, the common core standards were developed by the states, states and localities voluntarily adopt them, and they come up with their own curricula to meet those standards. so when you say education by washington, d.c., what do you mean?\n\ntrump: you're right, jake. but it has been taken over by the federal government. it was originally supposed to be that way. and certainly sounds better that way. but it has all been taken over now by the bureaucrats in washington, and they are not interested in what's happening in miami or in florida, in many cases.\n\nnow in some cases they would be. but in many cases they are more interested in their paycheck and the big bureaucracy than they are taking care of the children.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: governor kasich, you have called opposition to common core hysteria. what is your response to grassroots conservatives who do not agree with you?\n\nkasich: well, look, all i'm in favor of in ohio is high standards. first of all, let me tell you, i would take 125 federal education programs, put them in four buckets, and send them back to the states. ok, i've been working on this for many, many years.\n\nsecondly, jake, in our state, the state school board sets the standards. and we want high standards because we have not always had high standards, unfortunately. they set the standards and the local school boards develop the curriculum.\n\nnot only did we have that in the law, we reasserted it in the law. and we also want parental advisers in the local school district so that, in fact, you know, frankly, education has to be run at the school board level with a little guidance from the state.\n\nnow on top of that, you want to talk about the 21st century and what we need to do with our kids? we need to start connecting them to the real world. we need to be training them for the jobs of the 21st century, not the jobs of 20 years ago.\n\nwe need vocational education starting in the seventh grade where kids can get that kind of education that can take them to college, but all the way through their k through 12 they ought to be connected with real-world jobs.\n\nfrankly, what ought to happen is we ought to get them to pursue their god-given talents and connect them with the things that give them passion. and that's exactly what we're doing in ohio, combined with mentoring programs to talk to kids about what their future can be.\n\nso let me be clear, local control, obviously, high state standards. that's what it is in the state of ohio.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: so, senator cruz, let me bring you in. you object to common core. governor kasich says it's local school boards developing local curriculum to meet higher standards. what's wrong with that?\n\ncruz: common core is a disaster. and if i am elected president, in the first days as president, i will direct the department of education that common core ends that day.\n\n(applause)\n\ncruz: now, let me tell you why you can do that, because it's easy to talk about the problem, but you have to understand the solutions. the obama administration has abused executive power in forcing common core on the states. it has used race-to-the-top funds to effectively blackmail and force the states to adopt common core.\n\nnow, the one silver lining of obama abusing executive power is that everything done with executive power can be undone with executive power, and i intend to do that.\n\n(applause)\n\nbeyond that, though, jake, i intend to work to abolish the federal department of education and send education back to the states and back to the local governments.\n\nand let me say finally, the most important reform we can do in education after getting the federal government out of it, is expand school choice; expand charter schools and home schools and private schools and vouchers, and scholarships. and give every child - african american, hispanic - every child in need an opportunity to access to a quality education.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: let's move on to another topic of particular interest here in florida. florida has the highest percentage of seniors in the country. there are 3.1 million senior citizens here who receive social security benefits, and they're very interested in hearing what you candidates intend to do to keep social security going for future generations.\n\nlet me turn now to my colleague dana bash.\n\nbash: senator rubio, you argue americans your age must have an honest conversation about making social security sustainable. for people under 55, you want to raise the retirement age and also reduce benefits for wealthier americans. so, what should the new retirement age be? and how much will those benefits be cut?\n\nrubio: well, first of all, let me say that you're right, there are about 3 million seniors in florida with social security and medicare. one of them is my mother, who happens to be here today. i'm against any changes to social security that are bad for my mother. and we don't have to make any changes for them. but anyone who tells you that social security can stay the way it is is lying. any politician that goes around saying, we don't have to anything; all we have to do is raise a few taxes or just leave it the way it is, they're not being honest with you.\n\nsocial security will go bankrupt and it will bankrupt the country with it. so what it will require is people younger, like myself, people that are 30 years away from retirement, to accept that our social security is going to work differently than it did for my parents.\n\nfor example, instead of retiring at 67 the way i'm supposed to retire, i'd have to retire at 68. if i were still in the senate, i'd be one of the youngest people there.\n\n(laughter)\n\nif i've made a lot of money, my social security benefit will not grow as fast as someone who made less money. and by the way, medicare could very well become the option of using my medicare benefit to buy a private plan that i like better. medicare advantage does that now.\n\nthese are not unreasonable changes to ask of someone like myself who is 25 or 30 years away from retirement, in exchange for leaving the program undisturbed for the people that are on it now or about to retire, and ensuring that we do not bankrupt our country and that this program still exists when my children retire, when my grandchildren retire, when i retire.\n\n(applause)\n\nbash: senator, the question was specific though. you made your plan very clear about generally what you want to do, but how high would the retirement age go and how much would you cut those benefits?\n\nrubio: well, i'm sorry i didn't answer that part. so the thing is that my - my generation, someone my age would retire at 68. we would continue to allow it to increase the retirement age for future generations until it hit 70. and so my children would retire at 70. i would retire at 68. it would be a graduating scale over a period of time.\n\nbut again i'm talking about people like myself and ted who are 45 years old. we're years away from retirement. for people that are on it now, we don't have to change it at all. if we don't do anything, we will have a debt crisis. it's not a question of if. it is a question of when. in less than five years, only 17 percent of our budget will remain discretionary; 83 percent of the federal budget in less than five years will all be spent on medicare, medicaid, the interest on the debt.\n\nthat's - all of it will be eaten up by that. that's a debt crisis. and it will be debilitating to our economy and our children deserve better than to inherit a debt crisis.\n\n(applause)\n\nbash: mr. trump, you don't want to raise the retirement age, and you also don't want to cut benefits even for wealthier americans. but according to the social security administration, unless adjustments are made, social security is projected to run out of money within 20 years. so specifically, what would you do to stop that from happening?\n\ntrump: well, first of all, i want you to understand that the democrats, and i've watched them very intensely, even though it's a very, very boring thing to watch, that the democrats are doing nothing with social security. they're leaving it the way it is. in fact, they want to increase it. they want to actually give more.\n\nand that's what we're up against. and whether we like it or not, that is what we're up against.\n\ni will do everything within my power not to touch social security, to leave it the way it is; to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant.\n\ntrump: and it's my absolute intention to leave social security the way it is. not increase the age and to leave it as is.\n\nyou have 22 years, you have a long time to go. it's not long in terms of what we're talking about, but it's still a long time to go, and i want to leave social security as is, i want to make our country rich again so we can afford it. i want to bring back our jobs, i want to do things that will make us, that will bring back gdp…\n\ni mean, as an example, gdp was zero essentially for the last two quarters. if that ever happened in china. you would have had a depression like nobody's ever seen before. they go down to 7 percent, 8 percent, and it's a - it's a national tragedy. we're at zero, we're not doing anything.\n\nwe've lost our jobs. we've lost everything. we're losing everything. our jobs are gone, our businesses are being taken out of the country. i want to make america great again and i want to leave social security as is. we're going to get rid of waste, fraud, abuse and bring back business.\n\n(applause)\n\nbash: senator rubio, i know you want to get in. hang on one second, i just want to follow up with mr. trump. you're talking about waste, fraud and abuse, but an independent bipartisan organization, the committee for a responsible federal budget, says improper payments like you're talking about, that would only save about $3 billion, but it would take $150 billion to make social security solvent. so how would you find that other $147 million?\n\ntrump: because they don't cover most of the subjects. we're the policemen of the world. we take care of the entire world. we're going to have a stronger military, much stronger. our military is depleted. but we take care of germany, we take care of saudi arabia, we take care of japan, we take care of south korea. we take - every time this maniac from north korea does anything, we immediately send our ships. we get virtually nothing.\n\nwe have 28,000 soldiers on the line, on the border between north and south korea. we have so many places. saudi arabia was making a billion dollars a day, and we were getting virtually nothing to protect them. we are going to be in a different world. we're going to negotiate real deals now, and we're going to bring the wealth back to our country. we owe $19 trillion. we're going to bring wealth back to our country. (applause)\n\nbash: senator rubio, will that be enough to save social security?\n\nrubio: no. and i - and i think you've outlined why. the numbers don't add up. you know, when i ran for the senate in 2010, i came out and said we're going to have to make changes to social security, and everyone said that's the end of your campaign. in florida, you can't talk about that, but people know that it's the truth here in florida.\n\nfraud is not enough. certainly, let's wipe out the fraud, but as you said, it won't add up. you already gave those numbers. the second point is on foreign aid. i hear that all the time as well. i'm against any sort of wasting of money on foreign aid, but it's less than 1 percent of our federal budget. the numbers don't add up.\n\nthe bottom line is we can't just continue to tip-toe around this and throw out things like i'm going to get at fraud and abuse. let's get rid of fraud, let's get rid of abuse, let's be more careful about how we spend foreign aid. but you still have hundreds of billions of dollars of deficit that you're going to have to make up.\n\nand here's the thing. if we do not do it, we will have a debt crisis. not to mention a crisis in social security and medicare. both parties have taken far too long to deal with it. it is one of the major issues confronting america. it's barely been asked in any of these debates. and we'd better deal with or we're going to have to explain to our children why they inherited this disaster.\n\n(applause)\n\nbash: mr. trump, senator rubio says your numbers don't add up. what's your response? senator rubio says that your numbers don't add up. what's your response, mr. trump?\n\ntrump: well, i don't know if he's saying that. look, i'm just saying very simply we have a country that i've never seen anything like it. i've been going over budgets and looking at budgets. we don't bid things out. we don't bid out, as an example, the drug industry, pharmaceutical industry. they don't go out to bid. they just pay almost as if you walk into a drug store. that's what they're paying.\n\nand the reason is they have a fantastic lobby. they take care of all of the senators, the congressmen. they have great power and they don't bid out. the military is never properly bid. when we go out to military bids, it's not properly bid. and the people that really sell us the product are oftentimes the product we don't want, only because that particular company has political juice, ok?\n\ni'm self-funding my campaign. nobody is going to be taking care of me. i don't want anybody's money. i will tell you something. we're going to go out to bid in virtually every different facet of our government. we're going to save a fortune. (applause)\n\nbash: thank you, mr. trump. senator cruz, you advocate allowing younger workers to put some of their social security taxes into personal accounts. what do you say to critics who say that market volatility means that this is a disastrous proposal?\n\ncruz: well, number one, we need to see responsibility. social security right now is careening towards insolvency, and it's irresponsible. and any politician that doesn't step forward and address it is not being a real leader. we need to see political courage to take this on and save and strengthen social security.\n\n(applause)\n\ncruz: and as president, what i will do for seniors, for anyone at or near retirement, there will be no changes whatsoever. every benefit will be protected to the letter. but for younger workers, we need to change the rate of growth of benefits so it matches inflation instead of exceeding inflation. and as you noted dinan, we need to have for younger workers, that a portion of your tax payments are in personal accounts, like the 401(k), that you own, that you control, that you can pass on to your kids and grandkids.\n\n(applause)\n\ncruz: and one of the things that is critically important. listen, we've got lots of challenges in the world. but the answer can't just be wave a magic wand and say problem go away. you have to understand the problems. you have to have real solutions.\n\nit's like government spending. it is very easy. hillary clinton says she'll cut waste, fraud and abuse. if only we had smarter people in washington, that would fix the problem. you know what? that is the statement of a liberal who doesn't understand government is the problem.\n\n(applause)\n\ncruz: here's my philosophy. the less government, the more freedom. the fewer bureaucrats, the more prosperity. and there are bureaucrats in…\n\n(bell rings)\n\n… washington right now who are killing jobs and i'll tell you, i know who they are. i will find them and i will fire them.\n\nbash: did you justice just compare donald trump to hillary clinton on this issue?\n\ncruz: i will let donald speak for himself. but i will say, there's a reason, in my campaign i've laid out a very, very specific spend and cut plan, $500 billion. i've specified five major agencies that i would eliminate, 25 programs. and dana, you know why political candidates don't do that? because when you do that, the lobbyists attack you. when you specify the programs you would eliminate, then you get attacked. let's talk for example back in iowa the first primary. when i went to iowa and campaigned against ethanol mandates, everyone said that was political suicide. you can't take on ethanol in iowa. and my opponents on this stage not only didn't do the same. they attacked me and even promised to expand corporate welfare.\n\n(bell rings)\n\nif we're going to stop bankrupting our kids and grandkids, you've got to be willing to take on the lobbyists, which means not just some fanciful waste, fraud and abuse, but specifying these are the programs i'll eliminate so that we can take care of the hard working taxpayer.\n\n(applause)\n\nbash: thank you senator cruz.\n\nmr. trump, would you like to respond?\n\ntrump: yes. if you look back to iowa, ted did change his view and his stance on ethanol quite a bit. he did and - at the end. not full on, but he did change his view in the hopes of maybe doing well. and you know, i think everybody knows that. it was a front page story all over the place, and he did make a change.\n\nbash: senator cruz?\n\ncruz: listen, if you are fed up with washington, the question you ought to be asking is who is willing to take on washington? it's easy to have language, i'm fed up with the corruption in washington. but if you have a candidate who has been funding liberal democrats and funding the washington establishment, it's very hard to imagine how suddenly this candidate is going to take on washington.\n\nwhen i stood up and led the fight against obamacare, washington was furious and attacked me, but i did it because i was honoring my commitment to the hard-working men and women of this country who are losing their jobs because of obamacare.\n\n(applause)\n\ncruz: when i led the fight against amnesty, it's because i was standing with the people…\n\n(bell rings)\n\n… against washington. and if you want to tell people you're going to stand against washington, the question we should ask is, when have you ever stood up to the lobbyists in washington?\n\nbash: ok. mr. trump, i'll let you respond because he mentioned you but then i'm going to move to governor kasich. go ahead.\n\ntrump: well, that's fine. first of all, ted was in favor of amnesty. so there's no question about that. and sheriff joe arpaio recently endorsed me and there's nobody tougher on the borders than sheriff joe. and jeff sessions, one of the most respected senator in washington, an incredible man, also endorsed me.\n\nand there's nobody that knows more about the borders than senator jeff sessions. i would say this. we're all in this together. we're going to come up with solutions. we're going to find the answers to things. and so far i cannot believe how civil it's been up here.\n\n(applause)\n\nbash: governor kasich, let's get back to social security. you told a voter in new hampshire to quote, get over cuts to social security benefits because you have a reform plan and that is just the reality you say that is out there. why is cutting social security payments the solution?\n\nkasich: well, first of all, we hear about taking on washington. i took on washington and i won. i actually got the budget balanced when i was a member of the congress, the chairman of the budget committee. we paid down a half a trillion dollars of the national debt. we also balanced the budget four years in a row. and we were just growing jobs like crazy and the wage issue was not even an issue then.\n\ni also had a plan in 1999 to save social security and take the $5 trillion projected surplus and not only have social security for our young people, but also to give them private accounts. now there are more 18-year-olds who believe they have a better chance of seeing a ufo than a social security check and we have a lot of seniors who are very nervous.\n\nkasich: i have a plan to fix it that doesn't even require raising the retirement age.\n\nif you've had wealth throughout your lifetime, when the time comes to be on social security, you'll still get it. it will just simply be less. and for those people who depend on that social security, they'll get their full benefit. that's the way it will work. and we don't have to monkey around with the retirement age. and how do i know that? i've done all this before.\n\nthis is not a theory. do you have to take on entitlement programs to balance a budget? yes. it doesn't mean you have to cut them. it means you need to innovate them, the way we do things in the 21st century.\n\nso not only did we have a balanced budget in washington, but when i went to ohio, we were $8 billion in the hole and now we're $2 billion in the black. our credit is strong. we're up 400,000 jobs. and i want to go back with the same formula to beat the washington insiders again.\n\nand i will get it done, and this country will be much stronger economically as a result.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: thank you, governor.\n\nlet's take a broader look at the republican party now. mr. trump, one of the concerns your opponents have expressed throughout the course of this campaign is the notion that in their estimation you hold views that are at direct odds with republican party tradition.\n\nhow are you looking to fundamentally change the republican party as its potential leader? what should the republican party stand for in 2016?\n\ntrump: well, first of all, i don't really think that. i think that i hold views that are very similar to many of the people. we are more inclusive. and if you look at the polls and if you look at the millions of people that have been pouring into the polls, it's, again, the biggest story.\n\nyou look at all of these people that are coming in, something is happening. i am different in one primary respect, and that's trade. i feel that we have had horrible negotiators, horrible trade deals. the jobs in this country are disappearing, and especially the good jobs.\n\nyou look at the recent jobs reports, which are really done so that presidents and politicians look good, because all of these people looking for jobs, when they give up, they go home, they give up, and they are considered statistically employed. so that's that.\n\nbut i will say, trade deals are absolutely killing our country. the devaluations of their currencies by china and japan and many, many other countries, and we don't do it because we don't play the game. and the only way we're going to be able to do it is we're going to have to do taxes unless they behave.\n\nif you don't tax certain products coming into this country from certain countries that are taking advantage of the united states and laughing at our stupidity, we're going to continue to lose businesses and we're going to continue to lose jobs.\n\nand if you look at the average worker over the last 12 years, their salary and their pay have gone down, not up. it has gone down. and i think that's why there has been such an outpouring of love to what i'm saying.\n\ntapper: thank you, mr. trump. senator cruz…\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: … donald trump has so far won 35 percent of the vote. those people are signing up to his vision of the republican party. what do you think is wrong with that vision?\n\ncruz: well, donald is right, for example, he was just talking about international trade. he's right about the problems. but his solutions don't work. so, for example, his solution on international trade, he proposed earlier a 45 percent tariff on foreign goods.\n\nnow he backed away from that immediately and he may come back with a different number tonight. i don't know where he'll be tonight. but i'll tell you what happens. you know, we've seen prior presidential candidates who proposed massive tariffs, you know, smoot- hawley led to the great depression.\n\nand the effect of a 45 percent tariff would be when you go to the store, when you go to walmart, when you are shopping for your kids, the prices you pay go up 45 percent. but not only that, when you put those in place, because a tariff is a tax on you, the american people, but the response of that is that the countries we trade with put in their own tariffs.\n\na much better solution that works is the tax plan i've laid out which would enable our exports to be tax-free, would tax our imports, would not raise prices for americans, and would not result in reciprocal tariffs. fix the problem and that's what's missing from what donald says.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: mr. trump, we'll give you a chance to respond.\n\ntrump: the 45 percent tax is a threat. it was not a tax, it was a threat. it will be a tax if they don't behave. take china as an example. i have many friends, great manufacturers, they want to go into china. they can't. china won't let them. we talk about free trade. it's not tree free trade, it's stupid trade.\n\nchina dumps everything that they have over here. no tax, no nothing, no problems, no curfews (ph), no anything. we can't get into china. i have the best people, manufacturers, they can't get in. when they get in, they have to pay a tremendous tax.\n\nthe 45 percent is a threat that if they don't behave, if they don't follow the rules and regulations so that we can have it equal on both sides, we will tax you. it doesn't have to be 45, it could be less. but it has to be something because our country and our trade and our deals and most importantly our jobs are going to hell.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: senator cruz?\n\ncruz: jake, let me be clear what donald just said. he said that that 45 percent tax is a threat. and mind you, you are paying the tax. it's not china that pays the tax. it's you, the working men and women.\n\nso ask yourself at home: how is this helping you? if your wages have been stagnant for 20 years; if you can't pay the bills, how does it help you to have a president come and say, i'm going to jack - i'm going to put a 45 percent tax on diapers when you buy diapers, on automobiles when you buy automobiles, on clothing when you buy clothing. that hurts you.\n\nit's why we've got to get beyond rhetoric of china bad, and actually get to how do you solve the problem. because this solution would hurt jobs and hurt hard-working taxpayers in america.\n\ntapper: ok.\n\ntrump: jake, i have to say - honestly, it's just the opposite. what will happen if they don't behave, we will put on a tax of some amount, and it could be a large amount, and we will start building those factories and those plants. instead of in china, we'll build them here. and people will buy products from here, rather than buying it through china where we're being ripped off. and we have a $505 billion trade deficit right now.\n\nso we'll build our factories here and we'll make our own products. and that's the way it should be done. and the way we've been doing it for the last long period of time is our country - our country is in serious, serious trouble. it's a bubble and it's going to explode, believe me.\n\ntapper: all right. we're going to take a very quick break. when we come back, we'll have much more of this republican presidential debate from the university of miami right after this. stay with us.\n\n(applause)\n\n(commercial break)\n\ntapper: welcome back to the cnn republican presidential debate in miami, florida.\n\nmr. trump, let me start with you. last night, you told cnn quote, islam hates us? did you mean all 1.6 billion muslims.\n\ntrump: i mean a lot of them. i mean a lot of them.\n\ndinan: do you want to clarify the comment at all?\n\ntrump: well, you know, i've been watching the debate today. and they're talking about radical islamic terrorism or radical islam. but i will tell you this. there's something going on that maybe you don't know about, maybe a lot of other people don't know about, but there's tremendous hatred. and i will stick with exactly what i said to anderson cooper.\n\n(applause)\n\ndinan: senator rubio, your supporter, republican senator jeff sessions, said in response to mr. trump's comment last night, i'm sorry - senator jeff flake, i apologize. your supporter, republican senator jeff flake said in response to that comment, republicans are better than this. do you agree?\n\nrubio: well, let me say, i know that a lot of people find appeal in the things donald says cause he says what people wish they could say. the problem is, presidents can't just say anything they want. it has consequences, here and around the world.\n\n(applause)\n\nrubio: and so let me give you one. two days ago, i met this extraordinary couple who were on furlough because they are missionaries in bangladesh. it's a very tough place to be a missionary. it's muslim.\n\nand their safety and security very much relies upon friendly muslims that live along side them, that may not convert, but protect them and certainly look out for them. and their mission field really are muslims that are looking to convert to christianity as well. and they tell me that today they have a very hostile environment in which to operate in because the news is coming out that in america, leading political figures are saying that america doesn't like muslims. so this is a real impact. there's no doubt that radical islam is a danger in the world.\n\ni can also tell you if you go to any national cemetery, especially arlington, you're going to see crescent moons there. if you go anywhere in the world you're going see american men and women serving us in uniform that are muslims.\n\n(applause)\n\nrubio: and they love america. and as far as i know, no one on this stage has served in uniform in the united states military. anyone out there that has the uniform of the united states on and is willing to die for this country is someone that loves america. no matter what their religious background may be.\n\ndinan: mr. trump?\n\n(applause)\n\ntrump: marco talks about consequences. well, we've had a lot of consequences, including airplanes flying into the world trade center, the pentagon and could have been the white house. there have been a lot of problems.\n\nnow you can say what you want, and you can be politically correct if you want. i don't want to be so politically correct. i like to solve problems. we have a serious, serious problem of hate.\n\n(applause)\n\ntrump: there is tremendous hate. there is tremendous hate. where large portions of a group of people, islam, large portions want to use very, very harsh means. let me go a step further. women are treated horribly. you know that. you do know that. women are treated horribly, and other things are happening that are very, very bad.\n\n(bell rings)\n\nnow i will say this, there is tremendous hatred. the question was asked, what do you think? i said, there is hatred. now it would be very easy for me to say something differently. and everybody would say, oh, isn't that wonderful.\n\ndinan: mr. trump, thank you.\n\ntrump: we better solve the problem before it's too late.\n\ndinan: senator rubio?\n\n(applause) rubio: well, here we go. see, i'm not interested in being politically correct. i'm not interested in being politically correct. i'm interested in being correct.\n\n(applause)\n\nrubio: and in order to be correct on this issue, here's the bottom line. we do work. there is - islam has a major problem on its hands. it has a significant percentage of its adherents, particular in the sunni faith but also in the shia, who have been radicalized. and are willing to fly planes into a building and kill innocent people.\n\nthere is no doubt about that. it is also true if you look around the world at the challenges we face, we are going to have to work together with other - with muslims, who do not - who are not radicals. we're going to have to work with the jordanian kingdom.\n\nwe're going to have to work with the saudis. we're going to have to work with the gulf kingdoms. we're going to have to work with the egyptians to defeat, for example, isis.\n\n(bell ring)\n\nrubio: it will take a sunni arab movement to defeat them.\n\nand so i think you can be correct without meaning to be politically correct. we are going to have to work with people of the muslim faith even as islam itself faces a serious crisis within it of radicalization.\n\ntapper: thank you, senator.\n\n(applause)\n\ngovernor kasich, do you think islam hates us?\n\nkasich: no, i don't. i think there is a sect of, you know, this radical islam that is really, really serious, and poses the greatest threat to us today. there isn't any question. and that's why the whole world has to work together to make sure that we don't have proliferation of these weapons of mass destruction.\n\nbut look, i was there when, and saw it, when the egyptian ambassador to the united states was in the rose garden bringing the arab muslim world to work with us to repel saddam hussein from kuwait. the fact is that if we're going to defeat isis, we're going to have to have these countries. and they are egypt. and they are saudi arabia. and they are jordan. and they are the gulf states.\n\nand we're going to have in some way or another a rapprochement with turkey. and i frankly think the europeans went in the wrong direction when they rejected turkey from joining in to the economic sphere of europe. the simple fact of the matter is, a lot of these muslim countries, they are just - they can't believe the stuff they see out of people who have distorted their faith.\n\nlook, the people who represent radical islam, they want to destroy everything that we're about and other muslims who don't share their view. but at the end of the day, we've got to bring the world together, the civilized world. and we all speak with one voice to make sure that people who sit on the fence understand what civilization is, and we represent it, and equality and hope for everybody.\n\ntapper: thank you, governor kasich.\n\nmr. trump, i want to ask you about something else you've said during the course of this campaign. you said that the u.s. has to, quote, take out the families of terrorists. when it was pointed out that targeting civilians is against the geneva conventions, you said, quote, so they can kill us, but we can't kill them?\n\nit is against federal, military and international law to target civilians. so how will you order the military to target the families of suspected terrorists, while also abiding by the law?\n\ntrump: let me go back to the other just for a second. in large mosques, all over the middle east, you have people chanting death to the usa. now, that does not sound like a friendly act to me.\n\nas far as the families are concerned, and as far as the law is concerned, we have a law - this all started with your question on water boarding. we have a law that doesn't allow right now water boarding. they have no laws. they have no rules. they have no regulations. they chop off heads. they drown 40, 50, 60 people at a time in big steel cages, pull them up an hour later, everyone dead. and we're working on a different set of parameters.\n\nnow, we have to obey the laws. have to obey the laws. but we have to expand those laws, because we have to be able to fight on at least somewhat of an equal footing or we will never ever knock out isis and all of the others that are so bad.\n\nwe better expand our laws or we're being a bunch of suckers, and they are laughing at us. they are laughing at us, believe me.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: senator rubio, would you as president pursue a policy of targeting the families of suspected terrorists?\n\nrubio: no, of course not. and we don't have to in order to defeat terrorists. the way you defeat terrorists is pretty straightforward. it's difficult to do, but it has to be done. when i'm president of the united states, the best intelligence agencies in the world that right now have been hamstrung. they're going to be expanded. and the best intelligence agencies in the world are going to find terrorists.\n\nand then the best military in the world, which needs to be rebuilt because - because barack obama is gutting our military. he's going to leave us with the smallest army since the end of world war ii, and the smallest navy in a century, and the smallest air force we've ever had.\n\nwe are going to rebuild that military and that military is going to find the terrorists and destroy them. and if we capture any of these terrorists alive, they're not going to have the right to remain silent. and they're not going to go to a courtroom in manhattan. they're going to go to guantanamo bay, cuba and we will find out everything they know and we'll do so legally.\n\n(applause) tapper: senator cruz, you've talked about changing the rules of engagement in battle against isis. would that include targeting the families of suspected terrorists?\n\ncruz: no, of course not. we've never targeted innocent civilians and we're not going to start now. but listen, jake, i understand. people are scared and for seven years, we've faced terrorist attacks and president obama lectures americans on islamophobia. that is maddening.\n\nbut the answer is not simply to yell, china bad, muslims bad. you've got to understand the nature of the threats we're facing and how you deal with them. and yes, it is true there are millions of radical islamic terrorists who seek to kill us. we need a president, commander in chief focused on fighting them.\n\ncruz: and i'll tell you, frankly one concern i have with donald is that although his language is quite incendiary, when you look at his substantive policies on iran, he has said he would not rip up this iranian nuclear deal. i think that's a mistake.\n\nthe ayatollah khomeini wants nuclear weapons to murder us. i'll give you another example, dealing with islamic radical terrorism. on israel, donald has said he wants to be neutral between israel and the palestinians.\n\nas president, i will not be neutral. and let me say this week, a texan, taylor force. he was an eagle scout, he was a west point graduate, he was an army veteran. he was murdered by a palestinian terrorist this week in israel, and i don't think we need a commander in chief…\n\n(bell rings)\n\n… who is neutral between the palestinian terrorists and one of our strongest allies in the world, the nation of israel.\n\n(applause)\n\nhewitt: thank you senator cruz.\n\nmr. trump. we're going to come to you in a second, but wait. i want to go to hugh hewitt, who has questions on this exact line of subject.\n\nhewitt: mr. trump, i want to follow-up on the quote that senator cruz used. you said you would want to be, quote, sort of a neutral guy. he did mention taylor force. he was a west point graduate, he was a war hero. he was a vanderbilt graduate student.\n\nhe was killed in a palestinian terror attack near tel aviv, many others were killed. and the israeli government says the palestinian authority is inciting this. do you still want to stay neutral when the palestinian authority is inciting these attacks.\n\ntrump: first of all, there's nobody on this stage that's more pro israel than i am. ok. there's nobody.\n\n(applause)\n\ntrump: i am pro-israel.\n\n(booing)\n\ntrump: i was the grand marshall, not so long ago, of the israeli day parade down 5th avenue. i've made massive contributions to israel. i have a lot of - i have tremendous love for israel. i happen to have a son-in-law and a daughter that are jewish, ok? and two grandchildren that are jewish.\n\n(applause)\n\ntrump: but i will tell you, i think if we're going to ever negotiate a peace settlement, which every israeli wants, and i've spoken to the toughest and the sharpest, they all want peace, i think it would be much more helpful is - i'm a negotiator. if i go in, i'll say i'm pro-israel and i've told that to everybody and anybody that would listen.\n\nbut i would like to at least have the other side think i'm somewhat neutral as to them, so that we can maybe get a deal done. maybe we can get a deal. i think it's probably the toughest negotiation of all time. but maybe we can get a deal done.\n\nhewitt: senator trump…\n\n(crosstalk)\n\ntrump: and, by the way, just so you understand, as far as iran, i would have never made that deal. i think it's maybe the world deal i've ever seen. i think it's the worst deal i've ever seen negotiated. i will be so tough on them and ultimately that deal will be broken unless they behave better than they've ever behaved in their lives, which is probably unlikely. that deal will be broken.\n\nhewitt: thank you mr. trump. senator cruz and senator rubio.\n\ncruz: you know, we need a president who understands the national security interests of this country. the reason we are friends and allies with israel is they are a liberal democratic country that share our values, they're our strongest ally in the region.\n\nwe get billions in intelligence resources, billions in military resources. and the palestinian authority that donald, along with hillary clinton and barack obama say they want to treat neutrally, the same as israel. the palestinian authority is in a unity government with hamas, a terrorist organization.\n\nthey pay the families of these terrorists who murder people. and this is exactly the moral relativism barack obama has. and the answer is not scream, all muslims bad.\n\nlet me give you an example of a muslim for example, we ought to be standing with, president el-sisi of egypt, a president of a muslim country who is targeting radical…\n\n(bell rings)\n\n… islamic terrorist. hewitt: senator rubio.\n\ncruz: he's hunting them down and stomping them.\n\nhewitt: thank you.\n\ncruz: our focus needs to be on keeping this country safe.\n\nhewitt: i want to go back to the israeli government's assertion that the palestinian authority is inciting the convulsion of violence. do you agree.\n\nrubio: well, that's undeniable. first of all, they've said, they've encouraged people to do so. and you've seen the speeches of the palestinian authority president how glorious this is that they're doing these sorts of things.\n\nbut let me go back for a moment. the policy donald has outlined, i don't know if he realizes, is an anti-israeli policy. maybe that's not your intent but here's why it is an anti-israeli policy. there is no peace deal possible with the palestinians at this moment. there just isn't.\n\n(applause)\n\nrubio: because there's no one to negotiate with. the palestinian authority is not interested in a serious deal and they are now in union with hamas, an organization whose specific purpose is the destruction of the jewish state. every time that israel has turned over territory of any kind, be is gaza, or now in judea and sumaira, it is used as a launching pad to attack israel. and that's what will happen again.\n\nthese groups are not interested in a deal with israel. what they are interested in is ultimately removing the jewish state and occupying its entire territory.\n\n(bell rings)\n\nso maybe in 30 years the conditions will exist, but they do not exist now.\n\nhewitt: mr. trump, and then i'll come to you senator kasich.\n\nrubio: and to have a president forcing the israelis to the table is harmful to the israeli and emboldens israel's enemies.\n\nhewitt: thank you senator.\n\n(applause)\n\nmr. trump a response and then we'll go to governor kasich.\n\ntrump: if i become president of the united states, one of the things that will be an absolute priority is number one, protection of israel, but also seeing if a deal can be made, the toughest deal, the toughest negotiation there probably is of any kind no matter where you look, no matter how hard you look.\n\nbut i would like to give it a shot. very, very pro-israel, nobody more pro-israel. but i would love to give it a shot. and i have to tell you this, hugh. i have friend, israelis, non-israelis, people from new york city that happen to be jewish and love israel, and some are very tough people, every single one of them, they know it's tough, but every single one of them wants to see if we could ever have peace in israel.\n\nand some believe it's possible. it may not be, in which case we'll find out. but it would be a priority if i become president to see what i could do.\n\nhewitt: governor kasich, do you agree the israeli government that the palestinian authority is inciting this violence?\n\nkasich: well, there's no question. they were saying that the israelis intended to go to the dome of the rock. and i mean, when you think about this, thank goodness we work with israelis to give them the iron dome where they can protect themselves against all the missiles that were flying in. could you imagine living in like miami here and having people shooting missiles in?\n\nsecondly, there was just an article the other day, hugh, that i know you're familiar with the israelis are learning to train underground in combat because the palestinians now, hamas in particular, is digging these tunnels trying to get under israel. they're coming at them from above, they're trying to come at them under the ground.\n\nand i just have to tell you this, i don't believe there is any long-term permanent peace solution. and i think pursuing that is the wrong thing to do. i believe that every day that we can stability in that region by supporting the israelis and making sure they have the weapons and the security that they need with our 100 percent backing is the way to proceed in the middle east in regard to israel.\n\n(applause)\n\nhewitt: thank you, governor. senator cruz, i want to stay in the region. just this week the head of u.s. central command, general general lloyd austin, essentially said it's going to take a lot more troops on the ground to fix - to end the isis threat in syria and iraq.\n\nfrom the beginning of this campaign, you have said you will follow the judgment of military commanders in the pentagon. so here's the commander saying we need a lot more troops on the ground. will you follow that advice and inject americans again into what is in essence is metastasizing sunni-shia civil war?\n\ncruz: we need to do whatever is necessary to utterly defeat isis. and that's needs to be driven not by politicians but by military expertise and judgment. right now we're not using a fraction of the tools that we have. we're not using our overwhelming air power. we're not arming the kurds. those need to be the first steps. and then we need to put whatever ground power is needed to carry it out.\n\nbut, you know, a question that actually jake asked, and i'm glad to come back to it now, is rules of engagement. we have right now our troops engaged in combat but president obama has rules of engagement that are so strict that their arms are tied behind their back.\n\nthey're not able to fight. they're not able to defend themselves. they're not able to kill the enemy. and i have got to tell you, hugh, i think that is wrong. it is immoral. and i give my word to every soldier, sailor, and airman, and marine, and every wife and husband, every son and daughter, every mother and father, that will end in january 2017.\n\n(applause)\n\nhewitt: governor kasich, if it takes 20,000 or 30,000, if the pentagon says that's what needs to be done, will you follow their advice?\n\nkasich: hugh, i've said all along and laid out my foreign policy, i'm going to remind everybody that 55 percent of the foreign policy experts in this country said i was the best to be commander-in- chief. i spent 18 years on the defense committee, armed services, and then i was in the pentagon with donald rumsfeld after 9/11, in and out for a couple of years.\n\nwe absolutely have to win this with a coalition. arabs have to be with us. the europeans have to understand that this threat is closer to them than even is closer - is as close as it is to us. and in addition to that, you have to be in the air and you have to be on the ground.\n\nand you bring all the force you need. it has got to be shock and awe in the military-speak. then once it gets done, and we will wipe them out, once it gets done, it settles down, we come home and let the regional powers redraw the map if that's what it takes.\n\nhewitt: mr. trump, more troops? trump: we really have no choice. we have to knock out isis. we have to knock the hell out of them. we have to get rid of it. and then come back and rebuild our country, which is falling apart. we have no choice.\n\nhewitt: how many…\n\n(crosstalk)\n\ntrump: i would listen to the generals, but i'm hearing numbers of 20,000 to 30,000. we have to knock them out fast. look, we're not allowed to fight. we can't fight. we're not knocking out the oil because they don't want to create environmental pollution up in the air.\n\ni mean, these are things that nobody even believes. they think we're kidding. they didn't want to knock out the oil because of what it's going to do to the carbon footprint. we don't fight like we used to fight. we used to fight to win. now we fight for no reason whatsoever. we don't even know what we're doing.\n\n(applause)\n\ntrump: so, the answer is we have to knock them out. we have to knock them out fast. and we have to get back home. and we have to rebuild our country which is falling apart.\n\ntapper: thank you, mr. trump.\n\nlet's turn from current conflicts to those who have served in conflicts.\n\nsenator rubio, according to a v.a. study, of the 22 veterans who commit suicide every day, 17 of them have no connection to the v.a. the v.a. believes that this lack of connection is one of the reasons for this tragically high suicide rate.\n\nwhat specifically would you do as president to make sure that veterans in crisis are able to get the help they need?\n\nrubio: well, first let me say that one out of four calls to our office is about a veteran here in florida that's struggling with the v.a. my brother is a veteran. he's struggling with the v.a.\n\nthe other day, we heard this horrible story. it was a headline in usa today, and it said, calls to the v.a. suicide hotline went to voicemail. well, about a few days ago, we now found out that one of the gentlemen - one of the veterans who left a voicemail committed suicide. and they happened to call him back the day after he died.\n\npeople need to be held accountable for this. one of the things i'm proudest of is that in my time in the u.s. senate working with jeff miller here from florida in a bipartisan way, and i'll give him credit - bernie sanders was a part of this - we passed a v.a. accountability bill. and what it did is it created now a law that gives the v.a. secretary, because of the law i passed, it gives the v.a. secretary the power to fire people that aren't doing a good job.\n\nsenior executives should be held accountable if the v.a. outreach isn't working. the problem is no one's being held accountable. even after we passed that law, no one's been fired for no outreach. no one's been fired for calls going to the voicemail. no one's been disciplined. no one's been demoted.\n\nwhen i'm president of the united states, if you work at the v.a. and you are not doing a good job, you will be fired from your job at the v.a. (applause)\n\ntapper: governor kasich, the veterans affairs department is one of the biggest line items in the domestic budget. as part of its attempt to cut costs, the republican-controlled house of representatives just voted to try to reduce spending in the post-9/11 gi bill.\n\nshould veterans' benefits be part of attempts to reduce the deficit?\n\nkasich: i don't - i haven't seen the provisions of that bill, jake. my initial instincts are no. and let me just say about the v.a. when a veteran comes home, they ought to have access to healthcare wherever they want to go at any time, number one.\n\nnumber two, the veterans administration needs to be restructured. it needs to be downsized and spread out. it needs to be so responsive to the needs of the veterans.\n\nand secondly, the pentagon needs to share the information of returning veterans with the veterans' service operations in the states and with the job people in the states so that when a veteran comes home, they can be linked with a job.\n\nand when that happens, that means that every veteran will get work, because they're our golden employees. no veteran ought to be without healthcare; no veteran ought to be homeless; and no veteran ought to be unemployed in the united states of america.\n\ntapper: thank you, governor kasich.\n\n(applause)\n\nlet's turn to another issue of real importance here in florida. just over a week from now, president obama will visit cuba, the first time in 88 years that a sitting u.s. president will set foot in cuba.\n\ntwo of you on this stage have parents who were born in cuba and moved to the united states. let's go back to my colleague dana bash.\n\nbash: senator rubio, donald trump agrees with president obama in his decision to reengage diplomatically in cuba. the majority of americans seem to agree with that as well. so why are president obama, donald trump and the majority of americans wrong?\n\nrubio: well, i would love the relationship between cuba and the united states to change. but it will require cuba to change, at least its government. today, it has not. the fact of the matter is that after these changes were made - after these changes were made, there are now millions and hundreds of millions of dollars that will flow to the castro regime.\n\nit will now allow them to become set permanent and in stone. they will now be able to carry out a transition where the military continues to run the country there. they'll put a puppet figure forward as their new president. and nothing will change for the cuban people.\n\nthere has not been a single democratic opening; not a single change on the island in human rights. in fact, things are worse than they were before this opening. the only thing that's changed as a result of this opening is that now the cuban government has more sources of money from which to build out their repressive apparatus and maintain themselves there permanently.\n\nand we asked nothing in return. compare that to the changes that were required in burma. and by no means is burma a perfect country. but at least when there was a democratic opening to burma, they were required to make some democratic openings. when there was a diplomatic opening, it required democratic opening. and today, the former minority party is now the majority party in their legislative body.\n\nhe asked nothing in return and we are getting nothing in return. and cuba and its regime remains an anti-american communist dictatorship, helped north korea evade u.n. sanctions. it's harboring fugitives of american justice, including people stealing our medicare money and moving back to cuba, all in exchange for nothing.\n\n(applause)\n\nbash: mr. trump, you said the concept of opening cuba is fine. you said the concept of opening cuba is fine. why do you agree with president obama and disagree with what senator rubio just said?\n\ntrump: well, i don't really agree with president obama. i think i'm somewhere in the middle. what i want is i want a much better deal to be made because right now, cuba is making - as usual with our country, we don't make good deal. we don't have our right people negotiating, we have people that don't have a clue.\n\nas an example, i heard recently where the threat was made that they want reparations for years of abuse by the united states, and nobody's talking about it and they'll end up signing a deal and then we'll get sued for $400 billion or $1 trillion.\n\nall that stuff has to be agreed to now. we don't want to get sued after the deal is made. so i don't agree with president obama, i do agree something should be - should take place. after 50 years, it's enough time, folks. but we have to make a good deal and we have to get rid of all the litigation that's going to happen.\n\nthis was just a little story but it was a big story to me because i said oh, here we go, we make a deal, then get sued for a tremendous amount of money for reparations. so i want to do something, but it's got to be done intelligently. we have to make good deal.\n\nbash: senator rubio, i know you want to get in. but just to be clear, mr. trump, are you saying that if you were president, you would continue the diplomatic relations or would you reverse them?\n\ntrump: i would want to make a good deal, i would want to make a strong, solid, good deal because right now, everything is in cuba's favor. right now, everything, every single aspect of this deal is in cuba's favor. it the same way as the iran deal.\n\nwe never walked - we never - all we do is keep giving. we give and give and give.\n\nbash: but mr. trump, just to be clear, there is an embassy that you would have to decide whether it would be open or whether you would close it. which would it be? in havana.\n\ntrump: i would probably have the embassy closed until such time as a really good deal was made and struck by the united states. (applause)\n\nrubio: all right, first of all, the embassy is the former consulate. it's the same building. so it could just go back to being called a consulate. we don't have to close it that way. second of all, i don't know where cuba is going to use, but if they sue us in a court in miami, they're going to lose.\n\n(laughter and applause)\n\nthird, on the issue of a good deal, i know what the good deal. i'll tell you what the good deal now, it's already codified. here's a good deal - cuba has free elections, cuba stops putting people in jail for speaking out, cuba has freedom of the press, cuba kicks out the russians from lourdes (ph) and kicks out the chinese listening station in berupal (ph) cuba stops helping north korea evade u.n. sanctions, cuba takes all of those fugitives of america justice, including that cop killer from new jersey, and send her back to the united states and to jail where she belongs. and you know what? then we can have a relationship with cuba. that's a good deal.\n\n(applause)\n\nbash: thank you, senator rubio. senator cruz, if you become president, would you reverse course and once again break diplomatic relations with cuba?\n\ncruz: yes, i would. and you know, i think this exchange actually highlights a real choice for republican primary voters. when it comes to foreign policy, do you want to continue on the same basic trajectory as the last seven years of the obama foreign policy? when it comes to these deals, cuba and iran, they were negotiated by hillary clinton and john kerry.\n\nthere's a real difference between us. donald supported hillary clinton and john kerry. and what he said right now is that he agrees in principle with what they're doing. the only thing he thinks is that they should negotiate a little bit better deals, they should be more effective. i have a fundamental disagreement and i think most republicans and most americans do, that we shouldn't be allowing billions of dollars to go to nations that hate us to go to cuba, to go to iran and to let them use those billions of dollars to try to murder us.\n\n(applause)\n\ncuba: thank you senator cruz. mr. trump.\n\ntrump: well, if ted was listening, he would have heard me say something very similar. i said we would not do the deal unless it was going to be a very good deal for us. and i think i said it loud and i think i said it very clear. and i think after 50 years, and i have many friends, i own many properties in miami, many, many, and i have many people that know and they feel exactly the way i do, make a deal, it would be great, but it's got to be a great deal for the united states, not a bad deal for the united states. as far as iran is concerned, i would have never made that deal. that is one of the worst deals ever, ever made by this country. it is a disaster. so for ted to say i agree with this deal, i mean, it's a staple in my speeches that that may he worst single deal i've ever seen negotiated. so don't try to put it on me like it's wonderful, like i love it.\n\nbash: senator cruz, your response?\n\ncruz: well, look. i'll point out first of all it is a matter of public record that donald supported john kerry in 2004 over george w. bush, and he supported hillary clinton, gave her two checks in a presidential campaign in 2008. and indeed, once she was secretary of state, he described her as one of the greatest secretaries of state in industry.\n\ncruz: and, you know, the point on the iran deal, his answer to everything is if only if someone smarter were in government, things would be better. no. we don't just need smarter people in government. we need leaders that are protecting american interests.\n\n(applause)\n\ncruz: and when it comes to iran, donald has said he would leave the agreement in place and try to renegotiate it, giving the ayatollah khomeini over $100 billion. that reflects you do not understand the radical islam terrorist that is the ayatollah that wants to murder us.\n\nwe need a commander in chief that understands our enemies…\n\n(bell rings)\n\n… understands and doesn't give them billions of dollars to threaten our safety and security.\n\n(applause)\n\ntrump: i was against the giving of the money at all cost. i said don't negotiate at all until you get the prisoners back. if the prisoners don't come back early - three years ago. one of the longest negotiations i've ever seen, by the way. if they don't come back early, i was saying don't negotiate. they come back early.\n\nwhat you do is you take it back and you say, either give us the prisoners or we double up the sanctions. what we should have done is doubled up the sanctions and made a much better deal. cause that deal is a disaster.\n\nted, the money is largely gone because of incompetent and very, very poor negotiators. but that money, the $150 billion, is largely gone and already spent everywhere but the united states.\n\nbash: thank you mr. trump. let's refocus this back on cuba.\n\ngovernor kasich, a pair of entrepreneurs from alabama and north carolina have just received approval to build the first u.s. factory in cuba, making tractor for small farms. this is a direct result of president obama's policy in cuba that we've been talking about. if you were elected would you encourage more u.s. companies to do business like that in cuba?\n\nkasich: no, i wouldn't. listen, i think the problem with the administration, if you talk to our friends around the world, they say what is america doing? you know, you don't support us, we can't figure out where you are.\n\nyou won't arm the freedom fighters in ukraine, we let the russians trump up some excuse in the business of russian-speaking people. you had a red line in syria. you walked away from it. you refused to fund the syrian rebels, you undercut egypt and we ended up with the muslim brotherhood for awhile.\n\nand then we turn our back on netanyahu when he comes to congress to talk about his concerns of the iranian deal. look, i know in human nature sometimes there's a sense that you make better with your enemies than you do with your friends. and you know what happens when you do that? you make a terrible mistake.\n\nyou need to support your friends, you need to hold your enemies out here…\n\n(applause)\n\nkasich: … and you need to negotiate tough deals. the fact is, they need to understand who we are. the chinese understand. they don't own the south china sea. they have to stop hacking everything we have in this country or we'll take out their systems. we will arm the ukrainians so they have lethal defensive aid.\n\nwe will destroy isis and mr. putin, you better understand, you're either with us or you're against us. we're not rattling a sword. you're not our enemy but we're not going to put up with this nonsense any longer.\n\nand a strong america is what the entire world is begging for. where has america gone is what many of our allies say around the world.\n\n(bell rings)\n\nwhen i'm president, they're going to know exactly where we are because we're coming back.\n\ntapper: thank you governor. thank you governor. while we're discussing the issues of importance to floridians, i reached out to the republican mayor of miami, tomas regalado, to find out what he wanted to hear from you this evening.\n\nmayor regalado told me, quote, climate change means rising ocean levels, which in south florida means flooding downtown and in our neighborhoods. it's an every day reality in our city. will you, as president acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change and as president, will you pledge to do something about it? unquote.\n\nsenator rubio, the miami mayor has endorsed you. will you honor his request for a pledge and acknowledge the reality of the scientific consensus of climate change and pledge to do something about it?\n\nrubio: well, sure if the climate is changing and one of the reasons is because the climate has always been changing.\n\n(applause)\n\nrubio: there's never been a time when the climate has not changed. i think the fundamental question for a policy maker is, is the climate changing because of something we are doing and if so, is there a law you can pass to fix it?\n\nso on the issue of flooding in miami, it's caused by two things. number one, south florida is largely built on land that was once a swamp. and number two, because if there is higher sea levels or whatever it may be happening, we do need to deal with that through mitigation.\n\nand i have long supported mitigation efforts. but as far as a law that we can pass in washington to change the weather, there's no such thing.\n\n(applause)\n\nrubio: on the contrary, there is laws they want us to pass. there are laws they want to us pass that would be devastating for our economy or these programs like what the president has put in with the clean power act or all these sorts of things that he's forcing down our throats on the war on coal.\n\nlet me tell you who is going to pay the price of that? americans are going to pay the price of that. the cost of doing that is going to be rammed down the throats of the american consumer, the single parent, the working families who are going to see increases in the cost of living.\n\nrubio: the businesses who are going to leave america because it's more expensive to do business here than anywhere else.\n\nand you know what passing those laws would have - what impact it would have on the environment? zero, because china is still going to be polluting and india is still going to be polluting at historic levels. so, i am in favor of a clean environment. my children live in south florida. my family is being raised here. i want this to be a safe and clean place, but these laws some people are asking us to pass will do nothing for the environment and they will hurt and devastate our economy.\n\ntapper: so just to clarify, senator rubio, mayor regalado when he talks about the reality of the scientific consensus about climate change, the republican mayor of miami, he's saying the scientific consensus is that man does contribute to climate change.\n\nwhen you talk to him, because he is the mayor of miami and he has endorsed you, do you tell him that he's wrong?\n\nrubio: i would say to him that there is no law that they want us to pass that would have any impact on that. if we pass - if you took the gift list of all of these groups that are asking us to pass these laws and did every single one of them, there would be no change in our environment. sea level would still rise. all these other things that are happening would continue to go on for a lot of different reasons.\n\none, because america is not a planet. it's a country. and number two, because these other countries like india and china are more than making up in carbon emissions for whatever we could possibly cut. here's what he will immediately - and mayor regalado is a great mayor and a good friend - but here's what he's going to immediately going to start hearing from.\n\nhe will immediately start hearing from families in south florida who are barely making it by, and now their electric bill went up $20 or $30 a month because we just made it more expensive to generate power. that cost will be passed on to working families. i am not going to destroy the u.s. economy for a law that will do nothing for our environent.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: governor kasich, what would you say to the mayor of miami? kasich: well, i - i do believe we contribute to climate change, but i don't think it has to be a, you know, either you're for some environmental stringent rules or, you know, you're not going to have any jobs. the fact is, you can have both.\n\nin our state, we've reduced emissions by 30 percent. but let me tell you also what we're trying to do. we want all the sources of energy. we want to dig coal, but we want to clean it when we burn it. we believe in natural gas. we believe in nuclear power.\n\nand you know what else i believe in? i happen to believe in solar energy, wind energy, efficiency, renewables matter.\n\nnow, it doesn't mean because you pursue a policy of being sensitive to the environment, because we don't know how much humans actually contribute. but it is important we develop renewables. battery technology can unleash an entirely different world.\n\nso the fact is that you can have a strong environmental policy at the same time that you have strong economic growth and they are not inconsistent with one another.\n\ntapper: thank you, governor.\n\nsenator cruz, i want to talk a little bit right now about how you gentlemen see the world. senator cruz, colin powell this week said that the nasty tone of this presidential election is hurting the image of the u.s. abroad. he said, quote, foreigners of the world looking at this are distressed. does it matter to you what the rest of the world thinks of the united states?\n\ncruz: of course it does. and we've seen for seven years a president that has made the presidency and has made, sadly, his administration a laughing stock in the world. this administration started with president obama sending back the bust of winston churchill to the united kingdom within the opening weeks.\n\nthen he proceeded to go on a worldwide apology tour apologizing for the united states of america. our friends and allies quickly learned america could not be counted on. i'll tell you, when i travel abroad, when i meet with heads of states and defense ministers and foreign ministers, they say over and over again, it is hard to be friends with america; we can't count on america; america doesn't stand with us.\n\nand that is a disgrace. but the good news is, jake, we've seen this before. we have seen a weak democratic president undermine the military, weaken our readiness, weaken our respect in the world with jimmy carter. and in january 1981, ronald reagan came into office and that can change overnight.\n\nit's worth remembering iran released our hostages the day ronald reagan was sworn into office.\n\n(applause) and america needs a president who stands with our friends and allies, as i will do, and who stands up and demonstrates strengths to our enemies. that's why on day one, i will rip to shreds this catastrophic iranian nuclear deal because the ayatollah khamenei must never be allowed to acquire nuclear weapons.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: thank you, senator.\n\ntapper: mr. trump, some of your republican critics have expressed concern about comments you have made praising authoritarian dictators. you have said positive things about putin as a leader and about china's massacre of pro-democracy protesters at tiananmen square, you've said: when the students poured into tiananmen square, the chinese government almost blew it, then they were vicious, they were horrible, but they put it down with strength. that shows you the power of strength.\n\nhow do you respond…\n\ntrump: that doesn't mean i was endorsing that. i was not endorsing it. i said that is a strong, powerful government that put it down with strength. and then they kept down the riot. it was a horrible thing. it doesn't mean at all i was endorsing it.\n\nas far as putin is concerned, i think putin has been a very strong leader for russia. i think he has been a lot stronger than our leader, that i can tell you. i mean, for russia, that doesn't mean i'm endorsing putin.\n\ntapper: but the word strong obviously is a compliment…\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: … and many people would look at what the chinese leaders have done and what putin is doing as atrocities.\n\ntrump: i used to think merkel was a great leader until she did what she did to germany. germany is a disaster right now. so i used to think that.\n\n(applause)\n\ntrump: and strong doesn't mean good. putin is a strong leader, absolutely. i could name many strong leaders. i could name very many very weak leaders. but he is a strong leader. now i don't say that in a good way or a bad way. i say it as a fact.\n\ntapper: governor kasich, when you were a member of congress, you were outspoken about the tiananmen square massacre. what do you think?\n\nkasich: i think that the chinese government butchered those kids. and when that guy stood in front - that young man stood in front of that tank, we ought to build a statue of him over here when he faced down the chinese government.\n\n(applause)\n\nkasich: now i will tell you, i don't believe that we need to make china an enemy. they are a competitor. but i want to go back to three things they should do. we should have the heat on them to work in north korea to get rid of that guy and the things that he's doing, number one.\n\nnumber two, they need to realize they don't own the south china sea. and i will compliment the administration for sending a carrier battle group into the south china sea. and thirdly, when it comes to the issue of cyber attacks, we're going to have to beef up the cyber command.\n\nand they need to understand that if you attack us we will defend ourselves, everything, including our grid. but if you do it, we have the capability to take out your systems. the president has not given the cyber command that authority. i will.\n\nand when it comes to trade, i will tell you this, they can't manipulate their currency. that will not be anything that i would allow them to get away with. and if i saw them doing it, i would take immediate action and make sure that the american worker is protected.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: thank you, governor kasich.\n\nwe're going to take another quick break. when we come back, we'll have more of the republican presidential debate from miami, florida, right after this. stay with us.\n\n(commercial break)\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: welcome back to the cnn republican presidential debate in miami, florida.\n\nmr. trump, i want to start with you in this block. earlier today, a man was arrested and charged with assault after sucker- punching a protester in the face at your rally in fayettville, north carolina. this is hardly the first incident of violence breaking out at one of your rallies.\n\ntoday, hillary clinton, your potential general election opponent, clearly indicated she sees this as an issue for the campaign. she said, quote, this kind of behavior is repugnant. we set the tone for our campaigns, we should encourage respect, not violence. do you believe that you've done anything to create a tone where this kind of violence would be encouraged?\n\ntrump: i hope not. i truly hope not. i will say this. we have 25 (thousand), 30,000 people - you've seen it yourself. people come with tremendous passion and love for the country, and when they see protest - in some cases - you know, you're mentioning one case, which i haven't seen, i heard about it, which i don't like. but when they see what's going on in this country, they have anger that's unbelievable. they have anger.\n\nthey love this country. they don't like seeing bad trade deals, they don't like seeing higher taxes, they don't like seeing a loss of their jobs where our jobs have just been devastated. and i know - i mean, i see it. there is some anger. there's also great love for the country. it's a beautiful thing in many respects. but i certainly do not condone that at all, jake.\n\ntapper: some of your critics point to quotes you've made at these debates - at these rallies including february 23rd, i'd like to punch him in the face, referring to a protesters. february 27th, in the good ol' days, they'd have ripped him out of that seat so fast. february 1st, knock the crap out of him, would, you? seriously, ok, just knock the hell. i promise you i will pay for the legal fees, i promise, i promise.\n\n(applause)\n\ntrump: we have some protesters who are bad dudes, they have done bad things. they are swinging, they are really dangerous and they get in there and they start hitting people. and we had a couple big, strong, powerful guys doing damage to people, not only the loudness, the loudness i don't mind. but doing serious damage. and if they've got to be taken out, to be honest, i mean, we have to run something.\n\nand it's not me. it's usually the municipal government, the police because i don't have guards all over these stadiums. i mean, we fill up stadiums. it's usually the police - and, by the way, speaking of the police, we should pay our respects to the police because they are taking tremendous abuse in this country and they do a phenomenal job.\n\n(applause)\n\nso we should pay - we should truly give our police. they're incredible people, we should give them a great deal more respect than they receive.\n\n(applause)\n\ntapper: senator cruz, are you concerned at all that these kind of scenes potentially hurt the republican p

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nhere we go again.\n\npresident donald trump is calling on republicans to be the party of health care. but that's not going to be so easy to do since it requires them to have a plan.\n\nthe president, i don't think, really has any idea what he's really saying there. it's more of a promotional and marketing impulse on his part, said james capretta, a health care expert at the american enterprise institute, a free market think tank. it leaves republicans open to a little bit more attacks and ridicule by the democrats that they don't have a plan.\n\nwhile the party hasn't coalesced behind a health care plan, there are policies that republicans have long supported. yet some republican think tanks, particularly the influential heritage foundation, are looking to drum up interest on capitol hill in their ideas to overhaul the health care system.\n\nsome are still pushing a version of a 2017 bill from sens. lindsay graham of south carolina and bill cassidy of louisiana to replace the affordable care act.\n\nthe senators unveiled the legislation just before the gop repeal effort collapsed for good in 2017. it would turn the federal funding for medicaid expansion and obamacare's subsidies for premiums and out-of-pocket costs into a block grant program. states would receive a lump sum of money and would have a lot of leeway over how to spend it.\n\nthe bill would also let states alter several key obamacare protections for those with pre-existing conditions. while it would still require insurers to provide coverage to everyone, states could adjust other rules, including the mandate that insurers offer comprehensive policies.\n\nalso, states could change the pricing rules so that younger, healthier people could see their premiums go down, but those who need care and older americans in their 50s and 60s could find themselves unable to afford policies.\n\nstates could also revamp many of obamacare's financial protections, including limiting how much people must pay out of pocket each year and how much of the tab insurers must pick up.\n\nwhile trump is enamored of the plan and incorporated it into his budget, it's not likely to get far in the senate. asked whether congress could come together on a replacement plan, graham told cnn's kate bolduan wednesday that he doubts it.\n\nrevamping the nation's health care system isn't exactly the gop's strong suit. the party failed spectacularly to repeal and replace the affordable care act in 2017 when it dominated washington. the task will be only harder now that democrats control the house and are pushing plans to strengthen obamacare and protections for those with pre-existing conditions, likely a sharp contrast to whatever proposals or talking points republicans roll out.\n\nkey gop senators also haven't expressed much appetite for going into full-scale battle again over the affordable care act. asked about health care, sen. chuck grassley of iowa on wednesday pointed to his finance committee's work on lowering prescription drug prices. he is collaborating on that effort with ranking member ron wyden of oregon.\n\nmost of it's going to be very, very bipartisan, grassley said of his committee's plans on health care.\n\nsen. roy blunt of missouri said he will let the trump administration take the lead.\n\nall i'm going to say about that for a while is that i'm eager to see what the administration proposes, he said wednesday.\n\nthe trump administration, however, is not waiting for congress to change the health care system, particularly obamacare. its strategy centers on letting states overhaul their health programs. for instance, it has allowed states to implement work requirements in its medicaid program and is now considering requests to let states expand coverage only to those below the poverty line.\n\nofficials have also made it easier to buy short-term plans that have lower premiums but don't have to adhere to all of obamacare's rules. and they are looking to let states alter their affordable care act programs, including allowing them to funnel subsidies to people buying coverage outside the exchanges.\n\nmeanwhile, a coalition of conservative groups and several gop state representatives last year rolled out the health care choices proposal, which includes giving states more control and sending them a fixed amount of money, relaxing federal mandates and strengthening the private insurance market.\n\nit also calls for bolstering health savings accounts, which allow people to set aside funds for future health care needs. republicans have long pushed hsas, but critics say only higher-income americans can afford to use them.\n\nthe republican answer needs to address the things americans are telling us that we want, said marie fishpaw, director of domestic policy studies at heritage, which is part of the coalition. they want to make sure that they and the people they love don't lose access to coverage or care if they get sick. they want lower costs and they want better choices.\n\ncnn's haley byrd and ted barrett contributed to this report.
(cnn) —\n\nvermont sen. bernie sanders plans to introduce his new medicare for all bill wednesday morning, a move that will again push health care policy to the front burner of the democratic presidential primary.\n\nthe new legislation's big-name co-sponsors include four of sanders' fellow 2020 democratic contenders – sens. kamala harris, elizabeth warren, cory booker and kirsten gillibrand – all of whom also signed onto an earlier version sanders put out in 2017.\n\nby unveiling his proposal now, sanders is effectively doubling down on his signature policy idea and betting that his calls to eliminate private medical insurers will be a winning one with democratic voters, even as the party rallies around obamacare amid an escalating court battle instigated by republicans and backed by president donald trump.\n\nbut the move could light a match to a simmering debate within the democratic party, pitting sanders against other candidates, including some of the senate bill's co-sponsors, over the best path toward universal coverage. it is a fight sanders appears to welcome. during the early stages of the 2020 campaign, he has relentlessly attacked private insurers, arguing that their presence is a malign influence on the whole of american health care – a step, both rhetorically and on the policy front, that his opponents have so far refused to match.\n\nwarren, harris and booker have all signaled their willingness to consider compromise plans that allow private insurers a role to play in any new or revamped system. they're up against moderates like sen. amy klobuchar, who has said she is not in favor of medicare for all, and sen. michael bennet, who is planning to enter the race soon – neither of whom are expected to join their more liberal colleagues.\n\nthe new legislation will update sanders'$2 2017 bill, adding provisions to broaden its scope and potentially offer new details on sanders' plans to pay for a program that could virtually wipe out the private insurance industry. more than 150 million americans are currently covered by private insurance through their employers and tens of millions more through medicare advantage. millions more buy coverage via the affordable care act's exchanges.\n\nsanders, despite backing other less ambitious bills in the past, has ramped up his attacks on the industry, which he and many of his supporters view as greedy and the root of the problem medicare for all is designed to fix.\n\ntoday, we say to the private insurance companies – we say that whether you like it or not, the united states will join every other major country on earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right, sanders said at a rally in los angeles last month. the goal of health care is to provide quality care to all, not to have insurance companies make billions of dollars a year off our sickness.\n\na recent calculation by axios found that top health care executives brought in more than $1 billion combined last year – a fact that sanders, using similar numbers, has frequently cited on the stump as evidence of a dysfunctional system.\n\nunder medicare for all, everyone would be insured by a plan run by the federal government. it would cover all medically necessary care, including vision and dental. private insurers could remain in business, but could only provide benefits – such as elective surgery – not covered by the federal plan.\n\nthe main sticking point: the cost, which would be largely borne by taxpayers. estimates of the 2017 plan run as high as $32 trillion over 10 years. sanders' team argues that many people would still come out ahead because they wouldn't have to pay premiums, deductibles or co-pays.\n\nthe trump administration's decision in march to back a lawsuit that would strike down obamacare triggered a unified round of backlash from democrats, but it also highlighted the party's internal divisions, with moderates preferring to shore up the landmark health reform law and reverse many of the steps trump and congressional republicans have taken to undermine it.\n\nbut sanders has long held that simply patching obamacare or creating a buy-in to public programs would not solve the underlying problems.\n\nas long as you have private insurance companies as a part of that equation, you're going to have a system that is not purely interested in making people healthy and doing it in the most cost-effective way possible, a sanders aide told cnn after the trump administration announced its new position, suggesting that the renewed public focus on the issue could be a boon to sanders' campaign.\n\ni don't know what it says about other candidates, the aide said, but i think that it plays to his strengths as a candidate because he has a very clear message about health care and about the need to guarantee health care to every american as a right, not a privilege.\n\nsupport for sanders' bill, which won 16 co-sponsors in 2017 after attracting none only a few years earlier, was framed by many on the left as a signal of the party's move left on healthcare and, in the context of a primary fight many have spent two years gaming out, his lead role in driving the debate. in speeches during the early phase of this second presidential campaign, sanders has frequently reminded supporters that single-payer health care, an idea deemed too radical by the political establishment, has moved to the mainstream in the wake of his 2016 campaign.\n\ndemocratic candidates in 2020, like warren, booker and harris – among many others – have almost uniformly endorsed a broad expansion of government-run health insurance. but they are less inclined to package it with a call to topple the private sector insurers.\n\nasked at a cnn town hall last month if there could be a role to play for those companies going forward, warren didn't hesitate.\n\nthere could, she told cnn's jake tapper. or there could be a temporary role. even bernie's plan has a runway before it gets there, because it's – look, it's a big and complex system, and we've got to make sure that we land this in a way that doesn't do any harm. everybody has got to stay covered. it's critical.\n\nbooker, too, has been clear that private insurers would likely have a place even if democrats can pass big-ticket health care expansion.\n\neven countries that have vast access to publicly offered health care still have private health care, he said soon after announcing his candidacy.\n\nharris at a cnn town hall in january rattled off the complications that await many patients, including those with coverage, and said was ready to eliminate all of that. but she has since offered a more nuanced position, in support of medicare for all but with a continued openness to more incremental reforms and expansions.

arrogance without flamboyance.\n\nkushner chastised governors, with citizens literally gasping for air, for asking the federal government to help find life-saving ventilators. don't ask us for things when you don't know what you have in your own state. just because you're scared, you ask your medical professionals and they don't know, he reprimanded.\n\nat one point, he suggested that the federal stockpile of emergency medical supplies is not meant for the states, it's supposed to be our stockpile, he said. it's unclear who he meant by our.\n\nit is a well-documented fact that trump populated countless government positions with people utterly unqualified for their jobs. it comes as no surprise, then, that the rollout of emergency programs is proving less than impressive. millions of americans have already lost their jobs just a few weeks into the pandemic, so congress moved fast to enact trillions of dollars in relief legislation.\n\nmany government professionals are doing their best in an unprecedented emergency, but the early days of the rescue plan are not encouraging. suddenly-unemployed restaurant workers with families to feed may not get the promised $1,200 check for months. despite vows to get money in people's pockets within two weeks, it looks like it could take up to 20 weeks -- that's about four months -- to mail out all the checks.\n\nsmall businesses wondering if help will arrive in time to avert bankruptcy saw hope when treasury secretary steven mnuchin said on thursday that emergency loans would be available starting the next day. but just as he spoke, banks said they still need guidance from the small business administration before they can disburse funds.\n\nthe programs are enormous. perhaps the problems can be solved soon.\n\nbut there's no excuse for the incompetence and delays during this coronavirus crisis that have come as a direct result of trump & co.s' disdain for government.\n\nthe inescapable reality is that some challenges are so daunting that only the government can mount an effective response; some so cataclysmic than only the federal government has the muscle to do it.\n\ngabriel sherman, in vanity fair, wrote that it was reportedly kushner who told trump that, i'm doing my own projections...new york doesn't need all the ventilators, according to a person present at a recent white house meeting on the issue. cuomo explained, during a cnn town hall on the coronavirus: it's very simple: a person comes into the icu unit. they need the ventilator, or they die. the help may be coming, but not without delay.\n\nif the federal government were in good hands, it would have taken charge of the crisis much earlier. trump wouldn't have resisted urgent calls to enact the defense production act weeks ago, when the chamber of commerce persuaded him not to use his power to command production of ventilators\n\nnow states, watching the tidal wave of cases surge in their direction, are scrambling to secure the necessary supplies. incredibly, they are competing against each other , and now competing against the federal emergency management agency -- fema.\n\non cnn thursday, cuomo made a suggestion so practical, so logical, it's hard to believe it has not been put in place. instead of everyone simultaneously struggling to acquire the same products -- even from china, no less -- why not have a rolling deployment of supplies, distributed where they are needed, as the pandemic crests in different states at different times.\n\nimagine a pro-active, efficient, transparent and trustworthy administration, coordinating the purchase, production and distributing of ventilators and protective equipment to the places where they are needed, and arranging transportation of surplus from one state to another, as the need emerges.\n\nthe good government that we wish we had would have also ensured that everyone has health insurance. incredibly, trump rejected a proposal thursday to reopen obamacare enrollment so that uninsured americans could get coverage amid projections that millions could become ill. even health insurance companies were pushing for this, but trump said no.\n\nthe white house says it's exploring other options, but it's unclear what those might be. with millions losing their jobs, and most people's insurance linked to employment, the number of uninsured could soar at the worst possible time.\n\nwith a more competent administration, the navy hospital ships deployed with so much fanfare would not be floating mostly empty, as patients mass in overflowing hospitals. a tangle of military protocols and bureaucratic hurdles has prevented the comfort from accepting many patients at all, reported the new york times.\n\nfollow cnn opinion join us on twitter and facebook\n\nwithout a strong, big government, even paragons of capitalism, the country's iconic corporations, could disappear. thanks to a stimulus, taxpayers are saving them. the government should be saving the taxpayers, their livelihoods, their lives.\n\nbut this government doesn't believe much in government. early on it had promised to deconstruct the sinister-sounding administrative state. it's become painfully apparent how much we need experienced administrators.\n\nto paraphrase a figure from another crisis, you go to a pandemic with the government you have. we can only hope this administration will get better fast, and then we should try to have a better government before the next crisis.

(note how starr seemed eager to disclose such materials, while barr already seems to be finding reasons to suppress them. i wonder why.)\n\nnadler also plans to authorize a house subpoena to obtain mueller's full report, without any redactions. if the department of justice resists, we could end up in a legal battle pitting the legislative branch and its core oversight function against the executive branch.\n\nin the interest of transparency and public confidence in the department of justice, barr should put away his redaction pen and disclose as much of muller's report as possible. anything less will raise one big question: what is barr trying to hide?\n\nnow, your questions:\n\nray (california): doesn't mueller have some unanswered questions? for example, the supreme court upheld a mystery subpoena to a foreign company. what happens to that?\n\nmueller leaves behind important, unresolved cases and investigations. michael flynn still awaits sentencing, and rick gates continues to cooperate with prosecutors on several ongoing investigations. roger stone will stand trial in november, during which we should learn which senior trump campaign officials contacted stone to inquire about future releases of hacked emails by wikileaks.\n\nthen there's the subpoena that mueller served on an unknown foreign-owned company, which challenged the subpoena's legality. the courts upheld the subpoena, and the supreme court declined to take up the case, requiring the mystery company to comply. mueller also has prevailed thus far in a legal fight over a subpoena on stone associate andrew miller.\n\nall of these open matters – and likely more that are not yet publicly known – will go to us attorney's offices for completion. barr stated to congress that he is in the process of redacting from mueller's report material that could affect other ongoing matters, including those that the special counsel has referred to other department offices.\n\nindeed, a federal prosecutor in washington dc last week confirmed that mueller's grand jury was continuing robustly to investigate open matters. perhaps most worrisome for trump, mueller previously referred the michael cohen investigation to the southern district of new york, which now has a continuing probe into the trump organization and the inaugural committee.\n\nmueller's departure does not mean his investigations go away; it means they go to other prosecutors to finish.\n\nlisa (connecticut): could barr decide to remove parts of mueller's report based on executive privilege?\n\nexecutive privilege protects against disclosure of confidential communications between the president and his advisers. in his letter to congress, barr notes that trump has stated publicly that he intends to defer to me and, accordingly, there are no plans to submit the report to the white house for a privilege review.\n\nbarr's statement is ambiguous – perhaps intentionally. it could mean i will not submit the report to the white house and there will be no executive privilege redactions, or it could mean i will review the report myself and make redactions for executive privilege.\n\nbarr would pursue the latter scenario at the peril of his own credibility. executive privilege belongs to the president, and it is not for barr to assert it and do trump's political bidding for him.\n\nfurther, trump does not even appear to have a winning executive privilege claim. as the supreme court held in its unanimous 1974 ruling in the richard nixon case, executive privilege protects national security secrets but is not a generalized shield against presidential liability or accountability.\n\nthe stakes are high because many of the communications to which executive privilege might apply – internal white house conversations about firing (or potential firing) of james comey or jeff sessions or mueller, for example – go to the heart of the obstruction of justice question. if barr redacts that evidence from the mueller report, he will zip out some of the report's most important passages.\n\nmichael (california): if a legal issue relating to mueller's report goes to the supreme court, do you believe chief justice john roberts will, as he seems to have done in the past, feel the weight of keeping the court above perceived political partisanship and side with the more liberal justices?\n\nthe judicial branch is the least political of our three branches of government. federal judges are appointed, not elected, and once confirmed, they have lifetime tenure.\n\nthat said, it would be naive to assume that federal judges function in a political vacuum. they come into the job with ideological viewpoints, which often are the subject of confirmation hearings. and public perception of a purely apolitical supreme court took a permanent hit when the court split 5-4, along straight ideological lines, in the bush v. gore decision, which ended the contested 2000 election.\n\nin late 2018, after president trump lashed out at obama judges on the federal appeals court that ruled against his travel ban, chief justice roberts took the extraordinary step of issuing a public statement rebuking the president: we do not have obama judges or trump judges, bush judges or clinton judges…\n\nchief justice roberts plainly understands the growing public concern about partisanship in the federal judiciary, and cares about remedying that perception. with the recent replacement of justice anthony kennedy with justice brett kavanaugh, chief justice roberts now sits between the conservative and liberal blocs of justices.\n\nwhile i do not believe roberts would depart from his deeply held judicial principles to avoid an appearance of partisanship, i also think roberts does not want to go down in history as the chief justice who presided over politicization of the court. remember, roberts was the unexpected swing vote upholding the affordable care act (obamacare), and he could deliver another surprise if an issue related to mueller's report comes before the court.\n\nharry (canada): if collusion wasn't the reason that some trump associates lied about meeting or having contacts with russians (and risked going to jail), then why were they lying?\n\nmueller convicted several trump associates for lying to law enforcement or congress about their contacts with russians: michael flynn, michael cohen, george papadopoulos (and perjury charges remain pending against roger stone).\n\nyes, people lie for a reason, and those reasons are almost always bad. the law recognizes this. at trials, judges instruct juries about consciousness of guilt. essentially, this is the commonsense notion that, where a person lies, the jury can – but does not have to – assume he lied because he knew he was guilty of the offense.\n\nbut those bad reasons are not necessarily criminal. sometimes people lie for political reasons or personal reasons – or for a combination of reasons. i suspect a complex combination of bad motives drove each of the now-convicted trump associates to lie about their contacts with russia: fear that the russian contacts might have been criminal, mixed with a desire to avoid the political repercussions (for themselves and the campaign) of those contacts. as with so many things, we will know more once we see mueller's report.\n\nnicholas (california): if a sitting president cannot be indicted under doj policy, can he be indicted when he leaves office? would the statute of limitations freeze while he is in office or is there a way to extend the statute of limitations?\n\nwhile doj policy counsels against indicting a sitting president, a president can be indicted once out of office. but every crime carries a statute of limitations – a time limit, starting from the day a person commits a crime, within which criminal charges must be brought.\n\nfor most federal crimes, the statute of limitations is five years. so if trump leaves office in january 2021, a five-year statute of limitations would prohibit criminal charges for any conduct occurring before january 2016; if he leaves office in january 2025, then the statute of limitations would bar charges on anything he did before january 2020.\n\nthere is, however, an important exception. in some instances, federal law permits tolling of the statute of limitations – essentially a pause on the countdown clock. tolling happens, for example, when a defendant is a fugitive or during the pendency of a request from the united states to a foreign country for evidence.\n\nwhile the issue has never been decided in court, i believe prosecutors would have a strong legal argument that the statute of limitations should be tolled while the president is in office. prosecutors might make the unusual argument that being president is, for legal purposes, the same as being a fugitive: in both cases, the subject cannot be charged and apprehended, through no fault of the prosecution. essentially, prosecutors might argue, the president – by virtue of his position – hides from the law, in plain sight.\n\nthree questions to watch:\n\nget our free weekly

washington (cnn) president donald trump delivered another rapid series of false and misleading claims on sunday night, this time at a fox news virtual town hall event at the lincoln memorial in washington, dc.\n\ntrump was dishonest both about matters pertaining to the coronavirus pandemic and about his usual array of other topics, from trade with china to his rally crowds. here is a preliminary list -- which doesn't even include all of the inaccuracies:\n\nprevious administrations and hiv/aids\n\nthe president kicked off a slew of false claims sunday night with one he's made several times before, aimed at a familiar target: the obama administration. trump accused the previous administration of doing nothing to address aids.\n\nhe said, we will be aids-free within 8 years. we started, 10 years. should've started in the previous administration. they did nothing. it started at my administration.\n\nfacts first: it's not even close to true that previous administrations did nothing to address hiv/aids in the us, experts say and budget data proves.\n\nrepublican president george w. bush is known for the initiatives his administration spearheaded to combat aids, especially in africa. and the obama administration spent more than $5.5 billion per year on the three primary domestic programs to combat hiv/aids, according to figures provided by the kaiser family foundation , which closely tracks health care spending. (that's in addition to billions in spending on international anti-hiv/aids initiatives.)\n\nobama also introduced a comprehensive national strategy on combating hiv/aids. and experts note that the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, helped people with hiv gain health insurance coverage.\n\nin 2019, trump issued a plan called ending the hiv epidemic: a plan for america, which aimed to reduce the number of new hiv infections in the us by 75% within five years and by at least 90% within 10 years. experts said that trump's plan builds on obama's 2010 national hiv/aids strategy and a 2015 update to that strategy.\n\nin fact, before issuing its own plan, the trump administration said , that it was being guided by the obama-era strategy: the domestic policies and programs of the federal government continue to be guided by the national hiv/aids strategy, and we are focused on working toward achieving the strategy goals for 2020.\n\nyou can read a longer fact check here\n\ntravel restrictions\n\nasked about what his administration did early on to respond to coronavirus, trump praised his decision to impose restrictions on travel from china.\n\ni closed down the country to china, trump said, adding later, i did the china ban.\n\nfacts first: it's not true that trump closed down the country entirely, or that he banned travel from china outright. only foreign nationals who had been in china within the past 14 days were outright banned from entering the us.\n\nwhen asked by fox news's martha maccallum about the approximately 40,000 people who entered the country from china after trump announced these travel restrictions, trump said they were american citizens by the way. however, citizens were not the only exempted group able to enter the country under the trump administration's travel restrictions. the restrictions also exempted permanent residents, some of the close family members of citizens and permanent residents, and some others.\n\nyou can read more about the trump administration's travel restrictions in response to coronavirus here\n\nfauci on coronavirus threat\n\ntrump announced his travel restrictions against china at the end of january. at sunday's town hall, trump claimed that a month later even dr. anthony fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert, said the coronavirus was going to pass, not going to be a big deal.\n\nfacts first: trump is wrong that fauci publicly said the virus was not going to be a big deal and would pass. while it is true that fauci said in late february that americans did not need to change their behavior patterns at that time, he also clarified that these conditions could change and coronavirus could develop into a major outbreak.\n\nyou can read more about what fauci actually said here\n\nan apology from joe biden?\n\ntouting the restrictions on china, trump claimed that the presumptive democratic presidential nominee and former vice president joe biden had issued an apology for past criticism on the subject.\n\nbiden has now written a letter of apology because i did the right thing, trump said.\n\nfacts first: biden's campaign biden's campaign announced in early april that he supports trump's travel restrictions on china. but neither biden nor his campaign apologized for any previous criticism of trump. the campaign says that biden's comments trump has described as criticism of the china restrictions -- in which biden said trump has a record of hysterical xenophobia and fear mongering -- were not about the travel restrictions.\n\nbiden's campaign says he did not know about the china restrictions at the time of the january 31 speech in which he made these remarks, since biden's campaign event in iowa started shortly after the briefing during which the china restrictions were revealed by health and human services secretary alex azar.\n\ngiven the timing of the biden remarks, it's not unreasonable for the trump campaign to infer that biden was talking about the travel restrictions. but biden never took an explicit position on the restrictions until his april declaration of support -- and whether or not you accept his campaign's argument that the xenophobia claim was not about the restrictions, he certainly hasn't apologized.\n\nthe timing of the biden campaign's statement\n\ntrump continued to suggest that the biden campaign tried to bury its statement of support for the travel restrictions on china, claiming the campaign released the supposed letter on a friday night.\n\nfacts first: the biden campaign revealed during the day on friday, april 3, not at night, that biden supports the restrictions. deputy campaign manager kate bedingfield made a daytime statement to cnn anchor and chief washington correspondent jake tapper, who filed his article to cnn editors at 1:28 p.m. (tapper's the biden campaign revealed during the day on friday, april 3, not at night, that biden supports the restrictions. deputy campaign manager kate bedingfield made a daytime statement to cnn anchor and chief washington correspondent jake tapper, who filed his article to cnn editors at 1:28 p.m. (tapper's article was last updated at 4:42 p.m. that day, the cnn website shows.)\n\nfalse and misleading claims about hydroxychloroquine\n\nthe fox news anchors asked trump about hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malaria drug that trump spent much of march and april promoting as a potential game-changer for covid-19.\n\ntrump's comments about the drug typically haven't been rooted in science . his response during sunday's townhall was full of false information.\n\nfacts first: trump made at least five false or misleading claims about hydroxychloroquine in about two minutes. he exaggerated the good results and understated the bad results from early medical research. he implied the drug was safe, even though the food and drug administration trump made at least five false or misleading claims about hydroxychloroquine in about two minutes. he exaggerated the good results and understated the bad results from early medical research. he implied the drug was safe, even though the food and drug administration now says there are deadly side effects. and he falsely suggested it was harmless to tout the drug so aggressively, even though his past promotion led to shortages for americans with pre-existing conditions.\n\nfirst: asked about studies that found cardiac side effects in covid-19 patients, trump said it was only one study. there have been a handful of studies with similarly problematic or unhelpful results, including a trial from asked about studies that found cardiac side effects in covid-19 patients, trump said it was only one study. there have been a handful of studies with similarly problematic or unhelpful results, including a trial from brazil , a trial in france , a study of veterans' hospitals in the us and a large study of coronavirus patients in new york, the epicenter of the outbreak.\n\nsecond: when trump said, there were studies that came out that say it's very good, he isn't telling the full story. some small, early trials found positive results for hydroxychloroquine. but the most influential of those early studies, run by a when trump said, there were studies that came out that say it's very good, he isn't telling the full story. some small, early trials found positive results for hydroxychloroquine. but the most influential of those early studies, run by a controversial doctor in france , wasn't a randomized trial, and the publisher of the study now says the trial didn't meet its standards\n\nthird: trump said he recently got three calls from people that took (hydroxychloroquine) and they're giving it credit for saving their lives. he has trump said he recently got three calls from people that took (hydroxychloroquine) and they're giving it credit for saving their lives. he has cited stories like these in the past. it's a good thing when anyone gets better, but these are just anecdotes from some of the 1.1 million americans known to have the coronavirus. they don't carry the same weight as actual scientific evidence.\n\nfourth: by saying, we don't lose anything with hydroxy, trump is whitewashing the fallout from his dogged promotion of the drugs back in march and early april. by saying, we don't lose anything with hydroxy, trump is whitewashing the fallout from his dogged promotion of the drugs back in march and early april. cnn previously reported that his comments led to shortages for many chronically ill americans who have relied on this particular drug for years. the fda website says hydroxychloroquine is currently in shortage.\n\nfifth: by saying people aren't dying by trying hydroxychloroquine, trump is falsely implying that we know the drugs are safe to treat the virus. he has by saying people aren't dying by trying hydroxychloroquine, trump is falsely implying that we know the drugs are safe to treat the virus. he has said this before , and it isn't accurate. the fda gave hospitals emergency authority to use the drug, but issued warnings about deadly side effects. also, a hydroxychloroquine trial in brazil was halted after some patients died\n\ntrade with china\n\ntrump repeated three false claims regarding trade with china. he claimed we were losing $500 billion a year to china, for years, and that china never gave 10 cents to our country before he took office. regarding his tariffs on china, trump said the chinese paid for that tax, it wasn't our people. they paid for that tax, they devalued their currency.\n\nfacts first: not only are americans bearing most of the cost of trump's tariffs but the us has also had tariffs on china for more than two centuries, generating an average of $12 billion a year from 2007 to 2016, factcheck.org reported. there has also never been a $500 billion trade deficit with china. (trump describes trade deficits as losing, though many economists dispute that characterization.)\n\nyou can read a longer fact check on trump's china tariffs here\n\nhunter biden and china\n\nin criticizing the previous administration's dealings with china, trump took a shot at hunter biden, the son of the former vice president.\n\npresident obama and joe biden didn't do anything. china just had a field day with our country. and then you look at his son, walking out with $1.5 billion -- give me a break on that.\n\nfacts first: while hunter biden has previously had a board seat and a financial stake in a private-equity fund that the chinese government-owned bank of china has invested in, there is no evidence he walked out of the country with $1.5 billion. hunter biden's lawyer, george mesires, said in an october 2019 while hunter biden has previously had a board seat and a financial stake in a private-equity fund that the chinese government-owned bank of china has invested in, there is no evidence he walked out of the country with $1.5 billion. hunter biden's lawyer, george mesires, said in an october 2019 statement that the firm, bhr partners, was capitalized with 30 million renminbi (rmb), or approximately $4.2 million usd at today's currency exchange rates.\n\nas of october 2019, hunter biden had a 10% interest in bhr. in december 2013, the same month the fund was officially established, hunter joined his father on a trip to china. there, hunter met up with jonathan li, the fund's china-based partner. the new yorker reported that li met hunter at his hotel and shook hands with joe biden. however, according to the new yorker, hunter maintains that visit with li was social, not business-related.\n\nin july 2019, more than two years after his father left office, hunter purchased an equity stake in the bhr fund, valued around $430,000, according to mesires\n\nto date, hunter has not received any compensation for being on bhr's board of directors. he has not received any return on his investment; there have been no distributions to bhr shareholders since hunter obtained his equity interest, mesires said in the october 2019 statement.\n\nthe us contribution to nato\n\ntrump claimed that, until he got nato members to significantly increase their spending, they weren't paying. we were paying for 100% of nato.\n\nfacts first: the us was not paying for 100% of nato before trump's presidency, though its defense spending did represent the majority of total nato defense spending.\n\nnato countries other than the us spent a total of $262 billion on defense in 2016, according to official nato figures released in november 2019 (which used 2015 prices and exchange rates). the us spent $651 billion itself that year, about 71% of the total. that's a large percentage, but 100% is a significant exaggeration.

still in for a congressman who skips the fourth of july parade. just one of the many holiday wrinkles for the contentious obamacare repeal debate.\n\n\n\nbut we begin with the most pressing of many global challenges confronting president trump all at once. the pentagon says that missile tested yesterday by north korea is new and a game changer because of its likely ability to reach the united states. america's top general in south korea warns the prospect of war is real. that as the united states and its allies stage their own missile display in response to pyongyang. the south korean government added this to the message war, a computer animate video portraying a devastating attack on the north korean capital.\n\n\n\npresident trump is calling for global isolation and voicing his exasperation that china won't do more to help. and the north korean leader, kim jong-un, hardly shy about testing mr. trump's patience. listen to this. he calls that icbm test proof of his nuclear powers and a fourth of july gift launched to, quote, slap the american bastards in their face. north korea will top the president's crowded agenda when he lands in europe and as the urgent focus right now at the pentagon as well.\n\n\n\nbarbara starr has the latest there on the assessment of this new missile and the options to deal with it.\n\n\n\nhi, barbara.\n\n\n\nbarbara starr, cnn pentagon correspondent: hi, john.\n\n\n\nthe day after july 4th, a very different world for president trump because now it is just a fact, north korea has an intercontinental ballistic missile that could, some day, with some additional improvements, be able to strike the united states, in particular the western portion of alaska. they would have to make improvements to be able to do it, but there is no question that is the direction they are heading.\n\n\n\nu.s. officials, defense officials telling us the missile they fired yesterday, two stages, intercontinental ballistic missile capability. and it was something brand new that the u.s. had never seen before. u.s. intelligence now scouring every bit of information it has, radar data, satellite data, the pictures the north koreans have shown to try and calculate what this missile is all about.\n\n\n\nif you want to consider how destabilizing even this test might have been, a short time ago the pentagon spokesman explained to reporters the view of the defense department was this missile posed a potential threat when it was launched to aircraft, civilian aircraft flying in the region, satellites overhead because it achieved such a high altitude. shipping in the sea of japan. we asked why, then, if it was such a threat, it wasn't shot down. the spokesman saying it did not pose a direct threat to the united states at this time.\n\n\n\nbut, as north korea continues this test program and they continue to fire into these busy areas in the asia pacific region, there is growing concern that there could be a very unexpected disaster at some point. no indication the u.s. is looking to conduct military action, but they indeed are having that show of force yesterday that u.s. missiles also could reach into north korea.\n\n\n\njohn.\n\n\n\nking: at a minimum tense times to say the least. barbara starr at the pentagon.\n\n\n\nbarbara, thank you.\n\n\n\nthe shift in south korea is quite dramatic. it's new president just elected on a platform of dialogue with the north. but this latest missile launch is bringing a more muscular tone.\n\n\n\ndavid mckenzie is live for us in seoul with that.\n\n\n\nhello, david.\n\n\n\ndavid mckenzie, cnn international correspondent: well, that's right. hello, john.\n\n\n\ncertainly this is a real test for president moon here in south korea. he has been voted in because of promising, maybe a more dialogue ready posture toward north korea, but this really thrashing that to shreds. you see the daily papers here in south korea. a business daily here, john, which is saying that north korea's icbm provocation really threatens the red line of both south korea and the u.s. here in english language paper, again, big front page headlines showing kim jong-un overseeing that missile test.\n\n\n\nthe calculation here in south korea has always been slightly different from the u.s. they've got artillery pieces right on the dmz, right near seoul and any conflict could be a massive disaster for this country. so they tend to push, at least with this new administration, towards dialogue. but with kim jong-un continuing to provoke, continuing to progress that missile system, very little dialogue will come from the south koreans any time soon.\n\n\n\njohn.\n\n\n\nking: david mckenzie for us in seoul, tracking things there. david, thank you so much. with us here in washington to share their reporting and their insights, jackie kucinich of the daily beast, john yang of the pbs newshour, jill colvin of the associated press, and matt viser of the boston globe.\n\n\n\nlet's focus first on the president. this, obviously, as often is the case, something happens. the g-20 is a big economic meeting. normally they're scheduled to talk about trade, talk about other economic issues. almost always something happens in the world that becomes the dominant issue. this will be it.\n\n\n\n[12:05:00] the president, before he got on air force one, tweeting this morning, trade between china and north korea grew almost 40 percent in the first quarter. so much for china working with us. but we had to give it a try.\n\n\n\nthe president left his first meeting with president xi down in mar-a- lago quite optimistic that they had developed some sort of a personal understanding that china would help when it comes to north korea. after that launch yesterday, the president -- he's not saying he's giving up on that approach, but he seems more than exasperated.\n\n\n\njohn yang, pbs newshour: it's not clear whether he's given up or whether he's trying to pressure or shame china into doing more.\n\n\n\nking: right.\n\n\n\nyang: another tweet this morning also is when he said that we have all these trade deals with countries who aren't helping us and it shouldn't be lost that they're looking at steel tariffs and accusing china of dumping steel.\n\n\n\nking: the question is, what can he do? and his own credibility is being tested here because the president said early on, china will help us solve this problem or we will do it by ourselves.\n\n\n\nhe's going to go to the g-20. i want to get to -- secretary tillerson has called -- a, there's an emergency united nations session this afternoon. secretary tillerson says in a statement, global action is required to stop a global threat. any country that hosts north korean guest workers, provides any economic or military benefits, or fails to fully implement u.n. security council resolutions is aiding and abetting a dangerous regime. he goes on to say, all nations should publically demonstrate there are consequences.\n\n\n\nbut if you look at any nation that hosts guest workers, provides economic or military benefits. that, again, is china. the administration publically lashing out at china saying, do more, but what if it doesn't?\n\n\n\nmatt viser, the boston globe: it's also that, you know, looking at trump's business career, his past background in his relationships with people were often transactional. and -- but they would sign a dotted line and move on. this is a different case with xi, where he's trying to sort of move him in a certain direction, develop a relationship where you can sort of move somebody in a certain direction. and they don't seem to have that bond or that trust. and so what does president trump do? people are -- there's more talk about maybe diplomacy. you know, do you head in a diplomatic direction. but, again, trump was sort of very critical of the iran deal, which was all about diplomacy and sort of tamping down nuclear threats. and that's sort of where he's at right now and does he head down that diplomatic path in a way that he criticized in the past.\n\n\n\nking: right, and can he, to your point, if china said, we can get north korea to the table. the table for what? kim jong-un has shown no indication he's willing to give up his missile program or his nuclear program because those are his tickets, in his view, to survival. the trump administration has said the era of strategic patience is over. i assume they would only sit down if they had what they thought was a full commitment to dismantle the nuclear program. but the clinton administration negotiated that deal. and the north korean government immediately violated it. so is there -- is there a framework where you could conceivably at least test diplomacy?\n\n\n\njackie kucinich, the daily beast: it's -- well, and north korea has said that is not on the table at this point. now --\n\n\n\nking: and their leader -- and their leader just said he was slapping the american bastards in their face.\n\n\n\nkucinich: right.\n\n\n\nking: that's a pretty hard to get to diplomacy from there.\n\n\n\nkucinich: yes, that is rather far from that line. and so we just -- we don't know -- it's one of the reasons that the meeting between president trump and president xi at this conference this week is very important, and worth watching. it was going to be worth watching anyway because of the tariffs, because of lots of other reasons. but now, because of north korea, china doesn't have the same objectives in north korea as the united states and can he -- can president trump get them there, any closer to where the united states is on north korea. we don't know the answer to that question yet. we just don't.\n\n\n\nking: and sometimes china's response is the things you're asking us to do could be counterproductive.\n\n\n\nkucinich: right.\n\n\n\nking: if we cut off food, if we cut off energy, we don't know the reaction of the regime. they could lash out. they could launch weapons. they can shell artillery onto the south. and so you're asking us to be more harsh to them. but if kim jong-un thinks his regime is at all in question, what will he do?\n\n\n\njill colvin, associated press: absolutely. and i mean i think what's really interesting here too is that this is a president who hasn't really been tested when it comes to whether he or tillerson or anybody else in the administration is really capable of that kind of diplomatic outreach. you know, they alienated large swaths of europe with the paris climate agreement decision. and this is just not -- we haven't seen that side of trump yet. king: right, there's the complicated policy here, and this goes back,\n\n\n\nwhether you agree or disagree with president trump, he inherited this. this goes back several administrations trying to deal with this regime. one of the most isolated and strange, to be polite, regimes on earth, and then the personal, when he's challenged like, it's a slap in your face or don't do this anymore and kim jong-un gets directly confrontational with president trump.\n\n\n\njust to show the stakes of this, what this means, you heard barbara starr talking about, now that the pentagon does access, this was an icbm that is potentially capable, if not now very soon, a breach in the united states. i just want to look at the history of the north korean missile program. you see the smaller lines there internally. if you went back years, they had short range missiles and the threat was really -- you know, u.s. troops in south korea, without a doubt, but the threat was more regional. then the intermediate range missiles. and these are the missile tests. if you go back to the dear leader, then this leader's father, missile tests, yes, but not like this. kim jong-un, a young man, 83 missile tests. i think 11 or 12 since donald trump became president of the united states. he uses firing missiles, a, to get attention, and -- but then what? what is he looking for besides people think, ok, he has missiles, ok, he's a nuclear power. what?\n\n\n\n[12:10:12] viser: well, and so many of those have failed.\n\n\n\nking: right.\n\n\n\nviser: and you almost have this, you know, laughing stock, you know, ability of the united states to laugh at their failures. in this case, you know, by all accounts this was successful and so you wonder at some point how that changes the thinking of the united states when they deal with north korea, knowing that provocation has some major consequences, not only in the asian region, which it always has, but to our own country, to alaska, and, you know, potentially, depending on sort of how they progress in their capabilities, other parts of the west coast. and so how does that change the negotiations if they get to negotiations and how does that change president trump's ability to sort of needle a country that now has the capability of really punching back.\n\n\n\nking: and that -- and that for years has tried to ignore sanctions and just not -- and not show any great impact from sanctions, perhaps because there's a backdoor, because there are black market around those sanctions. but if you think about, yes, he's asked the pentagon, the president has, for a list of military options, you could conceivably launch a strike on a missile facility or on a nuclear facility in north korea, but you don't know what the north koreans would do to react to that. just to remind you, north korea has an estimated million-man army. the proximity to seoul is like that. there are u.s. troops there, 230,000 americans, including nearly 30,000 servicemen and women, 10 million people live in seoul. and so when people say it's a small hermit regime, you know, the united states is a world's greatest superpower, there's something that can be done, that's not necessarily the case because of the risks involved. yang: the risks are different. i mean on the united states' side, they\n\n\n\nlook at the -- any military could escalate into a conflict on the peninsula. for the chinese, they're worried about that border.\n\n\n\nking: right.\n\n\n\nyang: that if there are economic -- more economic sanctions, if use disrupt the civil society inside north korea, you can -- could have people surging across that border into china, which they don't want.\n\n\n\nking: they also want the refugees coming in.\n\n\n\nyang: right.\n\n\n\nking: and they also don't want the regime -- they don't -- they don't want a unified korea.\n\n\n\nyang: right.\n\n\n\nking: they don't want that. so what does the president do when he gets off the plane? i mean you mentioned president xi, that's part of it. you know, the president of south korea and the prime minister of japan will also be at this meeting. so they can have regional conversations. is there a european as here as well, just isolation?\n\n\n\nviser: i think the pressure is maybe next on -- if there's a sanctions -- or if there's a u.n. kind of solution that, you know, involves conversations with china and russia and getting their veto proof power on the security council to convince them to do something. and maybe on sanctions to try and squeeze the north koreans a little bit more on this, but --\n\n\n\nking: in this particular -- this is one of the cases for people out there who are fans or not fans of the united nations. this is one of those things where there have been meetings, there have been condemnation, there have been statements, there have been sanctions. again, we go back to -- i covered the white house in the bill clinton administration into the george w. bush administration. we've had these conversations now for a very long time.\n\n\n\nyang: but you're also talking about the isolation of north korea. people forget how many nations there are that do have diplomatic relationships with pyongyang.\n\n\n\nking: right.\n\n\n\nyang: and you talk about the guest workers and other aid. the white house just read out a phone call to president el sisi of egypt in which the president reminded egypt of the sanctions about guest workers in egypt, about egyptian aid to the north korean military. so i think the -- there is some way to go. there may be some way to go before their -- as isolated as say iran was during the sanctioned regime there.\n\n\n\nking: and we'll see if the president can make that case. again, he's on his way to europe for this big summit. and, also, a united nations security council meeting this afternoon.\n\n\n\nas we go to break, perhaps this is a sign of nikki haley, the u.s. ambassador, her sense of humor tweeting out yesterday, spending my fourth in meetings all day. thanks, north korea. i guess that's a little bit of humor there. more on the global challenges ahead.\n\n\n\nbut next, the fourth of july means fireworks, parades and, for the most part, members of congress in hiding.\n\n\n\nand speaking of fireworks, let's have a little sampling of last night's celebrations across the united states.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[12:18:38] king: take a peek here, mcallen, texas. protesters making clear they don't like the role senator ted cruz is playing in trying to repeal the affordable care act, or obamacare.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\ncrowd: (inaudible).\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nking: but let's give some kudos to senator cruz for understanding, especially on the fourth of july, democracy is supposed to be a little feisty.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nsen. ted cruz (r), texas: you know, one of the great things about freedom in america is even people who disagree can speak out. and there's a small group of people on the left who, right now, are very angry and they're expressing their views.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nking: senator cruz, sadly, was more the exception than the rule. more and more lawmakers are skipping holiday parades and town halls back home because they don't want to face questions and protests. minnesota republican congressman erik paulsen, for example, skipped the fourth of july parade in edina, so protesters stepped in.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nunidentified female: he never has town halls. he didn't show up to this. so we decided to take his place.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nking: they showed up to take his place. edina, minnesota, there.\n\n\n\nthat's clever. it's a stunt, but stunts are allowed in democracy. that's the way it's supposed to work. you organize, you go out, you yell at your congressman, sometimes you say thank you to your congressman or congresswoman or your senator. why is it -- i don't want to make too much of this, but why is it -- i\n\n\n\nguess it's obvious -- that fewer and fewer just don't -- they work for the people. why won't they go out and meet to the people, especially when the people are mad about something? that makes it more important.\n\n\n\n[12:20:05] colvin: we've seen what's happened at these town halls where, you know, republicans show up and they're just -- there's a deluge of hundreds or thousands of people who are there booing and screaming at them. you understand why they don't want to face that. there's no obligation for them to have to stand up and take that kind of thing. but, you know what, i think there's an interesting thing with the timing here. with the vote delayed, you know, you now have members having to go back home now, having to face the people who are actually going to be effected by these policies and hearing from them. and i actually do wonder whether the folks who did show up, who did schedule events, maybe are thinking about it maybe a tad bit differently now.\n\n\n\nking: it -- i would assume, maybe not, but i would at least assume that some of those progressives who don't like what ted cruz is doing, who probably don't like anything ted cruz has done, at least do they give him some respect because he's not afraid to show up at the event and he acknowledges that -- sure, he says it's a small group on the left. he gets his little politics in there as well. but, so what, that's how it's supposed to work.\n\n\n\nkucinich: well, and that's what you hear from these protesters, what the lawmakers say is, why am i going to these events that are full of people who, you know, are maybe not in my district, maybe aren't even from the state. you hear a lot of that, too. whether or not it's true.\n\n\n\nbut -- i mean but, again, as you said, why not just go? i mean this is -- this is democracy. and you're seeing -- we were talking a little bit during the break, you're seeing senators, in particular, doing other things. rob portman's staff sent out a notice today that showed rob portman, you know, hugging people during a parade and how well liked rob portman is. but then they mentioned that he was visiting centers for people who were dealing with opioid abuse. he's having a roundtable. they're choosing these smaller events that still allows them to talk to people -- and it's not like they are locking themselves in their office -- but aren't necessarily exposing them to the free-for-alls that some of these town halls have become.\n\n\n\nking: right. this matters, and i should have set up the context, it matters because senate republicans are in an internal family feud over what to do about repealing and replacing obamacare. they wanted to pass a bill last week. now they're hoping to pass a bill next week. but they're still working on this. rob portman one of the more moderate members who doesn't like the medicaid cuts in the proposal as it now sands, doesn't think there's enough money for drug treatment of the opioid. with him on what we'll call the left of the republican, the more moderate side of the republican conference is susan collins of maine, who did march in a parade back home and she says she's glad she marched because she right now is a no vote, and she says as she marched and as she listened to her constituents, she believes most of them are with her. (begin video clip)\n\n\n\nsen. susan collins (r), maine: what i've been hearing the entire recess is people telling me to be strong, that they have a lot of concerns about the health care bill in the senate. they want me to keep working on it, but they don't want me to support it in its current form. i still am a no unless the bill is dramatically changed.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nking: and so they're at home and she's still a no unless it's dramatically changed. senator cruz says he's still a no, but trying to change it as well. the issue in trying to get to 50 votes is, senator cruz is trying to take it to the right, senator collins is trying to take it to the left. if either one of them succeeds, you lose the other side. this math still looks, at the moment, impossible to me. does anyone see it otherwise?\n\n\n\nviser: no. and i think your -- you know, if mitch mcconnell's watching this, you know, his stomach's turning a little bit because when people go back to their districts they tend to get more entrenched in their prior positions than to sort of lean more toward compromise. i think what's interesting here too, though, is that collins was sort of the exception in marching in a fourth of july parade. you know, senators even avoiding that sort of softball, you know, pitch down the middle, you know, going to a parade to march in because they're so afraid of engaging with constituents. and the washington post had a good line today too about, there are more senators on this trip to afghanistan --\n\n\n\ncolvin: yes.\n\n\n\nviser: than there are having town hall meetings.\n\n\n\nking: and do we see anything from the time back home that shows the math is shifting in any way at all?\n\n\n\ncolvin: i think i've seen no evidence of that. i don't know about you, but at this point, not.\n\n\n\nviser: right.\n\n\n\nyang: which is precisely why mitch mcconnell wanted the vote before they went home --\n\n\n\nkucinich: right.\n\n\n\nyang: because this is going to make it harder -- harder for them when they get back.\n\n\n\nking: that makes it harder.\n\n\n\nkucinich: particularly these moderates. particular dean heller in nevada. and you mentioned susan collins, rob portman. they're hearing from people, not necessarily protesters, but people who are affected by this bill. susan collins had another line in i think that same washington post story that said -- oh, no, i'm sorry, it was angus king, who is an independent. but if you look at this bill, it's the worst bill you could possibly have for maine. so they are getting -- they're hearing from people and, yes, mitch mcconnell has to be frustrated by this because he is someone that's known as a deal maker, as someone who can get things done. but right now the numbers are just not there for them.\n\n\n\nking: and it matters, a, if you care about the health care debate, whatever side you're on. number two, it matters because we're two weeks away from the six month mark of the trump presidency and this health care debate has sort of held congress hostage to getting around to some of the other parts of the agenda. we'll keep an eye on that as members of the senate lead the parades or leave hiding, come back to washington.\n\n\n\n[12:25:02] up next, air force one is en route to europe and protesters are waiting for president trump.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\nking: welcome back.\n\n\n\nair force one is over the atlantic this hour as president trump heads to some high stakes meetings in europe. poland first and then the g-20 economic summit in germany as mr. trump makes just his second international trip as president. the big meetings include his first face-to-face meeting with vladimir putin. also on tap, china's president, xi jinping and sit-downs with two european allies, with whom mr. trump has big disagreements at the moment, chancellor angela merkel of germany and prime minister theresa may of the u.k.\n\n\n\ncnn's nic robertson is live in hamburg, where one of the interesting g-20 dynamics this time, nick, will include demonstrations much closer to the event site than we've become accustomed to in recent years. why is that?\n\n\n\nnic robertson, cnn international diplomatic editor: yes, there is a reason for it. quite simply, angela merkel has chosen to hold this summit in an environment, in a location that can be surrounded by protesters. it's not, as we see, some summits on a remote hilltop that the whole village or the town around it is secure. and there will be protesters here. there were protesters last night. the police had to turn a water cannon on about 1,000 of them. they just sort of rained in on them. didn't wash them off the streets. there was a women's protest just down beside here a little while ago.
return to transcripts main page\n\ncnn newsroom\n\nwhite house daily press briefing; wapo: trump dictated son's misleading statement of russia meeting; lawsuit: fox concocted conspiracy story on seth rich with white house coordination. aired 2:30-3p et\n\naired august 1, 2017 - 14:30 et\n\nthis is a rush transcript. this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\n\n\nsarah huckabee sanders, white house press secretary: during the last administration, small businesses found themselves under assault from a federal government that seemed determined to keep piling on regulations and compliance requirements until it became impossible to keep their doors open. obamacare's mandates saddled many with health care costs they simply couldn't afford, and every year these business owners see new additions to the tax code that force them to spend additional time and money to file.\n\n\n\nthe president is committed to ending these anti-growth policies and unleashing the american economy. we will continue to work with congress to repeal obamacare's oppressive mandates. and along with our partners in congress, we will deliver bold tax reform that provides relief for middle-income individuals, a more competitive model for businesses, and simplification for everyone. and we will continue the president's ambitious plan to eliminate unnecessary regulations, which disproportionately affect small businesses.\n\n\n\nwe look forward to hearing from the small businesses this afternoon about how the trump administration can continue to be an advocate for them.\n\n\n\nand with that, we'll keep it short today, and i'll take your questions now.\n\n\n\nalex (ph)?\n\n\n\nquestion: i wanted to ask about a comment senator lindsey graham made this morning. (inaudible) wrong that there's no good military option regarding north korea. he said there's a military option to destroy north korea's program and north korea itself.\n\n\n\nwould the white house be supportive of (inaudible)?\n\n\n\nsanders: i'm sorry?\n\n\n\nquestion: would the white house be supportive of that option, to destroy north korea's (inaudible) program and north korea itself?\n\n\n\nsanders: (inaudible) this direction. sorry, i just keep hearing somebody's phone talking or something.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk) sanders: yeah, it's very distracting.\n\n\n\nquestion: ... military option against north korea is to destroy north korea's program and north korea itself.\n\n\n\nsanders: look, the president obviously has been very outspoken about how he feels about north korea. we're weighing all options, keeping all options on the table. and as we've said many times before, we're not going to broadcast what we're going to do until that happens.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nsanders: i'm sorry?\n\n\n\nquestion: ... destroying the country, like lindsey graham says, an option?\n\n\n\nsanders: look, that's not what i'm saying.\n\n\n\nwhat i'm saying is the president has been very outspoken about the need to stop north korea. we've been very focused on stopping the nuclear program, stopping the missiles, stopping the aggression. that still continues to be the focus, and we're keeping those -- all options on the table in order to do that.\n\n\n\nquestion: sarah, according to the washington post, the president tried to change the narrative of what went down in (inaudible) meeting with the russian lawyer. can you address that story and tell us did the president really try to do that?\n\n\n\nsanders: look, the statement that don jr. issued is true. there's no inaccuracy in the statement.\n\n\n\nthe president weighed in as any father would, based on the limited information that he had.\n\n\n\nthis is all discussion, frankly, of no consequence. there was no follow up. it was disclosed to the proper parties, which is how the new york times found out about it to begin with.\n\n\n\nthe democrats want to continue to use this as a p.r. stunt, and are doing everything they can to keep this story alive and in the papers every single day. the president, the american people, they voted america first, not russia first. and that's the focus of our administration.\n\n\n\njohn (ph)?\n\n\n\nquestion: can you clarify the degree to which the president weighed in?\n\n\n\nsanders: he didn't -- he certainly didn't dictate. but, you know, he -- like i said, he weighed in, offered a suggestion like any father would do.\n\n\n\nquestion: did he not know what his... sanders: steven (ph)?\n\n\n\nquestion: i will follow up on that.\n\n\n\nwas he aware at the time that don jr. had had a meeting that was based on the pretext that he would be promised information that was negative about hillary clinton when he suggested that the statement only say that the meeting was primarily about russian adoption policy?\n\n\n\nsanders: like i said, the statement that was issued was true and there were no inaccuracies in the statement.\n\n\n\ni think what the bigger question is -- everybody wants to try to make this some story about misleading. the only thing i see misleading is a year's worth of stories that have been fueling a false narrative about this russia collusion and based -- a phony scandal based on anonymous sources.\n\n\n\nand i think that is -- if we're going to talk about misleading, that's the only thing misleading i see in this entire process.\n\n\n\nquestion: i would like to...\n\n\n\nsanders: you guys are focused on a meeting that don jr. had no consequence, when the democrats actually colluded with a foreign government like ukraine. the democrat-linked firm fusion gps actually took money from the russian government while it created the phony dossier that's been the basis for all of the russia scandal fake news.\n\n\n\nand if you want to talk further about a relationship with russia, look no further than the clintons. as we've said time and time again, bill clinton was paid half a million dollars...\n\n\n\nquestion: (off-mike)\n\n\n\nsanders: ... to give a speech to a russian bank, and was personally thanked by putin for it.\n\n\n\nhillary clinton allowed one-fifth of america's uranium to -- reserve to be sold to a russian firm whose investors were clinton foundation donors. and the clinton campaign chairman's brother lobbied against sanctions on russia's largest bank and failed to report it.\n\n\n\nif you guys want to talk about having relations, which you seem obsessed with doing, look no further than there.\n\n\n\nif you want to talk about somebody who's actually been tough on russia, look at president trump. he wants more fracking, more coal, more energy, a stronger military, a stronger defense. those things aren't good for russia.\n\n\n\ni think the distinctions are very clear and you guys want to create a narrative that just doesn't exist.\n\n\n\nquestion: sarah...\n\n\n\nsanders: hey, guys...\n\n\n\nquestion: sarah...\n\n\n\nsanders: glenn, go ahead.\n\n\n\nquestion: sarah, why did the president sign the russia bill?\n\n\n\nsanders: glenn, go ahead.\n\n\n\nquestion: sorry.\n\n\n\nsarah, sort of a follow-up on what you were talking about, our obsession with russia and the responsibility (inaudible).\n\n\n\nthere's a report out today based on a lawsuit that was filed that says that sean spicer met with a campaign donor and a journalist from fox news where they were pushing around this story that seth rich, this low-ranking dnc staffer who was murdered, was perhaps the one responsible for the wikileaks breach.\n\n\n\ntwo questions.\n\n\n\nsean put out a statement. he said it was just a brief meeting. he said the guy didn't know the president. the lawsuit alleges the president knew about it and had an influence on the story.\n\n\n\ndid the president know about the story pre-publication? and did he have an influence on the way the story was written?\n\n\n\nsanders: the president had no knowledge of the story. and it's completely untrue that here the white house involvement in the story.\n\n\n\nand beyond that is just ongoing litigation, and i'd refer you to the actual parties involved, which aren't the white house.\n\n\n\nquestion: follow-up.\n\n\n\ndoes it disturb you that the press secretary for the president of the united states, just gave this incredibly passionate pushback on us for focusing on russia -- does it disturb you -- just sped right past us -- does it disturb you that there is an allegation out there in a lawsuit and sean spicer admitted meeting with these two individuals, that this was discussed in your white house...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nsanders: he met with members of the media. i don't find that to be a strange thing.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nsanders: you guys are all members of the media.\n\n\n\nquestion: he was pushing a story that was later retracted because it was false. he met with that reporter and he met with a campaign donor. does it disturb you? does it say anything about this white house that he would entertain that kind of story?\n\n\n\nsanders: it doesn't bother me that the press secretary would take a meeting with somebody involved in the media about a story. none of that was disclosed. they had a conversation and that was the end of it.\n\n\n\nyou guys come to us with stories all day. i've taken meetings with the majority of the people in this room. i don't always know the nature of the story of which you're coming to talk to me about, but it's my job to talk to you, to listen. and i'm responding.\n\n\n\nthe president didn't have knowledge of the story. the white house didn't have any involvement in the story.\n\n\n\nand beyond that, it's ongoing litigation that doesn't involve anybody in the building, and so i'd refer you to the parties that it does.\n\n\n\nquestion: sarah, i've got two questions for you. i want to follow up on something you said yesterday after my first question.\n\n\n\nyou were on that flight back from the g-20. did you invite the president to be truthful in that statement that he was helping...\n\n\n\nsanders: i wasn't part of the conversation regarding the statement.\n\n\n\nquestion: you were not in the room at the time?\n\n\n\nsanders: well...\n\n\n\nquestion: were you in the room at the time?\n\n\n\nsanders: i was in the air. i was on the plane. but i wasn't part of the conversation. so i can't speak to anything beyond that part.\n\n\n\nquestion: yesterday you said that the president was joking about his comments putting suspects' heads -- telling police officers they shouldn't cover their heads when putting then in a car. was he making a joke about police brutality?\n\n\n\nsanders: not at all. i think you guys are jumping and trying to make something out of nothing.\n\n\n\nhe was simply making a comment, making a joke and it was nothing more than that.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nquestion: should he apologize for that joke?\n\n\n\nquestion: on that same issue, the head of the dea wrote immediately after the president made those remarks to officers in the dea telling them to disregard them and saying he had an obligation to speak up when something wrong happens.\n\n\n\nsanders: it wasn't a directive. it was a joke. there's a very big difference.\n\n\n\nquestion: why -- why was that not clear...\n\n\n\nsanders: olivia?\n\n\n\nquestion: sarah, has the president signed the russia-north korea-iran sanctions bill?\n\n\n\nsanders: i'm sorry. has he signed it?\n\n\n\nquestion: yes.\n\n\n\nsanders: he has not. but as we put out a statement earlier this week, he will. and we'll let you know when the details and final plan on that comes.\n\n\n\nquestion: what's the delay? what's the delay here? you guys have had this since friday. what -- what's holding him back?\n\n\n\nsanders: there's nothing holding him back. there's a review process, a legal process. they're going through that. and he'll sign the bill and we'll let you guys know.\n\n\n\nmargaret? question: thanks, sarah.\n\n\n\ni -- two questions.\n\n\n\nthe first is there's a really interesting story out, just before the briefing began, by defense one talking about air force one. and it says that the u.s. air force has found an alternative to get the price down as president trump wanted. that was to buy a pair of boeing 747 jetliners that were abandoned by a bankrupt russian airline.\n\n\n\ncan you verify the accuracy of the story? do you know if that's correct?\n\n\n\nsanders: i can't at this time. it's something i'd have to check into and get back to you.\n\n\n\nquestion: and then i also want just, sort of, an update on the new chief of staff, general kelly.\n\n\n\ncan you talk to us, sort of in broad strokes about calls (inaudible) he's (inaudible) so far, leadership of congress, folks outside of congress, any governors, that sort of thing? can you talk to us broadly about the message that he's sending and the people that he's talking to, both inside and outside of the administration?\n\n\n\nsanders: i know he's spoken to a number of members of congress, as well as a large number of individuals within the staff. he's taking time to get to know everyone here in the building that he hasn't met previously through his other role, and working through setting up, you know, new process and, kind of, setting the tone, i think, for a white house that under his leadership will be very focused on the president's agenda, as we've been doing the last six months. we're going to continue on that track, and we're going to do that under general kelly. and we're very excited to work alongside him in that process.\n\n\n\nhallie?\n\n\n\nquestion: you talk about the president's agenda and -- and i've been sitting here and i heard you list off a list of reasons of why you think the media should be focusing on democrats and not the president. and not to belabor an obvious point that hillary clinton is certainly not in the oval office, donald trump is, and there seems to be a trust deficit that is being created from on capital hill.\n\n\n\nand i want to tell you what lindsey graham said this morning on the today show. he said, if this is true, this washington post reporting, it was a bad decision by the president which will make us ask more questions. when you get caught in a lie about one thing, it makes it hard to say, 'we'll just let the other stuff go.'\n\n\n\nis this what is hurting the president's legislative agenda, this credibility issue (inaudible)?\n\n\n\nsanders: i think what's hurting the legislative agenda is congress' inability to get things passed.\n\n\n\nquestion: (inaudible) from some republicans that the president is not always being as truthful as he could be. how does he plan to address that?\n\n\n\nsanders: i -- i think by being truthful and transparent, as he has every single day.\n\n\n\n(inaudible)?\n\n\n\nquestion: thank you, sarah.\n\n\n\ni'd like to return to north korea. with north korea continuing to escalate nuclear tension, can we expect any action from the administration to ratchet up pressure of actions on china?\n\n\n\nsanders: as we've said, we're not going to broadcast movements on things like that before they take place.\n\n\n\nbut, you know, we're going to continue to work with our allies, continue to work with our partners. and again, the goals are to stop the nuclear program, stop the missiles, stop the aggression. with north korea, we're going to continue looking at the best options and ways to accomplish that.\n\n\n\nquestion: can you say what some of those options might be?\n\n\n\nsanders: not at this time.\n\n\n\njohn. sorry, john gizzi. you had your hand up when i first went back to...\n\n\n\nquestion: thank you, sarah.\n\n\n\nsanders: happy to go to somebody else named john. question: you said yesterday that -- i think you said yesterday that there would be no reshuffle in the cabinet, meaning general sessions would not move over to the homeland security. is that correct?\n\n\n\nsanders: correct.\n\n\n\nquestion: and does that also mean that secretary of state kris kobach, the vice chairman of the president's commission on electoral integrity, would stay at his position and not be considered for homeland security?\n\n\n\nsanders: i'm not aware of any movements for him. but, as always, when we have a personnel announcement, i'll be happy to share it with you.\n\n\n\njon decker?\n\n\n\nquestion: thanks.\n\n\n\nsanders: since we're in the jons.\n\n\n\nquestion: thank you, sarah.\n\n\n\ni was hoping -- just to follow up on north korea, hoping you could clarify the administration's message that it has for north korea.\n\n\n\nthe other day the president said, when asked about north korea, we will take care of them. we will take care of everything. and a little bit ago, the secretary of state, secretary of state tillerson, said that the u.s. is trying to convince north korea that the u.s. is not your enemy.\n\n\n\nso, which one is it? is the president focused on north korea as an adversary? or is secretary tillerson correct that the u.s. is trying to send this message that the u.s. is not north korea's enemy?\n\n\n\nsanders: look, like i just said a few minutes ago, the big priorities here, which we've laid out -- i think this is the third or fourth time i've done it just today -- is to stop the nuclear program, stop the missiles, stop the aggression. that's what we're focused on, in regards to north korea, and we're going to continue pushing on that, continue working with our allies and partners to accomplish that...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nsanders: ... and do what is necessary to achieve it.\n\n\n\nquestion: are they an adversary? does the -- does the president...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nsanders: look, i think -- i -- i think, in some ways, they get to decide by the actions that they take. if they want to stop their nuclear program, stop the games, stop the missiles, stop the aggression, then i think we may be able to find ways to move forward.\n\n\n\nbut those are the priorities of this administration.\n\n\n\ndave?\n\n\n\nquestion: sarah, thanks.\n\n\n\nsecretary mnuchin had a meeting on the hill this morning with senate leaders about the debt ceiling. apparently, according to reports, they didn't get anywhere. obviously, this has the potential to affect the stock market rally that the president is so pleased with.\n\n\n\ndo you have...\n\n\n\nsanders: i think the whole country is pleased with it.\n\n\n\nquestion: yes, that is true.\n\n\n\ndo you have any reason to believe, at this point, that you're going to get the debt ceiling issue done by the end of september?\n\n\n\nsanders: look, to ensure that we have robust economic growth and promote fiscal discipline, the trump administration believes it's important to raise the deal -- debt ceiling as soon as possible.\n\n\n\nover the past two decades, members of congress and presidents from both parties have raised the debt ceiling 15 times, and we look forward to working with congress to ensure the full faith and credit of the united states government.\n\n\n\nquestion: sarah?\n\n\n\nsanders: april?\n\n\n\nquestion: thank you.\n\n\n\nsanders: since you said my name so politely.\n\n\n\n(laughter)\n\n\n\nquestion: thank you, sarah.\n\n\n\nso...\n\n\n\nsanders: somewhat sarcastic.\n\n\n\nquestion: me, being sarcastic? no, never.\n\n\n\nsanders: go ahead, april.\n\n\n\nquestion: all right.\n\n\n\nsarah, when it comes to this joke that the president said friday, you have many organizations, to include police organizations, naacp and the american citizenship, that's upset about this.\n\n\n\ncould there be an apology from the president? and what does he view as reasonable, when he's not joking, when it comes to use of force from police?\n\n\n\nsanders: i would have to ask on that specific question.\n\n\n\nquestion: but do you think that the president is remorseful for what he said, because of the outcry from friday? sanders: i think the president supports our law enforcement, and he supports the protection of the citizens of this country, and he wants to empower our law enforcement to be able to do their job. i don't think there's anything beyond that.\n\n\n\nzeke?\n\n\n\nquestion: sarah? thanks, sarah.\n\n\n\nfirst, following up on olivier's question, you mentioned that there's a legal review of the -- this legislation. but the white house has already said that the president will sign it. so, what -- what is the nature of that review if, presumably, there is some review before putting (inaudible)?\n\n\n\nsanders: as with every very -- particularly complex piece of legislation, like this is, there's a legal review. and once we sign that, we'll work through and put more of the details of that process out.\n\n\n\nquestion: and separately, one more for you.\n\n\n\nlast month, the president had delivered a -- a warning to congress, a couple of times, not to take vacation in august. what is the status of the president's august plans? does he plan to leave washington? for how long? and what will he be doing during that timeframe?\n\n\n\nsanders: we'll continue to keep you guys updated on his august schedule as those details are finalized.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nquestion: thank you, sarah.\n\n\n\nthe coast guard commandant (inaudible) he won't turn his back on transgender troops, which would seem to preclude (inaudible) the president's directive on twitter. does the white house consider that he's refusing to follow an order?\n\n\n\nsanders: i haven't heard those comments, or had a chance to speak with any (ph) about it. but i know that the goal is to work with all of the relevant departments, primarily the department of defense, to lawfully implement that new policy.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nquestion: sarah, you just told april that you -- you would have to ask the president if an -- an apology would be appropriate. are you saying you will ask him and get back to us?\n\n\n\nsanders: no. i said i would have to, in order to answer that question.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nquestion: would you, please? could you ask him?\n\n\n\nsanders: i'll let you know if i do.\n\n\n\nquestion: now, also, on john -- on general kelly, you said yesterday that everybody's now reporting to the president through him. is that an accurate characterization?\n\n\n\nsanders: right. like -- i said that general kelly has full authority...\n\n\n\nquestion: so does that mean...\n\n\n\nsanders: ... in the white house.\n\n\n\nquestion: ... nobody can wander into the white house on their own? is he going to post somebody outside the oval office...\n\n\n\nsanders: i don't think anybody can wander into the white house on their own without...\n\n\n\nquestion: excuse me...\n\n\n\nsanders: ... secret service stepping in.\n\n\n\nquestion: ... in his (ph) oval office -- in the oval office? can his daughter, can his son-in-law, can steve bannon wander into the oval office and talk to him without...\n\n\n\nsanders: i don't think anybody just wanders into the oval office.\n\n\n\nlook, this is the -- the white house. he's the president of the united states of america. and there are processes and...\n\n\n\nquestion: but it's pretty informal here, normally, right? i mean, people talk to him. they don't wait to get approval to talk to him.\n\n\n\nsanders: look, general kelly is going to work with the entire team, as he's been doing over the last couple of days. he's done a great job of sitting down and talking to individuals about the needs that they have, the conversations, and putting a structure in place. there's nothing abnormal about that.\n\n\n\nquestion: (inaudible) staff talk to the president without the approval of general kelly?\n\n\n\nsanders: i don't know that i would say approval is the correct word. but i certainly don't think it's like we're getting permission slips signed.\n\n\n\nbut i do think that there is something to having a structured process in order just to make things run more smoothly at the white house.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nquestion: (inaudible) president's reaction to two opposition leaders being...\n\n\n\nsanders: sorry. i...\n\n\n\nquestion: ... (inaudible) in venezuela?\n\n\n\nsanders: can you say that again?\n\n\n\nquestion: what is the president's reaction to the two opposition leaders being jailed in venezuela now, after the sanctions from yesterday?\n\n\n\nsanders: overnight, the regime of the venezuelan dictator maduro detained two leading opposition figures, following its outrageous seizure of power through sham elections this weekend. the vice president spoke with mr. lopez just last week, and he and mr. ledezma are political prisoners held unjustly by the maduro regime.\n\n\n\nthe united states condemns the actions of the maduro dictatorship and we hold maduro personally responsible for the health and safety of both men and any others seized by his dictatorship.\n\n\n\nquestion: is the president already considering increasing the sanctions and perhaps going after their oil exports?\n\n\n\nsanders: again, i'm not going to broadcast. as secretary mnuchin said yesterday, we'll consider all options and keep you guys updated.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nquestion: on health care, you said earlier that (inaudible) keeping the president's agenda from (inaudible) congress and their votes. the president has said he wants to see health care done before anything else and yet, that's not the message we've seen from the senate majority leader, mitch mcconnell, in the last few days.\n\n\n\ncan you explain the discrepancy between the president and senior republican leadership on the hill when it comes to what should be done next?\n\n\n\nsanders: as we've said before, we can do a lot of different things at one time. we're continuing to focus...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nquestion: ... this thing first.\n\n\n\nsanders: we're continuing to try to push a new health care system.\n\n\n\nwe know that obamacare is failing. we know that inaction is simply not ok. we want to continue to make that a priority. we want to work with congress to do that. we may look for other ways to improve health care in the meantime. we're also continuing to focus on tax reform. we've been doing tax reform listening sessions for the last month. we've been having -- we've had countless meetings with members of congress, other organizations, talking about tax reform.\n\n\n\ninfrastructure. we're going to continue to focus on all of those priorities and move them forward.\n\n\n\nquestion: will the president support congress taking csr payments out of his hands? there's been some suggestion, again among senior republicans, that this is appropriate to do given the president's threats to stop these payments. they're saying those should be taken out of the executive branch.\n\n\n\nsanders: i'd have to get back to you on that.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nquestion: ... because this is something that's being discussed pretty aggressively on capitol hill. (inaudible) has talked about it. orrin hatch has talked about it.\n\n\n\nsanders: i'm happy to get back to you.\n\n\n\nquestion: thanks.\n\n\n\nsanders: peter?\n\n\n\nquestion: very quickly on (inaudible). does the president believe the (inaudible) original fox news report that seth rich was responsible for the release of dnc e-mails to wikileaks?\n\n\n\nsanders: i'm not sure, peter.\n\n\n\nthanks, guys. we've got a small-business event coming up shortly, and hopefully you all will tune in.\n\n\n\nquestion: is first strike off the table with north korea?\n\n\n\nquestion: thank you.\n\n\n\n[14:48:33]\n\n\n\nbrooke baldwin, cnn anchor: all right. the questions continue but she's got to go.\n\n\n\nlisten, a lot there. let me just begin with the story of the day, this washington post piece, which, you know, if you believe the post and their sourcing, they believe that now infamous don jr meeting over at trump tower along with paul manafort, russian attorneys, jared kushner, for a minute there, that the original statement, which said, no, no, no, and i'm entirely abbreviating this for you, but, no, this was about adoption, when in actuality, when the e-mails came out, we clearly saw it was about getting dirt on hillary clinton. this was the original statement because we just heard sarah huckabee sanders saying the president weighed in, didn't dictate, but did weigh in offering suggestions. the original statement here, so we're all on the same page, we primarily discussed a program about the adoption of russian children that was active and popular with american families years ago and was since ended by the -- he goes on -- russian government. but it was not a campaign issue at the time, and there was no follow-up.\n\n\n\nlet me play some sound, too. this is from one of president trump's lawyers saying that the president had nothing to do with writing that statement.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\njay sekulow, attorney to president trump: i wasn't involved in the statement drafting at all. nor was the president. i'm assuming that was between mr. donald trump jr, between don jr, and his lawyer. i'm sure his lawyer was involved. that's how you do it. you know that. so to put this on the president, i think, is just absolutely incorrect.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nbaldwin: ok, so, something isn't adding up here.\n\n\n\ndavid chalian, you're first at bat on this, our political director, because to hear sarah huckabee sanders saying, no, unlike what the washington post is saying, no, the president didn't dictate the statement, did weigh in, as any father would, with limited information. it's not all adding up, though.\n\n\n\n[14:50:21] david chalian, cnn political director: it is. now, this may have been one of sarah huckabee sanders's most troubling appearances in the press briefing room and you can hear it from the reaction of the entire press corps when she's jumping in. because they are failing at p.r. 101 here of actually martialing all the facts and putting them out and getting their stories straight. all they do is raise more questions. how much did the president know? had the president read the e-mail? we still don't know the time line here. i understand that she said he didn't dictate and that's their answer to the washington post. but when she said that the statement that you just read that was given to the new york times, donald trump jr's statement --\n\n\n\nbaldwin: the statement was true on adoption.\n\n\n\nchalian: completely true, totally factual. that is a sin of omission. she's not acknowledging the reality of what we've all learned since then. donald trump jr admits, president trump admits, that oppo research on hillary clinton was part of this, there was a set-up for this meeting where donald trump jr knew that it was the russian government's desire to affect the election. all of that was present. so, to just say that that statement was 100 percent contract and correct when we know it is not the full story, is, again, it's like, am i not supposed to believe my lying eyes? i don't understand who she's trying to convince that that was a full and accurate statement.\n\n\n\nbaldwin: jeff zeleny, let me pivot to you at the white house.\n\n\n\nand to chalian's point, we've heard out of the president's own mouth, both when he was with macron in france and with maggie haberman, at the new york times, both times saying, yes, the meeting in addition to talking about adoption was also about opposition research, and who wouldn't go to that kind of meeting. jeff zeleny, what do you think.\n\n\n\njeff zeleny, cnn seniow white house correspondent: exactly. i mean, what we learned today from this press briefing, brooke, is that there are still so many more questions about that flight on july 8 when the president was flying back from hamburg, germany, at the end of the g- 20 summit to washington when the new york times was first reporting about that meeting that now we've talked so much about. that meeting back on june 9, 2016. now, sarah huckabee sanders is confirming that the president weighed in, in her words, but that's in direct contradiction to what the president's own lawyers said. so now we are left to wonder, is the president's lawyer, is he accurate when he is saying the president had no part of writing that statement? or is his spokeswoman, his new press secretary accurate, while saying the president weighed in. so, again, i mean, i think that this press briefing here, which certainly raised more questions than it cleared up over all this, is going to do one thing. it puts the white house back on defense on the entire russia matter.\n\n\n\nand you can just sense the members of congress, senators, senator lindsey graham, others are already saying, brooke, that their patience is wearing a bit thin on this. and if you don't believe the president on this, it is leaking into other things in terms of their credibility.\n\n\n\nso, on day two here, when there was somewhat of a reset with the new chief of staff, you know, with the ousting of anthony scaramucci, it's a reminder that all of the baggage, quite frankly, that was here in the first six months remains here. so, this is something that the white house will have to contend with, and again, it's clouding the waters and, you know, really damaging their credibility.\n\n\n\nbaldwin: and, i mean, she came to that podium prepared. she had notes and stats, criticizing hillary clinton and bill clinton and money made, speeches in russia.\n\n\n\nbut let me pivot away from you, jeff, and go to robbie mook.\n\n\n\nspeaking of your former boss, you're now our cnn political commentator, former clinton campaign manager. listening to it and talking to david, i mean, she can point out, you know, russia and the clintons and talk about democrats all she wants, but that's not what's being investigated right now. david says it's a sin of omission. how do you see it?\n\n\n\nrobbie mook, cnn political commentator: well, it's a tactic by the white house to try to deflect attention. the fact of the matter is, donald trump is the president of the united states. he is the one who is serving the public. and he is the one who deserves to be scrutinized, and he is the one who needs to tell us the truth about what's going on. i'm not surprised by this. the white house has lied at every turn of\n\n\n\nnot just this scandal but everything that goes on. so, i'm not surprised that they're not telling the truth. i'm also not surprised that they're trying to go back to the -- the days of the campaign to try to, you know, create a foil here.\n\n\n\nwhich is also convenient for him because his party controls the entire government and they're simply not able to get anything done. and i don't mean this rhetorically, it's just a fact. that's because of donald trump. i really think that this congress could have passed a lot, but they have someone at the head of their team who is entirely dysfunctional and won't tell the truth.\n\n\n\nso, yeah, it's just a diversionary tactic, and it's sad. i think they should just get out there, answer the questions, and move on and try to pursue some legislation for once.\n\n\n\n[14:55:35] baldwin: ken cuccinelli, let me hear from you, cnn legal commentator, former virginia attorney general. would you agree, ken, that the white house has not been telling the truth here.\n\n\n\nken cuccinelli, cnn legal commentator: well, certainly, when you get a statement that they now say is basically accurate but has left things out, they invite more questions as time goes on. but i don't agree with robbie that the republicans -- the republicans nominally control congress but if you look at how the health care bill went, you can see the problem. the dysfunction isn't limited to any one part of washington. it's on capitol hill, too. and the senate republican leadership and a lot of the republicans who had promised for years to repeal obamacare have demonstrated why they can't get things done. it's because they're breaking their promises.\n\n\n\nwhat robbie said would be true and accurate if the republican leadership in the senate in particular were actually doing what they said. but they say something entirely different on the campaign trail and back in their districts, than they do here in washington. when they're talking to you, when they're talking to lobbyists, when they're talking to donors, it's a whole different world.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbaldwin: are you saying that --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbaldwin: i'm trying to follow your logic. you're basically showing a parallel in that we're talking about the president of the united states saying one thing, and his press secretary sort of saying another, and a lawyer saying another, and that's just like the dysfunctional congress who says one thing to us on tv and another to the constituents? are you equating the two?\n\n\n\ncuccinelli: the -- well, robbie had mentioned the control republicans have and the dysfunction over there. and i certainly agree there's dysfunction over there. but it's because a good swath of the republican senators didn't tell the truth about what they were really going to do on obamacare when they finally had the opportunity. and so now, at a slim margin of 52-48, because they aren't keeping their promises, and that's it, they can't pass a repeal of obamacare. so, now go down the street to the white house, and their story, they keep adding pieces here as time goes on.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbaldwin: but ken, i got to interject because this is a total tangent. we're not talking about obamacare. you know, the question --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncuccinelli: well, it's the most recent example, that's all.\n\n\n\nbaldwin: but the question is, why did trump feel the need to not be transparent about this meeting? period. that's the question.\n\n\n\ncuccinelli: yeah, look, i'm no psychoanalyst, but i guess i play one in politics, but this is kind of consistent with his a-plus-plus behavior everywhere else, is he wants to try to influence or control what's going on. it irritates him and so he wants to steer it in a particular direction. even if it --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbaldwin: but it's lying.\n\n\n\ncuccinelli: even if that means stepping into his own son's statement.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbaldwin: isn't that lying?\n\n\n\nmook: i also -- i actually agree with what ken just said. i would just add on to this. i think this is a pattern of behavior that was -- you could qualify this more, but basically, effective for him in his business life. he has a long track record. and i say this objectively, he has a long track record of not paying people, of signing a contract and just not following through on it, he bullied people all the time and wouldn't tell the truth in real estate. he's had a very topsy-turvy career. and i think at 70 years old, he has a long career behind him. i think he's pushing that forward into the white house. it just doesn't work. and ken knows this from serving in public life. you cannot lie to people every day and the public will just move on. you're held accountable every single day and everything's under a microscope. and i agree with ken. that frustrated him but this is not running real estate in new york. this is the most important office in the world. everything's going to get nitpicked and it will catch up with him.\n\n\n\nbaldwin: i want to come back to the two of you in just a second.\n\n\n\nbut let's get to the other big headline out of the briefing, this whole fox story and the dnc staffer, seth rich.\n\n\n\nhere was sarah huckabee sanders on that. (begin video clip)\n\n\n\nhuckabee sanders: the president had no knowledge of the story and it's completely untrue that he or the white house involvement in this story. and beyond that, this is ongoing litigation and i would refer you to the actual parties involved, which aren't the white house.\n\n\n\nunidentified reporter: does it disturb you that you would entertain that kind of story.\n\n\n\nhuckabee sanders: it doesn't bother me that the press secretary would take a meeting with somebody involved in the media about a story. none of that was disclosed. they had a conversation, and that was the end of it. you guys come to us with stories all day. i've taken meetings with the majority of the people in this room. i don't always know the nature of the story of which you're coming to talk to me --

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nby stating she would eliminate private insurers as a necessary part of implementing medicare-for-all, california sen. kamala harris during a cnn town hall monday night sent a shockwave through the national health care debate.\n\nharris' comments underscored the extent to which a move to single payer would radically overhaul the current system and, in frankly addressing one of the transition's most politically difficult steps, stepped directly into her critics' crosshairs.\n\nrepublicans attacked harris within minutes of her remarks, tweeting that she says she wants to eliminate private insurance even if you like your plan. by tuesday morning, former starbucks boss howard schultz was piling on and fellow billionaire potential presidential candidate michael bloomberg, the former mayor of new york, was dismissing the entire plan as a fiscally ruinous pipe dream.\n\nas the furor grew, a harris adviser on tuesday signaled that the candidate would also be open to the more moderate health reform plans, which would preserve the industry, being floated by other congressional democrats. it represents a compromise position that risks angering medicare-for-all proponents, who view eliminating private health insurance as key to enacting their comprehensive reform.\n\nboth the adviser and harris national press secretary ian sams said her willingness to consider alternate routes to a single payer system should not cast doubt on her commitment to the policy.\n\nmedicare-for-all is the plan that she believes will solve the problem and get all americans covered. period, sams told cnn. she has co-sponsored other pieces of legislation that she sees as a path to getting us there, but this is the plan she is running on.\n\ntheir description of harris' views is backed up by her record in the senate, where she co-sponsored vermont sen. bernie sanders' medicare for all bill, which would phase out for-profit insurers, but also the less aggressive approaches proposed by hawaii sen. brian schatz, whose bill would effectively create a public option by allowing certain americans to buy-in to medicaid, and a plan from sens. jeff merkley and chris murphy that would allow individuals to enroll in a new form of medicare and employers to purchase it for their workforce.\n\nshe was also a co-sponsor on a bill called medicare x, from sens. michael bennet and tim kaine, which would create a public insurance option on the affordable care act exchanges, along side the private insurance plans. the goal would be to give americans more choices when buying obamacare coverage, particularly in areas where few carriers participate.\n\nharris's comments on monday and her adviser's more cautious words on tuesday highlight the tensions among democrats over health care, an issue they united over in defense of obamacare in 2017. now, there is an increasingly heated intra-party debate over whether to open up medicare or medicaid to more americans, create a public insurance option that would retain the current job-based insurance plans or replace the entire system, like medicare for all promises to do, with a medicare-type plan for everyone. many establishment democrats, including some top officials, are skeptical of all those approaches, preferring instead to shore up the existing obamacare marketplaces.\n\nthe argument has implications that go beyond health care policy in a presidential primary that is expected to test the ideological boundaries of the party. harris has repeatedly affirmed her support for medicare for all but her record and support for more moderate legislation suggests that she could also be open to allowing insurers to remain or supporting a buy-in system, less than 24 hours after her comments in iowa, could seed new skepticism among the progressives she is seeking to win over.\n\nillinois sen. dick durbin, the chamber's second-ranked democrat, expressed some concern tuesday over the prospect of wiping out private health insurers.\n\ni don't want to guess what (harris is) thinking but that is a massive part of the american economy. there is a system in place for funding it, durbin said. it would take a mighty transition to move from where we are to that.\n\nasked by the audience in des moines on monday about health care and, more pointedly, if her solution (would) involve cutting insurance companies as we know them out of the equation, harris did not hesitate.\n\ni believe the solution – and i actually feel very strongly about this – is that we need to have medicare-for-all, she said. that's just the bottom line.\n\nharris then spoke about her mother and the benefits of medicare, a point she has made repeatedly and wrote about in a new york times op-ed, and called the current order inhumane for making people go through a system where they cannot literally receive the benefit of what medical science can offer because some insurance company has decided it doesn't meet their bottom line in terms of their profit motivation.\n\nwhen pressed by town hall host jake tapper over whether she would be willing to eliminate private health insurance as part of creating that new single payer system, harris stood firm.\n\nwho of us has not had that situation, where you've got to wait for approval (for medical care) and the doctor says, well, i don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this?, harris said. let's eliminate all of that. let's move on.\n\nher remarks drew applause from the drake university audience and from medicare-for-all supporters, who have been pleased to see a growing crop of democratic presidential contenders publicly back their agenda. still, many harbor doubts over whether the candidates, if elected, would be willing spend the necessary political capital to deliver on their promises.\n\nnational nurses united executive director bonnie castillo, whose organization has been at the forefront of the push for single payer health care, said she welcomed any contender's support for medicare for all and the acknowledgment that insurance companies have no place in our health care, but argued that it could not be done without the abolition of private health insurers.\n\nwe've got to push this across the finish line and my sense is that half measures are just not going to get it, castillo said. that has happened time and time again and we know as nurses that it is not effective – that is not an effective treatment or solution.\n\nwhile many polls show the majority of americans support a medicare for all-type plan, they are less enamored with the idea of jettisoning their current insurance. a recent kaiser family foundation poll found that 56% of americans favor medicare-for-all, but that approval rating drops to 37% when respondents heard that it would eliminate private health insurance companies.\n\nmost people are satisfied with the health insurance until they have a problem, said tricia neuman, director of the foundation's program on medicare policy. the public favors these proposals that would broaden choice, but also want to be sure they don't lose something that they value.\n\nthe harris adviser told cnn on tuesday that she is committed to the position she staked out in iowa. the adviser called the backlash from republicans good trouble for harris.\n\nharris and her allies signaled tuesday that they are eager to engage schultz, who is considering a third-party centrist run.\n\nthe public scrape with the billionaire, harris advisers said, can only help to burnish harris' progressive credentials.\n\nschultz criticized harris early on tuesday during an interview with cbs, when he reacted to her comments in iowa with derision.\n\nthat's not correct, that's not american, schultz said. what's next? what industry are we going to abolish next? the coffee industry?\n\nhe then compared the push for medicare-for-all to republican efforts to repeal obamacare.\n\ni don't agree with that, he said. the affordable care act should stay and it should be refined. but the thing we should get rid of is the insurance industry? again, this is exactly the situation – it's far too extreme on both sides and the silent majority of america does not have a voice.\n\nmeanwhile, bloomberg joined schultz on tuesday in throwing cold water on the notion of replacing private insurance with a government-run system, saying it would bankrupt us for a very long time.\n\ni think we could never afford that, said bloomberg. we are talking about trillions of dollars. i think you could have medicare for all for people who are uncovered, but that's a smaller group.
washington (cnn) president donald trump began march with a barrage of false claims about the coronavirus pandemic -- understating the extent of the crisis, overstating the availability of tests, inaccurately blaming his predecessor and wrongly insisting that the crisis was unforeseen.\n\ntrump made 50 false claims from march 2 through march 8, then 21 false claims from march 9 through march 15. of those 71 false claims, 33 were related to the coronavirus . that is on top of some additional misleading claims from trump about the coronavirus (we only count the false claims here), plus some false and misleading claims from members of his administration.\n\ntrump is now averaging about 57 false claims per week since we started counting at cnn on july 8, 2019. from that date through march 15, he has made 2,062 false claims in all.\n\nthe most egregious false claim: the availability of coronavirus tests\n\non march 6, as doctors and health officials around the country were reporting a shortage of coronavirus tests, trump said , anybody that wants a test can get a test. that's what the bottom line is.\n\nin reality, americans needed authorization from a doctor to get tested -- and even many people who did have a doctor's order could not get access.\n\nthis was trump deceiving the country about one of the most critical problems of the crisis.\n\nthe most revealing false claim: trade with europe\n\ntrump is serially reluctant to admit error, even trivial slips he makes while reading prepared speeches. instead of correcting himself, he usually pretends that he has not slipped at all.\n\nduring his oval office address to the nation about the coronavirus on march 11, trump, speaking from a script, announced that he was imposing restrictions on travel from europe -- and then added that these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. anything coming from europe to the united states is what we are discussing.\n\nas he was forced to explain on twitter after the speech, he was not actually banning trade and cargo from europe.\n\nso what happened? the usual, according to reporting from the new york times and the wall street journal . trump's speech said the prohibitions would not apply to trade and cargo; trump accidentally added the word only, reversing the meaning; trump plowed ahead as usual.\n\nthe most absurd false claim: handshakes in india\n\ntrump is regularly willing to make false claims that can be disproven using widely available video footage.\n\nwhile meeting with the prime minister of ireland on march 12, trump was asked whether he was fine shaking hands with foreign prime ministers. trump said they hadn't shaken hands that day -- then added, you know, i just got back from india, and i didn't shake any hands there.\n\nan indian news website promptly published a photo gallery of seven trump handshakes during his trip.\n\nthe coronavirus\n\n'control' of the coronavirus\n\nthis is a very contagious -- this is a very contagious virus. it's incredible. but it's something that we have tremendous control of. -- march 15 coronavirus press conference\n\nfacts first: experts said the us did not have the virus even close to under control. dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, said at this same briefing after trump left the room: the worst is, yes, ahead for us. it is how we respond to that challenge that's going to determine what the ultimate end point is going to be. we have a very, very critical point now.\n\ntrump claimed the next day that he had not meant the virus was under control -- that he had meant we are doing a very good job within the confines of what we're dealing with. but he had repeatedly made clear on previous occasions that he was talking about the virus when he spoke of control. he said in late january, soon after the us announced its first confirmed case, that we have it totally under control. he said in late february, when the number of confirmed us cases was in the low dozens, that we have it very much under control in this country.\n\nexpectations of the pandemic\n\n...but we're having to fix a problem that, four weeks ago, nobody ever thought would be a problem. -- march 11 exchange with reporters at coronavirus meeting with bankers\n\nfacts first: the us intelligence community, public health experts and officials in trump's own administration had the us intelligence community, public health experts and officials in trump's own administration had warned for years that the country was at risk from a pandemic. some of the warnings specifically mentioned the possibility of a coronavirus pandemic. and when this particular coronavirus, sars-cov-2, was identified in china in early january, health experts quickly cautioned it could be a major problem around the world.\n\nthis was foreseeable, and foreseen, weeks and months ago, and only now is the white house coming out of denial and heading straight into saying it could not have been foreseen, harvard university epidemiology professor marc lipsitch, director of harvard's center for communicable disease dynamics, said on sunday.\n\nalmost two months ago, experts were saying that the new virus in wuhan was potentially a global threat, lipsitch said in an email. one month ago, experts were saying that it was likely to be pandemic, and the white house's response was that this was under control, despite the fact that the us's lack of testing was demonstrably giving a false picture of the extent of infection.\n\nobama and coronavirus testing\n\ntrump claimed twice that he had reversed an obama-era decision that had impeded testing for the coronavirus. on the first occasion, trump said, the obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we're doing. and we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion. that was a decision we disagreed with.\n\nfacts first: there is : there is no regulation from president barack obama that impeded coronavirus testing. the obama administration did put forward a draft proposal related to lab testing, but it was never implemented. when asked what obama administration decision trump might be referring to, peter kyriacopoulos, chief policy officer at the association of public health laboratories, said: we aren't sure what rule is being referenced.\n\ndr. joshua sharfstein, who was principal deputy commissioner of the fda under obama and is now professor of the practice at johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health, said, there wasn't a policy that was put into place that inhibited them. there was no obama policy they were reversing.\n\nthe availability of coronavirus tests\n\nanybody that wants a test can get a test. that's what the bottom line is. and: anybody right now and yesterday — anybody that needs a test gets a test. we — they're there. they have the tests. and the tests are beautiful. anybody that needs a test gets a test. -- march 6 exchange with reporters after tour of the centers for disease control of prevention\n\nfacts first: that simply wasn't true. there were an : that simply wasn't true. there were an insufficient number of tests available , as vice president mike pence acknowledged the day prior, and americans could not get tested simply because they wanted to get tested. you may not get a test unless a doctor or public health official prescribes a test, azar said the day after trump's remark -- and even some of the people whose doctors wanted them to be tested were not able to obtain a test. (azar claimed trump was using shorthand for the fact that we as regulators, or as those shipping the test, are not restricting who can get tested.)\n\ncoronavirus testing\n\ntrump was asked about a case in which a doctor in houston reported being unable to obtain permission to get a patient tested despite the patient having symptoms of something and having tested negative for the flu.\n\ntrump responded that this was a mere one case and that frankly, the testing has been going very smooth. he also claimed: if you go to the right agency, if you go to the right area, you get the test. -- march 12 exchange with reporters before meeting with irish prime minister leo varadkar\n\nfacts first: it was simply not true that testing had been going smoothly or that, as trump suggested, it was simple to get a test by contacting the proper authorities.\n\nhealth officials in states around the country continued to report a shortage of tests and other problems. dr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, told congress the same day: the system does not -- is not really geared to what we need right now ... that is a failing. it is a failing, let's admit it.\n\ndr. fauci said, the idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countr(ies) are doing it: we're not set up for that. do i think we should be? yes. but we're not.\n\nyou can read a full fact check here\n\nthe timeline\n\nwe got hit with the virus, really, three weeks ago, if you think about it, i guess. that's when we first started, really, to see, you know, some possible effects. -- march 5 fox news town hall in scranton, pennsylvania\n\nfacts first: the us had its first confirmed case of the coronavirus on january 21, more than six weeks before trump spoke here, so it's not true that the us had not really seen even some possible effects until three weeks ago.\n\npeople's knowledge of the number of flu deaths\n\nyou know, three, four weeks ago, i said, 'well, how many people die a year from the flu?' and, in this country, i think last year was 36- or 37,000 people. and i'm saying, 'wow, nobody knew that information.' -- march 2 exchange with reporters at coronavirus meeting with pharmaceutical companies\n\nso when you lose 27,000 people a year, nobody knew that. i didn't know that. -- march 2 campaign rally in charlotte, north carolina\n\nfacts first: trump might not have known the number of annual flu deaths in the us, but that doesn't mean nobody else did. the centers for disease control and prevention : trump might not have known the number of annual flu deaths in the us, but that doesn't mean nobody else did. the centers for disease control and prevention publishes annual estimates on its website.\n\nthe cdc estimates that between 12,000 and 61,000 people have died in the us in each flu season between 2010-2011 and 2018-2019; its preliminary figure for 2018-2019 is 34,157 deaths.\n\nflu deaths in 1990\n\nspeaking about the flu, trump said, i think we went as high as 100,000 people died in 1990, if you can believe that. -- march 4 interview with fox news' sean hannity\n\n...when i was hearing the amount of people that died with flu, i was shocked to hear it. anywhere from 27,000 to 70,000 or 77,000. and i guess they said, in 1990, that was in particular very bad; it was higher than that. -- march 6 exchange with reporters after tour of the centers for disease control of prevention\n\nfacts first: while the 1989-1990 flu season was considered bad at the time -- the cdc : while the 1989-1990 flu season was considered bad at the time -- the cdc declared that it was an epidemic -- trump greatly overstated the number of deaths. a cdc analysis in 2010 estimated that there were 26,582 deaths from the seasonal flu in 1989-1990. (the same analysis found that this number of deaths was exceeded in nine of the 17 subsequent flu seasons through 2006-2007.)\n\npolling on trump and the coronavirus\n\ngallup just gave us the highest rating ever for the way we are handling the coronavirus situation. -- march 5 tweet\n\nour response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% approval rating, the highest on record. -- march 12 tweet\n\nfacts first: trump does not have a 78% approval rating for his handling of the coronavirus, nor the highest rating ever for a president's handling of an outbreak.\n\ntrump may have been wrongly describing a gallup poll conducted in early-to-mid-february -- before there were any reported us deaths from the coronavirus -- that found 77% of respondents had confidence in the federal government to handle a coronavirus outbreak. but that poll asked about confidence in the government's future acts, not about approval of its actual work to date. it also did not ask about trump in particular.\n\npolls actually asking about people's approval of trump's handling of the virus situation at the time found that his approval rating is much lower than 78%. in an nbc/wall street journal poll conducted march 11-13, 45% of registered voters approved of his handling of the coronavirus, while 51% disapproved. a quinnipiac university poll conducted march 5-8 found that 43% of registered voters approved, 49% disapproved. (some subsequent polls found trump's coronavirus-related approval above 50%.) conversely, a cnn poll taken in october and november 2009 found that 57% approved of barack obama's handling of the h1n1 flu pandemic.\n\ntravel from europe\n\nto keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from europe to the united states for the next 30 days...there will be exemptions for americans who have undergone appropriate screenings...these restrictions will also not apply to the united kingdom. -- march 11 oval office address to the nation on the coronavirus\n\nfacts first: trump was incorrectly describing his own policy.\n\nhis travel suspension did not apply to all travel from europe; it applied to the 26 countries in the schengen area, a european zone in which people can move freely across internal borders. (trump later added the united kingdom and ireland, which are not in the schengen area, to the restricted list.)\n\ntrump did not mention that he was exempting a variety of non-us citizens, including permanent us residents and certain family members of both citizens and permanent residents. and by referring to americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, he did not make clear that us citizens can return from europe even if they have not been screened before they take off for the us. the screening comes after they land in the us.\n\nyou can read a full fact check here\n\neuropean goods\n\nthere will be exemptions for americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. anything coming from europe to the united states is what we are discussing. -- march 11 oval office address to the nation on the coronavirus\n\nfacts first: though he corrected his error in a : though he corrected his error in a tweet shortly after his speech, trump was not actually prohibiting trade and cargo from europe. we're still counting this as a false claim because he did not correct himself during a high-profile national address.\n\nthe new york times and the wall street journal reported that, according to times sources and a journal review of drafts of trump's speech, the text of trump's speech said the restrictions will not apply to trade and cargo.\n\n(trump has a long history of attempting to improvise after he has made a mistake reading a speech from a teleprompter, rather than simply correcting the error.)\n\na rally in tampa\n\ntalking about how his campaign has canceled rallies because of the coronavirus, trump said, and we had four or five of them that we were thinking about. we have a big one in tampa, all sold out. we have over 100,000 requests for tickets, but i think we'll probably not do it because people would say it's better to not do. -- march 12 exchange with reporters before meeting with irish prime minister leo varadkar\n\nfacts first: there was no sold out trump rally in tampa, florida. while trump's campaign was : there was no sold out trump rally in tampa, florida. while trump's campaign was in the process of planning a tampa rally , the event had not been publicly announced and no tickets had been publicly offered, so it simply does not make sense that the event was sold out or that there had been over 100,000 requests for tickets. the associated press reported that trump's claim was an impossibility and that the campaign had declined to comment; the campaign also did not respond to our inquiry.\n\ngoogle's coronavirus website\n\ni want to thank the people at google and google communications because, as you know, they substantiated what i said on friday. the head of google, who's a great gentleman, said -- called us and he apologized. i don't know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace...and how that got out -- and i'm sure you'll apologize. but it would be great if we could really give the news correctly. it would be so, so wonderful. -- march 15 coronavirus press conference\n\nthe fake and corrupt news never called google. they said this was not true. even in times such as these, they are not truthful. watch for their apology, it won't happen. more importantly, thank you to google! -- march 15 tweet\n\nfacts first: google declined to comment on the substance of any call between ceo sundar pichai and the trump team, but it's not true that the press did not call google or that the press reported fake news about trump's announcement that google was helping to develop a coronavirus website, to be completed very quickly, that would determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location. journalists contacted google and accurately reported the company's initial response, which : google declined to comment on the substance of any call between ceo sundar pichai and the trump team, but it's not true that the press did not call google or that the press reported fake news about trump's announcement that google was helping to develop a coronavirus website, to be completed very quickly, that would determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location. journalists contacted google and accurately reported the company's initial response, which made clear that trump had exaggerated\n\nafter trump made the announcement, google issued a statement on behalf of its sister company verily, which said , we are developing a tool to help triage individuals for covid-19 testing. verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the bay area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time. in other words, there would be no quick national website. verily's focus was one part of california, and the entity in charge of the effort was not google itself (though verily said google engineers had volunteered to assist with the project).\n\nthen, more than 24 hours after the initial statement from verily, google issued a second statement announcing that it would itself be partnering with the us government in developing a nationwide website that includes information about covid-19 symptoms, risk and testing information.\n\nso it was fair for trump to applaud the second statement, but its existence does not mean that media reports about the first statement were inaccurate.\n\nnew york coronavirus deaths\n\nand then, when you do have a death, like you have had in the state of washington, like you had one in california -- i believe you had one in new york... -- march 4 interview with fox news' sean hannity\n\nfacts first: there had not been any new york deaths attributed to the coronavirus at the time. (the first two deaths in the state were : there had not been any new york deaths attributed to the coronavirus at the time. (the first two deaths in the state were announced on march 14, 10 days after trump spoke here.)\n\nthe coronavirus situation in italy\n\n...i hear the numbers are getting much better in italy. -- march 6 exchange with reporters after tour of the centers for disease control and prevention\n\nfacts first: the number of confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths in italy was continuing to increase at the time trump made this comment. as of saturday, march 7, the day after trump spoke here, italy had 5,883 confirmed cases and 233 deaths; as of monday, march 9, there were 9,172 cases and 463 deaths.\n\nthe coronavirus in the us and elsewhere\n\nwe have very low numbers compared to major countries throughout the world. our numbers are lower than just about anybody. -- march 6 exchange with reporters at signing of coronavirus appropriations bill\n\nfacts first: trump was exaggerating. the us did have fewer confirmed coronavirus cases than some countries, including china, italy, iran, south korea, france and germany. but it had more confirmed cases than big-population countries like india, indonesia, pakistan, brazil, russia and nigeria, plus neighbors mexico and canada, plus many other high-income countries.\n\nin addition, the number of confirmed cases is dependent on how many people are tested. the us was conducting fewer tests than some countries with much smaller populations.\n\na remark by nancy pelosi\n\nnancy pelosi just said, 'i don't know if we can be ready this week.' in other words, it's off to vacation for the do nothing democrats. that's been the story with them for 1 1/2 years! -- march 10 tweet\n\nfacts first: democrats were not going away on vacation, and pelosi was not suggesting they were. asked on monday, march 9 if her goal was to have the house pass a coronavirus relief bill this week, pelosi : democrats were not going away on vacation, and pelosi was not suggesting they were. asked on monday, march 9 if her goal was to have the house pass a coronavirus relief bill this week, pelosi said , i don't know that we can be ready this week, but we can introduce this week, we can introduce it and we may be ready this week, depending on cbo (congressional budget office), depending on (the house office of the legislative counsel) and how quickly they can get something back to us.\n\nthe house ended up passing the bill early in the morning of saturday, march 14.\n\ncanadians on the grand princess\n\nreferring to the grand princess cruise ship that had been kept in limbo over coronavirus concerns before being allowed to dock in oakland, trump said on march 10, so, the uk is taking their people, their citizens back, and canada is about 600 people; they're coming back. they're being met and brought to planes and being brought very, very -- in a very, very dignified fashion back into canada. he said on march 13, we worked with canada. they took their people back. and canada has approximately 600 people...\n\nfacts first: trump's number was wrong. there were fewer than 240 canadians on the grand princess, according to the canadian government; : trump's number was wrong. there were fewer than 240 canadians on the grand princess, according to the canadian government; 228 canadians were flown from california to a military base in ontario on a plane chartered by the canadian government.\n\npeople on the grand princess\n\ntrump said, of the grand princess cruise ship that was being kept in limbo over coronavirus concerns, we do have a situation where we have this massive ship with 5,000 people and we have to make a decision. he later amended the claim slightly, saying, it's close to 5,000 people. -- march 6 exchange with reporters at signing of coronavirus appropriations bill\n\nfacts first: trump was overstating the number of passengers on the ship. there were : trump was overstating the number of passengers on the ship. there were 3,533 people aboard : 2,422 guests and 1,111 crew members.\n\ntrump's student loan plan\n\namazing how the fake news never covers this. no interest on student loans. the dems are just talk! -- march 15 tweet\n\nborder closures\n\nin a certain way, you could say that the borders are automatically shut down, without having to say 'shut down.' i mean, they're, to a certain extent, automatically shut down. but it's affecting the airline business, as it would. and: and we have closed down certain sections of the world, frankly, and they've sort of automatically closed them also. -- march 4 remarks at briefing with airline executives\n\nfacts first: trump did not explain what he meant by the borders are automatically shut down. his travel restrictions at the time, on china and iran, did not constitute complete closures of the border; they make : trump did not explain what he meant by the borders are automatically shut down. his travel restrictions at the time, on china and iran, did not constitute complete closures of the border; they make exceptions for american citizens, permanent residents and some of their family members.\n\nthe europe restrictions and testing\n\nwhen a reporter noted that an american could bring back the coronavirus even with trump's new travel restrictions on some european countries, trump said, sure. but we have them very heavily tested. if an american is coming back or anybody is coming back, we're testing. we have a tremendous testing set up where people coming in have to be tested. -- march 12 exchange with reporters before meeting with irish prime minister leo varadkar\n\nfacts first: it's not true that americans or others returning from europe have to be tested for the coronavirus -- and no system is being set up to actually test these returning travelers.\n\ninstead, travelers are funneled to specific airports and put through an inspection known as enhanced screening, which cannot prove whether someone has the virus. previous us airport screening for the coronavirus has involved temperature checks, questions about travelers' health and travel history, and an inspection for symptoms like a cough or breathing trouble. the administration's statements about the enhanced screening for travelers from europe made no mention of coronavirus tests being conducted.\n\n(travelers returning from europe after the restrictions went into effect faced lengthy delays while awaiting screening, and hundreds were packed shoulder to shoulder even as public health officials were advising americans to keep a distance from other people. chad wolf, acting secretary of homeland security, later announced that they had fixed the problem with increasing staffing.\n\nhandshakes in india\n\nyou know, i just got back from india, and i didn't shake any hands there. and it was very easy because they go like this.

(congress ultimately allocated $7.7 billion). that same day, april 28, a centers for disease control and prevention test was cleared for use. the cdc began shipping tests across the us and around the world on may 1. between april 23 and may 31, the cdc says its influenza laboratory analyzed about 5,000 samples. in october, obama declared a national emergency to allow hospitals more flexibility for a possible flood of h1n1 patients.\n\nthe obama administration did face criticism over the pace of the government's vaccination effort, but they didn't do anything is clearly false.\n\nunemployment in pennsylvania and scranton\n\nthis area of pennsylvania, and pennsylvania itself, has the best numbers it's ever had. it's got the best economy it's ever had. it has the best unemployment numbers it's ever had. and scranton has the lowest and best unemployment numbers they've -- and employment numbers too -- that they've ever had, by far. -- march 5 fox news town hall in scranton, pennsylvania\n\nfacts first: neither the unemployment rate for pennsylvania nor the unemployment rate for the scranton area is at its lowest level ever. and both rates have crept higher over the past several months.\n\nthe pennsylvania state unemployment rate was at 4.5% in december 2019, worse than the best rates under presidents bill clinton and george w. bush. (the rate increased steadily in 2019 from the 3.8% rate in of april, may and june, which was the state's lowest rate since at least 1976.)\n\nthe december 2019 unemployment rate for the scranton/wilkes-barre/hazleton area was 5.6% -- worse than various rates under clinton and bush and also worse than the rate in obama's last full month in office, 5.4% in december 2016. it hit 4.0% in april 2019, which was the lowest for the area since at least 1990.)\n\nsocial security and medicare\n\ni must say, that was a very boring debate. biden lied when he said i want to cut social security and medicare. that's what they all said 4 years ago, and nothing happened, in fact, i saved social security and medicare. i will not be cutting, but they will. be careful! -- march 15 tweet\n\nfacts first: trump simply did not save social security and medicare, which still face uncertain financial futures, and there is no evidence democrats intend to cut either program. also, biden did not lie when he accused trump of wanting to cut social security and medicare: trump's 2020 budget proposal includes : trump simply did not save social security and medicare, which still face uncertain financial futures, and there is no evidence democrats intend to cut either program. also, biden did not lie when he accused trump of wanting to cut social security and medicare: trump's 2020 budget proposal includes cuts to medicare spending and spending on social security's disability insurance and supplemental security income programs.\n\ntrump's budget is a request to congress, not a law, so the cuts may not happen. and republicans are free to note that the proposed cuts would reduce projected future spending, but not be reductions from the current level of spending. still, biden had a reasonable factual basis for saying what he did.\n\n(trump also told fox news earlier in march that we'll be cutting entitlement programs, though he did not say which ones. his press secretary claimed he was talking about cutting deficits, not entitlements when he said we'll be cutting, though he had been asked, but if you don't cut something in entitlements, you'll never really deal with the debt.)\n\ntrade with japan\n\ni just made a deal with japan where they're paying $40 billion. they never gave us anything. all they do is sell us cars for no tax coming into the -- to the country. -- march 5 fox news town hall in scranton, pennsylvania\n\nfacts first: japan does not export cars to the us for no tax; the us has a : japan does not export cars to the us for no tax; the us has a 2.5% tariff on japanese cars. it's obviously untrue that japan never gave us anything, whatever trump meant by that vague phrase; japan purchased $120.4 billion in us exports in 2018, according to government data . and experts say that the 2019 deal between the us and japan does not include a $40 billion payment from japan.\n\nin prepared remarks in october, trump himself said the deal sets standards on the $40 billion in digital trade between the united states and japan. in other words, he suggested himself that it contained provisions addressing $40 billion in trade, not that it was a $40 billion payment.\n\njapan is not paying $40 billion dollars to the united states as part of the mini trade deal, mireya solis, director of the center for east asia policy studies at the brookings institution think tank, said in an email. she added: us-japan digital trade is worth $40 billion, but again that does not mean japan is paying the us that amount.\n\nmatthew goodman, senior vice president and senior adviser for asian economics at the center for strategic and international studies think tank, said there are no hard numbers or commitments in the us-japan deal to support that figure, as far as i know.\n\nchina and drugs\n\nwhen you go to a country where they have very, very stringent — unbelievably stringent, like probably we can't do in our country — they have no drug problem. you go into china, you say, 'how's your drug problem?' they don't even know — president xi doesn't even know what you're talking about. 'we have no drug problem.' they have quick trials. right? quick trials. and i won't even tell you what the punishment is, but let me just say it's very swift. -- march 3 speech to the national association of counties legislative conference\n\nfacts first: it is simply not true that china has no drug problem, though trump did not define what he meant by drug problem. joe amon, director of global health at drexel university and a clinical professor of community health and prevention, said the statement is definitively false. ann fordham, executive director of the international drug policy consortium, a global network of non-governmental organizations, said, there is so much data that refutes this claim from trump.\n\nfordham noted that the us state department released a report this very month that said china has a drug problem.in the report's words: while drug trafficking, manufacturing, diversion, and other drug-related crimes remain significant problems in (china), the central government continues to take steps to integrate the prc into regional and global drug control efforts, as well as to address the country's domestic drug problem through enforcement and rehabilitation. amon noted that china's own official figures, as of 2017, listed about 2.5 million people registered as drug addicts. a 2016 report from the brookings institution noted that the number of registered addicts had increased every year since the government's first annual drug enforcement report in 1998.\n\nthe new york times reported in 2015 that it was widely acknowledged that the official numbers understated the extent of the problem. the times reported : in october, liu yuejin, director general of the government's anti-narcotics division, estimated the actual number of addicts at roughly 13 million.\n\nrepeats\n\nhere are the repeat false claims we have previously included in one of these roundups:\n\nukraine and impeachment\n\nthe whistleblower\n\ntrump called the whistleblower who complained about his dealings with ukraine a phony whistleblower and claimed this person had described a call that didn't exist. -- march 5 fox news town hall in scranton, pennsylvania\n\nfacts first: the whistleblower's account of trump's july call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky has been proven substantially accurate. in fact, the rough transcript trump released showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. you can read a full fact check : the whistleblower's account of trump's july call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky has been proven substantially accurate. in fact, the rough transcript trump released showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. you can read a full fact check here\n\nhunter biden's career\n\ntrump claimed that, before democratic presidential candidate joe biden's son hunter biden was appointed to the board of directors of ukrainian natural gas company burisma holdings, hunter biden didn't have a job. -- march 5 fox news town hall in scranton, pennsylvania\n\nfacts first: at the time hunter biden was appointed to the board of burisma in 2014, he was a : at the time hunter biden was appointed to the board of burisma in 2014, he was a lawyer at the firm boies schiller flexner, an adjunct professor at georgetown university's foreign service program, chairman of the board of world food program usa, and chief executive officer and chairman of rosemont seneca advisors, an investment advisory firm. he also served on other boards.\n\nbefore joe biden became vice president in 2009, hunter biden, who graduated from yale law school, worked as a lobbyist. he became a partner at a law and lobbying firm in 2001. (he stopped lobbying late in the 2008 election.) before that, he had worked for financial services company mbna, rising to senior vice president and worked for the us commerce department.\n\nnone of this is to say that hunter biden's name was not a factor in the burisma appointment; hunter biden has acknowledged that he would probably not have been asked to be on the board if he were not a biden. but trump's repeat portrayal of him as an unemployed man is inaccurate.\n\neconomy\n\nprescription drug prices\n\ntrump claimed that last year was the first time in 51 years that drug prices, prescription, have come down. -- march 2 exchange with reporters at meeting with colombian president iván duque\n\nfacts first: the decline -- shown in the consumer price index, but not some other measures -- happened in 2018, not last year. and trump was exaggerating how long it had been since the 2018 decline; it had been 46 years, not 51. (this may seem like a small exaggeration, but it is habitual; he has made it more than a dozen times since july 8. you can read a longer fact check : the decline -- shown in the consumer price index, but not some other measures -- happened in 2018, not last year. and trump was exaggerating how long it had been since the 2018 decline; it had been 46 years, not 51.

(the net gain during the 2003-2005 period, also under bush, was 940,000.)\n\nmedian household income and energy\n\nmedian household income has hit the highest level ever recorded. if you look back and you go to president bush, it's $450. if you go to president obama -- and that's for eight years, remember. if you go to president obama, for eight years, $975. and if you go to president donald john trump, over a period of three years, it's almost $10,000. that's a big difference. -- march 3 speech to the national association of counties legislative conference\n\nfacts first: it's not true that median household income gains under trump were almost $10,000 in three years. a firm called sentier research says real median household income, pre-tax, was $65,666 in december 2019 -- up from $61,496 (in inflation-adjusted december 2019 dollars) in january 2017, a difference of $4,170. trump habitually adds an additional $5,000-plus on account of his loosening of regulations and supposed energy savings, but these explanations do not make sense mathematically.\n\nyou can read a longer fact check here\n\nivanka trump and jobs\n\nwe're also promoting workforce development through our pledge to america's workers. four hundred and thirty companies have already committed to providing new jobs and training opportunities to over 15 million americans. and i give my daughter, ivanka, a lot of credit for that ... she started off with 500,000 jobs, and she just broke 15 million. -- march 3 speech to the national association of counties legislative conference\n\nfacts first: ivanka trump has obviously not created more than 15 million jobs. before the coronavirus crisis, roughly 7 million jobs had been created during the entire trump presidency.\n\ntrump was referring to the white house's pledge to america's workers initiative, in which ivanka trump has sought to get companies to commit to providing education and training opportunities for workers. as of march 19, 2020, companies had promised to create 15.7 million opportunities, including one million by walmart alone -- but many of these opportunities are internal training programs, not new jobs. also, as cnn has previously reported , many of the companies had already planned these opportunities before ivanka trump launched the initiative.\n\nunemployment\n\nbest unemployment numbers in the history of our country. -- march 10 tweet\n\nfacts first: trump was exaggerating, though the february unemployment rate was indeed impressive.\n\nthe rate, 3.5%, was tied with september, november and december 2019 for the lowest since 1969. but it was not the best ever: it was substantially higher than the record 2.5% set in 1953 . (unemployment is expected to worsen substantially in march as a result of the coronavirus crisis.)\n\nunemployment for women\n\ntrump said women had the lowest unemployment rate in 71 years.=- march 4 interview with fox news' sean hannity\n\nfacts first: this was another of trump's : this was another of trump's regular little exaggerations of an impressive accomplishment. it had been between 66 and 67 years, not 71 years, since the women's unemployment rate had been as low as it was in february, 3.4% ; it hit that level in late 1953. (it was also 3.4% during previous months of trump's presidency, but we'll ignore those here for fairness to trump.)\n\nunemployment rates are expected to rise substantially in march as a result of the coronavirus crisis\n\nan lng plant in louisiana\n\ni opened up lng plants in louisiana where they were for years -- for 10, 12, 14 years and longer -- trying to get permits. they couldn't get permits. i got them built: a $10 billion plant in louisiana... -- march 5 fox news town hall in scranton, pennsylvania\n\nfacts first: the $10 billion lng facility trump visited in louisiana in 2019 was : the $10 billion lng facility trump visited in louisiana in 2019 was granted its key permits under obama , and its construction also began under obama. federal regulators have approved other multi-billion-dollar lng facilities for louisiana under trump, but they had not been waiting anywhere close to 10 or 14 years for approval.\n\nthe estate tax\n\ntrump falsely claimed to have eliminated the estate tax. -- march 2 campaign rally in charlotte, north carolina\n\nfacts first: trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. his 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but did not get rid of the tax entirely.\n\nforeign affairs\n\nvenezuela's wealth\n\nthe tragedy in venezuela is a reminder that socialism and communism bring misery and heartache everywhere they're tried. i remember so many years ago -- 20, less -- it was the wealthiest country. -- march 4 speech to the latino coalition legislative summit\n\nfacts first: venezuela was not the wealthiest country in latin america 20 years ago, as trump has claimed previously, and certainly not one of the wealthiest countries in the world, as trump has also claimed previously. (trump didn't say this time which one he meant.)\n\nvenezuela was one of the richest countries in the world 60 years ago. the richest in latin america 40 years ago. but not 20 years ago, ricardo hausmann, a former venezuelan planning minister and central bank board member, said in response to a previous version of the claim.\n\nvenezuela's per capita gross domestic product in 2000 ($4,824) was lower than that of argentina ($8,387), mexico ($7,016), uruguay ($6,817) and chile ($5,072).\n\nthe mexican border\n\nwe have, right now, 27,000 mexican soldiers on our border. -- march 5 fox news town hall in scranton, pennsylvania\n\nfacts first: mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the us border in particular; mexico's defense minister : mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the us border in particular; mexico's defense minister said in october that it was about 15,000 on the us border, about 12,000 on mexico's own southern border.\n\nthe soviet union and afghanistan\n\ntalking about the history of war in afghanistan, trump said the soviet union became russia because of afghanistan. you know, it's a tough place. -- march 5 fox news town hall in scranton, pennsylvania\n\nfacts first: this was an exaggeration. experts : this was an exaggeration. experts say the soviet union's failed afghanistan war was far from the only reason for its collapse, though the war did contribute.\n\ntrump and the invasion of iraq\n\nand i was always against iraq -- going into iraq. i think it was one of the worst -- maybe the worst decision ever made. -- march 5 fox news town hall in scranton, pennsylvania\n\nfacts first: trump was tentatively supportive of the war in iraq when radio host howard stern asked him in september 2002, are you for invading iraq? trump responded: yeah, i guess so. i wish the first time it was done correctly. the day after the invasion in march 2003, he said, it looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint. trump did not offer a definitive position on the looming war in a fox news interview in january 2003, saying, either you attack or don't attack.\n\ntrump started publicly questioning the war later in 2003, and he was an explicit opponent in 2004. you can read a full fact check here\n\ndemocrats\n\ndemocrats and cars\n\nif you like automobiles, how can you vote for a democrat who all want to get rid of cars, as quickly as possible, especially if they are powered by gasoline. remember also, no more than one car per family. -- march 10 tweet\n\nfacts first: the democrats are not proposing any limits on the number of cars a family could own. (trump has previously claimed, falsely, that this one-car limit is included in the democrats' green new deal environmental proposal.) and while some prominent democrats, such as presidential candidate joe biden, want to implement policies they believe will reduce the number of cars on the road, they are not proposing to get rid of cars by any kind of government prohibition. biden, for example, : the democrats are not proposing any limits on the number of cars a family could own. (trump has previously claimed, falsely, that this one-car limit is included in the democrats' green new deal environmental proposal.) and while some prominent democrats, such as presidential candidate joe biden, want to implement policies they believe will reduce the number of cars on the road, they are not proposing to get rid of cars by any kind of government prohibition. biden, for example, argues that a major expansion of high-speed rail would result in millions fewer automobiles being driven.\n\nthe green new deal proposal calls for overhauling transportation systems in the united states to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail.\n\nobama and kim jong un\n\ntrump discussed a conversation he claimed he had with president barack obama about north korea and its leader kim jong un. trump said, and i have a good relationship with him (kim). i said (to obama), 'did you ever call him?' the answer is: yes, he did. but i will tell you, i don't think they admit that; maybe they do. but called many times, and kim jong un did not want to talk to him. -- march 5 fox news town hall in scranton, pennsylvania\n\nfacts first: there is no evidence that obama called kim even once. this is a total fabrication, susan rice, who served as obama's national security adviser, : there is no evidence that obama called kim even once. this is a total fabrication, susan rice, who served as obama's national security adviser, said on twitter in response to a previous version of this trump claim. obama never called kim. not once, ben rhodes, former deputy national security adviser to obama, said on twitter after this new claim on march 5. there's also no evidence for trump's previous claim that obama begged kim for a meeting.\n\nobama and the 1994 crime bill\n\nafter touting the criminal justice reform bill he signed in 2018, trump appeared to criticize the 1994 crime bill signed into law by president bill clinton and supported by then-senator joe biden -- and suggested barack obama, who was not yet in elected office of any kind, had something to do with it: and, again, this was a biden/obama law that was -- this was -- and, obviously, it was -- it was really a hillary -- this was a bill clinton and a hillary. and it was -- i guess biden was a senator then and pushing it hard. obama was -- somebody said he was talking about it, but he had to be pretty young, if that were the case. -- march 4 interview with fox news' sean hannity\n\nfacts first: trump seemed to realize partway through this claim that it did not make sense to blame obama for a bill signed into law before obama was even elected to the illinois state senate -- but even though he eventually conceded obama was pretty young at the time, he did not make clear that obama had nothing at all to do with the bill.\n\naccomplishments and promises\n\nveterans choice\n\ntrump twice claimed to have gotten the veterans choice health care program passed into law. on one occasion, he said others had tried to do so for over 40 years. on the other, he said they had tried for almost 50 years.\n\nfacts first: the veterans choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators bernie sanders and the late john mccain, was signed into law by barack obama : the veterans choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators bernie sanders and the late john

overdose deaths have declined for the first time in 31 years or in nearly 31 years.\n\nfacts first: this was yet another of trump's signature exaggerations of numbers that are already impressive. there was a rare decline in overdose deaths in 2018, according to preliminary : this was yet another of trump's signature exaggerations of numbers that are already impressive. there was a rare decline in overdose deaths in 2018, according to preliminary data from the us centers for disease control and prevention's national center for health statistics -- but it was the first in since 1990, or 28 years ago, not 31 or nearly 31 years ago.\n\npre-existing conditions\n\nwe are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will. -- march 3 speech to the national association of counties legislative conference\n\npre-existing conditions: 100%, we take care of. -- march 5 fox news town hall in scranton, pennsylvania\n\nfacts first: the trump administration has repeatedly supported the trump administration has repeatedly supported bills that would weaken obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. trump is currently supporting a republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of obamacare void. he has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds, though he promised again at the town hall that republicans would have one.\n\nair quality\n\nnobody has done more in three years, the first three years, than we have. now environmentally, we're -- we have the cleanest air. we have the cleanest water. our air is as clean or cleaner than it's ever been. -- march 4 interview with fox news' sean hannity\n\nand i say very simply: i want to have the cleanest air on the planet. i want to have the most crystal clear, beautiful water on the planet. and our conditions now are much better than they were three years ago. -- march 5 fox news town hall in scranton, pennsylvania\n\nfacts first: by several : by several measures , us air was cleaner under obama than it has been under trump. three of the six types of pollutants identified by the clean air act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before trump took office, according to environmental protection agency data. there were more unhealthy air days for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016, and researchers from carnegie mellon university who studied environmental protection agency data found that air pollution increased between 2016 and 2018.\n\ntrade and china\n\nchuck schumer and the china deal\n\nor i watch schumer ... if you say, how great is the deal with china, oh, i don't like it, i don't like it. he said, 'he took away tariffs.' well, i didn't take away the tariffs. they're paying 25 percent of $250 billion. they pay us a tariff of 25 percent on $250 billion. but he was screaming, he took away the tariffs. you know, he didn't want the tariffs. and then, all of a sudden, when he thinks they were taken away -- but we didn't take them away. just the opposite. -- march 4 interview with fox news' sean hannity\n\nfacts first: trump's deal with china reduces, though does not eliminate, some of the us tariffs on imported chinese products. schumer accurately described the tariff changes in a january : trump's deal with china reduces, though does not eliminate, some of the us tariffs on imported chinese products. schumer accurately described the tariff changes in a january letter in which he argued that trump had given away leverage with a temporary deal of some reduced tariffs in exchange for american goods and vague promises of reform.\n\nafter trump made a previous version of this accusation on january 15, schumer responded the same day: i know what's in the deal. i'm not sure the president does. if he knows what's in the deal -- he should throw it away and take china back to the negotiating table. i will cheer him on if he does.\n\nchina's agricultural spending\n\ntrump said of chinese agricultural purchases: you know, the highest ever was $16 billion. -- march 3 speech to the national association of counties legislative conference\n\nfacts first: sixteen billion in chinese agriculture purchases is not the record: china spent $25.9 billion on american agricultural products in 2012, according to figures from the department of agriculture.\n\nwho's paying for trump's tariffs on china\n\ntrump claimed that revenue from his tariffs on imported chinese products is paid for by china and that it is money from china. -- march 3 speech to the national association of counties legislative conference\n\nchina is paying us billions and billions of dollars because of what i did to them with tariffs. billions of dollars. -- march 5 fox news town hall in scranton, pennsylvania\n\nfacts first: study after study has shown that americans are bearing the cost of the tariffs. and it is americans who make the actual tariff payments.\n\nthe trade deficit with china\n\ntrump claimed that the us used to have $500 billion a year trade deficits with china. -- march 3 speech to the

(cnn) deval patrick , the former massachusetts governor who in november made a late entrance into the democratic 2020 race, ended his campaign on wednesday, according to a statement provided to cnn.\n\ni believed and still believe we had a strong case to make for being able to deliver better outcomes, patrick said. but the vote in new hampshire last night was not enough for us to create the practical wind at the campaign's back to go on to the next round of voting. so i have decided to suspend the campaign, effective immediately.\n\nhe added: i am not suspending my commitment to help -- there is still work to be done. we are facing the most consequential election of our lifetime. our democracy itself, let alone our civic commitments to equality, opportunity and fair play, are at risk.\n\nthe announcement comes after patrick, by getting less than 1,300 votes, turned in a disappointing performance on tuesday night in new hampshire, his neighboring state.\n\na disheartened patrick told supporters on tuesday night that he and his wife needed to go home and rest and reflect on this outcome and make some decisions tomorrow morning about what the future of this campaign can and should be.\n\nno matter whether it is a candidate for president, or as a public citizen. i'm going to stay involved, patrick said. no matter what decision we make tomorrow morning about the practical ability of this campaign to continue. i'm going to stay involved, and so must you.\n\nthat conversation led patrick to decide to end his campaign. he will email his supporters later on wednesday to explain his decision.\n\npatrick had skipped the iowa caucuses and pinned his hopes on stronger-than-expected performances in new hampshire and south carolina as the democratic field winnowed.\n\nhis hope: regional connections in new england, and his appeal as the last african american candidate in southern states where black voters make up the majority of the democratic electorate, would lead voters to give him a late look.\n\nbut, in the end, he was merely a blip in new hampshire, overshadowed by the top-tier candidates.\n\npatrick's campaign underscored the difficulty of jumping into a presidential race months after other campaigns had begun raising money, hiring staffers, recruiting volunteers and developing policy platforms.\n\nhe'd hired some staffers, including campaign manager abe rakov, who had just departed former texas rep. beto o'rourke's campaign after o'rourke withdrew from the race.\n\nand he raised $2.2 million in the first six weeks of his campaign.\n\nphotos: former presidential candidate deval patrick deval patrick gives a speech in october 2013 while serving as governor of massachusetts. he served two terms from

president joe biden has a long list of health care promises -- many of which center on reversing policies enacted by the trump administration over the past four years.\n\nhowever, it will take the president's health officials time to address all of the measures, particularly as battling the coronavirus pandemic remains the top immediate priority. some items would be easy to undo, but others involve regulations and waivers that can't simply be voided. and some would need approval from congress, which would be a challenge because biden can't afford to lose a single democrat in the senate -- and few in the house, after his party lost seats in the chamber.\n\nalso, lawmakers have yet to confirm xavier becerra, biden's pick for health and human services secretary, and the president has yet to name his administrator for the centers for medicare and medicaid services, who will play a central role in putting his agenda into place.\n\nhere's what's on biden's health care checklist:\n\nsaving and strengthening the affordable care act: the central theme of biden's health care campaign, prior to the pandemic, was improving the affordable care act. though the central theme of biden's health care campaign, prior to the pandemic, was improving the affordable care act. though former president donald trump did not succeed in achieving his key 2016 pledge to repeal the law, his health officials made a multitude of changes to it. reversing those will keep biden's team busy.\n\namong the top priorities will likely be saving the law itself from being declared unconstitutional by the supreme court. the justices are currently considering a case brought of a coalition of republican state attorneys general -- and backed by the trump administration. it revolves around congress reducing the penalty for not having health insurance to zero several years ago, which the states argue rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional and the entire law invalid\n\nthe case will continue even if the justice department under biden withdraws, because it originated with texas and other republican-led states. but the president-elect could work with the new democratic majority in congress to short circuit the gop states' legal argument -- by setting the penalty at a $1, for instance.\n\nas for shoring up and building on the affordable care act, biden has plans big and small.\n\npublic option and making federal subsidies more generous -- would require congressional action. he's already tucked his goal of expanding obamacare's subsidies so no one pays more than 8.5% of his or her income for coverage into the two of his campaign promises -- instituting a government-backedpublic option and making federal subsidies more generous -- would require congressional action. he's already tucked his goal of expanding obamacare's subsidies so no one pays more than 8.5% of his or her income for coverage into the economic relief package he unveiled last week.\n\nbut there are many measures that would be an easier lift. they could restore the annual open enrollment period to three months, which it was before the trump administration cut it to six weeks. and they could increase funding for marketing and enrollment assistance, both of which were deeply slashed in recent years. and they could pull back on allowing private brokers to advise consumers looking for policies, which trump officials pushed.\n\nsomewhat more involved would be reversing various measures the trump administration put in place to chip away at the affordable care act. these include broadening the duration of short-term health plans to a year, and, more recently, allowing georgia to stop using the federal exchange , healthcare.gov, and shift to a private sector model instead. the centers for medicare and medicaid services went a step further in recent weeks, establishing a pathway for all states to do this for 2023.\n\nbiden may also want to institute a special enrollment period for obamacare to allow the uninsured to sign up, which trump refused to do last year.\n\nbolstering medicaid: the trump administration made many historic changes to the health insurance program for low-income americans, in line with republicans' long-standing wish list. officials allowed states to the trump administration made many historic changes to the health insurance program for low-income americans, in line with republicans' long-standing wish list. officials allowed states to introduce work requirements and just approved tennessee's request to shift its federal medicaid funding to a type of block grant.\n\nthe supreme court recently agreed to consider the approval of work requirements in arkansas and new hampshire, which were voided by lower courts.\n\nthese measures run counter to biden's promise to expand access to medicaid so his administration is expected to seek to limit or undo these waivers during his term, as well as possibly restore the criteria on waivers' impact on increasing coverage.\n\nalso, congress has limited states' ability to trim their medicaid rolls during the public health emergency. the biden administration may want to continue some of those provisions after it ends.\n\nchanging abortion policy: the biden administration is also moving to revamp federal abortion policy by rescinding a slew of restrictions implemented over the past four years.\n\nbiden is set on thursday to revoke the trump administration rule blocking federally funded health care providers in the title x family planning program from referring patients for abortions.\n\non the health insurance front, the incoming administration is expected to reinstitute guidance that states cannot bar medicaid funds from going to qualified providers that also provide abortion-related services, such as planned parenthood. medicaid funding does not cover abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or when the woman's life is at risk, due to the 1976 hyde amendment.\n\nbiden has pledged to protect roe v. wade , the 1973 landmark supreme court decision legalizing abortion nationwide prior to viability, which can occur at around 24 weeks of pregnancy. he has also indicated that his administration's justice department will seek to combat state laws restricting abortion access , such as requirements for parental notification, waiting periods, and ultrasounds.\n\nbiden appears unlikely to enforce a recent move by trump officials to withhold $200 million in medicaid funding from california in the first quarter of 2021 due to the state's requirement that state insurance companies provide abortion insurance coverage.\n\nthe administration is also not expected to pursue trump-era federal regulations that have been blocked by the courts, including measures that would have required insurers on the obamacare exchanges that cover abortions to issue separate bills for that coverage , and the so-called conscience rule, which would have let health care workers who cite moral or religious reasons opt out of providing certain medical procedures , such as abortion, sterilization and assisted suicide.\n\nreducing drug costs: like many presidents, including trump, biden has promised to lower drug costs. among his preferred ways is to allow medicare to negotiate prices, which is also favored by the democratic-led house. but actually putting this into law would be a massive undertaking in congress.\n\nit remains to be seen what biden's department of health and human services will do with them.\n\nbiden also supports allowing consumers to import prescription drugs from other countries.\n\naugmenting transgender health care rights: the trump administration moved last year to nix an the trump administration moved last year to nix an obama-era regulation prohibiting discrimination in health care against patients who are transgender, but a federal judge later blocked the repeal.\n\nwith the rule still in place, biden could try to reinforce it by issuing a new, more targeted rule that specifically prohibits that type of discrimination, going a step further than the department did in its 2016 regulation.\n\nthe incoming administration has also promised to take action on lgbtq mental health services, something that will be key for members of the transgender community, which sees uniquely high rates of suicide attempts.
(cnn) former president donald trump may be gone from the white house but his legacy of catastrophic mistrust is poisoning washington , dimming hopes of a unified effort to crush the pandemic before mutant viral strains take root.\n\nnine days after newly sworn-in president joe biden told america that every disagreement doesn't have to be a cause for total war, recriminations between the parties and the republican meltdown are consuming congress.\n\nit's now clear that the january 6 mob attack on capitol hill, while failing in its bid to reverse trump's election loss, has utterly fractured the basic level of trust needed to make a political system function — at a critical national moment.\n\nin the quarter century of bitter political battles since former speaker newt gingrich's republican revolution , washington has never been this inflamed.\n\nat times on thursday, it appeared that the whole of congress was fixated on its own civil wars, cut off from behind its high iron fence from the reality of america's darkest modern winter.\n\nand with more than 432,000 americans dead from covid-19 and the economy in ruins, hopes are fading -- amid the acrimony -- of a bipartisan effort to beef up the crucial vaccine drive.\n\nthe magnitude of that death toll has much to do with trump's neglect when he was in office. the tumultuous forces now rocking capitol hill are, in most cases, linked to trump or the extremism of his acolytes who have fully bought into his alternative reality that rejected truth and democracy itself.\n\nin an extraordinary comment on thursday, house speaker nancy pelosi warned of the enemy within in an apparent reference to some pro-trump republicans.\n\nwe have members of congress who want to bring guns on the floor and have threatened violence on other members of congress, pelosi said.\n\ngiven the urgency of getting every american -- regardless of party -- a vaccine before the pandemic mounts another deadly wave, it might have been expected that the republican house leader would be locked in negotiations.\n\nbut kevin mccarthy was in florida, paying homage to the ex-president , paving the way for trump's political comeback and effectively launching the 2022 midterm election campaign.\n\nthe make-up session means mccarthy is pinning his hopes of winning the house majority next year on the trump base and an aggressive political effort by the former president. far from being ostracized for trying to destroy democracy, trump is yet again dictating its future.\n\ntrump is still a hero to his base, but since he just comprehensively lost a national election, mccarthy is taking a gamble. in the shorter term, his genuflection means that with the house gop in thrall to the former president and his vengeful instincts, republicans will be even less ready to work with biden on critical efforts to respond to the pandemic.\n\n'you almost had me murdered'\n\nadding to the sense of unchained uproar, the republican party is eating its own. trump protege, rep. matt gaetz of florida, flew to wyoming thursday to lead a revolt against no. 3 house republican leader liz cheney, who -- in a vote of conscience -- voted to impeach the former president over the mob assault.\n\nit is extraordinary that the only senior republican in danger of being toppled over the insurrection that has been forgotten or excused by many republican leaders is cheney, an authentic and lifelong conservative.\n\nrank-and-file democrats, meanwhile, are pushing an attempt to expel newly elected rep. marjorie taylor greene, who has supported the fringe conspiracy movement qanon, following a report by cnn's kfile that before running for office she supported calls for the assassination of democratic leaders on social media.\n\ngreene, a georgia republican, is an enthusiastic supporter of trump and in a town hall meeting on thursday night repeated lies that the election was stolen from the ex-president who has endorsed her several times.\n\nin another sign of the toxicity paralyzing congress, house democratic rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york lashed out at texas sen. ted cruz , who had appeared to agree with her on the need for an investigation probing chaos on wall street. the new york democrat, who has said she felt her life was in danger during the insurrection, tweeted that you almost had me murdered. just before a pro-trump mob stormed the capitol, cruz had objected to the certification of arizona's electoral votes, embracing the baseless allegations from trump of an improper election.\n\nthe acidic mood in congress is also caused by the chasm on whether to punish the ex-president for inciting the riot.\n\nrepublican disinterest in holding the former president accountable for the insurrection in his impeachment trial starting next month is eroding the already tenuous effectiveness of the 50-50 senate.\n\nand in a previously unthinkable suggestion, the acting chief of the capitol police proposed a permanent fence around the capitol. not even the terrorist attacks on september 11 led to proposals for such draconian security measures.\n\ncalm reigns at the white house\n\nthe pandemonium on capitol hill contrasts with the methodical calm that now prevails at 1600 pennsylvania avenue just over a week into biden's presidency.\n\nthe president doggedly pressed ahead with his effort to rollback trump's political program on thursday, signing an executive order that will expand access to obamacare, the health care law trump tried to destroy.\n\nincredibly, given the circumstances, biden still believes that he can get republicans and democrats on board with his pandemic rescue bill, though has signaled he may be ready to negotiate the $1.9 trillion price tag.\n\nhe continues to believe that this can be -- should be and will be a bipartisan bill ... and he's having conversations with and listening to leaders and members of both parties to assure that we get to exactly that place, white house press secretary jen psaki said.\n\nbut there are increasing signs of impatience among democratic leaders on capitol hill , suggesting that time may be quickly running out for the new president to put a bipartisan veneer on the bill.\n\nwe want to work with our republican colleagues to advance this legislation in bipartisan way, but the work must move forward, preferably with our republican colleagues, but without them if we must, senate democratic majority leader chuck schumer said.\n\npelosi also signaled that she was ready to use a procedural device known as reconciliation to swiftly pass a bill to boost vaccine supplies, alleviate the housing crisis and extend unemployment benefits if republicans didn't sign on.\n\nthe president has announced an ambitious bid to completely overhaul the faltering vaccine distribution effort left over by the previous administration. but the plan is contingent on a huge boost in funding that only congress can provide. while hospitalizations and new cases of covid-19 have fallen across the country, the baseline is still highly elevated. many medical experts are concerned that mutations of the virus that are more transmissible, slightly more deadly and may be more resistant to vaccines could soon become dominant and trigger another wave of sickness and death. two cases of one of those variants, first detected in south africa, were found in south carolina, officials said thursday. the discovery was so worrying because biden said this week that it will be the end of the summer before all americans get the vaccine.\n\ndr. michael osterholm, director of the center for infectious disease research and policy at the university of minnesota and an informal adviser to biden's coronavirus team, warned of the darkest of days ahead.\n\nwhat we can expect to see in the course of the next, i think, six to 14 weeks, is something that we haven't even come close to experiencing yet, osterholm said on cnn's new day.\n\nthat's not a message that is breaking through on capitol hill.

trump tweeted earlier this month as he took flak for reneging on a major campaign promise.\n\nand beyond the diplomatic implications, trump has also had to confront the reality that china long ago stopped artificially devaluing its currency – instead working to prop it up, which benefits us exports.\n\n02:30 - source: cnn parallels between trump and nixon?\n\nbruising start\n\nbut trump and his white house did not come to learn the limitations of his presidency and the realities of governing until after the bruising first weeks of his presidency.\n\nwhite house officials' meticulous review of the language of a potential executive order on nafta followed the administration's early stumbles as it eagerly sought to implement another one of the trump's biggest campaign promises: banning travel from muslim-majority, terrorist-prone countries.\n\nthe initial salvo on that ban came within days of trump's inauguration and with little consultation with government agencies that would typically be consulted. the result was chaos at airports worldwide and the detention of muslims at us airports who had valid visas and even green cards to travel to and stay in the us.\n\ntrump has also struggled to make good on his core campaign promise of repealing and replacing obamacare with something much better amid disagreements between warring factions of the republican party. and amid his quest to get a bill passed as soon as possible, trump failed to help bridge those differences and was forced to accept a loss, canceling a scheduled vote on the house floor.\n\ntrump has sought to sidestep his difficulties on the legislative front with a slew of executive orders, but a person close to the white house acknowledged wednesday that they were no substitute for legislation.\n\nthey let you take action, the person said of the orders. it doesn't take place of something statutory.\n\n02:14 - source: cnn one moment from each of trump's first days\n\nfight continues\n\nbut even as trump is learning the lessons of governing and confronting the headwinds – diplomatic, economic and political – he faces as he tries to implement his hard-charging agenda, he is showing no signs of letting up.\n\na person close to trump vowed trump will only ramp up his actions on trade – still searching to make good in bold fashion on trump's campaign rhetoric.\n\nnafta as we know it today will change. it just is, the person close to the white house and trump said. it's just not going to stay the way it is. it's going to be different.\n\ntrump displayed the same bravado on nafta thursday morning as he did on the campaign trail, despite backing down on a potential nafta withdrawal just the night before.\n\nnafta has been a horrible deal for the united states. it's been very good for canada, it's been very good for mexico, but it's been horrible for the united states, trump said thursday from the oval office, as if he were still rallying supporters on the campaign trail.\n\ncnn's jim acosta and jeff zeleny contributed to this report.
(cnn) the white house is keenly aware of the republican objections that have arisen to president joe biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal , but they are urging democratic allies to be patient for the moment, according to two administration officials.\n\nbiden has spent the last several days on the phone with lawmakers in both parties, and his team has started a blitz in recent days not only to walk through the proposal with lawmakers and staff, but also listen to their concerns and potential proposed changes.\n\none key meeting between national economic council director brian deese and a group of 16 bipartisan senators will take place on sunday. but more are planned -- and biden himself is expected to be an active player in the days and weeks ahead.\n\nthe president has made clear to his team that we should be reaching out to members of congress from both parties to make the case for the rescue and engage with them and understand their concerns, deese told reporters during a briefing on friday.\n\nit all underscores the message from the top -- the preferred route is a bipartisan one, and biden still believes there is a pathway to at least 10 gop votes for a relief proposal. what that proposal looks like, however, is obviously subject to negotiation, one official said. in other words, the $1.9 trillion proposal is an opening bid.\n\nthey know they aren't going to get everything in their proposal, one democratic official who has worked on the measure told cnn. that's the point here -- it's supposed to be a negotiation.\n\nbut growing increasingly antsy about prospects for a bipartisan deal, senate democrats have been laying the groundwork to use a rare procedural tactic known as reconciliation to pass major parts of the covid-19 relief package if republicans stand in the way, according to multiple democratic aides.\n\nwhile leadership has yet to give the go ahead publicly and negotiations with republicans are still getting started, aides tell cnn that the process is complicated and arcane, which is why they are getting ready now in case they have to use it.\n\nyou just can't do this overnight, one democratic senate aide said referring to why the process is already starting.\n\nand more directly, house speaker nancy pelosi told donors on a zoom call thursday that she wanted to pass the covid relief bill in two weeks using budget reconciliation, a source familiar told cnn.\n\nwhile the biden administration's first goal is to pass its nearly $2 trillion plan with bipartisan support through the regular senate process, the odds are long for winning over enough republicans to pass another massive stimulus bill just months after a more than $900 billion package passed the senate in december. already, many republicans have signaled they think the package is too expensive or even unnecessary at this point.\n\nwe just passed $900 billion worth of assistance why we would have a package that big now? maybe a couple of months from now, sen. susan collins, a moderate republican from maine, said. the needs will be evident, and we will need to do something significant. but i'm not seeing it right now.\n\nfor their part, the biden administration has started to meet with republicans they've identified as potentially supporting the package in an effort to build support.\n\ni had a pretty good walkthrough of their covid proposal, republican sen. lisa murkowski of alaska, who is up for reelection in 2022, told reporters earlier this week. it was an opportunity for me to ask some questions.\n\nbut biden's team has publicly made clear they aren't willing to take any tools off the table -- a direct reference to the budget procedure that would allow them to move forward with a simple majority.\n\nit's a moment that requires decisive action to beat this pandemic and support the economic recovery that americans need, deese said.\n\nbehind the scenes, lawmakers recognize time is of the essence and are preparing to work through reconciliation if they have to. chairs of the house and senate budget committee have not been shy about talking publicly about their plans.\n\nthe caucus would prefer this be done on a bipartisan basis. we haven't made a decision yet to use reconciliation, but we are prepared to move very quickly if it looks like we can't do it any other way, rep. john yarmuth, a democrat from kentucky and the chairman of the house's budget committee, said thursday.\n\nhours later, sen. bernie sanders, the chair of the senate budget committee, told nbc's seth meyers that the first goal was to try to reach out to republicans, but he argued they couldn't wait for them to come along.\n\ni think we should reach out to republicans if they choose not to come on board, which i suspect will probably be the case ... we should use that majority in a very aggressive way, sanders said. it is my view we should make sure that we address the needs of the american people in that reconciliation bill, and if we pass it with 51 votes, we'll pass it with 51 votes.\n\nthe first step would be to pass a budget bill through committee to essentially unlock the process. once that was finished, the senate democrats could rework biden's bill so it fit into a very specific framework of what is allowed under the process. reconciliation requires that anything passed has a real impact on the budget and not just an incidental one. the process also requires that proposals have no impact on social security and that the impacts on the budget do not stretch beyond a 10-year window if the changes are permanent. because the process requires jumping through so many hoops and consultation with the senate's parliamentarian, committee staff have been working for weeks now to make sure they understand and are ready for the process in case it has to be used.\n\nthere's not much room for error, another democratic aide said noting that the committees will have to go point by point through bidens proposal to see what can fit in reconciliation.\n\nrepublicans used the reconciliation process when they attempted to repeal and replace obamacare in 2017 in the senate. the gop successfully used the process months later to overhaul the country's tax code, which passed with just republican votes.\n\nthe conversations about reconciliation have been reinvigorated in recent days as democrats have grown frustrated by the stalled negotiations to organize the senate . senate minority leader mitch mcconnell has dug in and insisted that majority leader chuck schumer agree to preserve the filibuster for the next two years. the filibuster protects the minority party in the senate by requiring that legislation meet a 60-vote procedural threshold before passing. schumer has argued that policy has never been part of an organizing resolution before, but the issue has delayed the process of setting up committees and passing biden's nominees.\n\nthere are still questions about what parts of biden's covid relief package would be allowed to advance under reconciliation. some aides have identified that items like the $15 minimum wage could struggle to meet the criteria.\n\nbut white house officials make clear the real negotiation hasn't even started yet -- and that biden, with decades of legislative work and relationships in the senate, plans to give it time and space to come to fruition before moving in another direction.\n\nthis story has been updated with additional reporting.
president donald trump played a key role in getting nevada sen. dean heller's primary challenger to drop out, and in convincing rep. kevin cramer to run for the senate in north dakota.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nfor months, nevada and north dakota were among the biggest headaches facing president donald trump and senate republicans headed into november's midterm elections.\n\nin nevada, until march, the gop had two well-known candidates. in north dakota, until february, it had none.\n\nbut after aggressive intervention from the white house, trump's political team and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, the gop now has one candidate in each of those races – giving the party nothing to worry about in tuesday's primaries in two of the most important senate battlegrounds on the 2018 midterm map.\n\nthis is an example of what it looks like when things work well, said josh holmes, a top political adviser to mcconnell. both of them had opportunity to be big trouble.\n\nin north dakota, despite a lobbying effort that included a visit with trump at the white house, rep. kevin cramer decided in january against a senate run.\n\nrather than looking elsewhere for another candidate, though, trump, mcconnell, national republican senatorial committee chairman cory gardner and other top republicans continued courting cramer, pressuring him to reconsider his decision.\n\neverybody saw him as by far and away the best candidate we could field. so, that was an all-in proposition to try to get him to reconsider, holmes said.\n\noil tycoon and gop mega-donor harold hamm also pressed cramer to run – and hamm's nudging, cramer told wday in north dakota, was a major factor.\n\nwhen harold talked to my wife chris, he said, 'if kevin does this, if you guys get into this, i will be his national finance chairman.' that was pretty compelling, cramer said in the may interview.\n\nin nevada, republicans were poised for a potentially disastrous primary between sen. dean heller and conservative challenger danny tarkanian, who argued that heller was insufficiently supportive of trump.\n\noriginally backed by bannon, tarkanian's campaign was undercut when trump and heller – whose relationship was frayed by heller's opposition to an obamacare repeal bill – grew closer.\n\nheller was a leading advocate for other trump legislative priorities, including the tax reform bill. the two also talked on an october cross-country flight to las vegas following the mass shooting there.\n\ntrump told republican national committee members he would campaign for heller.\n\nand in the days leading up to nevada's march filing deadline, trump 2020 campaign manager brad parscale urged tarkanian to drop his senate bid and run instead for the 3rd congressional district seat – with trump's support.\n\ntarkanian responded that he'd do so, but only if trump made the ask public – giving tarkanian something to show his supporters to explain his decision.\n\ntrump obliged, tweeting: it would be great for the republican party of nevada, and it's unity if good guy danny tarkanian would run for congress and dean heller, who is doing a really good job, could run for senate unopposed!
(cnn) andy slavitt, the former acting chief of medicare and medicaid under the obama administration, is expected to join president-elect joe biden's covid-19 team in a senior advisory role, cnn has learned.\n\nslavitt's role is expected to be temporary, sources said, as the incoming biden administration is days away from inheriting the daunting task of getting the spread of covid under control and quickly vaccinating the country. the expected hire underscores the all-hands-on-deck approach the biden team appears to be taking when it comes to the coronavirus, as it looks to meet its goal of administering 100 million vaccine shots during biden's first 100 days in office.\n\nslavitt declined to comment.\n\nnotably, prior to being named acting head of the centers for medicare and medicaid services, slavitt had been brought on to help the obama administration fix the botched rollout of its healthcare.gov website. that effort to fix the obamacare enrollment website was spearheaded by jeff zients, who is now biden's covid coordinator.\n\nzients confirmed to cnn thursday night his decision to bring slavitt onto the biden covid team as a senior adviser.\n\nread more
president trump said he is calling on congress to give him a line-item veto for all government spending bills.\n\nthe supreme court has previously found that the line-item veto violated the presentment clause of the constitution, which says the president does not have the power to unilaterally amend or repeal legislation (clinton v. city of new york).\n\ntrump also spoke about why the bill was so large, saying, it became so big because we need to take care of our military, as well as blaming democrats.

(photo by chris maddaloni/roll call/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthe next few weeks figure to be extraordinarily painful for democrats. what's still to be decided is whether the years – and decades – to come will follow with more of the same.\n\npresident donald trump's second supreme court nominee, brett kavanaugh, will almost certainly be confirmed by senate republicans and, depending on how the confirmation hearings unfold, a few red state democrats. the future of roe v. wade, along with obamacare and other core liberal achievements, will soon be considered ripe for conservative legal and legislative challenges.\n\nsome 12 days after justice anthony kennedy announced his decision to retire, democratic leaders in washington have yet to coalesce around a clear strategy for opposing his would-be successor. progressive groups are working to organize and energize the opposition, but they too have been vague in articulating how or by what means this fight ultimately breaks their way.\n\nthey must also be aware, and have to live with the fact, that a number of the 10 democrats running for re-election in states trump won – democrats they'll need to rely on if they can reclaim a majority – may break with the party, as some did in backing neil gorsuch's nomination.\n\nit's a pitiable state of affairs. the choice of kavanaugh might stir up some agita on the right, but there's little doubt the gop will coalesce around him when it counts. the best case for democrats, meanwhile, is to keep from splintering while parlaying almost certain defeat into more fuel for the base as the midterm elections approach and the 2020 presidential season comes up on the horizon.\n\nachieving that will require a shift in thinking both on and off capitol hill. to start, it's hardly a cop-out to concede that, more than any ideological divide on the left or lack of tactical imagination, the trouble for democrats now is rooted in simple math. unless a gop senator joins them, democrats don't have the votes to defeat kavanaugh.\n\nrepublican sens. susan collins of maine and lisa murkowski of alaska, both of whom support abortion rights, could, in theory, break ranks with their party. but that seems less likely at this point than red state democrats, especially those facing re-election, peeling off in favor of trump's nominee.\n\nbut if democrats have learned anything from the campaign that ended with trump's election, or the years of political brawling that created the environment in which a trump candidacy could flourish and win, they should understand now that the old rules no longer apply. so it goes for the long-standing conventional wisdom, which holds that an independent streak, a maverick tendency to buck the party (as the clichés go), is the best way to win over either nonideological or ideologically opposed voters.\n\nthat means, in this supreme court fight, unified opposition will be essential – even if it falls short of being successful. it means leadership, starting with senate minority leader chuck schumer of new york, need to do everything in their power to deny trump and the gop their way.\n\nmassachusetts' sen. elizabeth warren, a rumored 2020 presidential contender, tried to set the stakes early on.\n\nsupreme court justice anthony kennedy's retirement means that women's health, equal marriage, and civil rights are all at risk, she tweeted hours after the announcement. this is the fight of our lives.\n\nand one that democrats will only suffer more for backing down from. capitulation here will only compound the damage done and sow more doubt over whether the party can be trusted to defend its most fundamental, core principles.\n\nup for re-election this fall in a state won by trump in 2016, pennsylvania's sen. bob casey, one of the few democrats who oppose abortion rights, found a way to oppose the nominee before he was even announced.\n\ncasey gave progressives a jolt – and his colleagues a lesson – on monday by revealing plans to oppose the pick hours before it was made. he argued in a statement that trump's decision to select from a list of 25 options dictated to him by the heritage foundation undermined the process from the start and that any judge on this list is fruit of a corrupt process straight from the d.c. swamp.\n\nunified opposition, it turns out, doesn't require unified thought or tactics.\n\ncasey's much redder state colleagues have been more circumspect. alabama's doug jones and north dakota's heidi heitkamp, the latter facing a tough re-election fight, signaled some openness to backing trump's choice. west virginia's joe manchin could be swayed. joe donnelly, of indiana, is another gop target.\n\ntheirs are politically unenviable positions, to be sure. but if the logic guiding their votes doesn't factor in a legacy that stretches beyond the coming elections, they could end up confirming not only a justice, but also a more damaging suspicion about the democratic party.\n\nthis post has been updated.

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthe trump administration on friday granted a utah request for a more limited medicaid expansion, effectively short-circuiting a ballot measure approved by voters in november.\n\nthe approval allows utah to expand its program to those who earn up to 100% of the poverty level, or about $12,500 for an individual and $25,750 for a family of four. under obamacare's medicaid expansion provision, states have extended health insurance to those making up to 138% of the poverty level.\n\nalso notable is that utah can now cap enrollment of newly eligible residents if state funding runs out; currently, medicaid must accept anyone who qualifies.\n\nand the approval does not provide the higher level of federal funding that accompanies full expansion under obamacare, though utah officials have said they intend to seek the enhanced match soon. several red states are looking to partially expand medicaid, but want the richer support from washington, dc, for the newly qualified.\n\nthe approval is the latest step in a busy health care week for the trump administration.\n\non monday, the justice department said the entire affordable care act should be struck down in a filing with a federal appeals court, a dramatic reversal of a stance it took last year. two days later, a federal district court judge blocked the administration's efforts to allow states to impose work requirements on medicaid recipients.\n\nand on thursday, another judge blocked its effort to make it easier for small businesses to band together to buy health insurance in so-called association health plans.\n\nutah's republican governor, gary herbert, and gop lawmakers last month sought to pare back november's ballot measure by passing legislation that also limits expansion to 100%, seeks additional federal support and imposes more mandates on enrollees. that state law, however, requires additional federal waivers that utah has yet to submit to the trump administration.\n\nthis is an important first step in covering vulnerable utahns in a financially sustainable way, said herbert. but it's just a first step. in the coming months, we will submit a detailed proposal seeking a new funding arrangement with cms [centers for medicare & medicaid services] that will decrease the state's share of the costs, provide the federal government with assurances on its costs, and provide the state with additional flexibility to manage the program.\n\nfriday's action means some 70,000 to 90,000 newly eligible residents can start applying on april 1, state officials said. medicaid already covers more more than 312,000 utahns.\n\nbut it leaves out more than 50,000 people who would have qualified under the ballot measure, said andrew roberts, spokesman for utah decides, which supported the november effort.\n\nother community advocates also decried the move, saying it would leave needy residents without access to medical care and end up costing the state more money.\n\nlimiting the number of people who can enroll in the medicaid program could leave many vulnerable utahns shut out from health coverage when they need it most, said jessie mandle, senior health policy analyst for voices for utah children.\n\nutah will have to shell out more state funds to cover the newly eligible than it would have had it expanded medicaid like other states. the federal government funds at least 90% of the cost of additional enrollees under the obamacare provision, while it provides less support to the core medicaid program – about 70% in utah's case. wisconsin is the only other state that has expanded its program to the poverty level at the traditional federal match level.\n\nfriday's approval also requires certain enrollees to register for employment through the state's online portal, apply for jobs and participate in training. but unlike other states' work requirements, participants will not have to show they are working a certain number of hours a month.

source: cnn trump signs executive order helping veterans\n\nthe first test of trump's seriousness in pursuing bipartisan legislation will be whether he can reach an immigration deal with democrats to grant legal status to dreamers, the undocumented immigrants who came to the us as children whose protections are set to soon expire after he decided to cancel the obama-era program that brought them out of the shadows.\n\ntrump is expected to tout the framework he released last week, which offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million dreamers, while also calling for $25 billion in border wall and border security funding as well as a host of policies aimed at reducing legal immigration numbers, with a target on family-based immigration in particular. but early reports of the proposal have been rejected by the right and the left.\n\nthe white house has framed the proposal as a dramatic overture, though many democrats and even some republicans eager to broker a deal have balked at attaching a drastic proposal to end the visa lottery program and end americans' ability to sponsor their parents or siblings for residency in the us to the legislation.\n\nthe president's allies said the proposal, particularly by proposing a path to citizenship for nearly 2 million undocumented immigrants, signals trump's seriousness about reaching a deal.\n\nhe put his credibility on the line when he went at 1.8 (million for) citizenship, said bryan lanza, a former top communications aide to the trump campaign and transition. that's actually pretty courageous.\n\nbut so far it appears unlikely democrats are willing to accept trump's framework – which a senior white house official called trump's bottom line last week – and negotiators in the senate are working to craft an agreement that begins by looking at just protections for dreamers and border security funding.\n\ndemocrats are under pressure from their base to secure protections for the dreamers, but also must contend with a base of supporters that is loathe for democrats to cooperate with trump, particularly if it means making concessions.\n\ndealmaker?\n\nthat sentiment will be heightened as both parties near 2018, said republican strategist doug heye, a cnn political commentator.\n\nif there's one constant of trump it's that he has positioned himself or proclaimed himself to be the great dealmaker and if that's the case, then the two areas where it seems most obvious he could do that would be immigration and infrastructure, heye said. but the longer it goes on the harder it gets.\n\nnewt gingrich, the former republican house speaker, said he believes republicans have an incentive to work on bipartisan legislation ahead of the midterm election.\n\none of the keys to being a governing majority is to govern. it's always better to find ways to get things done, gingrich said.\n\nbut the viability of bipartisan dealmaking will largely depend on the president, who in recent weeks has both rejected bipartisan proposals and sang the praises of a bygone era of cooperation with republicans and democrats.\n\ni remember when i used to go out in washington, and i'd see democrats having dinner with republicans. and they were best friends, and everybody got along. you don't see that too much anymore. in all due respect, you really don't see that, trump said during an hourlong meeting with a group of lawmakers from both parties earlier this month.\n\non monday, he continued to express his hopes about a bipartisan immigration deal, saying hopefully the democrats will join us, or enough of them will join us, so we can really do something great.\n\nbut despite his talk of bipartisanship and consensus, trump's definition of bipartisanship appears to rest on democrats meeting him where he stands – and only agreeing to deals that don't bust his campaign promises.\n\ntrump would like to be bipartisan as long as it's within the framework of being trump, said gingrich. he has no interest in being bipartisan if that means giving up being trump.\n\nwatch the state of the union address on cnngo, at cnn.com/go on any desktop, smartphone or ipad, or from the cnngo app appletv, amazon fire tv and roku tv devices with no login required. and if you miss it, you can watch and listen to the speech in its entirety on cnn or your amazon alexa and google home devices – just ask cnn for the full state of the union speech.

about 9 million fewer americans will have health insurance next year thanks to the trump administration and republicans in congress, a new report estimates.\n\ncongress' elimination of the individual mandate, which takes effect in 2019, and a trio of moves by president donald trump are expected to fuel the decrease, the urban institute said.\n\ntrump's actions include the discontinuation of federal support of a key obamacare subsidy, the reduction of advertising and assistance for obamacare's open enrollment season and the proposed expansion of short-term insurance policies. the congressional budget office does not consider consumers with such policies to be insured.\n\nthe president and congressional republicans say they want to give americans more options when it comes to health insurance, including the choice of whether to buy insurance at all.\n\nthe individual mandate, one of obamacare's least popular provisions, requires nearly all americans to get coverage or pay a penalty. the cbo estimated in november that 4 million fewer people would be insured in 2019 because healthier people would be less likely to buy policies without the mandate in place.\n\nrelated: 8 ways trump hurt obamacare in his first year\n\nthe urban institute estimated that the mandate's elimination, as well as the reduced federal support of open enrollment, would leave 6.4 million fewer people with coverage by 2019.\n\nlast week, the trump administration proposed regulations that will make it easier to obtain short-term health insurance plans by allowing insurers to sell policies that last just under a year. the duration of these policies, which don't have to adhere to the affordable care act's consumer protections, had been limited to three months by the obama administration.\n\nhealth secretary alex azar said that short-term policies will give americans more choices so they can find coverage that meets their needs. rates will likely be lower for younger and healthier americans since these policies' premiums are based on consumers' health status and the plans don't have to offer as many benefits as those on the obamacare exchanges.\n\nrelated: trump administration unveils alternative to obamacare\n\nabout 2.5 million people who would have been otherwise insured will opt for short-term policies next year instead, the urban institute estimates.\n\ncombined, the elimination of the individual mandate and the expansion of short-term plans will likely cause premiums for obamacare policies to increase an average of 18.2% next year in the 43 states that do not prohibit or limit such policies, according to the urban institute.
john avlon is a senior political analyst at cnn. the opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. view more opinion on cnn.\n\n(cnn) i'm a cheerleader for the country, president donald trump said in his final coronavirus press conference in march — a month in which the us death toll increased from two to more than 4,000 .\n\nit was a rare moment of honesty in a press conference typically full of falsehoods . trump has always been a cheerleader — a hype man, a master marketer of himself which he parlayed into hyperpartisan politics and the presidency.\n\nbut, with apologies to cheerleaders, trump is confronting a crisis he can't hype his way out of. he is standing on the sidelines, out of his depth and now we're all paying the price.\n\nwhat we need in the presidency right now is a quarterback — someone who calmly calls strategic plays under intense pressure.\n\ninstead, we have donald trump. and his instincts are perfectly wrong for a pandemic.\n\npandemics don't care about partisan politics. but trump definitely does. and so we've seen a politicized and often petty response to the crisis from the president, despite having some of the best scientific experts, dr. anthony fauci and dr. debbie birx, on his team.\n\nwe've seen the president diss democratic governors in the hardest-hit states — from new york to washington to michigan, saying when they disrespect me, they're disrespecting our government.\n\nsomeone should remind him that to get respect you've got to give respect.\n\nbut now we may be seeing that reflexive partisanship trickling down to the delivery of critical medical supplies at a time when body bags are building up around our hospitals.\n\npresident trump's adopted home of florida — a critical swing state in the upcoming election with a republican governor — has somehow speedily received 100% of its requested medical supplies like 430,000 surgical masks and 180,000 n95 respirators. that's great for florida, which is scrambling amid rising cases after resisting social distancing efforts\n\nbut somehow massachusetts has only received 17% of what it requested — according to an analysis by the washington post — while illinois gov. j. b. pritzker told cnn's chris cuomo that his state has only received 10% of what it requested, which could cause serious shortages as soon as next week.\n\nthis is all coming as the administration is warning to expect deaths to rise sharply in the coming weeks, with president trump even trying to spin fatalities under 100,000 as evidence they had done  a very good job.  seriously.\n\nwe're going to have to come up with a better phrase than moving the goal posts, as the washington post called it , to cover such a ghoulish shift in position from a president who just weeks ago was assuring american's the coronavirus was totally under control and would miraculously disappear in april.\n\nwell, it's now april — and america has more cases of coronavirus than anywhere in the world. this is surely not what he meant by america first.\n\nthere is a grim, growing awareness — even acknowledged by the president — that things are going to get much, much worse in the coming weeks.\n\nstill, we've heard the president persist with his lies about readily available coronavirus tests against all evidence. he's repeatedly attacked the media for asking tough but totally fair questions about his handling of the crisis and bragged about his ratings . this isn't reality tv anymore, mr. president: ratings don't matter; results do.\n\nlately he's taken to saying that no one knew that coronavirus would be so contagious. everybody knew except, apparently, the president. but trump's talking points filtered down through partisan media and became a deadly form of misinformation, leading to a stark partisan gap on how seriously people were taking coronavirus in mid-march.\n\nit wasn't that long ago that we heard absurd attempts to rationalize the projected death toll from folks like wisconsin sen. ron johnson who told his home state paper, the milwaukee journal-sentinel, that getting coronavirus is not a death sentence except for maybe no more than 3.4% of our population (and) i think probably far less and added, we don't shut down our economy because tens of thousands of people die on the highways.\n\nfor the record, 3.4% of the current us population is 11.2 million. that's almost twice the population of wisconsin. luckily, it does appear that the fatality rate for coronavirus is far less than 3.4% — but that doesn't mean we should dismiss the deaths that are coming as acceptable collateral damage.\n\nthe understandable impulse to protect the economy from total free fall has led the trump administration to embrace multitrillion-dollar bailouts and stimulus of the kind that many on the right attacked during the bush and obama response to the financial crisis. according to an administration official cited by the wall street journal , trump wants to further politicize the bailout by putting his name on all the checks that will be sent out. but political self-interest seems to have trumped any alleged fiscal conservative principles in the republican party long ago. deficits and debt won't be discussed until there is a democratic president.\n\nbut they can't completely quit their impulse to own the libs by blaming the obama administration for their testing and medical equipment fiascos while refusing to open obamacare insurance exchanges for the rocketing number of new unemployed folks, according to new cnn reporting\n\nwe know that the trump justice department is backing a lawsuit to destroy what's left of obamacare (even though they'd rather wait for a final judgment until after the election) . give the current crisis, blocking people from getting access to open enrollment health care exchanges is petty and cruel.\n\nbut with the gravity of the crisis taking hold inside trumpland, it's the political impact of the pandemic that seems to be grabbing attention. according to the los angeles times , one former white house official said trump's reelection campaign advisers are terrified that the coronavirus outbreak, which so far has hit largely democratic coastal cities hardest, will soon scythe across the rural areas that remain deeply loyal to trump.\n\nthis is what happens to your brain on hyperpartisanship: even pandemics are seen through a red state vs. blue state prism. it's a different kind of sickness that we don't have a cure for yet. but that doesn't mean we should think it's normal. it's not.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter. join us on twitter and facebook\n\nhype and hate won't stop this virus. denial didn't work when president trump tried it. and attacking democratic governors won't help the country heal either.\n\nthe coronavirus crisis reveals how stupid and self-defeating, hyperpartisan politics is when it comes to actually governing. if ever there was a time for nonideological problem solving and empathetic leadership, this is it. but we're in a crisis, stuck with the president we've got — and the costs will soon be clear to all of us.

win mcnamee/getty images\n\nearly in the debate, sen. bernie sanders used an inaccurate figure that had been provided to his campaign by a progressive think tank that, among other things, keeps track of the fortunes of billionaires.\n\nin the last three years, last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth, sanders said.\n\nfacts first: the think tank that provided the figure says it is wrong, and says it takes responsibility for the error.\n\nsanders was relying on a figure from the institute for policy studies, according to the think tank senior scholar chuck collins but the number was inflated. we informed senator sanders that us billionaires increased their wealth since trump's election by $850 billion. our updated number is $710 billion, an increase of 30 percent, collins told cnn during the debate.\n\nsenator sanders was accurately using information that we provided, so we at institute for policy studies are responsible for the error, collins added.\n\nhe said that in 2016, there were 541 us billionaires with wealth totaling about $2.4 trillion. in 2019, he said, there were 607 us billionaires with wealth totaling about $3.1 trillion.\n\ncollins said he informed the sanders campaign on tuesday morning that there had been an error, after cnn contacted the campaign to ask for the source for the $850 billion number. it is not clear, though, whether sanders himself was informed of the error prior to the debate.\n\nthere is no doubt that the wealthiest americans have gotten wealthier under president trump, though others have also gained.\n\naccording to the federal reserve, the combined wealth of the top 1% of american households increased 18% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2019 — from $29.18 to $34.53 trillion. the combined wealth of the bottom 50% of households increased 55%, but from a much smaller starting point — from $1.08 trillion to $1.67 trillion — and spread out across many more households.

nothing for the wall.\n\nduring a televised soliloquy of a cabinet meeting wednesday, trump talked repeatedly about the need for a wall and said he was prepared to keep the shutdown going as long as it takes to get the $5.6 billion he wants for a border wall.\n\nwe're in a shutdown because democrats refuse to fund the border security, he said. they try and make it like it's just about the wall, and it is about the wall.\n\nso there will either be wall funding or there won't, probably masked by some kind of face-saving sop, but until we know the answer to that question, the parts of the federal government that are closed are going to stay that way.\n\nhere's how those other notable recent shutdowns ended.\n\nthe clinton and gingrich shutdowns – november 1995 and december 1995 to january 1996\n\nwho blinked?\n\nbill clinton, and then congressional republicans\n\nthese two shutdowns combined for 28 days. they're now viewed as largely helping to revive clinton's presidency even though he did agree, with stipulations, to republican demands that the budget be balanced within seven years.\n\nclinton made that concession to end the first shutdown. republicans blinked on their demands for how it should be implemented with the second.\n\non the day that longest american shutdown ended – january 6, 1996 – the new york times used the language of retreat to refer to republicans on its front page, comparing the party to napoleon overreaching in his attempts to take moscow.\n\nbut by the end, the shutdown had boomeranged into a powerful force against republicans, who were seen as wreaking havoc on federal workers and innocent citizens to score political points, michael wines wrote on the front page of the times. and mr. clinton's stubborn refusal to cut a deal, seen all last year as evidence of political weakness, suddenly began to look like courage in the face of an enemy siege.\n\nthe obamacare shutdown – october 2013\n\nwho blinked?\n\ncongressional republicans\n\nconservative republicans like sen. ted cruz of texas and rep. mark meadows of north carolina helped lead an insurrection among republicans in the house, where they insisted on an effort to strip funding for the affordable care act. but with president barack obama still in office and democrats then in control of the senate, the effort had no chance of success. there were other issues at play, but ultimately republicans agreed to fund the government at existing levels with a slight tweak to income verification for health care subsidies.\n\nthen-house speaker john boehner admitted in a radio interview that republicans had given up in the fight.\n\nwe fought the good fight. we just didn't win, he said at the time.\n\nthe daca shutdown – january 2018\n\nwho blinked?\n\nsenate democrats\n\ndemocrats thought they had the moral high ground even if they lacked a majority in the house or the senate. so senate minority leader chuck schumer refused to pass a massive spending bill unless trump and republicans agreed to a permanent fix for undocumented immigrants brought to the us as children. they had been protected under the deferred action for childhood arrivals program enacted by fiat under obama, but ended by trump. democrats lost their nerve quickly, however, and agreed to a promise by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell that the senate would consider a permanent daca fix. senators failed to fix daca. and trump's decision to end daca has been slowed down in the courts. look for this issue to return this year.\n\nthe details of how and when the current shutdown will end are still to be determined as it completes its 13th day, but what ultimately will happen is one side will have to give.
washington (cnn) the supreme court agreed monday to once again become the decider on the future of obamacare -- the controversial law that has become a fabric of society for the millions of americans who have come to rely upon it.\n\nbut the justices ensured something else as well. they guaranteed that over the next several months, as the presidential election rages on and legal briefs flood the zone, the fate of the law and the court will be front and center during the campaign.\n\nthe court had options. it could have taken up the case this term, and put the issue to rest by the end of june. it could have allowed the case to continue for months or maybe even years in the lower courts, delaying supreme court action until next year or beyond.\n\ndemocrats, meanwhile, will vigorously highlight the trump administration's legal argument: a law that protects individuals with pre-existing conditions should be invalidated by a court bolstered with two of trump's nominees: neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh. and while the president has vowed to come up with a replacement plan, so far he has not.\n\nregardless of the date of oral argument, the democratic candidate will -- and should! -- use this case to bludgeon president trump at every turn, nicholas bagley of the university of michigan law school tweeted\n\nwhat's still unknown is whether arguments will be scheduled before election day on november 3. under normal circumstances, a case granted this early for the following term could be a contender for october arguments. but the significance of that would not be lost on justices eager to avoid the political fray.\n\nbrian fallon, who runs a group, demand justice, that opposes trump's judicial nominees, underscored the point.\n\na supreme court oral argument about the future of obamacare, possibly in october right before the election, will put trump's plan to throw millions off their insurance front and center and make supreme court voters out of millions of people, he tweeted\n\nformer vice president joe biden echoed that argument.\n\nthis fall, donald trump will be trying to get the supreme court to strike down obamacare -- ripping health insurance away from 30 million americans, ending protections for 100 million more with preexisting conditions, destroying families, and costing a million jobs, the democratic presidential contender said in a statement. this case is a stark, life-and-death reminder how much is at stake this fall and what's on the ballot right now: democrats must nominate the candidate whom they know can beat trump and bring along the senate, to ensure we can protect our health care for generations to come.\n\ndemocrats even whipped up an impromptu rally -- scheduled within an hour after the court's decision to take up the case. such rallies usually only occur on decision days or argument days.\n\nin its usual tantalizing manner, the supreme court provided no information as to which justices agreed to hear the case. it would have taken at least four. it could have been the four liberals, dismayed with a district court ruling that invalidated the entire law and a federal appeals court that some think punted on the fate of the entire law to avoid an election year decision. or was it the same five justices ( the liberals plus conservative chief justice john roberts ) who all voted to uphold the law in 2012. those five are still on the bench after all.\n\nwhich leaves roberts front and center, again. he was eviscerated by conservatives in 2012 and trump for his ruling allowing the affordable care act to remain, classifying it as a tax.\n\nbut because congress cut the tax penalty to zero, texas and other republican-led states sued, saying roberts' logic no longer applies.\n\nnow that the individual mandate can no longer be preserved as a tax, the constitutionality of obamacare must be determined, texas attorney general ken paxton said monday. without the individual mandate, the entire law becomes unsupportable. the federal government cannot order private citizens to purchase subpar insurance that they don't want, and i look forward to finally settling the matter before the u.s. supreme court.\n\nthe court prides itself in showing its work at the end of a case, but how it arrives at its decisions remain shrouded in secrecy.\n\nwhich leads to speculation. two of the four liberals are over 80 and could possibly step down during the term of the next president. the liberals' voting power -- and the ability to grant cases -- would significantly diminish if a republican wins. one wonders if agreeing to take the challenge next term and not during this one (requiring an opinion before the election) was a compromise.\n\nwhat about the fact that the court granted the request of the democratic-led states to take up the case, but not a request from the house of representatives? that decision could have been made so that the court wouldn't have to decide whether the house had the legal right or standing to bring the case. but could it have also been an effort to keep another democratic-led house v. trump dispute off the books.\n\nmany americans, and at least one member of the court (cough, cough, chief justice roberts), aren't excited to relive another battle between those two bodies, so soon after the impeachment, said jessica levinson, a professor at loyola law school.\n\nthe court is already facing a number of cases this term about congress' power, specifically as it related to trump. later this month, it will hear arguments in trump's attempt to keep his taxes and financial documents private.\n\nthe court could be motivated to avoid a docket that looks like it is just the referee of disputes between the democratic-led house and the trump administration, levinson said.\n\nby leaving out the house, the court indicated it won't hear directly from the body that passed the law. it's a point most likely not lost on house speaker nancy pelosi, but she released a statement praising the court's decision.\n\nthe sooner the gop's dangerous anti-health care lawsuit is ended, the better, she said.\n\nand then she linked the case to the coronavirus outbreak , an issue that also might become a talking point in the next several months.\n\nthe trump administration continues to ask the court to destroy protections for people with pre-existing conditions and tear away health coverage from tens of millions of americans, she said. even in the middle of the coronavirus crisis, the trump administration continues to ask the court to destroy protections for people with pre-existing conditions and tear away health coverage from tens of millions of americans.\n\npelosi now has at least nine months to repeat that argument. day in and day out.
washington (cnn) if elections are won by defiant showmanship alone, donald trump, the grand political illusionist, will waltz to a second term in november.\n\nand he spelled out a daunting warning to a band of democrats who couldn't even cobble together a winner in the iowa caucuses on monday that he's an effective, relentless political communicator who will stop at nothing to win.\n\nin two stunning moments that book-ended the evening, trump, as he began his speech, turned his back on house speaker nancy pelosi's outstretched hand in a snub that encapsulated their boiling bad blood. then, after he wrapped up, pelosi, channeling her disgusted and outraged democratic members, ostentatiously tore up the speech in full view of the cameras , in a sure-to-go viral moment that showed she can do theatrics, too.\n\ntrump rattled through the night in a mood of huge self-confidence, taking political risks a more conventional politician would have spurned. it wasn't the performance of a president shamed and cowed by impeachment ahead of a vote in the gop-led senate expected to acquit him on wednesday.\n\nat his 2017 inaugural address, trump invoked a dark nightmare of american carnage. now he's selling the great american comeback.\n\nhe painted a vision of a prosperous unified american utopia, pulsating with racial harmony and common national purpose, leaning heavily on the strong economy and the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years.\n\nbut in hitting hardball notes on abortion, immigration, religion and awarding a medal of freedom to talk show king rush limbaugh on live tv , the president made his most brazen political base play yet.\n\nmoving moments\n\njust watched military family was reunited during state of the union replay more videos ... must watch military family was reunited during state of the union 01:48\n\nfusing the roles of commander in chief and reality show host, the president orchestrated a moving reunion between a soldier home from the afghan war and his unsuspecting wife and children -- in a prime-time version of the youtube videos that you can't take your eyes off.\n\nthis and other gestures, including his award of a scholarship to a young minority student to attend school under a controversial administration program, were touching and emotive. but they also were a trap for critics who risked coming across as callous if they accused trump of cynicism.\n\nthe president proclaimed that the state of our union is stronger than ever before -- boasting of standing up to china, winning with new trade deals and bringing torrents of jobs back to their rightful home.\n\nhe conjured the kind of america first toughness, populist rhetoric and refusal to stand with elites against the heartland that powered his 2016 triumph and which he is ratcheting up ahead of november's election.\n\nhe used his most valuable card -- the strong economy -- skillfully and at length, boasting that he shattered the mentality of american decline and was building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society.\n\nhis millions of supporters will have seen more than enough to get them flocking to the polls in droves in november -- even as doubts emerge about the unity and competence of democrats following the iowa caucus debacle.\n\nbut as is often the case with trump, the reality that he sketched was often at odds with the facts . his 80-minute appearance was pockmarked with exaggerations, falsehoods and misleading rhetoric.\n\nhe effectively accused democrats of seeking to steal the health care of americans with socialism and portrayed himself as the protector of coverage for pre-existing conditions. but his administration has made repeated attempts to kill off obamacare, the law that initiated those protections.\n\nhe boasted of building over 100 miles of a long, tall and very powerful wall on the us-mexico border. yet most of that construction is in replacing dilapidated barriers with an enhanced wall system.\n\nthe trade deals he touted, like those with china, mexico and canada , are far less sweeping than his extravagant claims.\n\ntrump woos suburban voters\n\nyet trump also put himself across as a rare politician who keeps his promises -- a powerful source of attraction for his supporters and an appeal to suburban uncommitted voters who he needs to convince he is worth a second term.\n\nthree years ago we launched the great american comeback, trump said.\n\ntonight, i stand before you to share the incredible results. jobs are booming. incomes are soaring. poverty is plummeting. crime is falling. confidence is surging. and our country is thriving and highly respected again, the president said, in a unifying opening to his speech.\n\nhe seized on the economic success of his presidency to parallel ronald reagan's morning in america mantra from 1984 -- implicitly warning americans they could jeopardize it all if they turf him out of office.\n\nbut trump also reeled off a series of blistering politicized passages that the conservative but temperamentally gentle 40th president would never have included in a speech that typically has reached for a common national ground -- even while being a laundry list of political priorities.\n\ndemocratic disgust\n\njust watched jake tapper: trump got under pelosi's skin replay more videos ... must watch jake tapper: trump got under pelosi's skin 02:12\n\nfor much of the time, trump twisted his body away from democrats to address only the republicans in the house of representatives, leaving members of the house majority, shaking their heads, apparently unable to believe their ears.\n\nel rushbo, who announced to his millions of listeners on monday his stage 4 lung cancer diagnosis , is regarded as a bigot and extremist by many democrats. his populist streak and mastery of flaming political rhetoric was in many ways a precursor to the president's own political brand.\n\nthere were several cries of no as trump announced the honor, encapsulating the disbelief of many democrats captive in their seats.\n\nand in a hard-hitting statement, democratic presidential candidate and former vice president joe biden eviscerated trump's address.\n\nin one fell swoop, trump delivered a speech worthy of the worst demagogue and turned his constitutional obligation to inform congress about the state of our union into an episode of reality television.\n\nhe even awarded our nation's highest civilian honor, not to the real american hero in the gallery -- one of the last surviving tuskegee airmen -- but a conservative media personality who has done as much as trump himself to divide our nation. it was a shameful display, biden said.\n\nmaryland democratic sen. chris van hollen called the speech disgraceful.\n\nthis is not the place for a maga rally, van hollen told cnn. this is a place where you at least attempt to bring the country together to unify us behind common purposes. instead, we have a president who's a megalomaniac.\n\nthe task was especially hard on tuesday as she was trying to respond to trump's flamboyant, non-traditional approach with the conventional imagery of a regular politician's televised speech.\n\ndemocrats are trying to make your health care better. republicans in washington are trying to take it away, whitmer said.\n\nand she quarreled with trump's vision of runaway american prosperity.\n\namerican workers are hurting ... wages have stagnated, while ceo pay has skyrocketed.\n\nunlike trump, whitmer also touched on impeachment.\n\nthe truth matters. facts matter. and no one should be above the law. it's not what those senators say tomorrow, it's what they do that matters, she said.\n\nwhitmer's rebuttal -- just like trump's -- encapsulated the two parties' differing approaches to 2020\n\nif the election is about facts, policy and in-depth discussion of the issues like health care, economic equality and a return to political norms, then voters may well turn to democrats over trump.\n\nbut if it's about a brazen willingness to put on a show, the president's challengers are already in trouble.
(cnn) —\n\nthe last government shutdown occurred in 2013 between a republican house and a democratic white house and senate. it lasted for 16 days in october and ended with a temporary debt and spending deal. phew!\n\nthis time the main sticking point in budget talks is immigration. (you know, that old chestnut that could affect millions of people.) in 2013 the shutdown centered on obamacare, which should surprise no one looking back.\n\nwhile this year's possible shutdown has focused on one very vulgar quote, some very memorable moments – and a weird obsession with food – also came from political leaders during the 2013 shutdown. check out the video above.\n\nknock it off. pass a budget. and move on.\n\n\n\n– president barack obama, to house republicans, apparently quoting republican governors and senators\n\nthis isn't some damn game.\n\n\n\n– house speaker john boehner, responding to the idea that democratic leadership saw the shutdown as a win. bonus points for slamming his newspaper down as he said it\n\nwell, those are two cookies. so why don't you give me one of those cookies?… you want both?\n\n– obama, subtly diet shaming vice president joe biden while ordering lunch. the two stopped by dc sandwich shop taylor gourmet, one of the local establishments that offered a discount to federal workers during the shutdown.\n\nif reasonable republicans want to talk about these things again, i'm ready to head up to the hill and try. i'll even spring for dinner again.\n\n\n\n– obama, who had previously hosted republican senators to try to foster a relationship with them\n\nthis government shutdown is an embarrassment to our nation.\n\n\n\n– senate majority leader harry reid, specifically citing an international economic conference that obama wasn't able to attend as a result of the shutdown\n\n[shows up with breakfast food] i'd like to be escorted.\n\n\n\n– biden, showing up at the environmental protection agency with muffins after the shutdown concluded\n\na reminder: obamacare is still around, although the fine for not buying insurance will soon be gone. so was the 2013 shutdown worth it? it certainly didn't encourage congress to take a wide turn to avoid another one. it also wasn't the last time food stories made their way into political news leading up to a shutdown. never change, washington. or do. just for the better.
the $1.9 trillion rescue package biden rolled out last week -- a big-ticket bid to revive a coronavirus-ravaged economy -- is getting the cold shoulder from republicans. and some democrats, anxious to act quickly, are beginning to question whether there is any point in trying to win their support.\n\nfor biden, who as a candidate branded himself the democrat best positioned to break capitol hill gridlock, the story of his presidency could well be written over the coming weeks, as the work of crafting the bill and wrangling votes for it begins in earnest. but even in the face of republican opposition and democratic anxiety, biden is betting on himself and a team of seasoned negotiators to deliver not only a massive aid package, but also a victory that would vindicate one of the core premises of his political life -- that there is always room and reason to negotiate with partisan foes.\n\nthe legislation biden described will, under the senate's current rules, require at least 10 republican votes and a unified democratic caucus to pass. if that fails, the white house and senate democrats are poised to pivot to a process called budget reconciliation, which would allow for a pared-down package to pass with a simple majority. to get the full package without gop support, senate democrats would likely have to go nuclear and change or end the legislative filibuster, a move that former president barack obama endorsed last year.\n\nbiden's stance is less clear. he has supported retaining the filibuster in the past but hedged in comments last summer, saying his posture could change depending on how obstreperous (republicans) become. asked on friday where biden currently stands, white house press secretary jen psaki would say only that his position has not changed.\n\nmoving to the budget reconciliation or getting rid of the filibuster would put a dent in biden's claim of being a master negotiator. but it might be the only way, democrats argue, to deliver relief to americans desperate for it.\n\nbiden has to give mcconnell some chance to see if he's going to play ball, but i think there's a time limit with that. i don't think that biden has the luxury of waiting forever. i think three months, four months at the most, said former senate majority leader harry reid, who worked closely with both senate minority leader mitch mcconnell, a kentucky republican, and biden during his time in the senate. there's going to come a time that the filibuster is going to have to go. it's not a question of if, it's a question of when it's going to go.\n\nreid acknowledged that getting rid of the filibuster -- or any moves to go around republicans -- would undercut biden's political brand. but the nevada democrat argued that his former colleague will likely have to choose between being an icon of bipartisanship and a president with a lengthy list of accomplishments.\n\nyou can't do both. ... his legacy will be judged on what he gets done. if (republicans) are going to stop him from getting anything done, his legacy will not be a good one, reid said, before he put a finer point on it: joe biden will be recognized for what he's accomplished. and won't be recognized for 'i got along with everybody. we didn't get everything done, but i was sure nice to everybody.' \n\nduring her first briefing on wednesday night, psaki said biden will be quite involved in the negotiating process and pointed to his 36 years in the senate as evidence that his engagement could yield results. but she also suggested that biden would not hesitate to cut bait when the time came.\n\nhis clear preference is to move forward with a bipartisan bill. there's no question about it, psaki said. but we are also not going to take any tools off the table for how the house and senate can get this urgent package done.\n\none of biden's top advisers, national economic council director brian deese, confirmed on friday afternoon that he will speak to a bipartisan group of senators sunday.\n\nin terms of the message, it's pretty clear, deese told reporters. we're at a precarious moment for the virus and the economy. without decisive action, we risk falling into a very serious economic hole, even more serious than the crisis we find ourselves in.\n\nhe stopped to make note that former trump economic adviser kevin hassett has come out in support of the package.\n\nstill, some democrats are already beginning to urge biden not to get hung up on hopes of winning a bipartisan, filibuster-proof majority. their ranks include veterans of the obama administration's protracted and ultimately fruitless quest to win over republican support for the affordable care act more than a decade ago.\n\nkathleen sebelius, a former kansas governor who was obama's first health and human services secretary, said she learned the hard way that waiting too long for republican support -- something that former sen. max baucus, the montana democrat who was the senate finance chairman during the process, promised but failed to deliver -- could do real political damage.\n\nthere is not a lot of time to waste, sebelius said of biden's relief push. he is wise to put it forward early, to say, 'i want bipartisan support,' and then to do anything he can to get whatever he can passed as quickly as possible, because people are really hurting.\n\nthe long process of passing obamacare allowed republicans to marshal opposition and positioned them to use the law -- which was still mostly an abstraction after its passage in early 2010 -- as a cudgel during that year's midterm elections, when democrats got shellacked, as obama then put it. a similar delay, sebelius added, threatened to hamstring democratic efforts to keep, or potentially expand, their congressional majorities in the 2022 election.\n\npeople have to feel the impact of what happens quickly. they have to know their lives are better, said sebelius. things that are very tangible have to happen visibly and quickly.\n\ndemocrats in the senate are keeping a close eye on their gop counterparts and, according to a senior aide to a member of the caucus, remain overwhelmingly upbeat about the white house's proposal and the messaging around it.\n\nthere's no heartburn over biden's initial kind of play to make it bipartisan, to reach across the aisle, the aide said, adding that there is also no illusion among the democrats over the prospect of republicans coming on board -- a reality that was hammered home by moderate maine gop sen. susan collins' recent comments questioning the need for more spending.\n\nthe plan, the aide said, was simple: we tout (the bill), we celebrate it, we say we want to reach across the aisle -- and at the same time, we need to be quietly moving to pursue some of this policy agenda via reconciliation.\n\nsome democrats, especially in the party's progressive ranks, have already questioned the strategy or are signaling their desire for a quick pivot to action -- with or without gop backing.\n\ni believe that president-elect biden has a very optimistic view of the republican party. he has made past statements (saying) once trump is gone, they will see the error of their ways, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york told reporters after a virtual town hall last week. i applaud his optimism, but disagree with his assessment.\n\nsen. bernie sanders, the incoming budget committee chairman, has been supportive of biden's approach so far, but he wrote in a cnn op-ed on the eve of the inauguration that democrats should be prepared to go it alone, using reconciliation.\n\nthe danger we face would not be in going too big or spending too much but in going too small and leaving the needs of the american people behind, the vermont independent wrote. if republicans would like to work with us, we should welcome them. but their support is not necessary.\n\nthe tension between the more aggressive approach favored by sanders and fellow progressives, like sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts, was one of the core conflicts of the 2020 democratic primary contest. biden ultimately emerged, in part, because a wider swath of democratic voters embraced his conciliatory pitch.\n\nbiden also benefited, in some quarters, from the view that almost anything he supported, because of his long record of taking moderate positions in the senate and as vice president, was definitionally the moderate approach -- even when he stakes out ground to the left of where the obama administration landed.\n\nthat brand will likely help the newly inaugurated president as he attempts to convince the public that pursuing his biggest campaign promise -- uniting a severely divided country -- and passing a massive covid relief bill are not in conflict.

(photo by john moore/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nfriday is the last day for president donald trump's legislative director marc short, ending a whirlwind tenure of a tumultuous time between the executive and the legislative branch of government.\n\nshort has seen trump through accomplishments – a tax cut law, a supreme court justice confirmation – and disappointments, such as the failure to fully repeal the affordable care act, as well as a wild roller coaster of relationships to members of his own party on capitol hill.\n\nwe certainly accomplished a lot that is sometimes overshadowed, short told cnn in a recent interview, looking back on what his west wing legacy will be, citing regulatory reform and judge confirmations. you go back and think of things that you could have done differently. the failure to repeal (obamacare) was certainly a disappointment. it was a disappointment that when given a chance to, that some wavered in that, short said.\n\nshort has led the trump white house's legislative affairs team since the transition – and has witnessed an evolution in the president's relationship with congressional leadership. a year ago, trump fired off a few days of critical tweets directed at someone who is supposed to be one of his closest republican allies.\n\ncan you believe that mitch mcconnell, who has screamed repeal & replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done. must repeal & replace obamacare! one such tweet read.\n\nnowadays, the president and the senate majority leader work more harmoniously.\n\nmy sense is that the two of them have a much better working relationship today and respect each's role, short said, adding there's a lot that we feel we've all accomplished together. he calls mcconnell a champion on regulatory acts.\n\nat his departure, short was praised for his work on capitol hill by congressional leaders, including by house speaker paul ryan.\n\nmarc was a great partner in helping republicans advance major tenants of our legislative agenda including regulatory and tax reform and the rebuilding of the military, the wisconsin republican said in a statement to cnn. i thank him for his service and wish him all the best in his next chapter.\n\nshort says he's seen a lot of change in the past 18 moths he's worked at the white house but one of the biggest changes he's seen in the relationship between trump and republicans on capitol hill involves twitter.\n\ni would say that one of the biggest changes of the last 18 months is that members used to call and say, can the president stop tweeting? short said. and those same members call today and say, 'can the president tweet this for me?' so where we were 18 months ago with the social media is very different than today that the members now call and specifically ask for tweets.\n\nshort weighs in on mccain-trump feud\n\none spat with a member of congress has deteriorated even further: the relationship between trump and arizona republican sen. john mccain, who, even while being in his home state of arizona recovering from cancer treatment, still publicly criticizes the president. on monday, mccain referred to trump's news conference with vladimir putin – where trump appeared to back putin over the us intelligence community – as one of the most disgraceful performances by an american president in memory.\n\nshort reflected on what was probably one of the most salient mccain moments from trump's presidency: the arizona republican's vote against repealing obamacare in july 2017.\n\nwhen in post-midnight hour it ended in the dramatic way that it did, it certainly was disappointing, short said, adding, that since then, it's not as if senator mccain has stopped expressing his disappointment with president trump.\n\nthe outgoing legislative affairs director told cnn that he has personal relationships with people who advise mccain and that he would reach out to those contacts during contentious points.\n\ntrump's invites to the white house pay off\n\nshort said several times during the phone call interview to cnn that the president has forged relationships with members in a way that he claims trump's predecessor barack obama did not: by inviting members to the white house for lunches, dinners, movie nights and even bowling sessions.\n\nshort said that the obama administration bluntly admitted a pitfall of their administration to him as he assumed the role of legislative affairs director: he [president obama] did not fully utilize what the white house offers. he was obviously a very gifted orator … but using the allure of the white house and having members of congress over, it was not something that was fully utilized\n\nthose smaller gestures, short says, were the ones that went unnoticed or unreported by the press.\n\ndemocrat members of congress say to me that they were over at the white house more times in the first part of the trump administration than they were in the whole eight years of obama white house, he said.\n\ntrump and immigration\n\nperhaps one of the most elusive, recent targets in congress has been immigration. republicans in both chambers struggled with and ultimately did not pass legislation to address the expiring deferred action for childhood arrivals program, full funding for trump's campaign promise of a border wall or the issue of family separation at the border.\n\nduring the the most recent round of immigration debate in the house, trump publicly supported an immigration bill, then reversed on which immigration plan he supported. he appeared to change position several times and republican members of congress were dumbfounded.\n\n#changethelaws now is the best opportunity ever for congress to change the ridiculous and obsolete laws on immigration. get it done, always keeping in mind that we must have strong border security. trump tweeted in june.\n\na few days later, the president tweeted, republicans should stop wasting their time on immigration until after we elect more senators and congressmen/women in november. dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. we can pass great legislation after the red wave!\n\nin the days surrounding the house immigration votes earlier this summer, trump faced criticism – from members of his party own party – for what they considered erratic support for efforts by gop leadership to push a compromise bill on immigration. short explained trump's stance bluntly\n\ni understand where the house members are coming from but the president's perspective was, if this is such a difficult issue and one that is demagogued easily, he said, asking, why twist people's arms if the senate is never going to pass it and it's never going to reach my desk?\n\na new legislative director takes over\n\nas he hands the reins over to shahira knight, who has been serving as the deputy director of the national economic council at the white house, short has confidence that transition should be rather seamless for her and the team.\n\nknight worked closely with the president on the tax cut bill, and short says she has a significant amount of hill experience from working on the house ways and means committee earlier in her career. he describes knight as an incredibly bright person.\n\ni think there's a lot of continuity, short said. she understands the process well.\n\nryan also praised knight whom he'd work with on the tax bill.\n\nshahira played an important policy role during the crafting of our tax reform plan and i look forward to working with her on our larger legislative agenda, ryan said in his statement to cnn.\n\nshort will be a research fellow at the miller center at the university of virginia and teaching at the business school at uva, in addition to partnering with a friend in a consulting firm.\n\nif those options don't work out, short could have a future as a pundit. in a white house where television trumps all, short also became a prominent face of the administration, appearing on sunday morning political shows, local syndicate stations and cable news outlets with regularity. he said the appearances helped him in more ways than one.\n\nit was a not a role that i honestly thought would be a component. it has pluses and minuses. there are some members who when they see you as the face of the administration, they give you more attention and access.\n\nit also helped him with the boss – short told cnn that trump would notice his television appearances. when asked if trump was pleased with short's media performances, he responds, i probably think if he wasn't i wouldn't have been doing them.
dr. vanessa kerry is a critical care physician at mass general hospital, an associate professor at harvard medical school and ceo of seed global health, which partners with governments to invest in health care capacity for national, economic and human security. the views expressed here are solely hers. read more opinion on cnn.\n\n(cnn) the centers for disease control and prevention has warned americans to plan for the inevitable spread of the novel coronavirus (covid-19) across the country. if we are going to mount an adequate response to a potential pandemic, our preparation must include an acknowledgment of the fractured state of health care access in this country.\n\nwe need comprehensive coverage -- even if temporary -- to address the threat of covid-19.\n\nwithout a comprehensive solution, the story of osmel martinez azcue will be the first of what promises to be many more in the wake of covid-19. the miami herald reported that azcue was charged over $3,000 for being responsible and visiting the hospital to be screened for the novel coronavirus following a feverish return from china, the virus' epicenter.\n\nhe is responsible for paying the hospital at least $1,400 of the bill and it may be more pending meeting his insurance company's strict requirements. worries that they will confront bills like his will deter many from seeking appropriate care and put more people at risk.\n\nazcue has become the new face of an old and long-standing crisis in america: we lack universal health coverage. too many americans are either underinsured or completely uninsured\n\nin the global spread of covid-19, this will prove catastrophic. today, there are 27 million uninsured americans -- almost 10% of our population . and like azcue, 45% of americans are underinsured, with coverage that results in catastrophically high deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses they can't meet.\n\nfurther, the adult uninsured rate rose to a four year high in the fourth quarter of 2018. it stood at 13.7% due to a number of factors, one of which is the trump administration's efforts to undermine obamacare and the public health safety net.\n\nsystematic cuts by this administration and the republicans in congress have reduced the number of us citizens insured, undermined disease prevention and weakened vaccination efforts, to name a few. in 2017, congress repealed the insurance mandate and stopped reimbursing insurers for low-income deductible and copay waivers. insurance became less affordable and increased those who could opt out.\n\nin 2018, the trump administration doubled down , lengthening the time short-term insurance could be offered from the previously allowed three months to a year and flooding the market with cheaper alternatives; these plans limit coverage such as for incidences of cancer only or have strict requirements before coverage kicks in like the plan azcue has.\n\naccording to the miami herald, he pays $180 per month but is required to provide three years of medical records before his emergency room coverage would bring his bill down to a still sizable $1,400. consumers seeking better deals are left vulnerable. when our citizens are sick, this administration's actions endanger americans' health and wallets, and it undermines access and coverage that is essential for surveillance, detection and early response in the face of an outbreak -- like covid-19.\n\nunfortunately, the worst is not over. president trump falsely assured the american public that we have taken all preparations necessary, but in his recently proposed budget he called for another $844 billion in cuts over the next decade primarily from medicaid, including the affordable care act's (aca) medicaid expansion to low-income adults and other aspects of the aca.\n\nwhile congress and the administration debate the size of an emergency funding package, ensuring comprehensive access to screening and care should be at the heart of any discussion. in the us, we have been struggling with testing capacity and lack a central count of how many people have been asked to self-quarantine or are being monitored by health professionals across the country.\n\ncontrast this with other countries like the uk which have tested thousands and been proactive about identifying the full scope of their outbreak. on sunday, data out of washington state reinforced that we have been too conservative; genetic mapping of the virus in the community indicate that the covid-19 has likely been circulating for weeks.\n\nincontrovertibly, we will need to broaden the criteria by which we test immediately. if the us government wants to demonstrate its strength, it should show its commitment to protect its people in the face of threat. we need to provide leadership -- and head-on investment in our health system so that it can protect and care for americans. we need to broaden the available coverage, public health interventions and access to care. there are options.\n\nwe should engage in multilingual, multilevel community health education efforts that target all communities and backgrounds in america. in a strong example of the power of reverse innovation, ebola in west africa taught us powerful lessons about how to create culture change around disease prevention and to reach all communities.\n\nwhen imams launched an awareness campaign and spoke about the importance of changing the cultural burial practices for muslim victims, their authority and trust helped stem the rise of new infection. we have a diverse population, all at risk in one way or another. we should be thoughtful about how we reach communities that are vulnerable and our avenues of messaging about the virus.\n\nfar more difficult, but also critical, will be creating safe havens for undocumented immigrants to seek care. given this administration's vehement attacks on immigrants, such an approach feels unfathomable. ensuring access for all in our borders -- however temporary in the face of a public health crisis -- is the only option to containment in the united states.\n\nremoving financial barriers or subsequent punishment for those seeking screening or care will be essential to encouraging engagement with formal public health and health delivery systems, which must be on the front lines of containing covid-19.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter. join us on twitter and facebook\n\nthe discussion for a universal health care plan is front and center in the 2020 election. beyond covid-19, we need to pursue a better path to universal health coverage. the road for the required fix is long and there has not been the political will or leverage from any side to close the gap once and for all. in the face of covid-19, we don't have the luxury of political fighting. we need the political sophistication, humility and courage to ensure care for all.\n\ncovid-19 presents a serious threat to our security and well-being. we would be well-served to build a comprehensive system to address this particular threat, which can hopefully provide a springboard for a better system overall.

wikileaks. as a leading senator says his committee has still found no proof of collusion, the chairman of the house intelligence committee, adam schiff, responds.\n\n\n\n(end videotape)\n\n\n\nbash: hello. i'm dana bash, in for jake tapper, in washington, where the state of our union is facing a constitutional showdown. president trump is at his golf resort in florida this weekend after\n\n\n\ndeclaring a national emergency on friday in order to secure funding for a wall along the southern border. it's intended to bypass congress and allow the president to redirect billions of federal dollars toward the wall.\n\n\n\nthe move is already facing challenges in the courts. and democrats are vowing to try to stop the president legislatively. some republicans are also criticizing the tactic. senator marco rubio said -- quote -- no crisis justifies violating the constitution.\n\n\n\nand just like he did in 2016, president trump is making the wall a central part of his 2020 reelection campaign. he held a rally this past week in el paso, texas, and displayed signs reading finish that wall, even though no new wall has been built.\n\n\n\ndemocrats, for their part, they are on the campaign trail pushing back on the national emergency declaration, calling it manufactured and inappropriate.\n\n\n\nand, as president trump hones his 2020 strategy, some in the democratic party are looking to a candidate who hasn't decided yet whether to run, and that candidate, potential candidate, is democratic senator sherrod brown, a longtime progressive and proud populist.\n\n\n\nand he joins me now from his home state of ohio.\n\n\n\ngood morning, senator. thank you so much for joining me.\n\n\n\nsen. sherrod brown (d), ohio: good to be back. thanks, dana.\n\n\n\nbash: let's start with the president's national emergency declaration.\n\n\n\nyou said it seems like he's trying to ignore the constitution. but you defended president obama for taking executive actions on immigration when congress wouldn't act. so, why is it ok for president obama and not president trump?\n\n\n\nbrown: well, this is the first kind of emergency we have seen like this that a president has done this.\n\n\n\nhe couldn't get the mexicans to build the wall. he couldn't get congress to vote the money in. this is the -- in fact, the first emergency declaration like this in -- with that kind of construct, where he got turned down by congress and then went ahead and did it.\n\n\n\nthat's why you see so many republicans saying, don't do this. republicans are afraid that he's going to take the money from somewhere else and something they care about, but, fundamentally, they think it's a president who failed, who hates to lose, who is acting childish, and is -- is violating the constitution.\n\n\n\nrepublican after republican is telling us that privately. we will have a vote on this likely in the next two or three weeks. see if those republicans show the backbone that they generally haven't shown standing up to this president in the past.\n\n\n\nbut this is more serious, because it's a constitutional question. so i take them at their word that they will stand up to him.\n\n\n\nbash: senator, in a series of tweets on friday, you said several other topics were actually national emergencies like gun violence.\n\n\n\nrepublicans have shown no willingness to pursue new gun control legislation. so, if you were president, would you declare a national emergency on gun violence?\n\n\n\nbrown: no, i don't think you think -- as a potential president, i don't think any candidate or sitting president should think, well, these are the big problems, i'm going to go after them with a national emergency -- as a national emergency.\n\n\n\ni mean, i -- when you look at gun violence, when you look at opioids, when you look at infrastructure, how we have failed, this government has failed to address those issues, you need presidential leadership to do that.\n\n\n\nlook back 50 years, when congress and the white house in our country realized that tobacco was a huge public health threat. all of the federal government, with all kinds of local community, people, governments, businesses, labor unions, all pulled together.\n\n\n\nwe have cut the rate of smoking in half and cut it by even more than that among young people.\n\n\n\nbash: but...\n\n\n\n[09:05:02]\n\n\n\nbrown: so you need a president that's going to do that on opioids, call on a national -- it's -- whether it's called an emergency or not, get people engaged that way, not sign a resolution like this, and then go out and make speeches, like this president is doing, without really dressing real emergencies, because this isn't the emergency that gun violence is and infrastructure is and opioids is.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbash: one more specific question on the border wall.\n\n\n\nformer texas congressman beto o'rourke says he supports taking the border wall, the border fencing in and around el paso, where he's from, down, because he said it hasn't made the country safer. do you think the existing walls and fencing along the border should come down?\n\n\n\nbrown: i don't live in el paso, and i take the congressman there at his word.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbash: but you are a united states senator who does these policies. brown: i understand that.\n\n\n\nbut i don't think you look at the border wall in a 12-mile area. i take a back seat to nobody in border security, and it's clear we have learned over time that we have the technology, helicopters, border agents, to make our country safe and to keep -- to keep illegal crossings at a minimum without building a long wall.\n\n\n\nthat's a decision that should be made in the whole context. you don't say, well, this congressman says take it down here, this congressman says build it up there. you really want to look more broadly than that.\n\n\n\nbash: senator, let's talk about the policy debates going on within the democratic party right now.\n\n\n\nand i want to start with health care. you just introduced a bill this past week that would allow americans over 50 years old to buy into medicare. but more than 20 million people are uninsured under the age of 50. so a lot of your colleagues, as you know, are supporting medicare for all, a plan that would cover everyone.\n\n\n\nwhy aren't you?\n\n\n\nbrown: well, i support universal coverage, and have since i paid my own health insurance when i first came to congress, promised to do that, paid it for years.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbash: but why doesn't this plan cover everybody?\n\n\n\nbrown: no, no, no, i understand that. i'm just giving you a little background of where...\n\n\n\nbash: sure.\n\n\n\nbrown: ... what -- my background in this.\n\n\n\nbut i want to help people now. i want to expand medicare to 50. we did that 10 years ago. we fell one vote short, when senator lieberman changed his vote. that would have been part of the affordable care act, medicare at 55 in those days.\n\n\n\nour bill now, with senator stabenow and others, is to bring medicare, a voluntary buy-in at 50. i want to help people. now, if we get enough people, we will see a lot of people get in -- in that plan, 58- year-olds and 62-year-olds that have lost their insurance, lost their jobs. we will see the success of that, and that will end up continuing to broaden and expand coverage for so many americans.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbash: and what would your plan be in the short term to cover people under 50? brown: well, you -- first of all, you go to congress and you fix the\n\n\n\nproblems with the affordable care act. you stop the attacks that president obama has made on the -- with the navigators.\n\n\n\nhe's taken people -- he's basically fired people that help people get on insurance that could get -- that could get subsidized insurance and be in the exchanges, that could get to medicaid. government needs an all-in in helping people get on medicaid.\n\n\n\ni think that if we -- again, i go back, and i want to help people now, and helping people now is building on the affordable care act, not -- not repealing obamacare, which is what they suggest. it's making sure we fix the consumer protections for preexisting conditions.\n\n\n\nbash: do you...\n\n\n\nbrown: it's all of those things. that will mean a lot more people almost immediately can get insurance. and that's the way i want to go.\n\n\n\nbash: do you not think that medicare for all is practical?\n\n\n\nbrown: i think medicare for all will take a while. and it's difficult. and it's selling to people who now have insurance that would have to -- they would have their insurance plans canceled and move into a government plan.\n\n\n\ni think that's difficult. i want to help people now. that's why you do medicare at 50.\n\n\n\nbash: well...\n\n\n\nbrown: i want to build -- again, i say, i want to build on the obamacare, not repeal it with a whole new plan.\n\n\n\nbash: one more health care question.\n\n\n\nbrown: sure.\n\n\n\nbash: do you believe there's a place for private health insurance?\n\n\n\nbrown: yes. i just said that. i said that in so many words, that you build on the affordable care act.\n\n\n\nbash: right.\n\n\n\nbrown: you don't wipe it off, wipe it away and then come up with something new that will take time and will cause people angst and anguish to move to a different plan.\n\n\n\nbash: got...\n\n\n\nbrown: give people the options now at medicare at 50, fix the affordable care act, get rid of the -- do the consumer -- strengthen consumer protections on the -- on the -- on the -- when insurance companies cancel their plans, preexisting conditions. bash: senator, let's move on to jobs, a big topic for you, i know.\n\n\n\nthere's a really big divide in your party over amazon. they backed out of plans to build a second headquarters in new york city. amazon had promised 25,000 new jobs. you spend so much of your time talking about the dignity of work.\n\n\n\ndid progressives in new york who lobbied against amazon make a mistake?\n\n\n\nbrown: no, i -- i don't think this is a big division in the party.\n\n\n\n[09:10:04]\n\n\n\ni think there's local communities that resent giving huge tax breaks to billionaires, as those of us in congress fight against giving big tax breaks to billionaires, whether you look at foxconn in wisconsin or amazon in various places.\n\n\n\nwhat we need to do is look at it more broadly. my patriot corporation act is simple. it simply says, you throw out the trump tax bill, the trillion-and-a-half-dollar mostly giveaway to the richest people in this country and to huge corporations. that's fundamentally what it was. seventy percent of the benefits went to the top 1 percent.\n\n\n\nyou then implement the patriot -- my patriot corporation act simply says, if you play by the rules, you pay decent wages and benefits, you do your production in the united states, you get a lower tax rate.\n\n\n\nbut if you are one of those companies, big, big companies, executives making millions, but you pay a lot of your workers $10 and $12 and $15 an hour, and they are eligible for food stamps and eligible for medicaid and eligible for section 8 housing, you have a -- you levy on them a corporate freeloader fee.\n\n\n\nthey reimburse taxpayers for the money that we, as taxpayers, spend subsidizing their employees. that will make a fairer tax system. and we won't -- we won't see these companies coming into communities and just ask -- demanding huge tax breaks in order to locate there.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbash: so you -- you just talked about your corporate tax plan.\n\n\n\ni want to ask you about another policy proposal that you say would help working families. it would double the earned income tax credit, expand the child tax credit. how are you going to pay for that?\n\n\n\nbrown: well, you pay for it by -- as i said earlier, you -- that's part of the corporate freeloader fee in the patriot corporation act. in our plan that you just mentioned, it will expand earned income tax...\n\n\n\nbash: but would that cover it?\n\n\n\nbrown: oh, yes. you pay for it by -- you wipe off the books, the trump tax bill, that blew a trillion-and-a-half-dollar hole in the budget. you start with, instead of giving those tax breaks to the wealthiest people in this country, you focus those tax breaks on corporations that, shall we say, are patriotic, do their production here.\n\n\n\nyou have revenue coming in from the patriot freeloader fee and -- from the corporate freeloader fee, and then the money -- then you will have money available for middle-income, $20,000, $30,000, $40,000, $50,000, $60,000 a year.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbash: how do you feel about the marginal tax rate on the super rich? should that also be increased?\n\n\n\nbrown: i don't -- there will be a lot of individual questions on when a senator or a campaign offers a tax plan or a congresswoman or a congressman does the same.\n\n\n\ni want to -- i want to build into -- so, i'm not going to answer each one individually.\n\n\n\nbash: but you think you can -- you think you can do your plan without raising the marginal tax rate for the super rich? i guess that's my question. can you do it with -- just with the corporate changes?\n\n\n\nbrown: no, i think -- well, i answered that earlier by -- by saying eliminate the trump tax bill.\n\n\n\nbash: uh-huh. and...\n\n\n\nbrown: the trump -- trump tax law -- and let's go from there and see.\n\n\n\ni mean, i, of course, support a graduated income tax. i always have. i mean, i -- from my votes against the iraq war 20 years ago, to my support for marriage equality, i have always been a progressive, and i'm consistent on tax policy.\n\n\n\ni just don't want to pick this -- pick this one off the menu and that one off the menu and say yes to that and no to that.\n\n\n\nbash: yes.\n\n\n\nbrown: i want a comprehensive tax bill.\n\n\n\nbut, fundamentally, it's aimed towards middle-class benefits, having the wealthy pay their fair share...\n\n\n\nbash: just...\n\n\n\nbrown: ... getting corporations to act responsibly for communities, rather than rigging the system, so that they don't play off community against community...\n\n\n\nbash: and just to... brown: ... and worker against worker.\n\n\n\nbash: ... put a button on this, you -- you -- it sounds like you are saying taxes should go up for the wealthy and people who have gotten tax breaks.\n\n\n\nbrown: of course. the wealthy -- the wealthy have had huge tax breaks over the years.\n\n\n\nthe trump tax plan, 70 percent went to the wealthiest 1 percent. of course taxes should go up for them.\n\n\n\nbut i'm -- and that -- but that's all part of a plan to make corporations actually operate in the -- to align corporations incentives with what's good for communities. we haven't done that. we have aligned -- corporations' incentives have been what's good for corporations.\n\n\n\nbash: senator...\n\n\n\nbrown: that hasn't worked.\n\n\n\nwe have seen wages -- we've seen productivity go up. we have seen corporate -- corporate profits go up. we have seen corporate executive compensation explode, but wages have been flat. it's partly because of a tax system. it's partly because of a trade policy that sells out american workers and fundamentally sells out american communities.\n\n\n\nbash: senator, before i let you go, you traveled to two of the four early voting states. have you learned anything that would keep you out of the race?\n\n\n\nbrown: no, i haven't learned -- i have learned a lot of things about communities.\n\n\n\nand i have been to iowa, new hampshire, and we're going to nevada and south carolina in the next couple of weeks. connie and i go -- connie and i go together.\n\n\n\nwe will have a timetable in the next couple, three weeks to make a decision. and i...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbash: are the odds still 50/50, as you have said before?\n\n\n\nbrown: probably, more or less. i don't -- yes.\n\n\n\nbash: higher?\n\n\n\nbrown: i don't know, 50/50, 51/49.\n\n\n\n(laughter)\n\n\n\nbrown: i don't know. bash: all right, senator, thank you so much for joining me this morning. i appreciate it.\n\n\n\nbrown: thanks, dana, always. thank you.\n\n\n\nbash: and, as the mueller investigation appears to be nearing an end, house democrats say their probe is only just beginning. will they accept the special counsel's results?\n\n\n\nwe will ask the chairman of the house intelligence committee next.\n\n\n\n[09:15:07]\n\n\n\nand a top trump adviser called president obama imperial for trying to get around the will of congress, but what about now that president trump is doing the same thing?\n\n\n\nstay with us.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\nbash: welcome back to state of the union. i'm dana bash.\n\n\n\nmore legal trouble for former trump associates.\n\n\n\nthe special counsel is recommending up to 24 years in prison for former trump campaign chairman paul manafort for financial crimes, as prosecutors revealed for the first time that they uncovered direct communications between roger stone and wikileaks, an allegation that raises more questions about how involved the former trump associate was in getting information about hacked russian e-mails.\n\n\n\njoining me now is the chairman of the house intelligence committee, congressman adam schiff of california.\n\n\n\nthere are so many questions to get to about the russia investigation, but first i want to ask you about the president's decision to declare a national emergency on the border.\n\n\n\nyou called the decision -- quote -- plainly unconstitutional. but the law does give the president broad discretion on when to invoke these statutes. and congress has never really defined what a national emergency is.\n\n\n\n[09:20:03]\n\n\n\nso, why is it unconstitutional?\n\n\n\nrep. adam schiff (d), california: well, because this is the first time a president has tried to declare an emergency when congress explicitly rejected funding for the particular project that the president is advocating.\n\n\n\nand in saying just the other day that he didn't really need to do this, he just wanted to do it because it would help things go faster, he's pretty much daring the court to strike this down. so it's hard to imagine a poorer case.\n\n\n\nbut i will say this, dana. it's going to be a real test for my gop colleagues in congress and their devotion to the institution. if we give away, if we surrender the power of the purse, which is our most important power, there will be little check and no balance left. it will not be a separation of powers anymore, just a separation of parties.\n\n\n\nso this is going to be a moment of truth for my gop colleagues.\n\n\n\nbash: well, and you are referring, of course, to what the house is likely to do and later the senate, which is a joint resolution to terminate the president's national emergency.\n\n\n\nbut let me ask you about potentially going a step further, because that would be hard to get a veto-proof majority on in both chambers. do you think that congress should actually change the law, so that the president can no longer declare a national emergency without the support of congress?\n\n\n\nschiff: well, there are reasons why a president should have an ability to declare an emergency -- that is, under a real emergency. that's plainly not the case here.\n\n\n\nand the risk the president takes, the risk to future presidencies, is that we limit the president's power to act when it really is necessary, when it is not practical to bring the congress into session on a moment's notice.\n\n\n\nbut this president doesn't care about future presidents. he only cares about himself. and, in this case, he only cares about placating his conservative critics.\n\n\n\nbash: let's talk about the mueller investigation.\n\n\n\nwe learned on friday that the special counsel obtained evidence of roger stone's direct communication with wikileaks, which he had said before didn't exist. and we also know that stone was coordinating with a senior trump campaign official, and those e-mails were hacked by the russians.\n\n\n\nso what does that tell you?\n\n\n\nschiff: well, it tells me that, as we have seen in other cases that the special counsel has brought, the full story is not in the indictment, that it is very possible that the best evidence is yet to come, that, in fact, here, there were search warrants executed on multiple accounts of these russian hackers that reveal communications between roger stone and wikileaks, and essentially directly with the gru and roger stone, because the gru is acting with the persona guccifer 2.0.\n\n\n\nthe substance of those communications can be very telling. it may go to what roger stone was trying to find out. it may go to whether he was communicating that information to people back in the white house. it could be very revealing. and we will just have to wait to find out.\n\n\n\nbash: this week, the chair, your counterpart in the senate, the republican chair of the intelligence committee, richard burr, said that his committee has found nothing to suggest collusion between the trump campaign and russia.\n\n\n\nyou said -- quote -- that's not our view in the house.\n\n\n\nbut, you know, burr hasn't exactly been a rabid partisan on this. until the last couple of weeks, he's been working very closely with the democrats. so, why do you think he's wrong?\n\n\n\nschiff: well, it's not just that i think he's wrong. mark warner, the vice chair of the intel committee in the senate, also disagrees with that assessment.\n\n\n\nbut, look, you can see evidence in plain sight on the issue of collusion, pretty compelling evidence. now, there's a difference between seeing evidence of collusion and being able to prove a criminal conspiracy beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n\nbut mr. -- chairman burr must have a different word for it, because, when you look, for example, at the e-mails to set up the meeting in trump tower, it was offered to the trump campaign, to the president's own son, dirt on hillary clinton as part of what was described as the russian government's effort to help donald trump in the campaign.\n\n\n\nand the response from the campaign was, we would love to have the help.\n\n\n\nnow, that's an offer of help. that's an acceptance of help. there's an overt act in the trump tower in furtherance of that. and, of course, that's not even contemplating the discussions with george papadopoulos or the information about the efforts that mike flynn made to work with the russian ambassador secretly to undermine sanctions and then lie about that.\n\n\n\nall of this is evidence of collusion. and you either have to look the other way to say it isn't, or you have to have a different word for it, because it is a corrupt dealing with a foreign adversary during a campaign.\n\n\n\nbut, again, it will be up to mueller to determine whether that amounts to criminal conspiracy.\n\n\n\nbash: well -- well, on that note, we expect at some point, maybe soon, maybe not, the findings of the mueller investigation to finally be completed.\n\n\n\n[09:25:00]\n\n\n\nif he finds that there was no direct collusion between the trump campaign and russia, will you accept that?\n\n\n\nschiff: well, we're going to have to do our own investigation. and we are. we will certainly be very interested to learn what bob mueller finds.\n\n\n\nwe may have to fight to get that information. bill barr has not been willing to commit to provide that report, either to the congress or to the american people. we're going to need to see it. the american people are going to need to see it.\n\n\n\nwe may also need to see the evidence behind that report. there may be, for example, evidence of collusion or conspiracy that is clear and convincing, but not proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\n\n\nthe american people are entitled to know if there is evidence of a conspiracy between either the president or the president's campaign and a foreign adversary.\n\n\n\nat the end of the day, the most important thing for the american people to know is whether the president is somehow compromised, whether there's leverage that the russians could use over the president. and if the russians are in a position to expose wrongdoing by the president or his campaign, that's compromising.\n\n\n\nbash: you're -- you are talking about transparency, but i guess the question is, in terms of what the substance of his -- his findings are, robert mueller, will you -- given the fact he has had such an extensive investigation, will you accept the findings, separate from the investigation that you are doing?\n\n\n\nschiff: you know, i will certainly accept them in this way, dana. i have great confidence in the special counsel.\n\n\n\nand if the special counsel represents that he has investigated, and not been interfered with, and not been able to make a criminal case, then i will believe that he is operating in good faith.\n\n\n\nbash: federal prosecutors are still considering whether to bring charges against former fbi deputy director andrew mccabe, after he allegedly lied to investigators about authorizing leaks to the media.\n\n\n\nnow, we have seen at least five trump associates indicted for just that, lying to investigators. do you think mccabe should be prosecuting -- prosecuted for doing the same thing?\n\n\n\nschiff: well, the justice department received a referral from the inspector general. i think they need to study that and the evidence, and they need to make an objective determination about it.\n\n\n\ni think he should be held to the same standard as anyone else that the justice department has looked at in this investigation or any other.\n\n\n\nbash: a little bit of 2020 politics before i let you go.\n\n\n\nthe governor of your state, gavin newsom, endorsed california senator kamala harris in the democratic primary for 2020. he joined four of your fellow california representatives in congress.\n\n\n\nso, what about you? are you going to endorse senator harris for president? schiff: i haven't made any decisions in the presidential race yet.\n\n\n\nit's still very early.\n\n\n\nbut i have to say, i have been very impressed with kamala harris as a senator, and i have been extremely impressed with her as a candidate for president.\n\n\n\nin a rare bout of truthfulness by president trump, he acknowledged what a superb rollout she's had. and i think we can already compare her favorably with some of the other candidates this early. but i'm not ready to make a decision.\n\n\n\nbash: ok.\n\n\n\ncalifornia representative and chairman of the house intelligence committee adam schiff, thank you so much for joining me this morning.\n\n\n\nschiff: thank you.\n\n\n\nbash: the president's power play is forcing some republican lawmakers to make a tough choice: support their principles or their president.\n\n\n\ni will ask a prominent trump supporter what he thinks next.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[09:32:36]\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\ntrump: i didn't need to do this, but i'd rather do it much faster. and i don't have to do it for the election. i've already done a lot of wall for the election, 2020.\n\n\n\nand the only reason we're up here talking about this is because of the election. because they want to try and win an election which it looks like they're not going to be able to do.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nbash: welcome back to state of the union. i'm dana bash.\n\n\n\npresident trump, you heard him there, seeming to undercut his own argument that there is an emergency at the border. we've got my panel with me. let's discuss.\n\n\n\nsenator santorum, let's start with you. you are a republican who his expressed reservations about using this executive power. if you were in the senate still, would you vote on that principle or vote with the president?\n\n\n\nrick santorum, cnn senior political commentator: look, i think the president has the authority to do it. so it's hard for me as a senator to say, well, i disagree with him on the principle that he could exercise national emergency. he can. the congress gave him broad authority to do it. should he have done it in this interest (ph)? the answer is, no. i think he could have done in this interest (ph). i think he could have -- he could have done and in fact, most of the money if you look at his spending, he could have spent that without declaring a national emergency.\n\n\n\ni don't think it was the right thing to do. he gave the reason as to why he's doing it because it makes it easier for him to deploy the money. declaring this national emergency gives him the authority not just to rearrange the money but to be able to bypass some things to be able to get his wall built.\n\n\n\nso there's -- there are lots of reasons he did it. i think to be consistent, having had criticized president obama for things far worse than what this president is doing, i think it's -- i think it's consistent for me to have voted no.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\njennifer granholm, cnn political commentator: the real reason that he did it, the real reason, i mean, there's a national emergency. but it doesn't have to do with what's going on at the border. he saw what was going on in congress. he thought this weekend, if they got -- if he signed a bill that didn't fund the wall, that we'd all be talking about what a loser he was, that he had failed in the budget negotiations.\n\n\n\nso he has to do something to change the subject. so he declared a fake crisis, a fake emergency at the border. and then what happens is that he puts it all on republicans to try to remedy the problem.\n\n\n\nand what are the republicans going to do? i appreciate the fact you say -- of you saying you'd not vote for it. i think there were a few other republicans over the past couple of day who said that.\n\n\n\n[09:35:01]\n\n\n\nbut mitch mcconnell who has come out so strongly in favor of congressional authority, the national emergency that's going on is that the president is usurping the constitution and taking away the power of congress for a fake emergency.\n\n\n\nsantorum: that's not true.\n\n\n\ngranholm: and they are allowing him to do it. if they allow this to go forward, he has pants them and they are saying, hit me again.\n\n\n\nsantorum: that simply -- that simply is not true. he has the authority.\n\n\n\ngranholm: it is true.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nsantorum: national emergency that the congress --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ngranholm: not for a fake emergency, rick. it is a fake emergency.\n\n\n\nsantorum: look at the other, quote, emergencies. sierra leone, congo, myanmar (ph) --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ngranholm: those are national crises that are happening in those countries.\n\n\n\nsantorum: they were not national -- they're not national emergencies.\n\n\n\ngranholm: this is fake.\n\n\n\nsantorum: he has every right to do what he's doing, i just don't agree that he should be --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nlinda chavez, former reagan administration official: we're not going to settle here whether or not he has the right. it is going to go into the courts. and he's right about that.\n\n\n\nit's probably going to be struck down. what will happen in the supreme court will be interesting. it will be interesting to see whether conservatives on that court, you know, look at the constitution and say article i says that congress has the right to appropriate money and he's been turned down on this.\n\n\n\nhe did it because he couldn't get his way. he's not the great negotiator that everybody said he was. and, frankly, that whole press conference he had, i think the real crisis here is the president's state of mind.\n\n\n\nthat was the most bizarre performance --\n\n\n\ngranholm: yes.\n\n\n\nchavez: -- i have ever seen in my 40-some years of politics in washington, d.c. never have i seen anything like that.\n\n\n\nbash: you are the sitting member of congress at this table. what do you think you guys are going to do?\n\n\n\nrep. anthony brown (d-md), armed services committee: well, there's going to be i think a two-pronged response. there's going to be a resolution of disapproval and they'll be a majority both i think in the house, clearly, as well as in the senate now. there's also going to be litigation filed.\n\n\n\nthere will be litigation filed by members of congress. we're already seeing litigation by property owners, state government, local government. this is going to be tied up in the courts.\n\n\n\nbut, look, i agree. the crisis is in the oval office and not on the border. the president is declaring a national emergency as he even stated in his announcement yesterday or the day before because of 2020 and what he anticipates to be a tough re-election.\n\n\n\njust like he sent active duty troops to the border before the 2018 midterms. he fabricates a crisis, calls it a national emergency for political purposes.\n\n\n\nbash: i want to play some -- some sound that our cnn's kfile found from the chief of staff, mick mulvaney, former member of the house articulating conservative opposition to then president declaring a national state of emergency.\n\n\n\n(begin audio clip)\n\n\n\nrep. mick mulvaney (r), south carolina: an imperial presidency is dangerous for everyone and i think this is -- this is the premier issue right now in washington, d.c. i don't think we're going to get anything across the president's desk that will pass a veto, but i do think we should put it on his desk and let him know that the elected officials of congress, republican and democrat alike, object to him going around congress.\n\n\n\n(end audio clip)\n\n\n\nsantorum: but the big difference here is what the president did on daca, president obama, and what he did on the obamacare. both were counter to what the congress wanted, just like what this president is doing. but he had absolutely no authority to do so, none.\n\n\n\nin this case, congress passed a law called the national emergencies act which gives the president broad authority to do it. this is not a constitutional issue. this is unlike what obama did. obama was blatant and unconstitutional.\n\n\n\nhere's the problem. no democrat fought obama. everyone said oh, he's doing what we want so we're all for it. and that's the dishonesty that we're seeing out of the democratic party. it was clear there was no authority whatsoever to do it. they didn't oppose it.\n\n\n\nchavez: i'm sorry, can we just --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nsantorum: i don't think he should --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nchavez: we have to have the facts here. on daca, the president did have the authority to not deport children who had arrived here. that was what --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nsantorum: but he went beyond that.\n\n\n\nchavez: he went beyond that and gave work permits. but he has the authority not to --\n\n\n\nbash: i hate to do this. we have to take a break. we've got a lot more to talk about.\n\n\n\ndon't worry, you're not going anywhere.\n\n\n\ngranholm: yes. we got to come back on that point.\n\n\n\nbash: a decision by amazon is dividing the democratic party. we're going to talk about that and this, next.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[09:43:32]\n\n\n\nbash: welcome back. let's continue our conversation about the president's national emergency declaration which, by the way, was continuing in a very lively way during the break.\n\n\n\ngranholm: i just want to respond to rick's point about this hypocrisy. number one, obama didn't use a national emergency, a fake national emergency to take money --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nsantorum: no authority.\n\n\n\ngranholm: to take money that congress had previously appropriated for other purposes to fund daca or dapa because they didn't require that funding.\n\n\n\nsantorum: obamacare didn't.\n\n\n\ngranholm: and importantly the executive order was temporary. it was not a long-term -- this is a permanent wall to fund a fake emergency that everybody --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbrown: two other points on this also with the daca and dream act, congress refused to act. the house wouldn't take it up. but i think important is that the american people overwhelmingly supported a fix for daca, just as today americans overwhelmingly reject the idea of a wall and a national emergency to build the wall. so there are plenty of distinctions and differences between daca and the wall.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nsantorum: of course, you're ignoring the affordable care act where he took money that was not appropriated, specifically under that. the congress said, no, we're not giving you this money. and he took it from somewhere else and spent it to subsidize insurance companies.\n\n\n\nyou ignore that. that's a reality. he had no authority. the court struck him down from doing it and you all applauded him doing it.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbash: i want to talk about what a prominent democrat who ran in texas and lost, your former colleague beto o'rourke, said about the wall.\n\n\n\n[09:45:01]\n\n\n\nhe said basically that he believes that the wall should be taken down in his hometown of el paso, texas. what do you think?\n\n\n\nbrown: i don't think we should be removing physical barriers. i mean, congress appropriated $1.375 billion this go around, $1.3 billion before. there are physical barriers that impede pedestrian movement across the border, vehicular movement on the border.\n\n\n\nwe focused on funding those barriers that resemble the designs that are currently deployed. so that's what we ought to do. there's no nation in the world that doesn't protect its borders. i reject the idea that we should take down walls.\n\n\n\nbash: is that going -- is that going to hurt him?\n\n\n\ngranholm: i don't -- i don't know. i don't know if it is or not. i totally agree with you.\n\n\n\ni mean, ,you have to -- as democrats have been saying, some portions need physical barriers. some need technological barriers. you need to be (inaudible) security --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbash: so you would not take down --\n\n\n\ngranholm: no.\n\n\n\nchavez: this is playing right into president trump's hands. i mean, really, this, you know, abolish ice, tear down the wall. we do need walls in some places. we don't need it for 2,000 miles and we don't need it to be a concrete barrier but having a wall in california, having a wall in texas where there are ports of entries and where you want to protect the area around it, it did, in fact, diminish the flow of people illegally into the united states when those sections of the wall were built.\n\n\n\nbash: ok. let's talk about amazon pulling out of new york city because the progressives elected and otherwise in new york city, lobbied against it.\n\n\n\nthe mayor of new york city bill de blasio defended the deal in a new york times op-ed this morning. and here's what he said, the agreement we struck with amazon back in november was a solid foundation. the retail giant's expansion in new york encountered opposition in no small part because of growing frustration with corporate america. the lesson here is that corporations can't ignore rising anger over economic inequality anymore.\n\n\n\nwould you have rejected those jobs? granholm: oh, no. i would have never rejected a single job.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ngranholm: all kinds of jobs for all kinds of people. so, no. i would have been thrilled to get amazon. i understand why bill de blasio wanted them and why cuomo really pushed for it. and why virginia is going to benefit enormously as a result of this.\n\n\n\nit's a shame that they, you know, that they didn't -- but i do think the point that de blasio is making about how a lot of these technology platforms have exacerbated income inequality and it's hard to look away from the fact jeff bezos is the richest man in the entire world. and amazon is a hugely successful corporation that, obviously, didn't need the tax breaks that were going to be spent.\n\n\n\nwhen that money could have been spent -- it would have been great if amazon agreed to like -- fix the subway. part of it.\n\n\n\nbash: what does it say about where progressives are -- the power of progressives in your party?\n\n\n\nbrown: well, first of all let me -- look -- first of all let me say we have plenty of progressives in maryland, and we were vying for amazon to come to maryland. we're glad they're coming to northern virginia. we'll benefit in maryland.\n\n\n\nbut i think it's important to focus on -- when you're talking about that public/private partnership to attract a large corporation and plenty of jobs, i think you focus less on the corporate subsidies and the tax incentives and focus on the infrastructure that you're going to bring to that community to support. and it's not just roads and rail but it's workforce development. it's affordable housing.\n\n\n\nand when you -- when you have that kind of partnership and you pitch that to the local community, you'll get the kind of support you need to bring 25,000 jobs. we'll gladly take them in maryland.\n\n\n\nchavez: instead of the big tax breaks. how about just lowering your tax rates in states like new york and then you will in fact attract more businesses as states with lower tax rates do.\n\n\n\ngranholm: you know what amazon paid in taxes last year? zero in federal taxes. zero. largely because of the tax breaks that the federal government --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nsantorum: because they lost money for a long period of time. anyway, the bottom line is bill de blasio is duplicitous in this op-ed because he was one of the reasons they didn't come because of his comments that were hostile to amazon about bringing unions in and all that sort of stuff. so he can -- he can -- he can say that he --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nsantorum: he was very hostile. and so the reality is that you are now seeing america look at what socialism looks like.\n\n\n\ngranholm: oh, come on.\n\n\n\nsantorum: it is hostile to the private sector. it plays class warfare no matter how beneficial those things are. and it's not going to be beneficial --\n\n\n\ngranholm: what?\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbash: we're going to have to continue this one in the green room. maybe you guys can do live tweeting. thank you so much. what a great discussion.\n\n\n\nthere are now more women than ever in congress and on the presidential campaign trail. and they are bringing a new approach to politics as usual. stay with us.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[09:53:53]\n\n\n\nbash: if 2018 was the campaign year of the woman, 2019 is the year women take the

changed who is at the decision-making table, we would change everything.\n\n\n\nbash: three years after a woman made history as the first female major party nominee, now half the democratic 2020 field is female and many view their gender as a selling point.\n\n\n\nsen. kamala harris (d), california: my mother used to say to me, kamala, you may be the first to do many things, but make sure you're

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\neditor's note: this story was originally published on march 10, 2019, after michigan republican rep. justin amash declined to rule out a 2020 challenge to president donald trump. it has been updated to reflect his july 4 departure from the republican party.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nfor most republicans, life in the house minority is a big change. but for rep. justin amash, in a sense, it's more of the same.\n\nit's just a different set of people doing the wrong thing, the michigan republican said in a march interview with cnn.\n\namash came to congress with the tea party wave in 2010, and although republicans controlled the house for the entirety of his congressional career until a few months ago, amash has long been the odd man out.\n\nhis firm libertarian stances on foreign policy, surveillance and federal spending put him in an awkward position with many in his own party. and two years into donald trump's presidency, amash appears lonelier than ever.\n\non thursday he announced he would break with the republican party, decrying partisanship in washington.\n\ntoday, i am declaring my independence and leaving the republican party, amash wrote in a washington post op-ed thursday morning. no matter your circumstance, i'm asking you to join me in rejecting the partisan loyalties and rhetoric that divide and dehumanize us. i'm asking you to believe that we can do better than this two-party system — and to work toward it. if we continue to take america for granted, we will lose it.\n\nhis closest allies – conservatives who routinely sparred with the gop establishment in the past – have coalesced behind trump even as his political and legal woes have mounted, with republican lawmakers now marching in lock-step behind the president even on issues they historically haven't supported, like shutting down the government. but that's not amash's style.\n\nand his fierce independence could be a sign of trouble for republicans in the future: in an interview with cnn's jake tapper, amash recently declined to rule out running for president as a libertarian in 2020. i would never rule anything out, said amash. that's not on my radar right now, but i think that it is important that we have someone in there who is presenting a vision for america that is different from what these two parties are presenting.\n\nit's a far cry from the turn amash's associates have taken in the trump age.\n\nthe michael cohen hearing\n\nthe divide was clearer than ever during a february oversight hearing with former trump attorney michael cohen. while most republicans on the panel stuck to ohio rep. jim jordan's strategy of attacking cohen's character and playing defense for the president, amash asked sharp questions designed to draw out information.\n\nwhat is the truth that you know president trump fears most? he asked. amash told cnn in an interview after the hearing that he gave jordan advance warning his questioning would be tough.\n\njustin's a great american, jordan said when asked about the episode.\n\njordan and amash were both founding members of the house freedom caucus, a group of hardline conservatives who preached a focus on cutting government spending and opening up congressional procedure, and clashed with party leaders over it. the three dozen members played a key role in former house speaker john boehner's resignation in 2015, and the caucus was instrumental in shaping the house-led gop effort to repeal obamacare, which became a centerpiece of trump's first-year agenda – though it failed to pass through the more moderate senate.\n\nbut the freedom caucus of 2019 is a different story.\n\nwielding considerably less power in a democratic house, the caucus is more recognizable today as home to some of trump's staunchest defenders. jordan and current chairman rep. mark meadows regularly make headlines with their ardent efforts to push back on investigations into the white house and russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nevery day, their allegiance to the president seems to reach new heights, and every day, amash's position among his allies seems a little more strained.\n\nfrom the time the president was elected, i was urging them to remain independent and to be willing to push back against the president where they thought he was wrong, said amash. they've decided to stick with the president time and again, even where they disagree with him privately.\n\nthe emergency powers vote\n\namash was the sole member of the caucus to vote against trump's use of emergency powers to seize funds for his long-desired wall along the southern border, even though the freedom caucus was known for lambasting president barack obama's executive maneuvering to get around congress.\n\nin some sense you've delegitimized objections to the president, amash said of his peers. you've built up such credibility for him that you just can't challenge him anymore.\n\nasked if he'd thought about leaving the freedom caucus in recent months, the congressman admitted he has been disenchanted enough to consider it at times. but he said having close partners to work with on issues he cares about has kept him from calling it quits.\n\nstill, the relationship has evolved.\n\nleading up to the 2018 election, amash started to feel like the group wasn't going to turn around. since then, he hasn't been attending all of the meetings like he used to, going only infrequently, he told cnn.\n\ni came to a meeting and really gave them a dramatic speech about what my concerns were and what we needed to do as a group and how we were losing sight of our purpose and our principles, amash recalled. and that was sort of it.\n\ntension built as amash regularly argued for the group to return to a focus on opening up the legislative process. in recent years, it has become harder and harder for rank-and-file members to have a say in lawmaking. leaders in both parties opt for a top-down approach, rejecting the idea of allowing a robust amendments process. when the senate was debating the gop health care bill, only a small handful of senators actually knew what would be included in the bill — even up until the final hours before the vote. and the house recently experienced its most closed session in history under now-retired house speaker paul ryan.\n\na changing caucus\n\nthe question of whether to prioritize process or policy has plagued the freedom caucus since its inception, and divisions have only heightened in the trump age. it hasn't helped that amash has lost key allies like raul labrador, the idaho lawmaker who left congress last year to run unsuccessfully for governor of his state, and mark sanford, who lost his south carolina primary to a more trump-friendly opponent in 2018.\n\nyet amash reiterated his freedom caucus colleagues remain some of his closest friends in congress.\n\nthey are good, kind people, he said. i may have my disagreements with some of the current approach, but i'd still take them over pretty much anyone in congress.\n\nand members who differ with amash's stance say he still brings a helpful perspective.\n\njustin, like all of us, is just looking for a way to be the most effective and efficient he can be, arizona rep. andy biggs said. when we're debating, he engages in debate and offers a ton of valuable comments and i think that's invaluable for all of us.\n\namash has the rhetorical style of someone who really enjoys arguing for the sake of arguing but also benefits from fiercely believing what he says. he also has a wry sense of humor.\n\nsoon after inauguration day in early 2017, trump signed a travel ban targeting six majority muslim countries. amash — whose mother is a syrian immigrant and whose father came to america as a palestinian refugee in 1956 — opposed the executive order. in the immediate aftermath of the ban, protestors flocked to airports, where travelers were stranded.\n\nat the height of the outcry, amash excused his lateness to a freedom caucus meeting one night with a joke at the administration's expense, according to one attendee who told cnn about the incident at the time. hey guys. sorry i'm late, he said. the travel ban got me held up at the airport — they're screening all the syrians.\n\nhalf of the room was amused by the quip. the other half — not so much. it was memorable enough that a lawmaker who also attended the meeting still recalled the episode more than two years later.\n\nto his closest friends in congress, amash's ability to call out his own side is part of his charm.\n\njustin amash is probably one of the most, if not the most consistent and honorable members of congress that i met in the eight years i was there, labrador, the former idaho representative, said. he always outlined what he believes in, why he believes in the things that he does and why he makes the decisions that he makes.\n\nit's not clear what's next for amash, whether another term in the house or something new. he admits he's thought about everything from breaking away from the gop to launching a presidential bid.\n\ni never stop thinking about these sorts of things, he told cnn. it's not because i have any immediate plans or anything like that, but i never stop thinking about those things because there is a big problem

(cnn) health care is a big issue for democratic voters this year. but for republicans, not so much.\n\nmost democrats are focused on picking a candidate who can defeat president donald trump rather than one who comes closest to their views on issues, according to a kaiser family foundation poll released friday.\n\nbut when it comes to issues, 36% of democratic voters said health care was their priority in the presidential election this year, the poll found. climate change came in second at 29%.\n\nrepublicans, however, ranked health care only fourth, at 12%, behind the economy, immigration and foreign policy/national security.\n\ngop voters are also losing interest in repealing the affordable care act. among those who said health care was important to their vote, only 3% listed jettisoning the landmark health reform law as their top issue. in a 2016 poll, 29% of republican voters named repealing obamacare as their main concern, far ahead of health care costs.\n\nread more
the trump administration has once again pointed to health insurers' robust stock market performance as proof that they are profiting from obamacare.\n\nthe white house's council of economic advisers issued a report this week declaring that insurers have made a lot of money since the affordable care act took effect, primarily thanks to large premium increases and generous federal funding of premium subsidies and medicaid expansion. the release coincided with an unsuccessful attempt in the senate to restore funding for a second set of obamacare subsidies -- which helped to reduce low-income enrollees' deductibles and co pays -- that president donald trump eliminated last fall.\n\ndespite an initial rough patch in the aca marketplaces, the aca medicaid coverage expansion and subsidies to insurers have resulted in a large increase in health insurer profits, the four-page report said.\n\nthe council's main argument: that the stock prices of health insurance companies rose by 272% since the health reform law's implementation in january 2014 -- more than double the gain of the s&p 500 over that period.\n\nthis is a flawed rationale that the trump administration has used before.\n\nrelated: despite trump's attacks, obamacare sign-ups dip only slightly\n\nwhile it's true that obamacare insurers are finally becoming profitable, they aren't exactly rolling in the dough because of their involvement in the individual market, experts say. and carriers' stock prices are a poor measure of their performance on the exchanges given how many other factors contribute to their bottom line.\n\nlet's take a closer look:\n\nin the first few years of obamacare, many insurers priced their plans too low, resulting in big losses. this prompted many carriers -- including most of the large publicly traded ones -- to downsize or exit the market completely. there are just over 130 insurers on the exchanges this year, down from 237 two years earlier, according to data from the centers for medicare & medicaid services.\n\nanthem (antm) is the only large public insurer with a sizable presence on the exchanges, but even it pulled out of several states for 2018.\n\nat least two years of big rate hikes have helped the insurers that remain get on more solid financial footing. several recent studies, including ones by the kaiser family foundation and s&p global, have found that many insurers' premiums in 2017 were more than adequate to cover policyholders' medical expenses.\n\nthe average monthly gross margin per member was nearly $79 in the third quarter of 2017, up from $9.90 two years earlier, according to the kaiser family foundation. (the gross margin doesn't take into account administrative expenses.)\n\nrelated: obamacare shoppers find fewer insurer choices on exchanges\n\nseveral insurers have reported their first profits in their obamacare businesses. highmark health in pittsburgh, pennsylvania, announced earlier this week that its affordable care act division generated income for the first time in 2017, calling it a substantial turnaround.\n\nthe fact that it has taken so long to achieve some level of profitability speaks to the challenges that have long existed in the individual market, said kristine grow, a spokesperson for america's health insurance plans, an industry trade association.\n\nstill, the individual market is not likely to be a font of big profits for insurers. it's expected to generate margins of only 1% or 2%, which is why many of the larger public carriers left, said deep banerjee, a director at s&p global. the employer insurance market, on the other hand, generally produces profit margins of 8% to 10%.\n\nthe affordable care act also boosted enrollment in insurers' medicaid divisions, which are generally profitable, experts said. states are increasingly contracting with insurers to manage the health care needs of their medicaid enrollees, said larry levitt, a senior vice president at kaiser. this includes the more than 11 million low-income adults who entered the program through medicaid expansion.\n\nrelated: anthem pulls out of virginia's obamacare exchange\n\nnearly two-thirds of plans in states that expanded medicaid said that it has had a positive effect on their financial performance, according to kaiser's 2017 survey of medicaid managed care plans.\n\nas for the insurers' stock prices -- that's usually driven more by their employer and medicare divisions, which are typically much larger, as well as by carriers' efforts to control costs, banerjee said.
(cnn) uninsured americans who want to buy affordable care act coverage have another three months to do so, thanks to an executive order president joe biden signed last month.\n\nthe federal obamacare exchange, healthcare.gov, reopened monday for a special enrollment period that runs until may 15. most states that operate their own marketplaces are also doing the same or are extending their sign-up season for several more weeks.\n\nthe president is hoping that some of the 15 million uninsured people eligible for affordable care act policies -- 9 million of whom qualify for federal financial assistance -- will participate. individuals making up to about $51,000 and families of four earning up to about $104,800 are eligible for subsidies.\n\nbiden tied the reopening of enrollment to the ongoing pandemic -- and to his $1.9 trillion stimulus plan. that package, the president wrote in a statement monday, will ramp up testing, tracing, and our national vaccination program, as well as take big steps to lower health costs and expand access to care for all americans, including those who have lost their jobs.\n\nthe federal exchange's homepage was updated with information about the special enrollment period monday morning.\n\nin his statement, biden encouraged americans who have coverage to help your family and friends sign up and enroll.\n\nawareness of obamacare coverage and premium subsidies remains fairly low, even though the exchanges first opened in 2014. just under two-thirds of uninsured adults said they had heard nothing or only a little about financial assistance for policies, according to an urban institute study conducted in september. the trump administration slashed obamacare's marketing budget by 90% during its term.\n\nthere are millions of people, literally, in the country who aren't enrolled because they don't even know they are eligible for something, said joel ario, managing director of manatt health solutions and former health official in the obama administration.\n\nmore money for outreach, but not enrollment\n\nto address this, the biden administration is pouring $50 million into outreach and education, though it has not provided many details on its advertising campaign or announced additional funds for enrollment assistance\n\nthe marketing efforts will focus in particular on groups that have had less access to health coverage and greater disparities in health outcomes, including communities of color, according to a news release issued by the centers for medicare and medicaid services on friday. it will run advertisements on broadcast and digital platforms, as well as in multiple languages, the agency said last month.\n\nbiden has yet to announce his pick to head the agency, which runs the federal exchange, and his choice for health and human services secretary, xavier becerra , has yet to be confirmed by the senate.\n\nabout 9 out of 10 enrollees in healthcare.gov receive subsidies, and three-quarters of consumers are eligible for financial assistance that would lower their premium to $50 or less a month, according to the agency.\n\ncongressional democrats are currently working on legislation that would make premium subsidies more generous and more available , but it's unclear how long it will take the bill to pass or how quickly federal and state agencies could reprogram the exchanges to reflect the increased assistance.\n\nbiden highlighted some of the provisions in his statement.\n\nit will increase federal subsidies and decrease premiums in order to ensure that no one pays more than 8.5% of their income to purchase meaningful and comprehensive health coverage, he said. and it incentivizes states to expand coverage to an additional four million people with low incomes, and provides states the opportunity to extend coverage for a year to low-income women who have recently given birth.\n\nhow many people will enroll?\n\nstill, it's unclear how many people will turn to the exchanges over the next three months.\n\nmore americans have appeared to hold on to job-based coverage than expected, while many of those who have lost their employment and most of their income have turned to medicaid. between february and september, medicaid enrollment jumped by more than 6.6 million people, or 10.3%, according to federal data.\n\nbut more people flocked to the federal affordable care act exchange during the most recent open enrollment period, which ran for six weeks in november and december. that's the first time sign ups increased under the trump administration. the number of new consumers for 2021 slid somewhat, however. roughly 8.3 million people selected plans in total.\n\neleven states that run their own obamacare exchanges, along with the district of columbia, allowed their uninsured residents to obtain coverage outside the usual time frame, in addition to those who lost their work policies or had other qualifying life changes. in total, more than 240,000 people signed up on the state-run exchanges between march and july, with several states reporting much greater interest than in 2019.\n\nstates saw many new consumers who had never interacted with the marketplace before, said julie bataille, senior vice president at gmmb, a consulting firm.\n\nthat speaks to the need for outreach and enrollment because you are making sure individuals know the marketplace is there, that it is an option, said bataille, a former obama administration health official.\n\nin california, the state-run exchange spends heavily on marketing annually, allocating $89 million for fiscal 2020. it spent $9 million during last year's special enrollment period, which attracted 289,000 residents, more than twice the number that signed up during the same time frame a year earlier.\n\ncovered california, which saw a record 1.6 million people selecting 2021 plans for coverage starting january 1, intends to spend $6 million for its upcoming special sign up session, which will also run through may 15.\n\nwe've learned over the last eight years that promotions matters, said peter lee, the exchange's executive director. it matters in many ways on the margins, but the margins are what make the most difference.\n\nthose who are sick seek out coverage and enroll, he continued. but the advertising campaigns draw healthier residents who may not be as aware of the coverage or the subsidies -- and these folks can help balance the risk and lower premiums for everyone.\n\nif you want to get everyone covered, you can't sit on your hands and keep it a secret, lee said.\n\nsome local enrollment assistance groups plan to do their own ad campaigns, particularly to let residents know they are there to help.\n\nchange happens, a navigator group that covers 30 counties in southeast texas, will run some ads with local newspapers and radio stations in coming weeks, said jeness sherrell, program director for adult services. it will supplement the national campaign.\n\nthe houston-based organization used to do more marketing, including placing billboards, before the trump administration cut its funding by more than half to $586,000. but it did set aside some money for advertising during the most recent open enrollment period for the first time in several years, hoping to reverse a decline in its enrollment numbers.\n\nwe know we needed marketing to get the word out -- even more so for the pandemic, said stacey thompson, aca navigator program coordinator at change happens.

maybe.\n\nbut that is hardly an argument for effectively walking away from the deal, which delays the iranian nuclear weapons program from resuming for around a decade from its inception three years ago.\n\nin the tricky art of diplomacy, a reasonably good solution is not the enemy of a perfect solution, since those are rarely on offer. to be sure, the deal didn't address the fact that iran has a robust ballistic missile program, but the deal wasn't about the unilateral disarmament of iran – which iran would be quite unlikely to agree to since its only real ally around the world is syria! – but rather it was to stop the iranians from acquiring nuclear weapons with all the new, additional leverage that would give them in the region.\n\nalso, if iran has nuclear weapons, that is sure to spark a regional nuclear arms race in which saudi arabia would also try to acquire them as soon as feasible.\n\nthree of the united states' closest allies, britain, france and germany, are all signatories to the iran deal. in recent weeks leaders of these countries have all begged trump to remain in the deal. these allies were even willing to negotiate amendments to the deal about issues such as iran's ballistic missile program under the rubric fix it, don't nix it, but even that wasn't sufficient for trump.\n\nwhy? historians will likely be debating this question for years. after all the iran deal is quite popular with americans, a healthy majority of whom – 63% – want to stay in the deal, while only 29% want to leave it, according to a new cnn poll.\n\nthose numbers are quite similar to these who opposed president trump's decision to withdraw from the paris climate agreement last year: 59% opposed that decision, while 28% supported it, according to a washington post-abc news poll:\n\nsimilarly, obamacare is now favored by a majority of americans, according to a march poll by kaiser.\n\ntrump is intent, it seems, on undoing the key international and domestic accomplishments of the obama administration. the question is: does he have a plan b that makes any sense? trump said he would repeal and replace obamacare, but when it came down to it he and the republican party didn't have a real viable plan to do so.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nthe iranians have repeatedly said they won't renegotiate the nuclear deal, which means they could restart their nuclear enrichment program. that, of course, will lead to renewed tensions with the united states, israel and the gulf states that the nuclear deal was designed to tamp down. and that path takes us back to the real and renewed possibility of a war in the region.\n\nwe can all hope that trump's big bet that he will force the iranians back to the negotiating table will pay off, but history suggests that these kinds of bets are easy to make on the campaign trail, but are much harder to pull off when you are sitting in the oval office.

—\n\nhouse speaker paul ryan steps down in january after a twenty year career in congress with one major accomplishment – a massive overhaul of the tax code.\n\nbut the policy wonk and republican thought leader departs without meaningful action on the agenda that led to his rise as a national republican figure – reforming entitlement programs and tackling the nation's debt crisis.\n\nthe timing of ryan's move to announce his plans wednesday stunned many of his gop colleagues, many of whom expected he wouldn't talk about stepping aside until after the midterm elections in november.\n\nbut ryan reminded reporters and colleagues it was a job he stepped into reluctantly after his predecessor john boehner's own surprising decision to retire in the fall of 2015.\n\nthis is a job that does not last forever, the wisconsin congressman said. you realize that you hold the office for just a small part of our history, so you better make the most of it. it's fleeting, and that inspires you to do big things.\n\nryan's big thing was his longtime goal to transform the large federal health care and retirement programs in order to cut back bloated federal spending. he spent years warning that the debt would cripple the nation's economic outlook. most notably, he proposed that the current medicare system shift into one modeled on private care rather than a government one-size-fits-all program.\n\npolicy pushes and pushback\n\nduring his tenure as chairman of the house budget committee, he methodically rolled out detailed proposals and his expertise on economic issues was one of the reasons the 2012 presidential nominee mitt romney picked him as a running mate. he went from showcasing powerpoint presentations for his colleagues in capitol hill hearing rooms to traveling the country and gaining a national profile.\n\ndemocrats repeatedly tried to use his medicare proposal as a campaign issue, even making one political ad that featured someone who looked like ryan pushing someone in a wheelchair off a cliff. under his framework, the government would no longer directly pay bills for senior citizens in the program. instead, recipients would choose a plan from a list of private providers, which the federal government would subsidize.\n\nryan also argued that medicaid, which provides health care for the disabled and the poor, should be administered by the states by sending them block grants to spend in the ways each governor decided best fit needs of its citizens.\n\nrep. steve womack, an arkansas republican, who now chairs the budget panel, told reporters that these kind of major reforms remain an elusive target for the party. the gop-controlled house was able to approve them as part of budget resolutions, but they failed to gain traction beyond those votes.\n\nthe timing is never right for it, womack said. it's either a brand new administration or an upcoming election, or another transformational piece of legislation that has occupied our time.\n\na new report from the congressional budget office showed that deficits under the gop-controlled congress are growing larger instead of diminishing as ryan and others pledged they would. the nonpartisan report said that the deficits over a trillion dollars will start in 2020, two years earlier than what the cbo predicted just 10 months ago. in ten years, cbo projected the deficit will be over $1.5 trillion. this is due to both the tax bill enacted last year and the spending bill approved just last month.\n\npresident donald trump effectively shot down ryan's dream of making headway on entitlement reforms. he campaigned against touching medicare and social security and reiterated he had no desire to change course when he took office.\n\non wednesday, the house speaker admitted that there was more work to do on reshaping those large federal programs. ryan touted that the house did pass a repeal of obamacare and lamented the fact the senate couldn't get that through.\n\nhe boasted that normalizing entitlement reform, pushing the cause of entitlement reform was something he was proud he accomplished through pushing his budgets and his record as speaker.\n\nboehner pointed out in his statement wednesday that ryan's proposals became the centerpiece of the gop's economic agenda.\n\nhis budgets during my own speakership showed the american people our conservative vision for addressing the drivers of our debt and restoring a path to prosperity for our children, the former ohio congressman said.\n\nryan has said for years that serving as chairman of the tax-writing committee was always his dream job. he held that post when boehner retired and he was propelled into the top leadership post.\n\nryan said wednesday that the tax bill was something that i've been working on in my entire adult life.\n\nfrom staffer to speaker\n\nhis colleagues and allies outside of the capitol say ryan grew into the role of speaker and quickly learned how to work within the various factions of the gop conference to reach consensus.\n\ncesar conda, a former hill aide and ally of ryan's, said that he's watched him evolve over the years from staffer to speaker, gaining momentum and skills that the policy wonk didn't possess in the earlier days.\n\nhe has evolved from a strictly policy-oriented legislator who was just concerned about policy x and policy y to someone who had to count votes and put together coalitions, conda said. that wasn't one of his strengths going into the job but he learned it pretty quickly.\n\nryan downplayed any splits he's had with trump during a session with a small group of reporters in his capitol office wednesday, saying that the opportunity to enact major policy changes gave him perspective on his priorities as speaker.\n\nthe tweet of the moment pales in comparison to the big policy changes that i really believe are gonna make a big difference in people's lives, are going to move us in the right direction, he said. those things completely overshadow the frustrations of the day or of the moment.\n\ngop lawmakers spent wednesday praising ryan, and also pointing to the tax legislation as his chief legacy.\n\nhe got it done. he got it done in a real way. this tax bill has been transformational, said rep. mario diaz-balart of florida. i think history will record speaker ryan as a very effective, transformational speaker.\n\ncnn's phil mattingly contributed to this report.
rick, patrick and michael recently commented on covered california's facebook page, urging others to ditch health insurance because:\n\nno more fines or penalties!!! trump took care of that!! saved me 700 bucks this year!!!\n\ntrump removed the penalty for not having insurance.\n\ni'm pretty sure trump abolished the illegal penalty.\n\nthey're right — and wrong.\n\non dec. 22, president donald trump did indeed sign a sweeping tax bill that repeals the affordable care act's tax penalty by zeroing out the fines.\n\nopponents of the tax penalty rejoiced, and many, like rick, patrick and michael, assumed it took effect immediately.\n\nnot so. the penalty won't go away until 2019, and that means you still will owe uncle sam if you didn't have health insurance — or an exemption from the mandate — in 2017. the same holds true for this year.\n\nthere's just mass confusion out there, reports steven stasoiski, a tax accountant and insurance agent in seal beach, california.\n\nrelated: tens of thousands of medicaid recipients don't pay their premiums\n\nsome of his clients decided to drop their health insurance this year without consulting him first, thinking they wouldn't have to pay a penalty next year. when they file next season ... they're going to be surprised, he says.\n\none client, a family of four in orange county, california, decided to go without insurance this year, and will owe about $15,200 next year because of it — roughly the same cost as a bronze-level health insurance plan that would protect them from catastrophic health insurance bills, stasoiski says.\n\nunder obamacare, most people must have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. for 2017, the penalty is $695 per adult (up to a family maximum of $2,085), or 2.5% of household income, whichever is greater. the penalty for children is half the adult rate ($347.50).\n\nyou can avoid the penalty if you qualify for one of the health law's several exemptions. for instance, you may be exempt if you were uninsured for less than three consecutive months of the previous year, if your income is low enough that you're not required to file a federal tax return or if you belong to a health care sharing ministry.\n\nbut if you don't fit into one of the exemption categories and you were uninsured in 2017, or will be in 2018, you're probably out of luck, says alison flores, a principal tax research analyst at the tax institute, the research wing of h&r block, based in kansas city, missouri.\n\nif you have a penalty and you're due a refund, that penalty reduces your refund, she says. if you owe a penalty but aren't owed a refund, and then you decide not to pay the penalty, the internal revenue service may take it out of a future refund, she says.\n\nthe irs says that this year, for the first time, it will reject electronically filed tax returns that don't address obamacare tax penalty questions. if you file a paper return and don't address those questions, your return could be held up and a refund delayed, adds michael eisenberg, a certified public accountant with squar milner in encino, calif.\n\nrelated: people with pre-existing conditions could face tough times\n\nthey are saying, 'this is the law, and you have to comply with the law while it's the law,' he says. they are going to enforce the penalties.\n\na quick note on the obamacare-related 1095 tax forms, which will help you prove to the irs that you had health insurance last year.\n\nsome of you who got insurance last year from employers, on the open market or through government programs such as medicare or medi-cal, may still be waiting for your 1095-b and 1095-c forms. the irs extended the deadline to march 2 for those forms to be delivered to taxpayers.\n\nbut you don't need them in hand to complete your taxes, which are due on april 17 this year. you should have other substantiation that you had health insurance, such as w-2 forms, medicare cards or explanations of benefits from your insurance company, flores says.\n\non the other hand, you must have a correct 1095-a to complete your taxes. if you're a covered california enrollee — or buy your insurance through any state or federally run health insurance exchange — you should have received your 1095-a forms by jan. 31.\n\nrelated: trump officials unveil rule that could chip away at obamacare\n\nif you're still waiting for yours and you're a resident of the golden state, log on to your covered california account and check your inbox. you should find a copy of your 1095-a there, says agency spokesman james scullary.\n\nif that still doesn't help, or if your 1095-a form is incorrect, fill out a dispute form, which you can find under the members tab of the covered california website at

(cnn) republicans in the house of representatives left a meeting on capitol hill monday evening with few answers on what will be included in a massive spending bill to keep the government funded ahead of a looming friday deadline.\n\naides and members say lawmakers are scrambling to resolve a host of policy disagreements from a controversial rail program between new york and new jersey to a health care market stabilization package that has become intertwined with the must-pass spending bill.\n\nlawmakers need to fund the government before midnight friday to avert a federal government shutdown.\n\nhealth care measures not currently included\n\namong the top unresolved issues monday was what to do about the affordable care act and whether to attach legislation aimed at stabilizing the obamacare marketplace and driving down insurance premiums.\n\nmultiple republicans including republican study committee chairman mark walker said the obamacare stabilization money hadn't been included. steve womack, a republican from arkansas, reiterated that the bill wasn't finished yet, but that at present he did not believe that stabilization measures for the affordable care act marketplace would be included in the bill because of fights over whether to include the hyde amendment, which is regularly attached to annual funding bills, and makes permanent a ban on federal agencies from using funds for abortion services except in cases of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is in danger.\n\nno hyde protections, no csrs, womack said referring to the cost sharing reduction payments that go to insurers to help cover the cost of insuring low income people. womack said that the payments were not in there as we speak.\n\naccording to a person in the room, there was applause when leadership told the room they wouldn't compromise on the issue and that plans were to keep health care stabilization out of the proposal if democrats wouldn't agree on abortion restrictions.\n\nover the weekend, according to two people familiar with the call, president donald trump spoke directly with the legislation's top sponsors republican sens. susan collins of maine and lamar alexander of tennessee and expressed his support for the plan. but democrats have rebuffed abortion restrictions that republicans want to include in it. and some conservatives have balked at spending money to prop up a health care system they tried to repeal last year.\n\ni'm still optimistic it's going to be included, collins said monday evening before house republicans met. it is the right thing to do. it would result in rate decreases that would provide substantial relief.\n\nother issues up for debate\n\nrepublican leaders and committee chairs who gave presentations monday in the closed-door conference meeting pitched the $1.3 trillion bill as a big win to a skeptical conference, according to one lawmaker in the room.\n\nthe meeting has also included presentations from house armed services chair mac thornberry, who touted the major increase in defense spending, and house appropriations chair rodney freylinghusen, who walked through the key components of the bill.\n\nfreylinghusen acknowledged the massive bill isn't done yet as of monday evening and there are still ongoing negotiations, the lawmaker in the room told cnn.\n\nbut health care is hardly the only issue causing tension in the negotiations. according to several aides who spoke with cnn , the omnibus isn't expected to include legislation that would modernize the process victims on capitol hill undergo when they report harassment. reports that it would not be included in the must-pass spending bill prompted sen. kirsten gillibrand, a democrat from new york, to release a blistering statement.\n\ni am appalled that house and senate leadership removed provisions from the omnibus bill at the last minute that would have finally brought accountability and transparency to congress's sexual harassment reporting process, gillibrand said. it begs the question: who are they trying to protect?\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell's spokesman david popp argued that nothing was removed last minute, but instead that the negotiations were ongoing.\n\nanother issue that may go untouched is immigration. some had hoped that the white house and capitol hill could find a way to protect recipients of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program in the spending negotiations.\n\nbut instead, a source familiar told cnn that the white house and congressional negotiators hit an impasse sunday after the white house offered democrats $25 billion in wall funding in exchange for a two and a half year continuation of daca. a counter offer was made to demand a path to citizenship for 1.8 million daca eligible individuals in exchange for full wall funding, but according to the source familiar with the discussion, the white house passed. politico was the first to report the negotiation.\n\nat this point, controversial riders may be scrapped rather than included in an effort to stave off any government shutdown. republicans were still trying to find a way to correct some errors in their tax bill, but those negotiations were hitting headwinds as democrats demanded concessions for the changes.\n\nfor now, the race is on to get the bill out the door and to the floor where it can get a vote before friday.\n\nwe'll get there, mcconnell told reporters monday evening.\n\nthis story has been updated to include additional developments.

(photo by drew angerer/getty images)\n\neditor's note: scott jennings, a cnn contributor, is a former special assistant to president george w. bush and former campaign adviser to sen. mitch mcconnell. he is a partner at runswitch public relations in louisville, kentucky. follow him on twitter @scottjenningsky. the opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.\n\n(cnn) —\n\na great many republicans have had their differences with arizona sen. john mccain over the years, and some of president donald trump's biggest supporters are using the occasion of the release of the senator's memoir to bash mccain in the sunset of his career and life.\n\nphoto: courtesy of scott jennings scott jennings\n\nthey take to twitter to bash a guy who suffered torture for his country, lived a life of public service and consequence, and has the audacity to express his political opinions and preferences on who eulogizes him.\n\nyou don't have to love john mccain to know this is wrong and, as jonah goldberg put it, grotesque.\n\nit is true that those of us who supported george w. bush over mccain in the 2000 gop primary found his attacks against bush to be whiny and irritating. mccain's position and vitriolic statements on campaign finance reform were grating, especially when you consider that his legislation did the opposite of reforming the system. it drove money out of the hands of candidates and parties, and into the shadows of outside groups.\n\nmccain's legacy on campaign finance, well-meaning as it may have been, is a broken system that he helped to drive fully off the rails.\n\nbut he has been a loyal american and republican all his life. he barnstormed the country for bush in 2000 and 2004. i saw him on the campaign trail for mitt romney in 2012. he took on the mantle of republican nominee for president in 2008, trying desperately to hold the white house for a party whose president was suffering from low approval ratings.\n\ndespite his ditching the gop on a handful of issues (most recently obamacare repeal), mccain has mostly been a solid citizen in the senate. he has opposed wasteful spending (a republican staple), and even now, serving under a president he clearly despises, votes for the trump agenda 83% of the time, according to 538's trump tracker. that's a better trump score than susan collins, mike lee and rand paul, and nearly 22 points more than the tracker would expect based on the 2016 outcome in arizona.\n\nanother 538 article pointed out that mccain stuck with the gop on party-line votes 87% of the time, just below the average of 91% for all republicans. he has a lifetime voting score from the american conservative union of nearly 81% over 35 years of service.\n\nmccain has been a maverick at times, but he will long be remembered as a mostly loyal and conservative republican who sometimes had differences of opinion and style with other leaders in his party. he was never afraid to fight people in his own party, or in the other one.\n\nbut it is mccain's attacks on trump, including those in his new book the restless wave: good times, just causes, great fights, and other appreciations, that have some trump supporters criticizing a man who is dying of brain cancer. they don't like it that mccain reportedly doesn't want trump attending his funeral, while former presidents bush and barack obama will deliver eulogies.\n\nwhat do you expect? mccain and trump don't like each other, and i don't know too many people who want people they don't like at their funeral.\n\ntrump assailed mccain during the 2012 primary (i like people who weren't captured, trump said of mccain). mccain turned around and voted against obamacare repeal in 2017 despite urging from trump and vice president mike pence, delivering the bill-crushing vote with a theatrical middle-of-the-night thumbs-down.\n\ndespite their political differences, mccain got along with bush and obama, and it makes sense for them to eulogize a genuine american war hero who dedicated his entire life to public service.\n\nin 2000, mccain ran as the anti-establishment insurgent, trying to upend the bush apple cart.\n\nbut today, at the sunset of mccain's life and career, it is another group of insurgents, trump and his supporters, who cast mccain as an unreliable relic, out of touch with the people of arizona and the republican party. they hate his views on immigration and his detestation of trump's behavior and style.\n\nin some ways, trump pulled off what mccain was trying to do back in 2000. mccain called it the straight talk express, pulling no punches and offering unprecedented press access. he didn't win but forever absorbed the brand of maverick in the process.\n\ntrump did the same thing. he ran against the establishment and was the most press accessible candidate in 2016. mccain was, tactically, ahead of his time, while trump got the timing just right.\n\nmccain will be remembered as a war hero, american patriot and public servant who was conservative but unafraid to buck his party from time to time. he will be remembered for clashing with trump and suffering for it politically among members of his own party.\n\nhe will be remembered for picking sarah palin and later regretting it. he will be remembered for making the campaign finance system worse while trying to make it better. he will be remembered for being entangled in the keating five ethics scandal.\n\nhe will be remembered for being tortured, and then leading the opposition to certain interrogation tactics during the global war on terror.\n\nbut no matter how you remember him or what you think of him, john mccain has earned the right to speak his mind and to have anyone at his funeral he wants. feel free to disagree with mccain, but lay off the vitriolic, tribal attacks.\n\nhe suffered mightily for your right to do so.
washington (cnn) while donald trump's first campaign for president was all about change, his argument for re-election was based on the premise that he had delivered on his initial promises and would continue to do so. the campaign slogan promises made, promises kept, became trump's rallying cry.\n\nto be sure, trump delivered on a number of initial campaign promises . he cut regulations, lowered taxes, withdrew from the trans pacific partnership, pulled the us out of the paris climate agreement and appointed hundreds of conservative justices. but in many cases, the reality behind the talking points and slogans fell short of what was actually promised.\n\nhere's a look back at how some of the most notable promises trump made during his campaigns and throughout his time in office stack up against reality.\n\nthe wall\n\nbuilding a wall on the us border with mexico (and getting mexico to pay for it) was one of trump's flagship promises from his first campaign, though the specific parameters of the wall evolved over time, from 1,000 miles to over 5 00 miles.\n\nthroughout his presidency, trump acted as if this was one accomplishment he had successfully crossed off the list, continuing to tout the hundreds of miles of wall his administration had built.\n\nbut the figures he threw out, as recently as in his recorded farewell video, were misleading and didn't live up to what he initially promised. as of january 8, 2021, 453 miles of border barriers were built under the trump administration, just 47 of which were erected where no barriers had existed before.\n\nof the other 406 miles: 22 miles replaced previously existing dilapidated or outdated secondary barriers, 33 miles were new secondary barriers where there had previously been only primary barriers and 351 miles replaced previously existing primary barriers that the government considered dilapidated or outdated. while these replacement barriers are not insignificant, it's worth noting that trump did not build a new wall.\n\nfurthermore, during the campaign, trump insisted that americans would not pay for the wall or any new barriers his administration constructed. according to trump, mexico would pay for the wall, but both the former and current mexican president have refused to do so (the former president was more explicit while the current president, who has been less critical of trump and has just avoided the topic). in the end, the us government spent billions in federal funds on the wall. since january 2017, approximately $15 billion has been allocated to construct both new and replacement structures for the border wall through a combination of department of homeland security and department of defense funding combined with the treasury forfeiture fund, according to a january 2021 report from customs and border protection.\n\nvaccines\n\npresident donald trump walks out after speaking at the operation warp speed vaccine summit on december 8, 2020 in washington, dc.\n\nas the coronavirus pandemic dominated the final year of trump's presidency, he made a series of promises regarding a vaccine.\n\ntrump repeatedly stated the us would have a vaccine by the end of 2020. while experts were skeptical, the trump administration's accelerated vaccine development initiative, operation warp speed, did result in a vaccine approved for distribution before the end of the year. the food and drug administration gave emergency use authorization to pfizer/biontech's vaccine in mid-december and to moderna's vaccine about a week later.\n\nbut while trump exceeded expectations in terms of the vaccine production timeline, his administration struggled to fulfill his promises regarding vaccine distribution. in october, trump promised 100 million doses of the vaccine delivered before the end of the year. though trump administration officials later reduced the goal to 20 million americans vaccinated against coronavirus by the end of december 2020, neither promise was ultimately fulfilled. several states have blamed the federal government for the failure to meet the vaccination goals, complaining that the trump administration initially provided fewer doses than previously promised . and with no federal mandate for how to administer the vaccines, eligibility for receiving the vaccine varied from state to state, likely causing an uneven distribution. as of december 31, 2020, fewer than 13 million vaccines had been distributed.\n\npre-existing conditions\n\nin countless rallies and other speeches, trump claimed he and his administration would always protect people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nthis is one promise cnn was able to fact check even before the end of trump's presidency, as the trump administration and republicans repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. trump also never issued a plan to protect those with pre-existing conditions, despite repeatedly promising to do so.\n\nobamacare\n\nprotesters hold signs and shout at lawmakers walking out of the us capitol in washington, dc, on may 4, 2017, after the house of representatives narrowly passed a republican effort to repeal and replace obamacare.\n\nduring his first campaign, trump promised to repeal and replace the affordable care act, a health care law often referred to as obamacare. after the passage of the 2017 republican tax bill which addressed a provision of the law, trump began to claim victory. but despite his insistence to the contrary, obamacare did not end under trump's administration, essentially or otherwise.\n\nin the 2017 tax bill , republicans effectively eliminated the individual mandate, a key part of obamacare, by reducing the penalty for not having insurance to $0. but other provisions of the law remained. the bill did not eliminate obamacare's expansion of the medicaid insurance program for low-income people, the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage, or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases. while trump continued to take other steps to weaken obamacare, much of it still exists.\n\ndebt\n\ntrump initially pledged to eliminate the us debt in eight years. he later scaled down the promise to just reducing a portion of the then-$19 trillion dollar debt. though he didn't specify the extent of the new goal, under trump the debt and deficit only got worse. according to the latest report from the government accountability office, the federal debt was at $26.9 trillion as of september 30, 2020. the gao attributed the increase between 2019 and 2020 to the federal government's covid-19 pandemic response, but the national debt was rising even before the pandemic. by the end of 2019, the federal debt was at $22.7 trillion , more than three trillion more than right before trump took office.\n\nmanufacturing\n\npresident donald trump speaks to workers at a whirlpool manufacturing facility on august 6, 2020, in clyde, ohio.\n\none of trump's flagship campaign promises was to revive us manufacturing and in his final state of the union address, he claimed to have succeeded in restoring our nation's manufacturing.\n\nmanufacturing employment did increase during the first three years of trump's presidency, but ultimately, any gains were gone by the end of his presidency, leaving the status of us manufacturing no better than when he took office. between january 2017 and the end of 2020, there was a net decrease in manufacturing employment. while some of the decrease could likely be attributed to the pandemic, america's manufacturing sector was in a downturn even before that, as cnn reported in august 2019 that the sector shrunk for the first time since september 2009.\n\n4% gdp growth\n\nduring his first presidential campaign, trump set a goal of 4% economic growth nationally, despite skepticism from economists. while trump heavily leaned on his economic accomplishments throughout his time in office, annual gdp growth since 2017 never reached 4%, according to data from the bureau of economic analysis. the quarterly gdp growth rate did hit 4% once, in the 4th quarter of 2020 , though economists say that wasn't enough to make up for the year's historically awful second quarter. 2020 also marked the first year us gdp declined since 2009.\n\naverage gdp growth did increase slightly under trump, to 2.5% during his first three years. that's well below the 4% trump had promised but a bit better than the 2.4% average growth rate during the last three years of obama's time in office. but as of the 3rd quarter of his fourth year in office, the gdp growth under trump was less than under the last five presidents before him at the same time in their presidencies, due in large part to the covid-19 pandemic.\n\ntrade deficits\n\nas a candidate, trump pledged to narrow america's trade deficit, especially with china. although progress was made, trump wasn't entirely successful. in 2019, the goods trade deficit with china fell to its lowest level since 2014. the overall us trade deficit also shrank in 2019, but it remained higher than when trump took office. the gap was further exacerbated by the pandemic, with the trade deficit increasing nearly every month between april and august 2020. in november 2020, the trade deficit reached its highest level since 2006.\n\ncoal\n\npresident donald trump holds up a trump digs coal sign as he arrives to speak during a make america great again rally at big sandy superstore arena in huntington, west virginia, august 3, 2017.\n\nat different times throughout the 2016 campaign, trump said he was going to bring back coal and put the miners back to work.\n\nin 2016 , the us produced more than 728 million tons of coal, according to the annual report from the energy information administration. while the trump administration made some policy moves to try to help the coal industry, production levels have not increased under the trump administration. the most recent available report indicates the us produced 706 million tons of coal in 2019, its lowest level since 1978, when there was a major strike.\n\naccording to a 2019 report from the international energy agency, the decrease in us coal production is in part the result of a shift toward cleaner renewables and cheaper natural gas. cheap and abundant natural gas combined with the climate policies of many states will continue to squeeze coal out of the electricity market, the report claims\n\na november 2020 report from s&p global market intelligence also shows a decrease in coal jobs since the start of the trump administration. furthermore, the 3rd quarter of 2020 marked a new low in average coal mine employment according to the s&p analysis.\n\nguns\n\nat a 2016 campaign rally, trump said , my first day, it gets signed, okay? my first day. there's no more gun-free zones. he later doubled-down on the promise, telling the media he was going to do something to end gun free zones.\n\nnot only did he not sign any legislation banning gun-free zones on his first day in office, but this was never accomplished. though house republicans proposed bills to repeal the crime control act of 1990 which made it a crime to possess a gun within school grounds, these efforts were unsuccessful.\n\nlobbying\n\nin 2016, trump called for enacting a five-year ban on all executive branch officials lobbying the government for five years after they leave government service. within his first week, trump signed the ethics commitments by executive branch appointees executive order. while on the surface that may have seemed like a promise kept, the order contained a loophole. the order only required appointees to pledge that they will not engage in lobbying activities with respect to the executive agency they were appointed to serve, language which could theoretically have permitted officials to lobby on other issues not directly related to their role less than five years after they stopped working for the federal government. additionally, days before his presidency came to an end, trump revoked the rule, ostensibly allowing his former administration officials to begin lobbying when they left government if they so choose.\n\nleaving the white house\n\npresident donald trump golfs at trump national golf club on november 21, 2020, in sterling, virginia.\n\nin 2015, shortly after announcing his run for president, trump said if elected he would rarely leave the white house because there's so much work to be done. he also criticized obama for all of the time [he] spent on the golf course, often flying to hawaii in a big, fully loaded 747, to play.\n\nand yet, trump left the white house repeatedly while he was president, often to spend time at his mar-a-lago property in florida or at his golf courses across the nation. in 2019 alone he spent 1 in 5 days at a golf club, per cnn's count\n\nclarification: an earlier version of this story oversimplified what republicans did to the individual mandate in 2017. they effectively eliminated it by reducing the penalty for not having insurance to zero.
washington (cnn) a day before the senate votes on whether to convict or acquit him on two charges of impeachment, president donald trump gave his annual state of the union speech in the house.\n\nwhile trump is known for his ad-libbed remarks rife with false claims, he tends to stick to the script for formal speeches such as the state of the union. nonetheless, here are the facts around what the president said in his third state of the union.\n\nenergy\n\noil and gas production\n\ntrump talked up the production of oil and gas in the us during his time in office.\n\nthanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the united states has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, by far, trump said.\n\nfacts first: the us did not become the world's top energy producer under trump: it took the top spot under the obama administration the us did not become the world's top energy producer under trump: it took the top spot under the obama administration in 2012 , according to the us government's energy information administration.\n\nthe us became the top producer of crude oil in particular during trump's tenure. the united states has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when us natural gas production surpassed that of russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded saudi arabia's, the energy information administration says.\n\n— tara subramaniam\n\neconomy\n\nunemployment for disabled americans\n\ntrump claimed the unemployment rate for disabled americans has reached an all-time low under his presidency.\n\nfacts first: the unemployment rate for americans with disabilities is lower than at any point in the obama administration, but it did go up from 6.1 percent in september of last year to 7 percent in december. in addition, describing this as an all-time low obscures the fact that the government has only tracked this data since 2008.\n\n— sarah westwood\n\nunemployment for african americans, hispanics and asians\n\ntrump said the unemployment rates for african americans, hispanics and asians are at the lowest levels ever. the unemployment rate for african-americans, hispanic-americans, and asian-americans has reached the lowest levels in history, trump said in his speech.\n\nfacts first: trump is correct. the unemployment rate for each of these three groups is at a record low, at least since the government has been issuing data on them. (the data for african americans and hispanics goes back to the early 1970s, while data for asians only goes back to 2000.)\n\ntrump inherited a positive trend that has continued during his tenure. the unemployment rate for all three groups had fallen substantially under president barack obama from the recession-era levels of 2009.\n\nthe african-american unemployment rate was 5.9% in december 2019. that is an uptick from the 5.4% all-time low in august 2019, but it is still lower than the rate at any point under any other president for whom we have data.\n\nthe hispanic unemployment rate was 4.2% in december 2019 -- an uptick from the 3.9% all-time low in september 2019 but, again, lower than any point under any other president for whom we have data.\n\nthe asian unemployment rate was 2.4% in december, an uptick from the 2.0% low of may 2018 but still a smidgen lower than the pre-trump record -- 2.6% in december 2016, obama's last full month in office.\n\n— donna borak\n\nfactories\n\ntrump said that after losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, america has now gained 12,000 new factories during his time in office.\n\nfacts first: both figures are correct, though it's worth noting that the numbers include both large traditional factories and tiny facilities that produce goods with fewer than five employees.\n\nthere are different ways to measure the number of manufacturing establishments in the country. according to the census bureau's statistics of us businesses data series, the number of manufacturing establishments in the us fell by 61,076 between 2001, the beginning of the george w. bush administration -- when there were 352,619 establishments -- and 2016, the last full year of the obama administration, when there were 291,543 establishments. that's a reduction of about 17%.\n\nanother government measure, the quarterly census of employment and wages, shows an increase of 12,074 in the number of manufacturing establishments between the first quarter of 2017 (343,972), when trump took office, and the second quarter of 2019, the most recent data available (356,046).\n\n— daniel dale\n\njob creation\n\ntrump said seven million new jobs have been created since his election, more than government experts projected during the previous administration.\n\nfacts first: trump is correct. between november 2016, the month of his election, and december 2019, the last month for which we have data, the economy added 7.3 million jobs.\n\nbetween february 2017, trump's first full month in office, and december 2019, the economy added 6.7 million jobs, according to the bureau of labor statistics. jobs added in january 2020 and the early days of this month likely took the total under trump even closer to 7 million. the jobs report for january is due on friday. but pre-election, trump said he would create 25 million jobs. regarding the projection it was not immediately clear what trump was referring to.\n\n— anneken tappe\n\nfood stamps\n\ntrump touted how the strong economy has lifted people out of poverty, noting that fewer people are enrolled in food stamps.\n\nunder my administration, 7 million americans have come off food stamps, trump said during tuesday's address.\n\nfacts first: it's true that fewer people receive food stamps than when trump took office, but he exaggerates the figure.\n\nsome 36.4 million people were enrolled in the supplemental nutrition assistance program, or snap -- the formal name for food stamps, in october 2019, according to data from the us department of agriculture.\n\nthat compares to 42.7 million who received food stamps in january 2017, when trump became president. that's a difference of 6.3 million.\n\nhowever, the october 2019 figure does not include data from north carolina. factoring in that data, the decline was closer to 5 million, according to the left-leaning center on budget and policy priorities.\n\nwhile much of the recent decline in food stamps is due to the stronger economy, experts said, the trump administration is pushing policies that will kick millions more off the rolls.\n\nofficials unveiled a rule in december that will require more food stamp recipients to work in order to receive benefits. the new requirement limits states' ability to waive existing work mandates and could result in 688,000 people losing assistance, according to the agriculture department.\n\nthe move is one of three trump administration efforts to overhaul snap. another proposed regulation, which would tighten the rules governing who qualifies for aid, could end up stripping more than 3 million people of their benefits and leave nearly 500,000 children without access to free school meals. the third proposal would change how allowances for utility expenses are calculated, which would have a mixed impact. the agency is still working on the latter two proposals.\n\ntogether, the proposed regulations would have decreased the number of people on food stamps by 3.7 million had they been implemented last year, according to a november report from the urban institute.\n\n— tami luhby\n\nimmigration and the border\n\nus-mexico border\n\ntrump said his administration has taken an unprecedented effort to secure the us-mexico border.\n\nfacts first: while it's unclear what measures trump is specifically referencing when he says unprecedented effort, his administration has taken some steps previous administrations haven't and officials have credited those measures with having reduced the influx of migrants into the us.\n\nstill, crossings at the southern border remain and many of the policies put forth by the trump administration have resulted in prolonged court challenges.\n\nin the last fiscal year, border patrol arrested more than 851,000 people trying to cross the southern border, leading to overcrowding in border facilities and straining the administration's resources. since then, border arrests have declined , but they remain high. last december, for example, border patrol arrested 32,858 people.\n\nover the last year, the trump administration has rolled out a series of policies to curtail the flow of asylum seekers to the border, such as the so-called remain in mexico policy. forcing migrants, many of whom are from central america, to mexico marks an unprecedented shift in us asylum policy. instead of living in the us as they work their way through the immigration court process, migrants are required to stay in mexico, under the policy formally known as the migrant protection protocols.\n\ndespite ongoing legal challenges, a federal appeals court allowed the policy to continue. department of homeland security spokeswoman heather swift has called the policy an effective tool to address the ongoing crisis at the southwest border, echoing similar praise from other administration officials.\n\n— priscilla alvarez\n\nborder wall\n\ntrump claimed to have built over 100 miles of a long, tall and very powerful border wall.\n\nfacts first: us customs and border protection said that, as of january 31, 115 miles of new border wall system had been built. the overwhelming majority has replaced dilapidated barriers with a new, enhanced wall system. around one mile has been built where there was no previous barrier.\n\nthe trump administration calls all miles new, arguing that it is all a major improvement on what was there before. critics scoff at the inclusion of replacement and reinforcement barriers in the new category, yet administration officials have stood by their classification.\n\none thing i want to emphasize is that every inch of the 100 miles that we have constructed is new border wall system, acting dhs chief chad wolf said in january. it's not so-called replacement wall, as some of our critics claimed. it is new wall.\n\n— daniel dale and priscilla alvarez\n\ncatch and release\n\ntrump repeated a concern he's voiced previously about the so-called catch and release practice, claiming migrants who were released never showed up for their assigned court date.\n\nbefore i came into office, trump said tuesday, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again.\n\nfacts first: this is not true. government data shows that, as of 2017, a majority of asylum seekers show up for their court hearings.\n\naccording to data from the department of justice, the rate of asylum seekers who did not appear for their court hearings rose from 9% in 2016 to 11% in 2017, meaning that roughly 90% of those actually do show up for their court hearings.\n\n— tara subramaniam\n\nillegal crossings\n\ntrump, touting his efforts to curb illegal migration, said that as a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75% since may -- dropping eight straight months in a row.\n\nfacts first: trump is correct about the recent decline, but he's cherry-picking the most favorable possible starting point: may 2019 was the month with the largest number of illegal crossings at any point in his presidency. the total number of illegal crossings under trump has increased, not decreased, from the late obama era.\n\nthe number of apprehensions and people deemed inadmissible at the southwest border, used as a proxy for the number of illegal crossings, was 144,116 in may. the number dropped every month through december, when it was 40,620 -- a decline of 72%. there was another decline in january, according to data obtained by cnn and not yet published by the government.\n\nbut the total number of people apprehended or deemed inadmissible for the 2019 fiscal year was 977,509. that's the highest number since 2007 and 77% higher than the 553,378 figure for the 2016 fiscal year, president barack obama's last full fiscal year in office.\n\n— daniel dale\n\nhealth\n\npre-existing conditions\n\ntrump has repeatedly promised to protect those with pre-existing conditions, even as he has sought to kill the affordable care act, which greatly expanded those safeguards.\n\ni've also made an ironclad pledge to american families. we will also protect patients with pre-existing conditions, he said during tuesday's state of the union address.\n\nfacts first: trump's claim about protecting those with pre-existing conditions is false. though trump says he would do this, his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the affordable care act -- including joining a lawsuit aimed at striking down the law -- without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits.\n\nthe affordable care act barred insurers in the individual market from denying people coverage or charging them higher premiums because of their health histories. also, carriers had to provide comprehensive coverage -- offering 10 essential health benefits, including maternity, mental health and prescription drugs.\n\ntrump has worked to undermine the affordable care act from his first day in office, when he issued an executive order directing agencies to interpret its regulations as loosely as possible. he championed congressional republicans' bills in 2017 that would have weakened the law's protections.\n\nand his justice department is siding with a coalition of republican states that are fighting in federal court to invalidate the affordable care act. an appellate panel in december upheld a lower court ruling that found obamacare's individual mandate unconstitutional but sent the case back to the lower court to decide whether the entire law must fall.\n\nthe president has said repeatedly that he would roll out a new health care plan that would protect those with pre-existing conditions, but he has yet to do so. last april, he backed away from pushing for a vote on a replacement plan until after the 2020 election.\n\nmeanwhile, he issued another executive order in late 2017 that would make it easier for americans to buy alternatives to the affordable care act that are cheaper, but offer fewer protections, such as short-term health plans . the law's defenders, however, fear that such plans could siphon off younger and healthier people, which could cause premiums to rise for those left buying policies in the obamacare exchanges.\n\ntrump's administration is also allowing states to make major changes to their obamacare markets, which could also leave low-income, older or sicker residents with few choices and higher costs. few states have taken the federal government up on this offer so far.\n\n— tami luhby\n\ndrug overdose deaths\n\nwith unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic -- drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. among the states hardest hit, ohio is down 22%, pennsylvania is down 18%, wisconsin is down 10% -- and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all, trump said during his speech.\n\nfacts first: trump's claim is correct, but it needs context. drug overdose deaths declined in 2018 for the first time since 1990, 28 years prior. the centers for disease control and prevention found that there were 67,367 drug overdose deaths in the united states in 2018, a 4.1% decline from 70,237 deaths in 2017.\n\nseveral states that were hardest hit did see a decrease, but others did not. while pennsylvania and ohio saw a decrease in overdose deaths in 2018, they were still among the top five states with the highest drug overdose death rate in the nation.\n\nthe cdc found that the drug overdose death rate was lower in 2018 than in 2017 in 14 states and the district of columbia. but the 2018 overdose death rate was also higher than in 2017 in five states -- california, delaware, missouri, new jersey and south carolina.\n\nand while the 2018 death rate due to heroin, methadone, and natural and semisynthetic opioids overdoses was lower or stayed the about the same as 2017, overdose deaths due to synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl, continued to rise in 2018. cocaine and psychostimulant overdose deaths also increased in 2018.\n\n— maegan vasquez\n\nprescription drug prices\n\ntackling the high cost of prescription drugs was one of trump's key campaign promises in 2016. and it's been a main focus of his administration, though little has actually been done.\n\nrecent statistics show a continued rise in drug prices, so trump harkened back to a data point he mentioned at last year's state of the union.\n\nand i was pleased to announce last year that for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down, trump said during his state of the union address.\n\nfacts first: that's not quite true. the president was citing the 12-month change in the consumer price index for prescription drugs for december 2018, when it dropped 0.6%. that was the largest (but not the first) decrease since april 1973, not in 51 years. at last year's state of the union he said drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.\n\nmore importantly, recent data shows that drug prices have continued to rise by several measures.\n\nthe list price of brand name drugs rose 3.2%, on average, over the 12 months ending in september 2019, after adjusting for inflation, according to ssr health, a consulting firm that captures about 90% of these medications sold in the us.\n\nthat's similar to the increase for drugs sold at the pharmacy and through mail order. the annual change in the consumer price index for prescription drugs was 3% in december, the third straight positive reading and its highest rate since june 2018, according to altarum, a nonprofit research and consulting firm. the cpi, however, varies widely month to month.\n\nthough the trump administration rolled out a 44-page blueprint on how to lower drug prices in 2018, few of the president's proposals have gone into effect. a district court judge last year blocked the administration's effort to require drug companies to include list prices in tv ads.\n\nadministration officials last year dropped plans to effectively ban drug makers from providing rebates to pharmacy benefit managers and insurers because it would have increased medicare premiums.\n\nand the administration's idea to set the medicare reimbursement level for certain drugs based on their cost in other countries has yet to be rolled out formally.\n\none effort that is moving forward -- amid much controversy -- is allowing states to import certain drugs from canada. several states, led by florida, have expressed interest in doing this. canada, however, hasn't been so eager to participate, and experts question whether it would be effective since canada's prescription drug supply is small compared to the us market.\n\ndrug companies, however, do appear to have slowed the rate of price increases, perhaps in part because of trump's twitter bully pulpit. pfizer temporarily walked back hikes in mid-2018 after trump tweeted that it should be ashamed for raising prices and taking advantage of the poor. pfizer ended up raising them the following january.\n\neveryone has pulled in their horns. it's not worth getting into a twitter war with the president, said richard evans, founder of ssr health.\n\n— tami luhby\n\ntrade\n\nusmca\n\ntrump claimed that the new us-mexico-canada agreement, which replaces the north american free trade agreement, will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying american auto jobs.\n\nfacts first: trump is inflating his administration's own estimate of job creation under the new trade deal -- which is even higher than an estimate from an independent agency.\n\nit's difficult to predict what will happen in the future. but a report from the trump administration's own office of us trade representative put the number at 76,000 jobs over five years.\n\nthe us international trade commission, an agency that is part of the federal government but conducts its analysis independently of the administration, estimated an increase of 29,700 jobs in auto parts production because of the usmca, but a decline of 1,600 jobs in vehicle production.\n\n— katie lobosco\n\ncourts\n\njudicial appointments\n\ntouting his record of appointing conservative judges, trump said, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our constitution as written.\n\nfacts first: trump does not have the overall record for judges confirmed at this point in a presidential term. but he does hold the record for appeals court judges confirmed, according to russell wheeler, a visiting fellow at the brookings institution who tracks judicial appointments.\n\nthe 187 judges trump has appointed falls short of the 197 president jimmy carter appointed at the same point in his term.\n\nthe 50 appeals court judges appointed by trump thus far beats the 48 carter had appointed, though carter was operating with a smaller judiciary.\n\ntrump has confirmed 21% of judgeships. for carter, it was 29%, and for president richard nixon it was 32%.\n\n— curt devine\n\ndemocratic response\n\nmichigan gov. gretchen whitmer said in the democratic response to trump's state of the union that american workers are hurting and wages have stagnated. in my own state. our neighbors in wisconsin. and ohio. and pennsylvania. all over the country. wages have stagnated, while ceo pay has skyrocketed.\n\nfacts first: it is unclear what numbers whitmer is citing, but the bureau of labor statistics' it is unclear what numbers whitmer is citing, but the bureau of labor statistics' latest jobs report doesn't support her claim.\n\naverage hourly earnings rose 2.9% in 2019, the report says. consumer price inflation meanwhile stood at 2.3% over the 12 months ending in december, leaving average hourly earnings slightly higher for the year.\n\naccording to the same wage measure, paychecks also rose in the states whitmer cited -- ohio, michigan, wisconsin and pennsylvania.\n\n— anneken tappe\n\nthis story is being

updated.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[11:00:44] alex marquardt, cnn anchor: good morning. i'm alex marquardt, in for fredricka whitfield this saturday. thanks for joining us.\n\n\n\nwe are following a number of breaking stories this morning.\n\n\n\nfirst, the trump administration losing yet another cabinet member. just moments ago, the president announced on twitter that interior secretary ryan zinke has resigned and will leave the administration at the end of the year. zinke departs amid growing scrutiny over a number of ethics investigations during his time heading up the interior department. we will have much more on zinke's resignation in a few moments.\n\n\n\nbut right now we move on to our other breaking story of the morning -- the future of health care for millions of americans is once again up in the air.\n\n\n\na federal judge in texas striking down obamacare, a controversial ruling that is setting the scene for a major legal battle ahead. this could once again leave the fate of president obama's landmark health care law in the hands of the supreme court.\n\n\n\nnow the texas judge's decision centers round the individual coverage mandate which requires all americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty. congress effectively eliminated that penalty as part of the 2017 tax cut bill. now the judge is saying that mandate is unconstitutional. so the entire law, he says, is invalid.\n\n\n\nmany states in reaction are vowing to fight back and appeal that calling the ruling an assault while president trump who campaigned vociferously against obamacare is taking a victory lap on twitter touting that new ruling.\n\n\n\nso for more, we are joined by our supreme court reporter, ariane de vogue.\n\n\n\nariane -- break this down for us. obamacare, signing up for that ends at midnight. millions have signed up for obamacare for 2019. but this really will not affect -- will not immediately affect them? ariane de vogue, cnn supreme court report: right, it won't. but this\n\n\n\nis a really broad ruling. this judge said not only is the individual mandate unconstitutional. he said the entire law must go.\n\n\n\nnow it's just one judge right, reed o'connor --\n\n\n\nmarquardt: right.\n\n\n\nde vogue: it can be appealed on this. but boy, it sends into doubt the future of a lot of people thinking about health care. he said it can remain in effect pending appeal.\n\n\n\nbut let me walk you through just a bit the history of it --\n\n\n\nmarquardt: yes.\n\n\n\nde vogue: -- so we understand how we got to today. remember back in 2012, the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the individual mandate. remember it was chief justice john roberts, he said it was ok under the taxing power.\n\n\n\nflash forward to 2017, congress acts to get rid of the tax penalty. so this judge last night says, look, you got rid of the tax penalty. that's the legal underpinning of this supreme court opinion. so now, not only is the individual mandate unconstitutional, but everything else must fall. that is a huge win for critics of obamacare.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: and as you and i were discussing right before the show this goes well beyond what the trump administration had even wanted.\n\n\n\nso game this out for us. it will go through an appeals process but it could make its way to the supreme court. and the supreme court has now shifted dramatically since the last ruling. so how does this all play out?\n\n\n\nde vogue: well, first of all, remember, the trump administration they've declined to defend this law. so california and a group of other states, they stepped in and last night they said we are going to the fifth circuit. that's a very conservative federal appeals court in texas.\n\n\n\nso the fifth circuit will look at it. and if it upholds exactly what o'connor did then this thing will shoot right to the supreme court because that's so broad. the fifth circuit could scale back a little bit and so maybe it wouldn't go to the court. but the court likes to hear things when they are big. national laws like this.\n\n\n\nwe do have this new, solidified, conservative majority but we also might have a concern about what is called severability, really kind of jibes by knocking down one provision, take the whole thing. that might be at issue at the court, too. so they will have to look at it if it gets to them.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: a lot of moving parts. but the important part to remember is nothing changes immediately --\n\n\n\nde vogue: right.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: -- but it is once again in jeopardy.\n\n\n\nde vogue: yes.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: so a lot of drama ahead probably.\n\n\n\nariane de vogue -- thanks so much for joining us and explaining that.\n\n\n\nde vogue: thank you.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: all right. well, the affordable care act was, as we mentioned, one president obama's biggest achievement while in office. this latest ruling threatens to wipe away the protection for people with pre-existing conditions, as you just heard from ariane\n\n\n\n[11:04:59] that is a major staple of the law which was widely featured in the 2018 midterm campaign on both sides among democrats and republicans.\n\n\n\nso joining me now is one of the architects of obamacare, jonathan gruber. jonathan -- thanks so much for joining us this morning.\n\n\n\nfirst of all, what is your reaction to this ruling out of texas?\n\n\n\njonathan gruber, architect of obamacare: well, i think it's really disappointing. i mean essentially a perversion of representative democracy.\n\n\n\nrepublicans controlled the congress. they had a chance to strike down obamacare. they said no, we are going to leave obamacare and strike down the tax penalty. so they have literally said it is severable. republicans have spoken. they said it's severable.\n\n\n\nyet, this judge is saying, no, i don't believe what the representative democracy delivered. i'm going to declare it unseverable.\n\n\n\nso that's why legal experts, even legal experts who were opposed to the affordable care act in previous cases are saying this is just ridiculous.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: and the judge did say that because the individual mandate is unconstitutional, the whole law is as well. that mandate as we know is what they called as central and inseverable, as you were just discussing, from the remainder of obamacare. so do you agree?\n\n\n\ngruber: well look, i think when the law passed we all thought the mandate was a very important part of the law. we have now basically been proven that it's important but not as important as we thought because look, we now have experience of the law without it, they removed the mandate. and we are seeing it weakens the law, it raises premiums, but the law still remains quite strong, albeit not as strong as it would have been.\n\n\n\nso we have seen empirically that the law -- that it is severable. the law still works without it. congress in its wisdom has declared that it's severable, has said, look, we're going to keep the law but remove the mandate penalty.\n\n\n\nso really there is just no basis for a judge in texas to just say despite what the body that represents the american people have said, i'm going to decide this is not severable. there's just no reason to do it.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: are you confident in the appeals process that this won't go any farther?\n\n\n\ngruber: no, i'm not confident. previous cases on the affordable care act have all been clearly, by an objective standard, easy wins for the affordable care act, and yet they've all passed by the skin of their teeth.\n\n\n\nthe supreme court clearly does not represent the constitutional expertise of the broad senate constitutional experts, who for example in 2012 by about an 80 percent to 90 percent margin said the mandate was constitutional. yet the supreme court found it wasn't.\n\n\n\nso i'm nervous. what's fortunate is the supreme court i think does care about the opinion of the american people. the american people have spoken. they believe that protecting people with pre-existing conditions against insurance market discrimination is a key contribution of this law. and indeed it is.\n\n\n\nand i think hopefully the supreme court will see that that's something that matters to people. and that because of some obscure severability clause --\n\n\n\nmarquardt: right.\n\n\n\ngruber: -- or lack of severability --\n\n\n\nmarquardt: right.\n\n\n\ngruber: -- they will not go against the will of the congress.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: you say you are nervous. at the same time you say that the supreme court listens to the will of the american people. but now we have a supreme court that has two new conservative justices in gorsuch and kavanaugh on it. so if this makes its way to the supreme court, do you have any sense of how you think they might rule or how the whole court would rule?\n\n\n\ngruber: i honestly don't. i just hope that they will look and realize that even without the individual mandate, we are talking about a law that provided insurance to 17 million people, and for the 133 million americans with pre-existing conditions, it's saying don't worry, if you lose health insurance you can go buy it on the exchange.\n\n\n\nif this law goes away, we return to a day where people who are sick can't get health insurance, which defeats the whole purpose of the product.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: all right. jonathan gruber -- thanks so much for joining us this morning. gruber: you bet. >\n\n\n\nmarquardt: all right. joining me now is npr congressional reporter kelsey snell, and assistant editor at the washington post and cnn political commentator david swerdlick.\n\n\n\ndavid -- let's start with you. protecting those with pre-existing conditions was a focal point of the midterm campaigns and did help democrats take back the house. what do you think are the political consequences of this ruling?\n\n\n\ndavid swerdlick, cnn political commentator: so, good morning -- alex.\n\n\n\ni think the political consequences are that republicans have now basically done the equivalent of playing jenga. they pulled the bottom block out of something hoping it will collapse. it's not going to go away yet because as your previous guest has said it's going to have to go up to the supreme court probably to resolve this.\n\n\n\nbut if the affordable care act eventually does fall apart, then you have a divided congress that's not going to be able to agree on how to proceed with health care and that will leave millions of americans who depended on the affordable care act sort of in the lurch.\n\n\n\ndemocrats are moving left toward medicare for all. republicans have been unable to pass their plans, which are a version of, you know, market-based health care where states can choose what kind of plans they have. the two sides are far apart.\n\n\n\n[11:10:02] i don't think democrats in the immediate future are going to be able to deliver on this because they don't have the senate. and i think republicans are going to have to answer in the coming months why they want to take this apart if they don't have a plan in place that can replace it that's clearly better.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: and kelsey -- picking up on that, the soon-to-be house majority leader nancy pelosi has slammed this ruling. is there anything that she can do?\n\n\n\nkelsey snell, congressional reporter, npr: well, she is very capable for bringing up bills to vote on her congress at this point so that the house could potentially take a vote and uphold portions of the law or even bring back the penalty for the individual mandate that was zeroed out by republicans last year.\n\n\n\nbut i think it's very important that this is a big political issue for pelosi. she firmly believes and has strong evidence for the fact that republicans lost many, many congressional races in states like new jersey and in florida and california based on messaging on the affordable care act because voters really started to like this law.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: right.\n\n\n\nsnell: they may not like it being branded as obamacare but they really do like the protections that are in the law.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: right.\n\n\n\ndavid -- a point that i have been trying to get at with some of our guests is --\n\n\n\nswerdlick: -- if we play this -- if we game this out and it gets to the supreme court and now you have the supreme court that is firmly conservative with the nominations of neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh -- how does that impact things? because the chief justice john roberts was the key vote, the key voice last time and now you've got solid five to four conservative majority. so how is that going to affect things?\n\n\n\nswerdlick: yes. no -- i think we're going to -- it's a little bit of a wait and see. i mean this texas federal judge has a reasonable if not ultimately winning point that if the supreme court in 2012, you know, premised its upholding of the affordable care act on the idea that this was part of congress's taxing power but now the law does not include the penalty or the tax then that premise is gone.\n\n\n\non the other hand, the idea i think ariane was talking about the severability problem earlier in your program -- the problem is does this make the entire law fail. and you know, i can't get into the minds of the supreme court justices, including justice roberts who is a conservative bush appointee who's the chief justice, but who i think in 2012 clearly saw what would happen if the supreme court intervened to essentially undo the will of congress. so i have to go with wait and see right now -- alex.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: wait and see it is.\n\n\n\nall right. well, he have a lot more to discuss. david and kelsey -- please stay with us.\n\n\n\nwe're going to take a quick break.\n\n\n\nstill ahead, turmoil inside the white house. just after president trump names mick mulvaney as his acting chief of staff, his interior secretary ryan zinke steps down amid several ethics investigations.\n\n\n\nwe will be live from the white house, next.\n\n\n\n[11:12:45] (commercial break)\n\n\n\nmarquardt: president trump has lost yet another cabinet member after naming an acting chief of staff. in a tweet this morning the president announcing the resignation of his embattled interior secretary ryan zinke. trump tweeting that zinke is stepping down and will leave his administration at the end of the year. zinke was under growing pressure over a number of ethics enquiries.\n\n\n\nthe president has also announced on twitter that mick mulvaney will become the acting chief of staff at the end of the year. mulvaney will also somehow continue in his job as the director of the office of management and budget, the omb.\n\n\n\nso for more let's bring in cnn's sarah westwood at the white house. sarah -- zinke was in trouble because of all these investigations but his departure didn't seem imminent, did it? why did all this happen today?\n\n\n\nsarah westwood, cnn white house reporter: well, alex -- interior secretary ryan zinke is someone whose fate within the administration had been was unclear for several months now given some of the headlines that he's generated in the white house responding to those by saying they'd look into the problems facing zinke but the timing of his departure comes amid a massive staff shake-up across the west wing in the cabinet.\n\n\n\nnow zinke had been embattled for weeks now. he was facing a number of probes from the department of interiors inspector general over allegations that he used his post to enrich himself, that he perhaps had a relationship with the chairman of haliburton that was under investigation. his dealing in a casino project in connecticut also being looked at by the agency's inspector general. abuse potentially of agency resources.\n\n\n\nand cnn reported in october, that the department of justice was looking into some of the zinke's conduct after the inspector general referred some of its work to the justice department.\n\n\n\nnow, zinke's departure does perhaps prevent some headaches for this white house because now he won't really be in a position to be dragged before congress. democrats had been vowing to bring him in to ask him questions about some of these scandals -- alex.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: sarah -- switching over to mulvaney for a second, he has been named acting chief of staff, emphasis on the acting. and somehow he is going to do that incredibly difficult and time-consuming job while also holding on to his job as the head of omb?\n\n\n\nwestwood: that's right. that's what this administration says, although the day-to-day work will be taken over by a deputy. it won't even be the first time mulvaney is pulling double duty. he also took over as head of the cfpb earlier in the trump president -- something that was a little controversial at the time.\n\n\n\nbut the president is accepting mulvaney in this position, in an acting capacity is a remarkable shift from just a couple of weeks ago when the president ultimately wasn't able to come to an agreement with his first choice for the position, nick ayers, vice president mike pence's chief of staff, because ayers wanted to hold it on a temporary basis as well. but the president is suddenly ok with having an acting chief of staff to fill this vacancy -- alex.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: all right. sarah westwood at the white house. thanks for breaking that all down.\n\n\n\nso back with me to discuss more are david swerdlick and kelsey snell.\n\n\n\nkelsey -- sarah was just hitting on the point that i wanted to start with you, the fact that the first choice for chief of staff, nick ayers, who is vice president's pence's chief of staff. [11:20:05] the reason those talks broke down is because he wanted the acting title and trump didn't. so why do you think he's accepted it with mulvaney? is it just to sort of quash any perception that no one wants the job?\n\n\n\nsnell: it may just be that because, as you know, there have been other candidates who have said no or who have been turned down since ayers decided that this wasn't the job for him. like mark meadows --\n\n\n\nmarquardt: right.\n\n\n\nsnell: -- the freedom caucus chairman. and you know, it may also be to put a little bit of ease with people in congress because mulvaney has an odd relationship with folks up there, particularly with democrats.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: congressman for six years.\n\n\n\nsnell: he was. and there are democrats who are already out there saying that trump is picking mulvaney because he wants to have a bigger shutdown fight and that's something that mulvaney has always been a kind of a critic of government spending and he was one of the republicans who always fought to keep spending limited. so it's entirely possible that he is trying to calm the waters.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: and he's a true partisan and true supporter of the president so it's unlikely that he's going to be that middle ground, that moderating diplomat with democrats on capitol hill.\n\n\n\nsnell: that is not the expectation that people have for the type of chief of staff that we would see from mick mulvaney.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: david, to you -- like many republicans the president's new acting chief of staff has not had kind words for the president in the past, specifically before the 2016 election.\n\n\n\nand overnight there's new video that we found of mulvaney before election day and in it mulvaney actually explains why he is reluctantly supporting trump. let's take a quick listen to that and we'll talk on the other side.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nmick mulvaney, omb director: yes, i'm supporting donald trump. i'm doing so as enthusiastically as i can, given the fact that he's a terrible human being. but the choice on the other side is just as bad.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nmarquardt: he's a terrible human being. i wonder if the president has actually seen that piece of video. assuming he does at some point, do you think that mulvaney will actually become the permanent chief of staff?\n\n\n\nswerdlick: no idea. but -- and i haven't seen that video yet -- alex. but i have two reactions to it. one is that even though it's a little more blunt than most would put it, in some ways i think that is an articulation of the bargain that a lot of republicans in congress and a lot of republican voters made with president trump in 2016.\n\n\n\nthat they didn't think he was great on issues of personal character or comportment but they preferred him to secretary clinton. they liked his agenda and they wanted a republican in the white house with a republican congress so they made that deal and they went with them and now here they are.\n\n\n\nand now here congressman mulvaney or rather director mulvaney is now. he's a loyal trump soldier now, served as omb director, cfpb as sarah just reported.\n\n\n\nhe's got the right resume but i agree with what kelsey said to you a minute ago. the fact that you have to take him on an interim basis just shows how much people don't want this job.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: kelsey -- when you hear -- to david's point -- that people don't want this job and yet you see the president saying that many people wanted this job, which is true? are people actually lining up to try to be the chief of staff in this white house at this time?\n\n\n\nsnell: not as far as we have seen. there are some people who enjoyed having their names out there or were, you know, were not discouraging that conversation --\n\n\n\nmarquardt: right.\n\n\n\nsnell: -- about their candidacy. we haven't seen a lot of people come forward. it would be a very difficult job. we have seen that through the number of people who have gone through it already.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: very difficult because we have the democrats coming in to taking over the house, and we're at possibly the end of the mueller investigation. so this is a white house that's under fire.\n\n\n\nsnell: yes, this is a time when things are about to get a little bit stickier.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: all right. david, back to you -- how could mulvaney help trump navigate this russia investigation. we've seen a number of events this week with regards to michael flynn and michael cohen and paul manafort. so there is a sense that robert mueller might be wrapping things up in the early months of next year. how do you think mulvaney is going to help with that?\n\n\n\nswedlick: you know, i think at a minimum, he knows congress as a former member of congress so he can at least help the president with the ins and outs of the committee process even if he, as kelsey said earlier, is not on the best of terms with all the democrats in congress. that's the book on mulvaney.\n\n\n\nhe has a fresh start here, right. with some bad blood brewing between the president and general kelly. the president didn't have confidence in reince priebus, his first chief of staff. so at a minimum, he's able to turn the page and say ok, where do we go from here, fresh start?\n\n\n\nbut the president is looking at the mueller investigation coming to a conclusion perhaps sometime in the next few months. the president is looking at a situation where he's already done a tax cut into a full employment environment. so if there's a recession, let's say, what stimulative things can he approach congress with at this point? it is going to be a tough sled for any chief of staff for any white house in this next congress, i think.\n\n\n\n[11:24:54] marquardt: and kelsey -- with mulvaney coming in as acting, that is kind of plugging one hole in the boat but at the same time, you've got john kelly widely respected, leaving. you now have ryan zinke leaving under this cloud of ethics investigations. that, of course, follows scott pruitt and tom price.\n\n\n\ni mean how battered does the white house become with these two high- profile departures after this long string of other departures?\n\n\n\nsnell: well, this is not necessarily something that's going to calm critics down. it's also not a situation that makes it any easier on the senate because they are going to have to confirm replacements for zinke --\n\n\n\nmarquardt: right.\n\n\n\nsnell: -- and for another attorney general.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: right.\n\n\n\nsnell: this has been very difficult for them to get through controversial nominees. we've seen a lot of nominees get through on very narrow votes. we've seen the vice president have to break more ties his than several of his predecessors combined.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: right.\n\n\n\nsnell: so this is creating a serious backlog and a serious issue for the white house in the very beginning of next year.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: so much to discuss, we could spend hours on it but unfortunately we have to go.\n\n\n\nkelsey, david swerdlick in new york -- thank you so much.\n\n\n\ncoming up, interview showdown. sources telling cnn that the special counsel's team continues to be interested in sitting down with the president, but will the president give in?\n\n\n\n[11:26:03] (commercial break)\n\n\n\nmarquardt: the special counsel overseeing the russia investigation still wants a face-to-face meeting with president trump, but the president's lawyers are saying a sit-down interview is not going to happen. the development follows a new slam by robert mueller involving general michael flynn, the former national security advisor. the special counsel is dismissing suggestions by flynn's lawyers that\n\n\n\nhe lied to the fbi because he was set up. the memo caps a head- spinning week of revelations that shows the legal walls are closing in on trump and the people around him.\n\n\n\nthese are the current active investigations in and around trump's orbit. take a look at this. the trump campaign, the trump transition team, the trump inaugural committee, the trump foundation, and the trump organization and, of course, the trump administration itself.\n\n\n\ncnn's erica orden is following all of this. erica -- let's start with michael flynn. this was a fascinating moment because both sides, the flynn legal team and the mueller legal team had said that michael flynn deserves no jail time because of his extensive cooperation. now we see the mueller coming out swinging saying that michael flynn's version of the facts is untrue and he should have known that lying to federal investigators is against the law.\n\n\n\nerica orden, cnn correspondent: that's right. so, as you pointed out, one of the important things to keep in mind is that both sides have asked for little to no prison time for michael flynn. however the prosecutors had been pushing back against some of flynn's claims.\n\n\n\nand one effect that all of this may have in terms of the sentencing is that the judge has brought up in his court filings and, you know, you've seen the judge order prosecutors and lawyers and from the special counsel's office to file additional material in response to some of those claims.\n\n\n\nso what you may see during sentencing is the judge seek to elicit more information on some of these issues from both sides -- from flynn's attorneys and from the special counsel team.\n\n\n\nand you may see the judge enquire with flynn and with his attorneys about why flynn is bringing up some of these -- some of these claims right now just before -- just prior to his sentencing.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: so how do you think that actually plays into the sentencing which is on tuesday? flynn could face up to six months. i understand his legal team has asked for probation. they've offered 200 hours of community service. but given that flynn has now clearly irked the mueller folks, does that make it more likely that he could face some prison time?\n\n\n\norden: he does seem to have irked them but given again that both sides have asked for little to no prison time, and that the mueller team has gone into detail about -- although some of it has been redacted in court filings -- has gone into detail about flynn's level of cooperation and his willingness to assist the special counsel investigation. it doesn't seem likely that these kinds of claims will substantively change the ultimate sentence for him.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: and of course, the major question, what did michael flynn actually tell the prosecutors in more than 62 hours of conversations about president trump.\n\n\n\neric orden -- thanks so much for breaking that down for us.\n\n\n\norden: thanks .\n\n\n\nmarquardt: so for more, let's bring in elie honig who is a former federal prosecutor and state prosecutor.\n\n\n\nmueller says that this won't change his recommendation, that flynn will receive no jail time. so elie -- what does this tell us about mueller's process and what were flynn's lawyers doing calling out the fbi in the first place in that sentencing memo?\n\n\n\nelie honig, former federal prosecutor: yes. i do not think this will change mueller's recommendation of no jail time. i think -- but i do think flynn's lawyers overstepped here. they went down a road that they didn't need to.\n\n\n\ntheir guy was perfectly situated to get a no jail time sentence.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: right. that was the defense recommendation. that was mueller's recommendation. it was a done deal.\n\n\n\ni don't know why they poked this bear. they did not need to. and the arguments they're making are silly. they are not correct as a matter of law. they're not correct as a matter of common sense.\n\n\n\nthe fbi has no obligation to tell someone in this situation that they ought to get a lawyer because the interrogation was not in fbi custody. so that's different from like a miranda setting. the fbi did not have to warn michael flynn, hey if you lie to us, that's a crime.\n\n\n\nand by the way of all people who should know that it should be the incoming national security adviser. so i don't know why the lawyers went down this path. i don't see any benefit to it for flynn.\n\n\n\n[11:35:01] now the judge has shown some interest, as you said before -- alex. and i don't -- that could mean either thing. that could meant the judge is thinking about throwing the case out. i don't think that's likely. it could mean that the judge on the opposite side is ticked off and think that flynn has not truly accepted responsibility now which could result in a slightly higher sentence.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: right. let's just remind our viewers what happened is that flynn was questioned by fbi agents, that those fbi agents did not tell him explicitly that lying to the fbi is illegal.\n\n\n\nhonig: right.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: and the mueller's team response was someone who spent this much time heading up an intelligence agency in the military at this highest level of u.s. government should know that.\n\n\n\nso elie -- flynn was one of the first people in trump's inner circle to cooperate extensively as both his team and the mueller have said at the highest level. he was cooperating. he was part of the campaign. he's part of the transition. he's part of the administration. does it looks like this is a test case for other potential cooperators?\n\n\n\nhonig: it could be. look, i always approach cooperators from the point of view that the other potential cooperators are watching. and that's why i think mueller has been smart.\n\n\n\nthe cooperators who have come through, who've been honest, who've been truthful, who've given him good information he's gone to bat for. michael flynn being one of them.\n\n\n\nthe cooperators who have messed around and played games and stretched the truth he's thrown out. papadopoulos, right, mueller put in a very negative sentencing memo on papadopoulos. and of course, paul manafort who mueller threw out of the prop room altogether. and now manafort is looking at an extremely high sentence.\n\n\n\nso i think there is important messages to be sent which is if you cooperate and you do it right and you do it fully and you do it truthfully you will get a benefit. but if you come in here and play games it's going to back fire.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: and elie, now this news that the special counsel says he still wants to interview president trump on the russia investigation. of course, his lawyers have pushed back and say they are opposed. they don't want to do that.\n\n\n\nhere is what president trump's former lawyer, michael cohen, said about the president's truthfulness. take a listen.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\ngeorge stephanopoulos, abc news anchor: the special counsel did say that you were doing your best to tell the truth about everything related to their investigation, everything related to russia. do you think president trump is telling the truth about that?\n\n\n\nmichael cohen, former trump attorney: no.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nmarquardt: so very simply, is it in president trump's interest to sit down with robert mueller?\n\n\n\nhonig: no, if i was representing the president i would fight that at all costs. but there's two ways this can go. they can agree to terms of an interview between mueller and trump's team. i don't think that will happen because i don't believe trump lawyers are willing to walk him into a room with mueller and let him answer questions.\n\n\n\nand if not then the ball moves over to mueller's court, is he going to issue a subpoena? and if he does, we're going to end up in the courts and we're going to have i think a very close contest up to the supreme court.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: and if he issues a subpoena, of course, that is to be approved by mueller's bosses -- rod rosenstein, the acting attorney general matt whitaker until there's actually a new attorney general. so it's unclear whether that subpoena would actually come into effect.\n\n\n\nbut elie -- the last question to you. the trump entities as we highlighted at the top there are under investigation across the board. it does feel like to some extent that the walls are closing in on the president. what does it mean for trump legally, personally himself? should he be scared at this moment more so than in the past?\n\n\n\nhonig: he should. he's got exposure on various levels. let's start with i do think it's unlikely that the department of justice indicts the sitting president. there is existing doj guidance saying that doj will not do that.\n\n\n\nthat said there are plenty of people very close to the president, including potentially relatives of his who could be in criminal legal jeopardy. and he's going to have all manner of civil problems. the trump org is going to have to deal with all sort of civil lawsuits as well. so yes, i wouldn't be resting easy by any means.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: all right. elie honig, always appreciate your expertise.\n\n\n\nhonig: thanks -- alex.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: thanks for joining us. >\n\n\n\nall right. up next, we're going to hear from the family of a 7-year- old migrant girl who died in u.s. custody. and what u.s. officials are saying about how exactly this tragedy happened.\n\n\n\n[11:38:59] (commercial break)\n\n\n\nmarquardt: a protest is planned this afternoon in el paso, texas after a 7-year-old migrant girl from guatemala died in u.s. custody. she was detained with her father in a remote part of new mexico on december 6th. officials say she was medically cleared to be taken to a detention facility with the rest of her group which included another 50 unaccompanied children.\n\n\n\nthe next day she got seriously ill and was airlifted to a hospital where she went into cardiac arrest and died a short time later. an autopsy is being performed, but an initial hospital report says that the girl died of septic shock.\n\n\n\nfor more let's bring in cnn's ed lavandera who is in el paso. ed -- what are we now hearing from the girl's family?\n\n\n\ned lavandera, cnn correspondent: well, they are simply devastated. we've been able to reach the family in guatemala, the extended family and mother and grandfather who spoke about how devastated and horrified they are by the news of what has happened to this young girl.\n\n\n\nthe grandfather of jacqueline spoke with us -- our cnn colleagues from cnn espanol who were down in guatemala speaking with them. and this is what they had to share. (begin video clip)\n\n\n\ndomingo caal, grandfather of girl who died in u.s. custody: i'm not going to speak that much because i can barely take it. it's difficult for us. this happened because we are very much in need. the girl would jump in happiness that she would get to go to the united states, very happy and content. but she didn't know. for us it's very difficult.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\n[11:45:02] lavandera: the family talked about how it was desperation that drove them to make that long journey. and of course, there has been a great deal of debate about the very trek that they made.\n\n\n\ntrump administration officials have been very critical of the father in particular for, quote, choosing to cross illegally into the united states. that has been pushed back on very intensely from immigrant rights activist, especially here in el paso who say it's the trump administration's policies and immigration stance that is driving many of these people to cross into the country illegally.\n\n\n\nthis father and daughter were part of a large group of migrants who had crossed into a border checkpoint in the far remote areas of western new mexico. this was hundreds of miles from many things where they would have been able to provide quick medical care in this situation.\n\n\n\nso a great deal of debate and a lot of finger-pointing as to how all of this could have happened -- alex.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: one of the disturbing things, ed, in this whole story is that this happened more than a week ago so why did it take so long for this to come to light?\n\n\n\nlavandera: that's a big question, you know. and there has been a number of critics who really kind of fault the transparency or the lack of transparency on the part of the trump administration.\n\n\n\nel paso congressman beto o'rourke basically faulted the department of homeland security for not being transparent enough. the leader of the customs and border protection testified before congress on tuesday several days after this young girl had passed away and made no mention of this particular case.\n\n\n\nso there is a great number of criticism of the administration for essentially having to count on a news report to break thins story and bring it to light.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: all right. ed lavandera in el paso, texas -- thanks so much.\n\n\n\nnow, remember the deadly shooting at a high school in parkland florida back in february? the panel investigating the attacks now wants a new law allowing teachers to carry guns. details and reactions coming up next. [11:47:09] (commercial break)\n\n\n\nmarquardt: this week we saw a new controversial push to put guns in classrooms to try to avoid tragedies like the parkland massacre. it's been ten months since 17 people, 14 of them children, were gunned down at marjory stoneman douglas high school in parkland, florida.\n\n\n\nnow the school safety committee formed after that shooting has voted to recommend a state law be passed that allows teachers to be armed with guns. those teachers would have to volunteer and undergo a background check.\n\n\n\nnow, this comes as a new report from the cdc shows that nearly 40,000 people were killed by guns last year. that's the highest number since at least 1979 when firearm deaths were first recorded -- 40,000.\n\n\n\njoining me now is cnn correspondent polo sandoval. polo -- what can you tell us about this recommendation to arm teachers?\n\n\n\npolo sandoval, cnn correspondent: well, you know, first off, alex -- that commission is certainly still remembering those 17 people whose lives were cut short, their families continue to grieve today and they likely will the rest of their lives.\n\n\n\nbut for the last eight months, members of the commission that was appointed to try to come up with a solution has been meeting trying to figure out a way of preventing something like this from happening again.\n\n\n\nand what's interesting here is that is a majority of them, about 14 of the 15 members of that panel all came to an agreement in the last few days. and all of them believe that perhaps the solution is to allow more teachers to carry weapons in the classroom.\n\n\n\n(begin videotape)\n\n\n\nbob gualtieri, pinellas county sheriff: such as participating on the threat assessment teams.\n\n\n\nsandoval: the marjory stoneman douglas high school public safety commission is recommending teachers be allowed to carry guns on school campuses. the controversial proposal part of a 407-page preliminary report. it addresses failures by broward county law enforcement during the massacre as well as recommendations on how to counter future school violence.\n\n\n\nchairing the commission, pinellas county sheriff bob gualtieri who supports the measure.\n\n\n\ngualtieri: we have to give people a fighting chance so we've got to give them an opportunity to protect themselves in my view. we don't have enough to put cops in every school or multiple cops in every school and we're not maximizing the use of the guardian program. and one person, one good guy with a gun on every campus is not adequate.\n\n\n\nsandoval: the proposal has yet to go before the governor or state lawmakers. if approved, teachers who want to carry would be required to go through training and background checks before arming themselves.\n\n\n\nunidentified female: here's the issue -- districts and schools need to act now.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: right.\n\n\n\nunidentified female: they need to act now. they need to act now.\n\n\n\nsandoval: currently only some teachers and school staff are allowed to carry firearms. since the parkland shooting, at least 14 other states have introduced similar measures. the changes have been met with some support in states where rural communities lack funding and resources to respond to a school shooter.\n\n\n\nmax schachter is the only person on the advisory commission opposing the arming of florida teachers.\n\n\n\nmax schachter, parent: i don't think teachers should be carrying guns. i think they have enough on their plate. i think their priority is teaching. it just creates a lot of host of problems.\n\n\n\nsandoval: with the recommendation still tentative, more debate is likely about how to face a school's worst nightmare.\n\n\n\ngualtieri: what we got right now isn't working. so we need to do something differently.\n\n\n\n(end videotape)\n\n\n\n[11:54:54] sandoval: and though this measure has large support within that public safety commission, there is a plenty of opposition outside of it, particularly some of these pro-gun reform groups, including every town for gun safety, a volunteer with that group strongly condemning it.\n\n\n\nalex -- i want to read you a small portion of the statement that he published the week following the release of this draft report. gay valemont (ph) a volunteer with this group, writing there is no evidence that arming teachers makes kids safer. he went on to write our children deserve real solutions to keep them safe from gun violence, like a criminal background check on every gun sale.\n\n\n\nso even though this is still a draft report, still has to go to the governor, alex, still also has to go to legislators, this obviously is still making for quite a bit of debate there in florida to try to keep something like this from happening again.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: and of course this is the kind of policy that the president has trumpeted numerous times --\n\n\n\nsandoval: right.\n\n\n\nmarquardt: -- after this horrific massacres that we've seen.\n\n\n\npolo sandoval, thanks so much for that report. all right. still ahead, a federal judge has struck down the affordable care act, obamacare marking a win for president trump but potentially putting the health care of millions of americans in jeopardy.\n\n\n\n[11:55:59] (commercial break)

alas, no. americans use roughly the same or less healthcare, but pay far more for health services including drugs, hospital stays, and medical procedures such as an mri.\n\nthe canada comparison\n\na comparison of healthcare costs between the us and 10 other high-income countries allows a detailed comparison of the us and canada, the most relevant peer country. according to the comparative data, the us spends 17.8% of gdp compared with canada's 10.3%, amounting to $9,403 per person in the us compared with canada's $4,641.\n\nall canadians are covered by the healthcare system, while 10% of americans lack public or private insurance coverage. total pharmaceutical spending per person per year averages a whopping $1,443 in the us, compared with $613 in canada.\n\nfor example, the cholesterol drug crestor is $86 per month in the us, and $32 in canada; the arthritis drug humira is $2,505 in the us, compared with $1,164 in canada. yet despite the much higher health spending per person, life expectancy in the us is 78.8 years, while in canada it is 81.7 years.\n\nthe article reaches the following conclusion: the united states spent approximately twice as much as other high-income countries on medical care, yet utilization rates in the united states were largely similar to those in other nations. prices of labor and goods, including pharmaceuticals, and administrative costs appeared to be the major drivers of the difference in overall cost between the united states and other high-income countries.\n\nhuge private costs in the us\n\nus private health insurance costs are out of sight. a typical us family of four covered by employer-based health insurance pays, in total, around $28,000 per year, taking into account the insurance premium paid for by the employer out of the worker's total compensation, the premium paid directly by the household, and all of the extra costs, including deductibles, co-payments, and out-of-network payments. the cost of healthcare is crippling working-class families, which may explain why it is at the top of the political agenda.\n\nwhat is the reason for these extraordinary costs in the us? astronomical administrative costs, for one, are the result of countless and conflicting payments systems facing almost any patient who visits the doctor's office or hospital. one study in 2014 suggested that america's extraordinarily complicated multi-payer system leads to administrative costs for billing and insurance that are five times the costs of a simplified payment system such as canada's.\n\nthe second is the soaring monopoly profits and sky-high salaries along the entire private supply chain, from drug manufacturers to hospitals. the drug companies use their extraordinary monopoly power, whether due to patents or fda approvals on out-of-patent drugs, to overcharge americans with markups that are sometimes hundreds of times the production cost of the medicines. and private providers are a highly concentrated industry in most metropolitan areas.\n\nwith the mergers and closures of hospitals during the past 20 years, driven by for-profit medicine, this market power has soared, and so too have monopoly profits and healthcare costs facing consumers.\n\ncheck out the ceo compensation of the big systems providers – $59 million for aetna, and $44 million for cigna in 2017 – or the salaries of the executives of the not-for-profit hospitals in your area, often running several million dollars per year.\n\nfor these reasons, healthcare costs in the us could be brought down by cutting three main areas: administrative costs, drug prices, and monopoly profits of private insurers, which in turn could be achieved by much lower reimbursement rates for medical services and more effective contracting. recent studies (here and here) have shown prospective savings on national health expenditures resulting from medicare for all would save trillions of dollars over 10 years.\n\nsmart cost control\n\nthe jayapal bill is smart on cost control. it would have medicare negotiate with pharmaceutical companies to drive drug prices down, with the threat of removing the monopoly rights of patents if the drug company doesn't reach a reasonable agreement on prices. (technically, the government would issue a compulsory license to competitors). it would have medicare set an annual budget with hospital providers. this annual budget would focus on healthcare provision rather than wasted time and expenses on billing. it would not permit astronomical management salaries and super-profits.\n\nby wringing massive administrative costs, monopoly profits, and sky-high salaries out of the healthcare system, costs would be slashed, with the savings passed on to households. remember, if the us paid the same share of income as our peer countries like canada, the total saving would be on the order of 6% of gdp (from 18% today to around 10-12% as in the peer countries). with a gdp of around $62,000 per person in the us, 6% of gdp saving comes to a cost saving of around $3,700 per person, or around $14,800 for a family of four.\n\nsuch savings wouldn't be achieved in full, or even in the early years. the pushback from industry against cost-cutting will be fierce. moreover, the sheer inertia of existing costs, prices, budgets, and administrative systems cannot be doubted. but what can be said with confidence is that a well-designed mfa system would put the us on a path toward the reasonably priced healthcare systems of other comparable countries.\n\nmoreover, mfa would allow us to rethink healthcare delivery to take into account perhaps the biggest feasible benefit in health outcomes. america's current disease burdens often reflect unhealthy life circumstances – great stress, obesity-inducing diets, lack of exercise, drug dependence, and others. these are social ills turning into medical ills.\n\na fairer, more balanced, health system based on good health rather than maximum profits would turn its attention to helping americans live healthier lives.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\ngetting mfa through the political process won't be easy. the drug industry is one of america's top lobbies and campaign contributors, befitting a massive economic sector rolling in profits. lobbying outlays in 2018 across the health sector are estimated at around $549 million and campaign funding in the 2018 election cycle at $255 million. the industry will be ready to fight an mfa plan with guns blazing, and trot out the usual arguments: stop socialized medicine, save personal choice, don't put yourself into the hands of government bureaucrats, don't let american become venezuela – you name it.\n\nyet sanders and jayapal and their many colleagues who have come on board now (including 106 co-sponsors) have the best chance to prevail in our modern history. americans know that the healthcare system is rigged, and they will support a new system that convincingly shows the way to fair and reasonable healthcare costs.

tell donald trump to go to hell, graham said on cnn's new day in december 2015, responding to trump's statement at the time calling for the us to ban all muslims from entering the country.\n\na month later, graham described trump as the most unprepared person to run for president and someone who scares the hell out of me. when asked to choose between trump and sen. ted cruz for the nomination, graham said that was like deciding between being shot or poisoned.\n\ntrump, for his part, labeled graham a nut job and a disgrace, and he constantly taunted the senator, who barely registered in the polls, for his poor performance on the campaign trail. graham dropped out of the gop race before the primaries began and lent his support to bush.\n\nsen. lindsey graham embarrassed himself with his failed run for president and now further embarrasses himself with endorsement of bush, trump tweeted in january 2016. a month later, he tweeted that graham was a dumb mouthpiece for the former florida governor.\n\nwhat a difference time can make.\n\nsince trump became president, he has golfed with graham three times, more than he has with any other senator. and graham has lauded not only trump's golf game but also his golf course, calling trump's property in west palm beach, florida, spectacular last month.\n\nat the same time, trump repeatedly endorsed the graham-cassidy health care effort last fall. the bill failed to go anywhere in the senate, but graham is still hopeful congress will address it this year.\n\nnow trump and graham are working closely together on an immigration reform proposal, an issue the senator has been passionate about for over a decade. i've never been more optimistic, graham told the president last week before cameras at a meeting on immigration.\n\nwhy the change in relations? graham has said he feels a sense of obligation to work with the president. to get a seat at the table, he's learned to play to the president's deal-making sensibilities.\n\nkeep talking to him. keep him close, graham said last fall when a washington post reporter asked how he negotiates with trump.\n\nkevin bishop, a senior aide to graham, argued that just because the senator may disagree with the president's style and rhetoric that doesn't translate into opposition of all things trump. bishop noted that both men support popular gop agenda items like getting rid of obamacare, supporting tax cuts, reducing regulations and placing conservatives on the supreme court.\n\nis (graham) going to vote against things he supports because trump also supports them? that's utterly ridiculous, bishop said.\n\na circle of rivals\n\nrepublican sens. rand paul, marco rubio and cruz also engaged in tense political combat with trump when they failed to best him for the 2016 republican nomination. paul at one point referred to trump as gollum, and rubio questioned trump's manhood while mocking the size of his hands.\n\ncruz called trump a pathological liar, utterly amoral, a serial philanderer and a narcissist at a level i don't think this country's ever seen.\n\nbut all have largely held their fire now that trump is in the white house. their moves to make amends with the president reflect a calculation among many senate republicans: while they may complain about what they view as his erratic behavior, they will look past previous disputes to get on his good side and influence him on key decisions.\n\npaul was at times a thorn in the president's side last year — most noticeably in september, when paul was poised to derail one of the many obamacare repeal efforts — but the two seem to have struck some harmony. they golfed twice last year, and trump signed an obamacare-related executive order in october that was inspired by an issue paul had been pushing for months.\n\nrubio has worked closely with the president's daughter ivanka trump on tax reform provisions. cruz has been a reliable vote for trump and has maintained a strict policy of not commenting on the president's controversial tweets. he also worked with the white house on a health care-related amendment last summer, though the amendment ultimately wasn't taken up.\n\nfor his part, corker has repaired his relationship with trump after the two men exchanged fierce words in the fall, according to sources familiar with their discussions.\n\nthe two have spoken several times since late last year, particularly as corker was weighing whether to support the sweeping tax overhaul. ultimately, corker reversed his position and backed the tax bill – and endured sharp criticism over what he said was erroneous reporting suggesting he backed the bill because of a provision that would enrich him financially. corker complained about the news coverage to trump, who deemed it fake news, the sources said.\n\nbff's with limits\n\nwhile graham has heaped unexpected praise on trump at times, he's still approaching the mercurial president with caution and realizes there are limits to the kill-him-with-kindness approach.\n\nthat was evident monday, when graham, known for his southern wit, poked fun at trump's recent tweet about being a very stable genius.\n\nif he doesn't call himself a genius, nobody else will, graham said to laughs on abc's the view.\n\nthe artful response allowed graham to defuse a sensitive question with humor and avoid being forced to weigh in on trump's state of mind.\n\nhe used a similar approach last week at that immigration meeting. trump introduced graham as someone who used to be a great enemy of mine. now he's a great friend of mine. i really like lindsey, can you believe it? i never thought i'd say that but i do like him a lot.\n\ntrump may have expected, or hoped, graham would return the goodwill and heap similar praise on him.\n\ni like me, too, graham responded, earning nervous laughter in the room.\n\nbut graham then turned to trump and heralded him as the one president in recent times whose tough stance on immigration makes him the perfect person to cut a deal on the stalled issue.\n\nobama couldn't do it. bush couldn't do it. i think you can do it, graham told trump and the assembled press.\n\ngraham's decision to get closer to trump is coming at a personal cost, too, as some republicans are not happy with him. that includes people close to sen. john mccain of arizona, graham's closest friend in the senate and one of the few remaining steadfast gop critics of trump.\n\ni've known lindsey graham for many years and sat in the first meeting between him and john mccain. couldn't be sadder today, tweeted john weaver, a former top aide to mccain, shortly after the immigration meeting. i don't believe lindsey is being political or currying favor, just is very wrong.\n\ncnn's dana bash and lauren fox contributed to this report.
edward m. pioroda/cnn\n\nbernie sanders responded to former joe biden's attacks on the political feasibility of his medicare for all plan, saying his policy objectives require involving millions of people in the political process.\n\ni admit, it is a different type of campaign, because i'm not here to tell you vote for me, i'm going to do all these great things. ain't gonna happen that way. never happens that way, sanders said.\n\nthat's why we call our campaign us, not me, he said. because i'm not going to tell you i can do it alone. i can't do it alone. we need to all stand up to take on the power of the health care industry.\n\nbiden has sharpened his attacks on sanders' health care proposal in recent days as he campaigns in new hampshire.\n\npeople need hope now, the former vice president said tuesday in nashua. so we want real progressive change in health care. real change, not just talk. and i'm the only one in this race who's ever gotten a big health care reform bill through the congress. it's called obamacare.\n\nwatch more:

(trump offered zero proof that mccain had leaked the dossier, put together by a former british intelligence agent, to the press.)\n\nso. let's take a step back here and think of what happened here in washington on tuesday. sitting next to the leader of a foreign country, the president of the united states went after a former republican senator (and former gop presidential nominee) who not only served in the vietnam war but spent years of his life being tortured in a north vietnamese prison camp. and this is a president who received several deferments during vietnam, including for bone spurs. in an interview with the new york times in 2016, trump called the condition temporary and minor.\n\nhere's what i know: these latest comments will cause zero erosion in trump's support among his hardcore backers. they will love the wringing of hands and woe-is-me reaction by who they believe to be elites. he's freaking them all out! they don't know what to do with him!\n\nhere's what i also know: there are certain things that are right and certain things that are wrong – whether you are a democrat, a republican or somewhere in between. and attacking a dead man who spent five years as a prisoner of war and another three decades serving the country in elected office, is simply wrong. that's true if barack obama, george w. bush, millard fillmore, franklin pierce or whoever the next president will be did it. (none of them would have said what trump did about a man with as decorated a past as mccain but the point still holds.\n\ntrump proudly embraces his smashing of political idols. desecrating the old ways of doing things – and doing so gleefully – he believes is at the root of his political people. it says, he thinks, that he won't let the rules that past crappy politicians have lived by govern him.\n\nbut what trump's comments about mccain should remind us of is this: whether there is political gain to be found in dishonoring a lifelong public servant, it is simply wrong. it is not who we are – or who we should be. that everyone – republicans, democrats, independents and all the rest – won't come together to say that as one is profoundly depressing and disappointing.
(cnn) —\n\nandy slavitt, the former unitedhealth group executive who spent two years as the acting head of the centers for medicare and medicaid services under president barack obama, has some experience with rough launches.\n\nin 2013, slavitt was part of the team that rescued healthcare.gov after the online marketplace's bungled rollout. over the next few years, he took a lead role in steering the affordable care act through a fraught implementation period.\n\nthen, amid the squall of republican efforts to gut the law in 2017, slavitt emerged, via his twitter account, as one of the grassroots liberal opposition's favorite wonks. but with the unveiling this week of his new nonprofit, called the united states of care, slavitt himself has come under fire by activists – some suspicious of his intentions, others confused or troubled by his tactics.\n\nthe bipartisan group's aim, it says on a sleek website littered with sometimes impenetrable banalities, is to consolidate public opinion around policies that would ensure that every single american has access to quality, affordable health care, no matter his or her station. what precisely that means, or how it should be achieved, is left open to interpretation. those blank spaces have roiled the progressive left, so often criticized for failing to offer specifics in its own advocacy, as it works to build support for a single-payer, or medicare for all, plan.\n\nthe prospect of reaching across the aisle, in pursuit of good-faith compromise, has also struck many as out of touch with the moment, especially as democrats fight with one arm against gop efforts to undercut obamacare – like they did in eliminating the individual mandate late last year – and the other to chart a path toward expanding coverage and care to millions of the uninsured.\n\non wednesday, i discussed with slavitt the organization's purpose and the brewing controversy over his intentions. (hours later, he tweeted plans to answer the criticism more formally in the coming days.)\n\nthe interview that follows has been edited and condensed.\n\nkrieg: on the united states of care site, you say – this is a quote – we must change the conversation and create a new narrative that puts health care over politics by redefining the goal in human, not political terms. … how would you describe the current narrative?\n\nslavitt: our narrative, unfortunately, is limited by what our politicians and our lawmakers are willing to do. and the public doesn't feel particularly well represented by that. they feel like the needs of their families, their concerns, aren't represented and that we don't have politics that represent the need for american families to be able to afford to take their kids to the doctor, to afford their prescriptions, so they're fearful.\n\nif we're going to build a new, positive vision, we need to start with a narrative that is grounded in the realities and desires and goals people have to have a better health care system – and do it in a way that is sustainable, and not worry that it's going to be tipped over every election cycle.\n\nkrieg: why not then put this energy and these resources behind some of the movements that are already out there? medicare for all obviously now has traction with senate democrats, as do other less comprehensive plans. there are a lot of people already out there trying to create a new narrative, in favor of expanding care. why not put your influence and, maybe, money behind them?\n\nslavitt: one of the questions (being asked by critics) is about me personally and, you know, i personally am not changing. i don't expect that my views or my activities personally around making sure that we're fighting to get better health care for more people changes. and i don't expect other people who are affiliated with the organization or part of sponsoring it to change their activities, whether they agree with me or disagree with me.\n\nbut we have to do something over the long term in addition to make sure that we're not having this war forever. the question is how do we do that? and there's no guarantees that it'll ever happen. but what is clear to me, and i think a number of other people, is if we don't take down the temperature of the debate, then, the next time we go at doing this, we're still going to be more and more divisive.\n\nso i think there is room for us in the debate to focus on both what needs to happen now and over the next couple years – which is, as you point out, there are a number of organizations that are well-suited for that and some of which i'm affiliated with and will continue to be affiliated with – but also for there to be a movement that's a little bit longer term that changes the equation. think about big changes that have happened in the country, (like) marriage equality. that didn't start the year before laws were changed. that started decades before laws were changed. there needs to be a movement and effort to establish successful change that occurs beyond just the current year.\n\ni think this is an organization that has an opportunity, if done right, to make a difference in the long-term debate even while people are working on these very challenging issues in the near term.\n\nkrieg: to be clear, though, you were speaking to modern healthcare about this, and you're quoted as saying, we believe every single american should have access to basic, affordable care. but we avoid using language like universal coverage that is polarizing. we want to bring people together, and certain words are used by one party or another to create divides. so, asking as directly possible: do you support or oppose single-payer health care?\n\nslavitt: do i personally?\n\nkrieg: yes.\n\nslavitt: i would personally love to be in a world where we have, once and for all, given every american health care, and that's certainly one way to do it. so, to that extent, the answer is yes.\n\nkrieg: ok, but how do you feel, not personally now, but as an activist or political actor?\n\nslavitt: what i believe is that there are a number of ideas, including new ideas, that are going to be necessary to get to where we want to get. i believe that it's going to take a number of years from where we are today, so for someone who believes in single-payer, medicare for all, i hope that you can also be for other things that are good for people in the meantime, and that those things might even build the ability to get there.\n\ni also believe that there are lots of approaches, because there's not even one ready bill; it's not like there's a bill that's ready that can do everything because the medicare program, of course, is designed for seniors. it's not designed for younger people, low-income people, etc. so there's a lot of un-sexy dirty work that has to happen, to make these policies work, to get public support for them. to vet them, to drive them.\n\nso if you look at the three principles of (usoc), they include anything that can get people access to the coverage they need, the care they need, protect them from bankruptcy and do it in a way that can be lasting from an economic and political standpoint. that absolutely includes single-payer and it includes other ideas that are either currently formed or that need to be formed.\n\nkrieg: one of the criticisms of the organization is that this, effectively, is an abandoning of politics. it's saying, we can't fight and win, we need to come to a truce. is this giving up on politics?\n\nslavitt: i'm glad you asked that question because that's the exact wrong interpretation.\n\nkrieg: why?\n\nslavitt: because we need to use the grassroots and the will of the people to change the politics and to use the politics and to translate what people really want and believe into political change. the reality is that right now we don't have the political make-up where people have the incentive to compromise. we have people in a world where their incentive is to get more polarized. so when we say health care over politics is a top priority, it (means) that we want to have an impact on constituents first in making care accessible to all americans.\n\nwhen we change the politics, or prevail over the politics, what it will mean to me, i think, to many of us on board, is when you show up every day as a lawmaker, who are you thinking about? are you thinking about your next campaign or are you thinking about your constituents back home and their needs. as soon as we can flip that equation around, i think we will win.\n\nkrieg: reading your interviews around the rollout, my impression is that you believe policy backed by one party, or a law that's passed along party lines, is intrinsically, if not bad, then doomed. is that right?\n\nslavitt: well, i'll tell you that what i've lived through for the last number of years is something that i hope the country doesn't have to go through much longer – where one party pulls on one side of the rope and the other party pulls on the other side of the rope.\n\ni think our aim ought to be to get policies that can pass with over 60% to 70% support if we can, because that reflects, at least by what public polling suggests, the will of the american public. i think we'd like to have our elected representatives vote in ways that support where the public is. now, it's not that simple and a lot of work needs to be done but laws are more stable when we don't feel like every election we worry that they're going to get overturned. so of course it would be better for everybody if we could answer this question once and for all.\n\nkrieg: going back to your experience these last few years. republicans have been very open about their position on all this. they do not like obamacare. but they also don't, as we've seen, really have a plan to replace it. what would you say to activists who argue, even with republicans on the board, that you're cloistering yourself, with other elite thinker types, and then setting up to negotiate with yourselves?\n\nslavitt: i don't think anyone is negotiating anything. the question is whether there are people from diverse views who all believe it's time to change the dialogue and that the politics is getting in the way.\n\nthere are a number people whose differences were not brought on board to be reconciled. they are perfectly irreconcilable because their goal is not to strive for agreement or even to support whatever policies are approved. their goal is to say, these are three principles that we should put over politics and, in so doing, we will allow for a dialogue that will get us all to better answers.\n\nthere is purposely nothing that all the people who put their names on the website are going to all agree to – their interests are more purposely diverse. this isn't a convening body which is aiming to forge a tepid consensus. these are people who know that it's going to be ok to publicly to disagree.\n\nand everything i'm saying to you now, i know there are people on the founder's council who will disagree with that – and they have said to me, andy, you know that i may publicly disagree with you. and those are the terms under which their support happens. they're not going to be people who are going to be involved in watering down the policies to a place where they don't accomplish their principles. the principles are fundamental.
(cnn) democratic candidates for president took part in their party's seventh debate on tuesday night in des moines and cnn commentators weighed in. the opinions expressed in these commentaries are those of the authors\n\njulian zelizer: elizabeth warren had the best moments\n\nsenator elizabeth warren had a very good debate. it seems that the challenges she has faced in the past few weeks, such as her slide in the polls and frustration with her shifting positions on medicare for all , strengthened her resolve and sharpened her focus. although she will certainly come under some fire for walking away even further from medicare for all, warren delivered a series of sharp answers about us policy overseas, trade, health care, child care and corruption.\n\nwhen asked about the comment that sanders allegedly made to her about a woman not being able to win the presidency, she didn't take the bait, avoiding an explosive fight and instead turning the conversation back to the big picture: how to win back the white house.\n\nwarren pivoted to make a vital argument about the centrality of the women's vote to victory in 2020, reminding the audience that the only people on stage who have won every single election they've been in are the women. it was reminiscent of 1984 when president ronald reagan was asked about his age during a televised debate with the younger walter mondale. without missing a beat, reagan, who some thought was too old to be president, promised that he wouldn't use mondale's youth and inexperience against him.\n\nfollow cnn opinion join us on twitter and facebook\n\nit's unclear what a strong debate performance can accomplish at this point. it might be that concerns about electability are so strong that they will give biden the victory, or that sanders' grassroots support is so strong that warren can't undercut his strength.\n\nbut given the fluidity that seems to exist in the electorate, it might be possible that this debate becomes a step in revitalizing the coalition that started to come together in the summer, allowing warren to position herself as the most unifying candidate in the democratic pack.\n\npatti solis doyle: klobuchar had the best night but may still fall short in iowa\n\npatti solis doyle\n\ntonight's debate did not shake up the race. the 60% of undecided caucus voters in iowa will likely leave this debate still undecided. biden had a steady performance with particularly strong answers on foreign policy and a demonstration of the ability to not only fight trump but also heal the country. but biden's performance was not a home run, as many of his answers were just lackluster. the same goes for pete buttigieg. while mayor pete was solid, he never achieved that memorable debate moment.\n\nwarren and sanders went at it on the can a woman win? he said/she said. senator warren had a great moment which will be played over and over, explaining it was only the women on stage who had never lost a race. in the end, however, both sanders and warren were vociferous in their certainty that indeed a woman can win the presidency.\n\nit was amy klobuchar who had the best night, with consistently strong answers on every topic and a convincing argument that she can beat trump in a general election, but her performance is likely not enough to get her from 6% to a win, place or show in iowa.\n\nbottom line, the dynamic of the caucus remains unchanged.\n\npatti solis doyle, a cnn commentator, was an assistant to the president and senior adviser to then-first lady hillary clinton, was chief of staff on clinton's 2000 and 2006 senate campaigns, and clinton's presidential campaign manager in 2007 and early 2008. she is president of solis strategies, a washington-based consulting firm that specializes in serving nonprofits, nongovernmental organizations and corporations. follow her @pattisolisdoyle\n\nian sams: how biden won the foreign policy debate\n\nian sams\n\nright out of the gate, the debate was primed for conflict. cnn's wolf blitzer prodded senator bernie sanders to confront vice president joe biden on his support for the iraq war.\n\nbut sanders didn't dive in fully.\n\nas one of just a handful of open contrasts amidst a relatively friendly primary, a successful sanders attack -- and biden flub — conceivably could have shifted the dynamic in the final weeks before iowa. but for some reason sanders demurred, instead focusing on his own dovish stances.\n\nblitzer tried to draw focus back to biden's support for the conflict in iraq, but the frontrunner wasn't trapped.\n\nbiden pointed to his long-ago apology for that 2002 vote which, if we're honest, seems like ancient history in the trump era. he was smart to pivot to what's still fresh to most democrats: the obama era. biden drew voters' attention to his leadership on the iraq troop drawdown and opposing an afghanistan surge.\n\nthe answer fed a sentiment felt by a full half of democrats according to a late november cnn poll: that they trust biden to best handle foreign policy. no doubt, that's an extension of his tenure as vice president. he wants voters to do a bit of trust transference -- remember the sane obama years? i'll take us back there.\n\nas tensions with iran flare and foreign policy positions are more important than they've been all primary, biden's answer worked. he won on foreign affairs, and avoided falling into a trap that could have threatened his still-strong frontrunner status.\n\nian sams is the former press secretary to senator kamala harris' presidential campaign.\n\nvan jones: a dispiriting night for democrats\n\nthere were beautiful moments in tuesday's first democratic debate of 2020. bernie sanders shined a light on america's moral failures. joe biden talked about restoring the soul of the nation. pete buttigieg told powerful stories about troops deploying for combat. and amy klobuchar put a human face on job losses from decades of failed, top-down economic policy.\n\nand of course, elizabeth warren knocked it out of the park. she combined clear explanation of her plans with a powerful defense of people who are suffering in trump's america. and in her exchange with bernie sanders, she drew massive applause by pointing out just how formidable female candidates have been in recent elections.\n\nall that said, tuesday night left me disappointed and dispirited. that has a lot to do with who was there, and who was not.\n\nfirst, this was the first debate since cory booker, julián castro and kamala harris ended their campaigns. the debate was poorer without their voices, and without andrew yang, who failed to qualify, in the mix.\n\nthere are now more billionaires than black people in the democratic primary. there are more plutocrats than people of color. the most diverse field ever has been winnowed down -- and not in the way any of us hoped.\n\nsecond, as both a democrat and a progressive, i was saddened to see the friction between bernie sanders and elizabeth warren. when those two are at each other's throats, it does not benefit biden or buttigieg. it helps big pharma, big banks, big oil -- and every other powerful interest that leaves too many americans feeling real pain every day.\n\namerica and policies of trickle-down economics have left a generation of voters with too much debt, too many jails and too few options. the sanders / warren agenda is music to the ears of this rising generation. anything that divides two candidates who represent the future of america is a distraction we cannot afford.\n\nvan jones is the host of the the van jones show and a cnn political commentator. he is the ceo of the reform alliance\n\ncarrie sheffield: democrats embrace weak policies\n\ncarrie sheffield\n\nduring tuesday's presidential primary debate, democrats continued their embrace of policies that would make our country poorer, less free, less safe and less fair.\n\nsanders attacked the united states--mexico--canada agreement (usmca) negotiated by president donald trump, yet omitted that usmca is expected to increase annual us agricultural and food exports by $2.2 billion, according to the us international trade commission . he also touted his free college for all proposal, ignoring as usa today reports , that people with higher debts often have higher earnings, especially people who went to graduate school such as lawyers or doctors. they're more able to pay off their loans -- and loan forgiveness would make them very wealthy very quickly.\n\npete buttigieg's disdain for president trump's leadership in stepping away from the flawed iranian nuclear deal naively dismissed that the deal lifted sanctions, enabling the bankrolling of terrorist operations for iranian-backed proxies in lebanon, yemen, iraq, syria and throughout the region.\n\neven as former vice president joe biden tried to denigrate president trump's foreign policy, he neglected to mention that president obama's national security adviser gen. james jones said the trump administration was absolutely correct to kill top iranian gen. qassem soleimani, and that history will say that this was the right thing to do.\n\nall of the democrats onstage, with the exception of sen. amy klobuchar, endorsed a ban on fracking, but none of the candidates acknowledged that the resulting shale boom from fracking has helped make the us less dependent on middle east oil, thus protecting our gas prices from the whims opec nations, especially iran. this gas price stability also helps the poor and middle classes, who spend a higher share of their budgets than the rich on transportation.\n\nthere may have been fewer candidates onstage during tonight's debate, but their policies provided no greater clarity about what would actually work to protect our freedoms, grow our economy and strengthen america's forgotten men and women.\n\ncarrie sheffield is a visiting fellow at independent women's forum, a

number of commentators expressed surprise and even a bit of disappointment that the candidates were relatively chummy . after all, this was their last debate before the iowa caucuses -- their final opportunity to attack each other and perhaps shake up the race. why didn't they? was that a mistake?\n\nthe expectation for hostility among the candidates is understandable, given the degree of vitriol coursing through our politics these days. but from my perspective, their civility was not only welcome but smart. with a smaller number on stage, we had a chance to see more of the character and temperament of each candidate. my sense was that the extra time and exposure made most of them seem more likable and attractive.\n\nthat is more important than it may seem: in voting for president, people tend to ask themselves whether they want to have candidate x or candidate y in their living rooms for the next four years. democrats who have become discouraged about the quality of their candidates should feel a little happier after last night.\n\nfor weeks, democrats have been asking, of course, who is the best candidate to beat trump? watching the crosstalk among the candidates last night, it also became clear that dems would be well advised to ask a related question: who is the best candidate to beat trump in televised debates?\n\ndebating skills are not always among the criteria that parties have applied in choosing a nominee. but given the aggressive, brutal style of the man who will be waiting in the ring, the dems ought to be thinking hard about them now.\n\nfor my money, their most attractive debaters -- those who would likely stand up well against trump -- are among those thought less likely to win the nomination: amy klobuchar and pete buttigieg. klobuchar is the most improved on stage, as she has relaxed and shown a little moxie. buttigieg is the most intellectually interesting and articulate. among the other candidates, elizabeth warren has the strongest grasp of public policy. after some off nights, she was in good form again last night and she graciously decided not to lash out against bernie sanders on gender.\n\nstay tuned!\n\ndavid gergen has been a white house adviser to four presidents and is a senior political analyst at cnn. a graduate of harvard law school, he is a professor of public service and the former director of the center for public leadership at the harvard kennedy school.\n\nrekha basu: sanders and warren won the night\n\nrekha basu\n\njudging by their compelling critiques of a system rigged in favor of the wealthy and corporate interests and the strength of their respective cases for how to bring transformative change for the better, bernie sanders and elizabeth warren both won tuesday's debate.\n\nthe other four democratic candidates sharing the drake university debate stage also put in admirable performances. tom steyer may have most exceeded expectations, because as a wealthy businessman with no political experience, he had the most to prove. he called income inequality unsupportable, championed health care as a right for every american and criticized a system where neighborhood property taxes determine which school has the most resources.\n\nit's unlikely that joe biden, who most needed to win over voters to re-cement his first place standing in iowa, accomplished that goal. it's not that he made any major gaffes but he lacked any major breakout moments. he seemed vulnerable when asked about his family's role in a ukrainian business deal involving his son -- which president donald trump allegedly tried to get ukraine's president to investigate in exchange for the release of funds to ukraine. biden also couldn't effectively defend his vote for the iraq war, other than to argue that president barack obama picked him as his running mate anyway.\n\npete buttigieg and amy klobuchar put in solid performances, but both were more effective at articulating the case against trump than in sealing the deal for themselves. buttigieg once again showed himself to be a dynamic speaker with a keen intellect and a compelling story. klobuchar is a shrewd, smart and likable politician. but both were arguing for incremental rather than structural changes, at a time when many democrats are fed up with the status quo. their cases seemed to be no match for what klobuchar dismissed as other candidates' grand ideological (schemes) that will never see the light of day.\n\nor maybe they will see the light of day.\n\nrekha basu has worked as a reporter, editorial writer and columnist at newspapers in new york, florida and iowa. her commentaries appear twice weekly on the opinion pages of the des moines register (usa today network) and are distributed weekly by tribune content agency.\n\nlaura belin: what candidates didn't show iowa voters\n\nlaura belin\n\nthe four democrats locked in the closest ever iowa caucus race appeared determined not to repeat the mistakes front-runners made here 16 years ago.\n\nback then, negative campaigning between howard dean and dick gephardt aided the rapid ascent of john kerry and john edwards in the final weeks before the 2004 caucuses. in contrast, a multilateral non-aggression pact was evident in des moines on tuesday night.\n\ncandidates mostly stuck to their own positive messages. for bernie sanders: think big, not small, and take on the 1 percent's greed. for elizabeth warren: root out corruption and build a movement for real change. for pete buttigieg: it's time to turn the page. for joe biden: i can lead this country at home and abroad.\n\nwarren was particularly skillful at pivoting to the points she wanted to drive home. biden avoided the gaffes and non-sequiturs that have marred past debates.\n\nsanders and warren seemed eager to defuse tensions over a year-old conversation that came to light recently. the occasional mild rebuke, such as buttigieg suggesting we shouldn't measure the boldness of a health care plan by how many americans it will alienate, sparked no drama or instant memes.\n\ni doubt any iowan leaning toward one of the top four candidates heard anything to make them question that choice.\n\nfor that reason, it was a tough debate for the two contenders trailing the pack. they stated their cases effectively too: for amy klobuchar, i can win big and govern without extremes, and for tom steyer, i can beat donald trump on the economy. but they don't control their destiny. they can't break out unless iowa democrats see a need to abandon the candidates vying for the lead.\n\nlaura belin is the primary author at the website bleeding heartland. she has been covering iowa politics since 2007, writing as desmoinesdem. you can follow her @laurarbelin\n\nscott jennings: democrats go into pitiful crouch\n\nscott jennings\n\ni just don't get the strategy here.\n\nthe biggest bombshell of the week was elizabeth warren claiming bernie sanders told her that a woman can't be elected president, a stunning attack for one of the three leading candidates to make on another. sanders gamely denied it, and then just stood there as the moderator appeared to ignore his denial. then he failed to challenge warren straight up by demanding she admit she was lying!\n\nthis is perhaps the most direct character attack of the primary (well beyond the tame wine-cave drama) and sanders just basically stood there and took it, which must have been demoralizing for his supporters. warren has made up other things in the campaign and yet sanders just didn't challenge her veracity on this one at all. stunning.\n\nand then there's the overall lack of any meaningful challenge to joe biden, the national front runner. sanders challenged him a little bit on foreign policy to open the debate but that too was fairly tame. the rest of the night people just left him alone, which is nuts when you consider that for any of the rest of these candidates to win they have to defeat biden!\n\nso, my takeaway is -- why do the democrats just stand there and let things happen to themselves. biden is ahead nationally, and nobody did anything to stop him. warren is effectively calling sanders a backwoods misogynist and he slinked off into a corner.\n\nhow do these folks hope to get the nomination or win the white

castle depicts two parallel universes: one in which the germans and japanese won world war ii, and one where the allies did. the main characters bounce between these two polar opposite realities. the effect can be dizzying, and yet also clarifying.\n\ntonight's democratic debate showed leadership as opposite from donald trump as those two fictionalized worlds. where trump is corrupt, the democrats spoke of reform. where trump is self-centered, democrats dared to care for kids and the poor and the working class. where trump is a bully, democrats were empathetic. where trump is a serial liar, the democrats stuck to the facts.\n\ni think democrats, especially in iowa, will love it. iowans, god love 'em, hate negative campaigning. that's why negative ads in the 2020 democratic caucus campaign are about as common as synchronized swimmers in a sioux county cornfield. perhaps that's why, in the all-important first half-hour of the cnn/des moines register debate the candidates beat their swords into ploughshares.\n\nthe days before the debate featured supporters of bernie sanders attacking elizabeth warren, with warren countering that sanders made a sexist statement in a private meeting over a year ago. but when the red light came on in des moines, they were both on their best behavior.\n\nit helped that moderator wolf blitzer opened the debate on the biggest question of all: why are you best prepared — the best prepared person on this stage to be commander in chief? joe biden owned his disastrous 2002 vote for the bush war in iraq. bernie sanders chided him for it, but didn't draw blood, allowing biden to deftly shift attention to his partnership with president barack obama. pete buttigieg noted that some of the enlisted troops he served with in afghanistan are so young they cannot remember when the war began.\n\nelizabeth warren gave half of a great answer, excoriating generals who say we've turned the corner so many times that we're going in circles. but she also weirdly shoehorned in an attack on giant financial institutions. amy klobuchar was the only one who truly took the fight to trump, demonstrating impressive expertise on military affairs, and heart-rending empathy on trade.\n\ntom steyer came to life when he spoke about climate change. the question was about trade, but unlike warren, who seemed to be reaching to include wall street in her national security answer, steyer seamlessly and personally made an appeal to put climate at the heart of any future trade deal.\n\nyes, there were not a lot of punches thrown. but the dustbin of the 2020 campaign is filled with politicians who used their debate moments to attack. from kirsten gillibrand attacking joe biden for an op-ed he published decades ago to kamala harris hammering biden on busing, to julian castro cheaply (and dishonestly) accusing biden of not remembering what he'd said two minutes before. all three dropped out before the first vote has even been cast.\n\nperhaps elizabeth warren pulled back from her attack on sanders because when she attacked buttigieg in the last debate she gained nothing; in fact she stalled. in fact, joe biden had perhaps his best moment when, after noting that donald trump is viciously attacking my surviving son, he said it was his job to not only fight but also heal. beautiful.\n\nthe race is extremely fluid. all four of the top candidates: biden, warren, sanders and buttigieg, have at one point led in the iowa polls. i did not see anyone break out in the debate. the candidates will have to win the old-fashioned way: door to door, farm to farm, town hall to town hall. that is a far better strategy than seeking a knockout in a debate.\n\npaul begala, a democratic strategist and cnn political commentator, was a political

than three weeks before the iowa caucuses, elizabeth warren is currently sitting in 4th place if you average the last three polls out of iowa. in a state where the old political adage is that there are only three tickets out of iowa , fourth place is not where any candidate wants to be.\n\ntonight's debate was one of the last opportunities warren had to make her case to iowa voters. so the question isn't whether she had a good night. she unquestionably did. the question is whether she had the type of great performance that moves iowans to change their votes from joe biden or bernie sanders or pete buttigieg.\n\nin the last few days, the warren campaign found itself in a back and forth with the bernie team over his volunteer phone call talking points and what he allegedly said at a meeting over a year ago. it guaranteed her a question at the debate on whether a woman could be elected president. as expected, she was well prepared and gave a smart answer that promoted her candidacy without attacking sanders.\n\nbut did anyone change their vote from sanders to warren as a result? unlikely. and if not, it was a missed opportunity for her to make the case that bernie sanders is the wrong candidate from the progressive wing to expand the democratic party's double-digit lead with female voters. and there may not be many more opportunities coming her way before february 3rd.\n\nsarah isgur is a cnn political analyst. she has worked on three republican presidential campaigns and is an adjunct professor at george washington university's school of media and

the dynamics of the race are coming into clearer focus. and one thing was clear from debate in des moines: diversity matters. with cory booker, julian castro and kamala harris out of the race -- and andrew yang off the debate stage -- there was little to no substantive discussion on issues like immigration, voting rights, the trump administration's neglect of puerto rico and criminal justice reform. instead, we had perfunctory mentions of black and brown people throughout the evening.\n\nthis is a problem when 40% of democratic voters are people of color. these constituencies will be vital to whomever becomes the nominee, and the candidates should not have depended on the moderators to bring such topics up; they should have been proactive in doing so themselves.\n\none revealing moment came when pete buttigieg was questioned about his lack of support among african american voters. the black voters who know me best are supporting me, he said. he went on to mention that he is supported by black elected leaders in iowa. his answer came off as a nice way of saying, in effect, that he has black friends. it was inadequate and somewhat tone-deaf.\n\nbuttigieg also name-checked justice in policing, which might not have been the smartest move given that he has faced controversy for his handling of a police shooting that inflamed racial tensions in his hometown of south bend, indiana. by now, buttigieg should have developed a more nuanced answer to explain his lack of minority support.\n\nthat said, overall, virtually all of the candidates (including buttigieg) acquitted themselves well during the debate. if no one had a breakout moment, no one had an embarrassing moment either.\n\nhowever, tom steyer stood out on the stage for the wrong reasons. addressing the camera directly was a mistake, as it made it seem as if he were ignoring the moderators, audience, and fellow candidates. though he repeatedly touted his business experience, he did not make a strong case for himself as a presidential candidate. a billionaire talking about income inequality is a hard sell, and steyer certainly did not close the deal.\n\nraul a. reyes is an attorney and a member of the

the benefits to the united states-mexico-canada agreement (usmca) trade deal. bernie sanders was not wise to criticize the deal; other candidates acknowledged the usmca has brought about about improvements.\n\nformer president vice president did his best to rise above the field and take it directly to president trump. biden made his closing call to caucus, claiming america's character is on the ballot.\n\nsen. elizabeth warren danced around a question about reporting that bernie sanders allegedly told her last year that a woman could not be elected president. if nothing else, her response did get sanders off message for a while.\n\nbut despite the focus on iowa, for the first time in the 2020 primary, foreign policy took center stage. each candidate criticized president donald trump for not having authorization to attack iran and outlined their general plans for withdrawing troops from iran. former south bend mayor pete buttigieg touted his military experience, compared to president trumps draft deferments, to make the case he is prepared to take on the president on the issue.\n\nmark my words: iowa voters were taking close notes of the candidates on the debate stage.

afghanistan\n\npeter bergen\n\nforeign policy had been, so far, almost absent from the democratic debates, but the targeted killing of iranian military leader qasem soleimani, ordered by president donald, put foreign policy firmly in play on the des moines debate stage tuesday.\n\nand there was a fair amount of consensus among the candidates that now is the time to end america's longest war in afghanistan.\n\nsen. bernie sanders said that americans are sick of endless wars.\n\nsen. elizabeth warren observed that she sits on the senate armed services committee and that american generals had repeatedly come before the committee to assert that the united states had turned a corner in afghanistan. warren wryly observed that in afghanistan, we have turned a corner so often we are turning in circles.\n\nformer vice president joe biden was the only candidate on the debate stage who has been in a position of power to weigh in on the afghan war issue—he was an important voice in president barack obama's war cabinet early in obama's first term in 2009. at that time, obama was considering whether to surge tens of thousands more us troops into afghanistan.\n\na decade ago, biden advocated not for a surge of conventional military troops but rather for a relatively limited american presence in afghanistan focused on counter-terrorism missions led by us special forces. biden lost that debate, and in the end, obama opted for a surge of conventional forces.\n\non tuesday night, biden offered a more nuanced take than the other candidates on the stage, arguing that we can't just walk way completely from afghanistan and that there is a big difference between having combat troops in a country such as afghanistan and maintaining a residual force of us special forces to advise and assist local forces.\n\nwhen it came to the afghan war, biden offered a more nuanced position-- indeed, a more presidential position-- than the other democratic candidates. he made the case that just pulling the plug on afghanistan would not be smart and that there is a big difference between an endless war and maintaining a persistent presence in a country like afghanistan to prevent the country being taken over by the taliban, which would benefit jihadist groups like al qaeda and isis.\n\nwith this argument, biden established himself as more credible as a potential commander in chief than his rivals on tuesday's debate stage.\n\npeter bergen is cnn's national security analyst, a vice president at new america and a professor of practice at arizona state university. his new book is

sanders in a much-awaited exchange over comments he allegedly made to her once doubting whether a woman could be elected president. but this might not move the needle much: sanders is not actually the frontrunner, warren is going to need his supporters down the road, and negative campaigning could always backfire.\n\nbut that issue doesn't matter -- nor do the candidates' views on anything else, if americans aren't allowed to vote. our beautiful democracy only works when all eligible voters can fully participate. but even in 2020 the country continues to be plagued by sustained attacks on americans' right to exercise one of the most fundamental rights of citizenship. even still, in tuesday's debate, there wasn't a single question asked about the candidates' views on how to combat voter suppression.\n\nsome quick history -- in 2013, the supreme court in shelby county v. holder made it infinitely easier for states and localities to revert to the discriminatory policies that have haunted the united states for all of its history. for instance, in just 2016 ,14 states put in place new, restrictive voting laws for the first time. and according to the leadership conference on civil and human rights, 1,688 polling places have been closed in formerly covered states since the shelby county decision. the candidates need to be talking about this.\n\nwe all remember reading in high school history about the literacy tests and poll taxes that prevented blacks from voting in the jim crow south. the tactics have only gotten more sophisticated. this has not been an accident. voter suppression works, and it is most successful at hampering the votes of vulnerable groups in society, namely people of color, the elderly, students, and the disabled.\n\nto be clear, this issue is not about what's best for democrats or republicans. it is about which mortal sins we will continue to allow to fester in our country. the very integrity of the election depends on it. it's time to hear what the candidates plan on doing.\n\nelliot williams ( @elliotcwilliams ) is a cnn legal analyst. a principal at the raben group, a national public affairs and strategic communications firm, he

wins, biden doesn't lose\n\nfrida ghitis\n\ntwo important things happened in this debate, and both work in favor of sen. amy klobuchar. the first was a much-needed discussion about women in the 2020 election; the second was a winning performance for moderates over progressives, accentuated by the rift between progressive sens. bernie sanders and elizabeth warren.\n\nit was that scuffle between warren and sanders, who had entered the election with something of a non-aggression pact, that opened the door to a salutary airing of the subject of electability, a sexist prejudice disguised as strategy.\n\nwhen confronted with the claim that sanders told warren that a women could not win, sanders denied it, arguing that he has always believed in women. but warren rejected sanders' denial, and grasped the electability matter with both hands, demanding to talk about the elephant in the democratic primary living room, the claim that a woman can't win in 2020.\n\nit's time to attack it head-on, she said, brandishing a memorable and devastatingly effective fact. look at the men on this stage: collectively, they have lost 10 elections. the only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are women.\n\nthat helps warren against the men, but it does nothing to help her against klobuchar, who underscored the impressive fact that, i have won every race, every place, every time. i have won in the reddest of districts, in urban, suburban and rural areas.\n\nthat argument also undercuts former vice president joe biden, who is marketing himself as the most capable among the candidates to win with republicans and independents disenchanted with trump.\n\nbiden was an evanescent presence on the stage. he has come a long way from his early performances. he was solid, showed confidence and made some good points. most of all, he made no big mistakes. but no one would accuse him of giving a rousing performance. as the candidate leading in the national polls, biden didn't need to win. he only needed to hold his own, to keep from losing ground, and he did that.\n\nthe moderates: biden, klobuchar and pete buttiegieg -- always polished and impressive -- came across as much more reasonable, knowledgeable and able to make things happen in washington and on the global stage. their responses on foreign policy -- iran, troop deployments, north korea -- and trade sounded like the kind that win elections.\n\nmoderates beat progressives. women made gains. in that venn diagram, only one of the candidates stands at the intersection of both categories. that is amy klobuchar.\n\nfrida ghitis, a former cnn producer and correspondent, is a world affairs columnist. she is a frequent opinion contributor to cnn, a contributing columnist to the

define winning as making a more clear, confident, sustained case than we've seen before.\n\ni have won every race, every place every time, she said , emphasizing that she has won conservative and pro-republican districts in the midwest. it was a direct pitch to democrats who tell pollsters their main desire is to pick a nominee who can defeat president trump.\n\nnowhere was her performance more clear and cutting than in the extended colloquy about health care. after senator bernie sanders described his medicare-for-all plan, klobuchar said she was offering something better: a plan, and not a pipe dream. she also told senator elizabeth warren that warren had supported a bill that would have kicked 149 million americans off their existing insurance plans.\n\nof pete buttigieg's plans on medicare and negotiating drug prices, she said, i actually have led that bill for years. i have 34 cosponsors. that would allow medicare to finally negotiate and lift the ban that big pharma got into law that says they can't negotiate for better prices [for drugs] for our seniors.\n\nshe also pointedly warned against supporting progressives like bernie sanders and elizabeth warren, telling voters to avoid candidates promising grand ideological sketches that will never see the light of day.\n\ndemocrats looking for a practical, moderate challenger to president trump will likely give the minnesota senator a second look in the final days before the iowa caucuses. for a candidate trying to break into the top tier, that's a win.\n\nerrol louis is the host of inside city hall, a nightly political show on ny1, a new york all-news channel.\n\naaron david miller: all the candidates failed on america's global role\n\nafter six democratic debates in which foreign policy and national security received short shrift, i was really looking forward to a robust discussion during the seventh, especially given the real time crisis with iran. i should have known better. there was too little discussion of the current crisis with iran and too little about each candidate's conception of america's role in world. here are my depressing and sobering takeaways.\n\nbiden's missed opportunity. he came close to articulating a strategy on north korea. but the former vice president missed a huge opportunity to demonstrate his experience, authority and clarity on foreign policy or why he was best credentialed to serve as commander-in-chief. it was the height of irony that the first candidate to even refer to the notion of an overall strategy was tom steyer -- the guy with the least foreign policy experience.\n\nno coherent vision. given the extent of donald trump's diplomatic malpractice, a huge opportunity opened up for any of the candidates to lay out a coherent vision and role for america in the world -- simply and clearly. and each candidate was offered at least two chances to do it. none did. what they did offer up -- using more diplomacy; working with allies; getting out of endless wars -- represented slogans and bumper stickers and offered not a single idea of substance on how they would approach these issues or the other serious challenges america confronts.\n\nwithdrawal of us forces fearful of alienating the party's progressive base, when asked about withdrawal of us forces, all six candidates expressed in varying degrees the need to withdraw us combat forces either totally (elizabeth warren, bernie sanders, or partially (joe biden and amy klobuchar). no distinction was made between defensive and offensive deployments or training missions. and, sadly, no candidate even bothered to identify us interests in the middle east -- the first step toward crafting policies to protect and advance them.\n\naaron david miller is a senior fellow at the carnegie endowment for international peace and author of the end of greatness: why america can't have (and doesn't want) another great president. miller was a state department middle east analyst negotiator in democratic and republican administrations.\n\naisha c. moodie mills: what was missing from the conversation\n\none thing's for sure, every candidate on the debate stage tonight would make a far better president than donald trump, who is more concerned with promoting his own interests above the country's. but it's still unclear which of them is poised to be the democratic nominee. after seven debates, the primary race is predictably split along ideological lines with progressives pushing for deep structural change and moderates preaching pragmatism.\n\nno winner emerged largely because the conversations were redundant, a parroting of the same talking points -- we must stomp out corporate corruption, we should build upon obamacare, not scrap it -- and the same issues -- health care, political experience, corporate responsibility, etc. that dominate each debate.\n\nmissing from the conversation are a range of issues that would more fully showcase each candidate's point of view and speak to the hearts and interests of the democratic base. i put out a quick twitter poll and found that voters want to hear more about: voting rights; election protection; criminal justice reform; immigration and family separation; the future of work; curbing the rise of white nationalist terrorism; women's rights and reproductive health; gun control; federal courts; education equity; eliminating the electoral college; poverty and income inequality; veterans issues; affordable housing; addressing police brutality; disability rights; lgbtq rights -- and the list goes on.\n\nmore of the same will not motivate or mobilize democratic voters and that's true for the topics at these debates as well.
washington (cnn) the four liberal justices of the supreme court are steeling themselves for a momentous spring as the reality settles in that the left flank of the bench could remain at least one critical vote shy of a majority in ideologically driven cases for decades.\n\nfacing an emboldened conservative majority and a docket marked by some of the most consequential cases in recent years, the liberals, led by the ailing 86-year-old ruth bader ginsburg , will work to stall the conservative legal revolution launched with the election of president donald trump who is fulfilling his pledge to transform the courts.\n\nit won't be easy.\n\non top of that, if trump succeeds in november, there is a strong possibility that he would have another seat to fill particularly given ginsburg's age and that of justice stephen breyer, who is 81. trump would likely choose a young nominee along the lines of his first two supreme court picks neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh.\n\nlast month, the court dropped a bombshell: the justices agreed to review trump's bid to shield his financial documents from disclosure. that's on top of a docket this term of explosive issues concerning immigration, abortion, lgbtq rights and the 2nd amendment. in addition, the justices may be faced with the option to -- yet again -- consider the fate of the obama-era affordable care act.\n\nafter swing vote justice anthony kennedy retired in 2018, ginsburg pointedly remarked that his departure would have far reaching consequences impacting not only current disputes, but those many terms ahead. as she battles her fourth bout of cancer, she remains on the bench often piping up early during oral arguments, subtly jousting with her conservative colleagues.\n\nwhen the court is not in session she attends speaking events . last month she told an audience in washington that serving on the high court is the best job i've ever had and reiterated that she will stay on as long as i will be able to do it full steam. asked about the current state of affairs in the us and abroad, ginsburg said the country would emerge from anxious bumpy periods.\n\nwe have in the past and we will again, she said.\n\nand after a term of transition last year, the four conservatives to the right of chief justice john roberts have hinted more than once that they are ready to make their mark.\n\nfor instance, last spring, conservative justice clarence thomas warned in an opinion related to an alabama abortion access law, that the time was coming for the supreme court to revisit its abortion jurisprudence which he said had spiraled out of control.\n\nwe cannot continue blinking the reality is what the court has wrought, thomas wrote.\n\nthe liberal justices know better than anyone else to what extent most if not all the court's conservative justices are bent on refashioning constitutional law, said michael gerhardt of the university of north carolina school of law in chapel hill. trying to narrow the scope of decisions, as they have done in recent years, may remain their best strategy for minimizing what they would regard as the damage to existing constitutional law.\n\nliberal justice elena kagan, an appointee of president barack obama, did not mince her words recently when asked about the downside of a job she loves.\n\nthe worst part of the job is when you lose some of the cases that you think are really important, where you think the court has just made a difference but made not a good difference, she told an audience at george mason university in november.\n\nkagan added that at times during her near 10-year tenure, she's emerged from a closed-door meeting with her fellow justices with an urge to ram my fist through a wall after they took an initial vote on a pending case.\n\nkagan, a persuasive and pragmatic justice, admitted that every once in a while a justice changes his or her vote -- not unfrequently -- and joked that it was a pretty good day if she were the one who swayed a colleague.\n\nspeaking in general terms, and not the specific docket, kagan noted that in some of the high-profile cases the justices don't often need a fresh look at an issue they've long considered. they know pretty well how they feel about a particular subject in part because they've seen similar cases on the same subject many times before, so they've developed a way of thinking about an area of the law, kagan said.\n\nin other words, they know which way they are headed.\n\nso far, some of the initial votes have been cast in high profile cases, other cases are yet to be argued. drafts will fly between chambers from now until the end of june. by then -- as the presidential election gears up -- the public will have a greater sense of how fast and how far the court will move.\n\njust watched ruth bader ginsburg weighs in on impeachment bias replay more videos ... must watch ruth bader ginsburg weighs in on impeachment bias 00:53\n\nguns, abortion, immigration and

city law limiting where a licensed gun owner could take a locked an unloaded gun.\n\nsupporters of broader gun rights want the newly solidified majority to broaden those rights. but looming over the case is the fact that after the prospect of a precedent-setting ruling became evident, new york changed the law.\n\nat oral arguments, the liberals suggested the court should dismiss the case and leave the fight for another day.\n\nyou are asking us to take a case where the other side has thrown in the towel, justice sonia sotomayor said.\n\ntwo critical votes -- roberts and kavanaugh -- did not show their hands at oral arguments. kavanaugh didn't even ask one question. justices gorsuch and fellow conservative samuel alito seemed ready to decide the case. thomas, who rarely speaks up at oral arguments, has expressed frustration in previous opinions that the court was dodging 2nd amendment cases.\n\nroberts and kavanaugh were also difficult to read in november when the court heard a case concerning the trump administration's efforts to terminate daca (deferred action for childhood arrivals) -- the obama era program that shields hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who arrived in the us as children from deportation.\n\nthe four liberals made clear that they believed the administration had not followed the proper procedures as required by law when it attempted to wind down the program.\n\nbreyer noted at one point the vast number of people --some 700,000 -- who have enrolled in the program questioning whether the department of homeland security had properly considered the impact of its actions on those who have come to rely upon daca.\n\nin october, all eyes were on gorsuch in a case that could impact millions of lgbtq americans. at issue was whether federal employment law that bars discrimination based on sex includes claims of sexual orientation and gender identity.\n\ngorsuch often focuses on the plain text of a law when analyzing it. at oral arguments, he gave hope to supporters of lgbtq rights when he suggested that it was a close call if the text of title vii of the civil rights law of 1964 that bars discrimination because of sex also encompassed sexual orientation and gender identification.\n\nit's close, ok? he said. but in the next breath he worried about the massive social upheaval that would be entailed in such a decision and whether it would be more appropriate a legislative rather than a judicial function.\n\nit's a question of judicial modesty, gorsuch added.\n\nin march, the supreme court will take up the first abortion-related case since kavanaugh and gorsuch took the bench. the case does not directly challenge the landmark 1973 opinion roe v. wade, but some believe it could give the conservative majority a chance to chip away at abortion rights.\n\nat issue is a louisiana law that requires a doctor to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where the abortion is performed. critics say there is no medical justification for the law.\n\nthe case is noteworthy because the law is nearly identical to a texas law that the supreme court struck down in 2016. back then, kennedy joined with the liberal justices to rule against the law. roberts, thomas and alito were in dissent. last term, roberts joined the liberals in putting the louisiana law temporarily on hold in a 5-4 emergency order.\n\nbut supporters of abortion rights fear that roberts may have only joined the left side of the bench to give the justices time to take up the case, hear arguments and distinguish the louisiana law from that of texas.\n\nif so, this is the type of case where the four liberal justices may have to settle for a strong dissent.\n\njust watched gorsuch: nine people

trump's bid to shield his financial documents from disclosure.\n\none case concerns a new york prosecutor's grand jury subpoena to trump's longtime accounting firm, mazars usa for his financial documents. trump's personal lawyers argue he has broad immunity from such investigations.\n\na separate case involves house subpoenas for similar documents from mazars as well as two of trump's banks.\n\nthe cases brought by the president's personal lawyers, tee up the potential for a momentous ruling concerning congress' ability to investigate the president, calling into question supreme court precedent and coming at a time when trump is embroiled in impeachment proceedings and has spent years attempting to keep some of his financial documents private.\n\nlower courts have ruled against the president so far, and the court will have to wrestle with trump's broad claims of immunity and separation of powers claims. if the court sides with the president, it will embolden republicans as he gears up for the presidential election and represent a striking blow to his critics who are trying on several fronts to obtain the documents.\n\nobamacare\n\none issue before the justices immediately concerns the future of the affordable care act, the signature legislative achievement of the obama administration that has long been in trump's crosshairs.\n\nlast month, a federal appeals court held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional. but critically, the court punted on whether the rest of the massive law -- even provisions unrelated to the mandate -- could remain on the books. over 98 pages, the 2-1 appeals court asked a district court to review that issue -- infuriating supporters of the law. they contend the two republican appointees in the majority were attempting to delay a decision that could gut the law until after the election.\n\ncalifornia and other democratic-led states as well as the democratic-led house of representatives asked the supreme court on friday to step in now to review the decision. calling the law a fixture of the american health-care system donald verrilli, a lawyer for the house, urged the justices in legal briefs to review a remarkable lower court decision that threatens profound destabilization of the health care system.\n\nthe present case represents yet another effort by litigants who disagree with the policy judgments embodied in the aca to use the courts, rather than the democratic process, to undo the work of the people's elected representatives, the filing states.\n\nbut challengers of the law might calculate that it only takes four justices to agree to hear a case, and the liberals might contemplate the massive sweep of the law and decide it shouldn't languish in the lower courts -- bringing uncertainty to millions of americans.\n\nroberts, who voted in 2012 to save the law, might question whether the entire law needed to be invalidated, the liberal thinking goes.\n\njust watched

justices might view the newest aca case as an important opportunity to resolve lingering doubts to the aca, in its current form, as unconstitutional, and re-fortify the congress' role in shaping domestic policy on health care, gerhardt said.\n\nduring her recent talk, george mason professor steven pearlstein asked kagan if she despaired about the court because her side will be losing more in the coming years before having the chance to win more.\n\ni think the court is a great institution, kagan said. even when i lose, i know that everybody on the court is operating in good faith and trying to do the best they can in handling really hard legal questions.\n\nand for those thinking the court will feature a future of closely divided decisions she had a message: nobody knows what the next case brings, let alone what the next year brings, let alone what the next decade brings.

i mean how did -- did he always -- was he always good with computer?\n\n\n\nsmith: well, when he was a kid, computers weren't out yet. and --\n\n\n\n(laughter)\n\n\n\nand then they were out and he -- i got a computer and he started playing with them and he started showing me how you could build a flame thrower and -- by just watching a computer and then told you how to do it. so that's how it started.\n\n\n\ncooper: he lived in the netherlands. were you able to communicate a lot? i mean he'd served in a lot of very dangerous places. did you always know where he was?\n\n\n\nsmith: i always knew where he was when he told me. for example, this time he was in the hague and that is where he was stationed. he was supposed to be there for about two years. and then he would transfer some place else. i did not know he was going to be in libya.\n\n\n\ncooper: did he ever talk about the dangers that came along with his job? i mean he -- he serve d in iraq as well.\n\n\n\nsmith: yes, in fact, he sent me -- i still have it on my computer where he sent me this thing. he was in working in the palace over there.\n\n\n\ncooper: in baghdad.\n\n\n\nsmith: and they -- yes, in baghdad, and he says, got to go, and suddenly he just disappeared and i said, well, what's happening over there. and he said listen. and i was listening, and suddenly i heard boom. where they were shooting at him.\n\n\n\ncooper: you must have worried a lot.\n\n\n\nsmith: when that was over. i can't spend my life worrying about it. i accepted what he wanted to do.\n\n\n\ncooper: i want to play for our viewers some of what president obama said about your son when he returned home. let's watch.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nbarack obama, president of the united states: sean smith, it seems, lived to serve. first in the air force, then with you at the state department. he knew the perils of this calling, from his time in baghdad. there in benghazi, far from home, he surely thought of heather and samantha and nathan, and he laid down his life in service to us all.\n\n\n\ntoday, sean is home.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: he's mentioning his wife and his children. when you heard the president say that, what did you think?\n\n\n\nsmith: this is the first time i heard the president say that.\n\n\n\ncooper: it is really?\n\n\n\nsmith: yes, he never told -- didn't tell me that. sean knew he was in a bunch of scary places. i knew he was in security places. i didn't expect him to get blown up. i didn't expect him to die. cooper: do you feel that you know what happened or are you still searching for answers? have you been in contact with the state department? have they reached out to you and given you details of what happened?\n\n\n\nsmith: that's a funny subject. i begged them to tell me what was -- what happened. i said i want to know all the details, all of the details no matter what it is, and i'll make up my own mind on it. and everyone of them, all the big shots over there told me that -- they promised me, they promised me that they would tell me what happened. as soon as they figure it out.\n\n\n\nno one, not one person has ever, ever gotten back to me other than media people and the gaming people.\n\n\n\n(end videotape)\n\n\n\ncooper: her son was a big video gamer.\n\n\n\nwe are going to have more of my conversation with pat smith after a quick break. she has some very tough words for this administration who she says has forgotten the promises they made to her the day sean's body was returned.\n\n\n\nalso tonight, the latest on today's congressional hearings into the attacks. jill dougherty and fran townsend join us next.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\ncooper: we're talking tonight with pat smith whose son sean smith was killed in the libya terror attack. former navy seal glen doherty was also killed. today his mother barbara asked mitt romney to stop invoking her son's name on the campaign stump, quote, i don't trust romney, she says. he shouldn't make my son's death part of his political agenda.\n\n\n\npat smith did not speak about anyone's political agenda tonight. she is, however, bitterly, bitterly disappointed with the state department, the defense department and the white house tonight. you're going to hear shortly about how the state department is going to respond to her charges.\n\n\n\nbut first, though, more of my conversation with pat smith starting with her as yet unfulfilled search for answers.\n\n\n\n(begin videotape)\n\n\n\ncooper: who told you that they would give you information?\n\n\n\nsmith: you'll love this. obama told me. hillary promised me. joe biden -- joe biden is a pressure. he was a real sweetheart. but he also told -- they all told me that -- they promised me. and i told them please, tell me what happened. just tell me what happened.\n\n\n\ncooper: so you're still waiting to hear from somebody about what happened to your son? about what they know? or even what they don't know.\n\n\n\nsmith: right. right. officially yes. i told them, please don't give me any baloney that comes through with this political stuff. i don't want political stuff. you can keep your political, just tell me the truth. what happened. and i still don't know. in fact, today i just heard something more that he died of smoke inhalation.\n\n\n\ncooper: so you don't even know the cause of death?\n\n\n\nsmith: i don't even know if that's true or not. no, i don't. i don't know where. i look at tv and i see bloody hand prints on walls, thinking, my god, is that my son's? i don't know if he was shot. i don't know -- i don't know. they haven't told me anything. they are still studying it. and the things that they are telling me are just outright lies.\n\n\n\nthat susan rise, what -- she talked to me personally and she said, she said, this is the way it was. it was -- it was because of this film that came out.\n\n\n\ncooper: so she told you personally that she thought it was a result of that video of the protest?\n\n\n\nsmith: oh, absolutely. absolutely. in fact all of them did. all of them did. leon panetta actually took my face in his hands like this and he said, trust me. i will tell you what happened. and so far, he's told me nothing. nothing at all. and i want to know.\n\n\n\ncooper: it's important for you to know all the details no matter how horrible.\n\n\n\nsmith: yes.\n\n\n\ncooper: or no matter how tough they are to hear.\n\n\n\nsmith: exactly. i told him, if it's such a secret thing, fine, take me in another room, whisper in my ear what happened so that i know, and we'll go from there. but no. no, they -- you know, they treat me like -- at first i was so proud because they were treating me so nice when i went to that reception. they all came up to me and talked to me and everything. i cried on obama's shoulder. and he -- then he'd kind of looked off into the distance.\n\n\n\nso that was worthless to me. i want to know, for god's sakes. or for allah's sake or whoever's sake is there.\n\n\n\ncooper: you deserve -- you deserve answers.\n\n\n\nsmith: i think so. i believe i do. i believe it. it's my son. i had him for the first -- i told obama personally, i said, look, i had him for his first 17 years and then he went into the service, then you got him. and -- i won't say it the way i said it. but i said you screwed up, you didn't do a good job, i lost my son. and they said, we'll get back to you. we -- i promise, i promise you. i will get back to you. cooper: some of the administration have said well, you know, we're investigating, we're still trying to find out answers. but you just want --\n\n\n\nsmith: they still are.\n\n\n\ncooper: you would still want them to contact you and at least keep you apprised of the investigation, of where things are. you would think that they would at least do that.\n\n\n\nsmith: that would be so nice. that would at least acknowledge that i have a right to know something, something other than, we're checking up on it, or trust me. i like that one the best of all. trust me. i will let you know.\n\n\n\nwell, i don't trust you anymore. i don't trust you anymore. you -- i'm not going to say lied to me, but you didn't tell me and you knew.\n\n\n\ncooper: pat smith, thank you.\n\n\n\nsmith: ok.\n\n\n\n(end videotape)\n\n\n\ncooper: a grieving mother. we are joined now by two women who broke the news on the story right from the start. former bush homeland security adviser, fran townsend, and foreign affairs correspondent, jill dougherty.\n\n\n\nwe should mention, fran, as always -- as we always mention, serves on the cia's external advisory committee. she recently traveled to libya with her employer macandrews & forbes. that was before the attack and actually had met with ambassador stevens.\n\n\n\nobviously mrs. smith is very upset and we -- you know, it's very understandable why she would be. what is the procedure, though, for keeping a family informed? i mean she says, they said we will let you know what happened. is it -- do they wait until the investigation is over? or you would think somebody would be in contact with her.\n\n\n\nfran townsend, cnn national security contributor: right. so there's actually an office in the justice department because this is now obviously a criminal investigation, that's responsible. the office of victim witness assistance. they are supposed to be the advocates inside the apparatus of the u.s. government to get updates, to make sure that the families are kept apprised. but you would -- you also expect and every department has this. if it's an employee that's lost, or it's a member of one of our law enforcement or intelligence services that agency takes ownership of making sure to shepherd the person through the system and around the system to get information.\n\n\n\nso in many respects, anderson, it's sort of incomprehensible to me these are people, the family members were identified, they met with senior officials, including the president of the united states and the secretary of state. it's not as though they don't know where she is. she's got --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncooper: right. initially i thought, well, maybe it's -- you know, it's -- maybe they're in contact with sean smith's wife who is i guess in the netherlands. but she was at this reception. they clearly talked to her.\n\n\n\ntownsend: no, that's right. and the fact oftentimes, anderson, with a family that's lost someone, there's more than one person, right? so you'll have the parents of the victim.\n\n\n\ncooper: right.\n\n\n\ntownsend: you may have a spouse or an extended family. and it becomes the government's responsibility to care for that family and keep them informed.\n\n\n\ncooper: well, jill, i know you reached out to the state department tonight about the allegations that pat smith has made. what are they saying?\n\n\n\njill dougherty, cnn foreign affairs correspondent: well, there's three things they said to me. they're saying they, since the beginning, have made it a priority to be in touched with the families, maintain regular contact, as they say. they say that in the last 24 hours before the congressional hearing they've reached out by phone to at least one member of the family and told them what would be reported at that -- at that congressional hearing.\n\n\n\nand then they also said we're going to make sure that the mother of sean is contacted by us. so, they won't get into a lot of specifics but they maintain that they have been in contact with the families in some way or another since the beginning.\n\n\n\ncooper: so you're saying that they are now saying that they will contact mrs. smith?\n\n\n\ndougherty: they'll make sure. yes, they said, they will make sure that they are.\n\n\n\ncooper: at this point, though, i mean, a family member, who's -- who are they supposed to believe? i mean there have been so many different stories out there, fran, and so many different -- and others, you know, lots of political allegations. we had this hearing today and, you know, some saw it as a political hearing. and politics motivating it.\n\n\n\nwhat do you --\n\n\n\ntownsend: you know, look, this is really hard. in the first 48 to 72 hours, the first facts are often wrong.\n\n\n\ncooper: right.\n\n\n\ntownsend: and so i think the media and the american people understand that and sort of allowed for that. the problem is, tomorrow is a month since the attack. it is hard to imagine that no one has talked to this woman. the autopsy in which -- was done at dover air force base for all of the victims with fbi agents present is a well known fact. the results of that are understood by investigators and there is no excuse for not sharing that information with this victim's mother.\n\n\n\ncooper: right. jill, the hearing -- let's talk about the hearing that happened today. which the state department defended the administration's handling the attack. you say it was highly political. did it accomplish anything? did it resolve anything? there's certainly a lot of allegations about the political --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ndougherty: anderson, you know, i didn't hear a lot of really new information at all. i mean i think, i and some others who were watching it at the time were really struck by the fact that it really turned into his sparring, and it was very, very personal between, you know, the republicans and the democrats.\n\n\n\nand so it -- i don't think that it accomplished very much when you get down to the nuts and bolts of what was learned.\n\n\n\ncooper: one of the most contentious moments, jill, was, i mean, the state department said that they had -- i don't have the exact phrasing but basically the appropriate number of people on the ground, and there was -- there was a sharp rebuke from the panel saying, how can you say that when -- given four americans are dead.\n\n\n\ndougherty: right. and that's the essential thing. but i think what -- and not to explain away what the state department is doing, but their view would be based on the information that they had at that particular point which -- was coming from intelligence agencies and others on the ground. they believe that they had the adequate amount of staffing.\n\n\n\nnow they also say that event was so extraordinary that basically nothing a few more people, a few more, let's say, protective measures could not have protected from something that they are describing, really, as combat -- military combat attack.\n\n\n\ncooper: there is an investigation underway. i mean, a -- at this point, fran, who is responsible for giving the definitive account of what happened and what cables were sent in doing this investigation?\n\n\n\ntownsend: well, as we've said and reported, anderson, there are a number of -- there's accountability review board, there are these congressional hearings. in the end, the definitive version of the facts will come from the fbi who are responsible for putting together the investigation and a potential prosecution. they will be -- they will be the keepers of the evidence. but i must tell you ,you know, the answer on its face if we had adequate security kind of fails the common sense test. i mean, honestly, if you step back from the partisan politics of washington, and you talk to average americans who've got no dog in this fight, they sort of say, look, it's obvious we didn't have adequate security. this isn't -- if we're looking to assign blame, the terrorists are to blame for the death. but if we need -- we want accountability because we want to understand how can we make sure the state department are working in dangerous places, we want to make sure, how do we assess threats, assign security, and --\n\n\n\ncooper: what the state department has said today in this hearing was that no amount of sort of the usual security would have been able to deal with a -- dozens of attackers. they're saying, there were dozens of attackers who are heavily armed. you say?\n\n\n\ntownsend: i say we have forward operating bases in iraq and afghanistan during the height of the war. and we protected --\n\n\n\ncooper: and certainly -- and the facility itself was not very secured in terms of the actual technological security devices over there.\n\n\n\ntownsend: that's right. but if it's -- so if you're at a facility that you cannot protect, that it is not possible to protect from the threat that is present, then you shouldn't be there. if you are there and you believe you can protect, then you've got to give it adequate resources. it's -- this is less about to me about blame than it is about accountability. what we ought to care about is accountability to protect other diplomats.\n\n\n\ncooper: sure. because you don't want this to happen again.\n\n\n\ntownsend: right.\n\n\n\ncooper: and there are other facilities that we have that are like this consulate. that's the bottom line here.\n\n\n\ntownsend: right.\n\n\n\ncooper: and also getting answers for the families.\n\n\n\njill dougherty, i appreciate your reporting. fran townsend, as well.\n\n\n\nlet us know what you think. we're on twitter right now. follow me @andersoncooper. i'm tweeting about this tonight.\n\n\n\njust ahead. mitt romney seems to move to the middle on abortion then moves right back. it's not the first time. the question tonight, what does he believe and was it just a mistake what he said yesterday. we'll show you all sides. we'll be right back.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\ncooper: well, the man behind that video that set of protests in egypt and elsewhere was in federal court today. we'll tell you why when 360 continues. (commercial break)\n\n\n\ncooper: another keeping them honest report tonight. a look at what mitt romney says about abortion. not what he believes deep down or whether those beliefs have changed over time, but his statements and positions as a candidate past and present. his record as an elected official and how it all comes together right now.\n\n\n\nright now mr. romney needs swing voters, especially women, which may explain why beginning with the debate in denver mr. romney seemed to be sounding more moderate or centrist on a range of issues. just yesterday, comments he made about abortion were picked up by democrats as yet another example of governor romney taking on a more centrist position. now listen to his q&a yesterday with a reporter from the des moines register.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nunidentified reporter: do you intend to pursue any legislation specifically regarding abortion?\n\n\n\nmitt romney (r), presidential nominee: i don't -- there's no legislation regarding -- with regards to abortion that i'm familiar with that -- that would become part of my agenda.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: so right after he said that, however, his spokeswoman said this to the national review, quote, governor romney would of course support legislation aimed at providing greater protections for life. and then late today in ohio mr. romney said -- gave one specific example of what he would do as president.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nromney: i think i've said that time and again i'm a pro-life candidate, i'll be a pro-life president. the actions i'll take immediately are to remove funding for planned parenthood, would not be part of my budget.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: that's consistent with his position throughout these primaries. in the part romney has said he supports extending 14th amendment protections to unborn children, says that roe versus wade, which legalized abortion should be overturned, and abortion law returns to the states.\n\n\n\nso keeping them honest, was his statement to the des moines register, to the des moines paper in a moderate swing state an attempt to tailor the message to voters there or was it simply a misstatement, a mistake?\n\n\n\nromney's views on abortion have changed over time, often it seems coinciding with when he's running for office and where he's running for office. in 1994 he was running against senator ted kennedy in massachusetts and he said this.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nromney: i believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country. i have since the time that my mom took that position when she ran in 1970 as a u.s. senate candidate. i believe that since roe v wade has been the law for 20 years that we should sustain and support it. and i sustain and support that law and the right of a woman to make that choice.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: well, he lost that election. eight years later running for governor in massachusetts, he said this.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nromney: so when asked, will i preserve and protect a woman's right to choose, i make an unequivocal answer. yes.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: in fact he promised during a debate with a democratic opponent not to make any changes, quote, which would make it more difficult for a woman to make that choice herself. once elected, though, mr. romney changed his position. in 2005 he vetoed a bill expanding access to emergency contraception. two years later he was running for president on a staunch pro-life platform.\n\n\n\nnow on opponent, fred thompson, actually made an ad using that 1994 pro-choice clip against him. i asked the governor about it during a debate. here's what he said back in 2007.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nromney: i don't know how many times i could tell it, i was wrong. all right? i was effectively pro-choice when i ran for office. if people in this country are looking for someone who has never made a mistake at a policy issue and is not willing to admit they're ever wrong, well, then they're going to have to find somebody else. because on abortion, i was wrong. and i changed my mind as the governor. this didn't just happen in the last couple of weeks or the last year.\n\n\n\nthis happened when i was governor, the first time a bill came to my desk that related to life, i could not sign a bill that would take away human life. i came down to the side of life every single instance as governor of massachusetts. i was awarded by the massachusetts citizens for life with a leadership award for my record.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: tonight, it's exactly that. his record that has many on the left crying flip-flop. folks on the right saying he was misunderstood or mistaken. joining us now is jen psaki, the traveling press secretary for the obama campaign and kellyanne conway, former senior advisor to the newt gingrich campaign.\n\n\n\nkellyanne, president obama was asked about mitt romney's comments on abortion to the des moines register. i want to play a clip of what he just told abc news.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nbarack obama, president of the united states: this is another example of governor romney hiding positions he's been campaigning on for a year and a half.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: kellyanne, do you dispute that -- that mitt romney seems to have moved to the center in that debate and sense that there is a different tone, maybe a more centrist approach?\n\n\n\nconway: not on abortion because the campaign quickly said to go back and look at the national review interview he gave in june of 2011 if you want to know how he would govern as president --\n\n\n\ncooper: so was that just a mistake to the des moines register or -- an oversight?\n\n\n\nconway: i read his quote, anderson, and i believe it was probably more of an oversight than a misstatement because i read his quote and he said there is no legislation that he can think of.\n\n\n\nbut he has already said that he would sign legislation if he it came to his desk on fetal pain, which of course, is probably the greatest challenge being legislative and litigating in the states --\n\n\n\ncooper: but do you see a move to the center on kind of a broader sense, on other issues certainly in the debate?\n\n\n\nconway: not away that would put close any kind of day light between president obama and governor romney. i think that he was talking about his health care plan last week. i don't believe it's an ideological shift. i believe that debates give everybody a 90-minute opportunity to be more expository on all the issues --\n\n\n\ncooper: i mean, on health care plan, he is saying pre-existing conditions are covered when in fact by most people's definition under his plan, pre-existing conditions are not covered.\n\n\n\ni mean, he is talking about if you have health insurance and you lose your job, and you have a pre-existing condition, you can continue with coverage if you pay the premiums. that's not most people's definition.\n\n\n\nconway: that is right. and i read that eric fehrnstrom, his senior adviser did talk about that in the spin room after the debate and clarified. i do want to say that the whole abortion and contraception has been talked to death this year for the war on the women.\n\n\n\ni noticed conspicuous by its absence in that debate. president obama never uttered abortion or contraception in 90 minutes.\n\n\n\ncooper: but on the health care thing that we just talked about, i know his spokesman corrected him afterward. why did he need to be corrected? you would think he would know what his position is saying that during the debate. was that an attempt to kind of appeal to a wider range of people or is that also a misstatement?\n\n\n\nconway: you would have to ask governor romney why he said what he said. but i don't that there is any machination trying to appeal to a broader audience. i mean, i think we should ask president obama why he tried to appeal to nobody.\n\n\n\ncooper: jen, do you see machination here?\n\n\n\njen psaki, obama campaign traveling press secretary: well look, i think we were reminded with this interview that mitt romney was willing to say and do anything to be president even if it means hiding to his own positions.\n\n\n\nwe're tying him to his -- what his positions are, which on issues like women's health care, on immigration, on his embrace of a $5 trillion tax cut. those are positions that are the far right wing of the party.\n\n\n\nand we are going to hold his feet to the fire for the next 27 days. it does amaze me that, you know, mitt romney had one good night. the president didn't have the best night.\n\n\n\nhe has been pretty straight forward about that. we are looking forward to the next debate, but we're running like we're five points behind him in these swing states.\n\n\n\ni hope that the romney team is doing the same things because there is a little bit of overconfidence i'm hearing from kellyanne and from members on the romney team.\n\n\n\nconway: sorry, never. no overconfidence. i'm not part of the romney team, but i certainly support him for president, but, jen, no over confidence here. this race is not over and the late in the game deciders are female.\n\n\n\nthe only thing to them is when you talk about women's health, they think about cardiovascular issues, osteoporosis, obesity, nutrition and diabetes. they don't think about abortion.\n\n\n\ni think that you've taken that word. it was once called abortion then it was choice and now it's all women's health. it's insulting to women --\n\n\n\ncooper: a lot of those are pre-existing conditions. i guess, i still don't understand why governor romney during that debate would be saying that this health care covers pre-existing conditions, when by most people's definition of what pre-existing condition is and how you get that covered, his plan doesn't cover that.\n\n\n\nconway: and there is another thing, anderson, you just explained it better than president obama did in his debate. what president obama did --\n\n\n\ncooper: i appreciate the compliment, but i would like an answer.\n\n\n\nconway: well, here's my answer. what president obama did in that debate was thank mitt romney for essentially providing inspirational blue print and the political cover in his own advisers to the white house to help construct obamacare, the affordable care act --\n\n\n\ncooper: i just don't understand how any candidate who has been running for a long as mitt romney is and as smart as mitt romney is could get his own policy so wrong unless he was trying to appeal to a wider range of people by kind of painting with a very broad brush and the definition that not most people have about what a pre-existing condition is.\n\n\n\nconway: no, well, look, president romney is not a liar. he is not going to go on national tv and talk in a debate and lie about his own health care plan. he got that part wrong according to his senior adviser, which i am not --\n\n\n\npsaki: he did last week.\n\n\n\nconway: and in any event --\n\n\n\ncooper: so he got it wrong. so you are just saying it was a mistake.\n\n\n\nconway: that is what eric fehrnstrom said. he is his adviser so i assume they are correct.\n\n\n\ncooper: jen, do you believe it was just a mistake?\n\n\n\npsaki: look, i have to say this is becoming pattern. so when something becomes a pattern, you have to wonder what is behind it and why mitt romney is so uncomfortable with his own positions.\n\n\n\ncooper: it's going to be a fascinating debate though, but tomorrow night the vice president and vice presidential candidate. kellyanne conway, appreciate it. jen psaki, thank.\n\n\n\nconway: thank you.\n\n\n\ncooper: well, the family of lillian cary is speaking out tonight. they want you to know she is more than just a statistic in the deadly fungal meningitis outbreak. you're going to hear from them ahead.\n\n\n\nplus dr. sanjay gupta's important new details about the company at the center of the outbreak and even bigger company with ties to it that is next.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\ncooper: the seven-time tour de france winner, lance armstrong was the most sophisticated and successful, that's a quote, doping program in cycling according to the u.s. anti-doping agency and they say they have more than 1,000 documents to back up the claim. we'll have the latest on that ahead.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\ncooper: keeping them honest, important new information tonight about the company at the center of the deadly meningitis outbreak that now involves 10 states, 137 people have been sick and 12 people have died.\n\n\n\nas many as 13,000 may have been exposed to the tainted steroid injections linked to the outbreak. injections made by a company called new england compounding center, a type of pharmacy that is regulated by state officials not the fda.\n\n\n\nits owners are not taking questions from reporters. chief medical correspondent, dr. sanjay gupta, got as far as their parking lot yesterday. he was told to leave.\n\n\n\nhe managed to take a look behind their facility though and what he found was pretty surprising, a recycling site filled with waste and garbage right next to the building where inside medications are being mixed.\n\n\n\nit turns out the recycling center is owned by the same guy who owns the compounding center and that's not all. i will tell you sanjay did some more digging. here is what he found.\n\n\n\n(begin videotape)\n\n\n\ndr. sanjay gupta, cnn chief medical correspondent (voice-over): necc, this is the place where the deadly meningitis outbreak started. we came here looking for answers, but we soon found out no one would talk.\n\n\n\n(on camera): is there someone that we can actually talk to? we've been leaving voice messages and --\n\n\n\n(voice-over): i even went straight to the home of barry cadden. he is the owner of the facility. there was a car parked at the end of the driveway. no visitors allowed, but i was told they would call me back. they didn't.\n\n\n\nbut there was something else we noticed. look closely at the name of this garbage facility connected to the necc.\n\n\n\n(on camera): conigliaro, well, it turns out this is the maiden name of barry cadden's wife, lisa. she is also listed as a pharmacist at necc.\n\n\n\na little bit more digging and we found out that barry cadden, gregory conigliaro who is lisa's brother are the owners of necc, that recycling facility and also this medical facility called the ameridose. they wouldn't let us on the parking lot here.\n\n\n\n(voice-over): now if necc is big then ameridose is the 800-pound gorilla. necc has 21 employees and generated $8 million in revenue and ameridose, 400 employees and generated $100 million a year.\n\n\n\nameridose does drug manufacturing, which is regulated by the fda, but they also do add mixing, that's a form of compounding and that's regulated by the state pharmacy board.\n\n\n\n(on camera): and here is something else, there is a woman named sophia pasedis. she is the vice president of compliance here at ameridose. she was also appointed to the state pharmacy board back in 2008.\n\n\n\nwe asked them about that and they say she has recused herself of all matters related to the ameridose and necc.\n\n\n\n(voice-over): both companies have done business with the united states government. in fact, more than $800,000 worth of drug orders were placed with them by government agencies since 2007.\n\n\n\ntogether both these companies produce hundreds of thousands of medication doses and now both have shut down their operations.\n\n\n\n(end videotape)\n\n\n\ngupta: and i'll tell you as well, anderson, the massachusetts department of health did not say there is evidence of contamination when it comes to products for ameridose.\n\n\n\nbut we're still trying to find out what exactly is the connection between again this 800-pound gorilla, ameridose and necc and what that might mean for consumers sort of going forward, anderson?\n\n\n\ncooper: and the bottom line is the federal officials, the fda, is not responsible for overseeing the quality at these compounding pharmacies. it's up to state officials?\n\n\n\ngupta: well, ameridose does two things. it does manufacture some medications that does come in the view of the fda, but they also have this part where they do add mixing where they are mixing together different medicines. and again that's the same sort of thing that we talked about with necc. that is a state regulated thing.\n\n\n\ncooper: all right, sanjay, stay with us. lillian carrie is one of the 12 people who tragically died in this outbreak. she got a steroid injection in august, came down with fungal meningitis, and died two weeks ago.\n\n\n\nshe is more than a statistic, of course. she was a wife, a mom and a grandmother. her family held a memorial service for her yesterday honoring her life. their grief, of course, is mixed with fear and worry.\n\n\n\nlillian's husband also got a steroid shot made by necc. george cary joins me now along with his daughter, heather angus. george and heather, i'm so sorry for your loss. and i guess i want to ask you what do you want people to know about lillian?\n\n\n\ngeorge cary, wife died of fungal meningitis after injection: first of all, she was a wonderful woman that she had a love for life. she was part of our family, and that this should not have happened. this is a tragedy that goes beyond our family.\n\n\n\nand from our standpoint, we wish to express our condolences to the other people who have also lost loved ones and those people who may also have been injected with this steroid, and are undergoing the same period of uncertainty that we are and our family.\n\n\n\ncooper: george, i mean, you not only dealing with a grief of losing lillian, but you had injections from the same pain treatment center. what have you been told about your own risk of developing meningitis? how do you feel physically?\n\n\n\ncary: i was advised on friday afternoon of the connection between lillian and i, and the batch and lot number of the recalled fda steroid. on saturday afternoon i had a spinal tap. those tests were sent out. i still haven't received any information regarding them.\n\n\n\ni, like many other people, have steroid injections as a result of neck pain. neck pain is one of the symptoms of meningitis. it is something that i live with. as a result, i'm watching other body function to try to keep on top of it.\n\n\n\ncooper: heather, when you heard that these injections came from a pharmacy that is not regulated by the fda what did you think? i mean, did you know that?\n\n\n\nheather angus, mother died of fungal meningitis after injection: i was not aware of that at first. i can honestly say that shock, frustration, anger, and a little bit of disgust were definitely emotions that crossed my mind.\n\n\n\ni think it is ridiculous that these companies in this day and age weren't mandated to have inspections and that this completely preventable death and tragedy had to happen due to these oversights.\n\n\n\ncooper: i want to bring in dr. sanjay gupta. sanjay, because there were a lot of folks, 13,000 who may have gotten and exposed to these shots, what are symptoms that people should look for? george mentioned neck pain\n\n\n\ngupta: yes, and again, let me add as well, george and heather, you know, it was tough to hear. your story of what happened to your mom and wife, you know, it is difficult especially with this type of meningitis, a fungal meningitis as you may know is more rare than bacterial and viral meningitis.\n\n\n\nviral is the most common. but george is absolutely right, i mean, neck pain is one of the symptoms. people can often develop significant what's called photophobia, so just not wanting to be out in the light at all, headache as well, sometimes fever. what george is describing is where they are actually now taking some of the fluid and examining it to see if they can see evidence of fungus actually within the fluid.\n\n\n\nit doesn't mean, for sure, that if they don't find it that, you know, you still doesn't have to be vigilant about this. so george, i don't know if they told you this.\n\n\n\nbut up to 28 days or so, you know, if you have any other of these symptoms i am describing, you really do need to get checked it out and that's a message we've been giving to everybody who's concerned about this.\n\n\n\ncooper: george, have the answers you have gotten been satisfactory? what do you want to see happen? you have called this a wake-up call for the country.\n\n\n\ncary: well, i think that the lobbyist and corporations have always been a part of the political process regarding important issues. and i think this is an example of how the process works.\n\n\n\ncooper: and heather, what do you want to see happen? i mean, who do you think should be held accountable here?\n\n\n\nangus: i definitely think that the corporations themselves should be held accountable. i think that the federal government should step in at this point and enforce stricter guidelines. obviously, the state was not vigilant with their oversight and ensuring that the american public is getting safe drugs.\n\n\n\ncooper: and sanjay, when you were out of the facility, is the fda now investigating? where they the ones in charge of the investigation?\n\n\n\ngupta: yes, the fda is now investigating both the necc facility, which is at the heart of this and today, also ameridose owned by the same people that own necc.\n\n\n\nbut you know, they are absolutely right. it's interesting even at the state level, when a facility like this applies for a license. they have a process that they go through at that point.\n\n\n\nbut as far as we can tell, i'm talking to officials here on the ground, that unless there is a problem and that problem usually comes to light because something like this happens, not usually to this magnitude thankfully.\n\n\n\nbut something happens and then the organization, the licensing organization comes back in to sort of check things out. this particular facility back in 2002 as we have talked about was cited for unsterile practices. ten years later, you see what is happening.\n\n\n\ncooper: sanjay, is there preventive treatment for people maybe who received these injections, but who don't yet know whether or not it is going to give them the meningitis? gupta: well, the one thing that doctors always sort of wrestle with this, you know, should we just go ahead and treat somebody as if they have the infection even if we haven't confirmed it.\n\n\n\nand when it comes to this, and again, george, i don't know if they spoke to this with you, but the treatment is a longer course, of what are called anti-fungal medications.\n\n\n\nand these are the types of medication that you really do want to have confirmed infection before you start using because it is a long course. sometimes it involves being in the hospital for a few days. so i think there's really not a preventative sort of course here, but really just a real vigilance about any of these symptoms.\n\n\n\ncooper: well, george and heather, again, you know, speaking to us just one day after the memorial service for lillian, i appreciate you being on again. we are so sorry for your loss.\n\n\n\ncary: thank you for having us on your show.\n\n\n\nangus: thank you. our biggest concern was definitely putting a face to the statistics because this is more than just numbers. these are human beings and loved ones and people. hopefully, by sharing our story, we're able to help bring more awareness to this to get stricter guidelines going forward.\n\n\n\ncooper: i think everyone is going to think about lillian every time they hear about this and the others as well. and hopefully we'll learn more about them in the days ahead. again, thank you so much. stay strong.\n\n\n\ncary: thank you.\n\n\n\nangus: thank you.\n\n\n\ncooper: another deadly day in syria. at least 77 people killed in damascus alone, 16 in homs according to opposition groups. more on today's death toll when we continue.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\ncooper: following a number of stories, let's check in with isha in the 360 bulletin -- isha.\n\n\n\nisha sesay, cnn correspondent: anderson, opposition groups in syria say 197 people died in violence throughout the country today. video posted in youtube purports to show opposition fighters taking over the main security center south of idlib where they say government forces detained and tortured anti-regime activists. cnn cannot confirm the video's authenticity.\n\n\n\nin

(cnn) with the 10-year anniversary of the affordable care act fast approaching, former president barack obama highlighted the landmark health reform law's benefits in a new video released tuesday.\n\nwith your help, it's the closest we've ever come to universal coverage in america, obama said in the 90-second clip released by protect our care, a liberal advocacy group. there are people alive today because of what you did. there are 135 million americans whose pre-existing conditions are now protected because of what you did.\n\nhe added, that's something worth celebrating, but it's also progress worth protecting.\n\nobama filmed several videos promoting the aca -- usually with a humorous bent -- while he was in office and then more recently at annual open enrollment time for the obamacare exchanges. the appearances have been aimed at reminding consumers of the deadline to sign up for coverage at a time when the trump administration has slashed funding for marketing and outreach.\n\nbut tuesday's video was serious, emphasizing that voters protected obamacare in the 2018 midterm elections, when democrats took control of the house of representatives, effectively ending president donald trump and gop lawmakers' quest to repeal the law through congressional action for the time being.\n\nread more
it's hard to compare exactly why one candidate can win and another will lose in two different elections, but it's perhaps worth noting what sets clinton and biden apart and guess about whether that would make biden stronger against president donald trump in november than clinton turned out to be.\n\nthere are a lot of things that could explain why voters seem more open to biden than clinton. there are a lot of reasons it makes no sense at all.\n\nthere's one obvious difference between them: biden isn't a woman.\n\nfor instance, even though clinton was poised to become the first woman president, biden actually did better among women in this year's democratic primary in michigan than clinton did four years ago: biden got 57% and clinton got 51% vs. sanders.\n\nbut men also swung from sanders to biden. they went 55% for sanders over 44% for clinton in 2016. this year biden and sanders split them about evenly. the exit polls don't tell us why.\n\nhere are some other similarities and differences.\n\nthey're both tied to barack obama\n\nrunning against obama -- clinton went much farther than biden when they both ran against obama in the 2008 democratic primary. biden, who was on his second run, dropped out after iowa and clinton, who was in her first, stayed in it much longer, until june 3, when the last primaries took place.\n\nworking for obama -- both of them went to work for obama, biden as vice president and clinton as secretary of state. biden was obama's sidekick. he cornered obama into backing same-sex marriage. he said obamacare was a big effing deal. clinton was the focus of conspiracy theories throughout her time in the obama administration, perhaps because she had been drawing the enmity of republicans for decades and perhaps because she was seen, from the outset, as obama's natural heir even if biden was his vice president.\n\nrunning to follow obama -- clinton came right after obama. she pushed an inevitability vibe and only really faced sanders. she was set up to be the first woman president following the first black president. biden, who was older and had already run for president twice, deferred to her. but she struggled against sanders and, despite promising apocalypse if trump won, lost to him too.\n\nthey were both washington fixtures for decades\n\nclinton's time as first lady shaped her public image -- around the time biden was being sworn into the senate, clinton was working on the the watergate committee as a young staffer. but she didn't become a household name until her husband, bill clinton, then the governor of arkansas, ran in a fractious field in 1992. he was the comeback kid, whose career-minded wife stood by him as he around the time biden was being sworn into the senate, clinton was working on the the watergate committee as a young staffer. but she didn't become a household name until her husband, bill clinton, then the governor of arkansas, ran in a fractious field in 1992. he was the comeback kid, whose career-minded wife stood by him as he battled allegations of infidelity and, later, worse. her efforts to reform the health system were foiled. travelgate. whitewater. the vast right-wing conspiracy. she has been a magnet for conservative conspiracists ever since.\n\nshe also became a twitter meme as secretary of state, admired by a younger generation of women.\n\nbiden toiled in the senate after tragedy -- he has been in washington since 1973, taking office after a personal tragedy and riding the train home to see his boys at night. he's the longtime senator from delaware who chaired the judiciary committee and the foreign relations committee and enacted major pieces of legislation. he made friends with republican senators, some of whom he still praises even though maybe he shouldn't.\n\nto be sure, biden is now at the center of conservative conspiracy theories, but it's also true that he's relatively new as a target. trump's attempts to pressure ukraine to investigate biden his son hunter were at the center of the president's impeachment trial. trump and his allies have repeatedly made unfounded and false claims to allege that the bidens acted corruptly in ukraine.\n\nthey share some policy weaknesses\n\nthey both voted for the iraq war . they were both tainted by the 1994 crime bill, though that hurt biden more than clinton they both voted for the wall street bailout. none of these votes are very popular with the modern-day democratic base.\n\nthey ran in very different fields\n\nclinton only ever really faced sanders -- yes, martin o'malley was in the race. and so were a handful of others. but sanders was the progressive alternative to clinton's juggernaut that year. it's becoming clear that a good portion of his 2016 support was simply anti-her.\n\nbiden faced a huge field -- yes, he was the early frontrunner, but biden also faced scrutiny from many more sources. more than 20 democrats were in the presidential race at one point and biden, despite not winning in either iowa or new hampshire, survived to romp in south carolina and then on super tuesday. the party coalesced around him instead of making a binary choice between clinton and sanders.\n\nthey ran in very different years\n\ntrump didn't seem possible in 2016 -- both the clinton and trump campaigns thought leading up to election day that she would win. she warned that it was her or the apocalypse.\n\nnow trump is president -- but clinton's apocalypse came to be. and much of biden's strength, in exit polling, has to do with the perception that he is viewed as the candidate best equipped to take on trump even if sanders shares more policy priorities with much of the democratic base.\n\nthey have very different favorable ratings

miller's proposal would only compound this trend by scaring people away from services they are entitled to by law. it effectively criminalizes government services for those the administration views as undesirables.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nanother problematic aspect of miller's plan is that it would potentially make major changes to our legal immigration system without congressional approval. yet if congress had wanted to bar immigrant households from the earned income tax credit, it would have done so; the same goes for barring immigrants' kids from chip. actually, the last time congress clarified the term public charge in 1999, it excluded from the public charge definition access to services like health care and nutrition programs.\n\nsure, our immigration system is in need of an overhaul. however, that is the job of congress, and reforms should be rooted in reality, not fear. consider that 75% of americans say immigration is a good thing. or that this summer, the united states has a record 6.6 million job openings, and an unemployment rate of 3.9%. the white house website is touting the country's booming economy, so why do we need to make it harder for people to earn green cards and citizenship?\n\nthe answer is that we don't. miller's proposed policy reflects his personal, lifelong antipathy to immigrants as well as the xenophobia of an administration that has rescinded daca, limited grounds for asylum, and split up families at the border. this is not about the rule of law, the gang ms-13, or strengthening our borders. it is not about getting in line, or immigrating the right way. this proposal is a cynical attempt to promote negative stereotypes of immigrants – and to close america's door to those who have played by the rules and emigrated legally.

(chuck) schumer (d-new york) made it very clear that they didn't want to be part of this process. they were happy with obamacare. we believe obamacare's failing.\n\ndemocratic sen. tammy baldwin rejected spicer's theory.\n\ncertainly his premise is that democrats don't want to have anything to do with repealing the affordable care act, and it's because what they're doing is a bunch of partisan nonsense to notch up a political and partisan victory, the wisconsin senator told cnn's brooke baldwin on newsroom.\n\ndemocrats have been protesting the gop bill by trying to slow down senate action, including limiting committee hearings. several hearings set for tuesday afternoon were canceled, including on pandemics and restoring watersheds.\n\nbut they can't hold off republicans forever if mcconnell wants to go forward.\n\nsen. richard burr, r-north carolina, asked if there will be a vote next week said, i believe the majority leader when he says there's going to be one.\n\nfinance committee chairman orrin hatch said republicans are close, but not quite ready, to send a bill to the cbo.\n\nwe've been working on it for a long time. we're just not there yet, the utah republican said, adding he is confident the senate could vote next week.\n\nbut hatch insisted the gop senators are in the loop. under the senate rules, republicans need only 51 votes to pass the bill, and don't need to face a democratic filibuster – and a 60-vote threshold – that would kill it.\n\nwe've been chanting about the various aspects of the legislation. we're not leaving anybody out in the cold, hatch said. it's a tough job to get these things done and sometimes they're very complex and very lengthy.

four of the justices in the (2012 case) felt that the whole statute had to fall. so, as i said before you arrived, senator, you know at the end of the day, i felt that this was defensible legal position to take.\n\nrelated: the inside story of how john roberts negotiated to save obamacare\n\nfeinstein also pressed barr on who in the administration changed its stance.\n\nis this determined by the white house? she asked.\n\nbarr said that it was determined by the process within the executive branch and a number of different players.\n\nwell, i assume you wouldn't take this position unless this is what the president wanted, feinstein added.\n\nwell – that would be a safe assumption, barr said.\n\nthe administration's latest court filing came after months of heated internal debate that pitted barr along with health and human services secretary alex azar against acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney and officials aligned with him, a source close to the white house told cnn at the time.\n\noverturning the law would have far-reaching consequences – way beyond disrupting coverage for the millions of people who get their health insurance on the exchanges or through medicaid expansion.\n\nobamacare saves senior citizens money on their medicare coverage and prescription drugs. it lets many americans obtain free birth control, mammograms and cholesterol tests. and it allows children to stay on their parents' health insurance plans until they turn 26.\n\nbecause the trump administration is no longer defending the law in court, a coalition of 21 democratic states led by california has stepped in to do so.\n\nbefore the aca, 133 million americans faced barriers to coverage because of a pre-existing condition like diabetes or pregnancy – yes, pregnancy, california's attorney general becerra said in a statement on wednesday.\n\nwe will be in court defending americans' healthcare that president trump seeks to strip from them,  he added.\n\nbarr's comments on wednesday came after he faced a similar grilling from members of the house appropriations committee tuesday on the new decision. at one point during the hearing, he told rep. matt cartwright, a pennsylvania democrat, that concerned lawmakers should let the courts do their job.\n\nmulvaney said over the weekend that the white house could introduce a proposal fairly shortly.\n\ncnn's kate sullivan and jeremy diamond contributed to this report.

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\ncnn's latest poll shows president donald trump's approval rating hitting 43% with voters and 42% with all adults. that's not great, but it matches other recent polling that illustrates the president's approval rating is clearly up after crevassing during the government shutdown in january.\n\nanother way to look at these numbers: trump doesn't seem to have lost public support after declaring an unpopular national emergency regarding a border wall and having to veto an attempt by congress to override said national emergency.\n\nthat is, trump seems, for now, to have made the right public opinion move in declaring the national emergency.\n\nafter losing the shutdown fight, the president had three options when it came to a border wall.\n\n1. trump could have forced another government shutdown in order to build a more complete border wall with mexico.\n\nthis option was probably the worst one for trump. the outcome probably would have been the same as the first shutdown. congress would have refused to fund it. government workers would not have been paid. trump's approval rating would have fallen again.\n\n2. trump could have deemed building an extension of the border wall with mexico a lost cause and moved on.\n\nin doing so, trump would have avoided a shutdown and the center of the electorate would have liked it. i thought this may have been the best political option, as trump probably wants to get his approval up heading into 2020.\n\nmoving on wasn't without risks, however. in doing so, trump may have gained nothing with the center and alienated his base, which trump originally won over with his stances on immigration. members of his base were upset with him in december when he was originally going to fund the government without money for a wall, leading to the 35-day-long government shutdown. and while you may not remember it, trump has lost portions of this base before when he failed to deliver, most notably when congress failed to overturn obamacare in the summer of 2017.\n\nthis left trump with the third option.\n\n3. declaring a national emergency to build the wall.\n\nso far, it seems to be working out for him. at least with voters, his approval rating hasn't been harmed by declaring a national emergency. he proved to his base that he was serious about the issue. trump didn't have to harm government workers' by taking away their paychecks with a shutdown. and while he most certainly faced a rebuke from congress, they almost certainly won't override his veto. trump can go into the campaign and essentially say he did his best to fulfill a promise he made to build the wall.\n\nindeed, it's not even clear how unpopular trump's decision to declare a national emergency actually was. by a 16-point margin (53% to 37%), voters thought trump shouldn't have vetoed congress' attempt to override his national emergency. but the same poll showed that by only an 8-point margin (50% to 42%) did voters want congress to override the president in the first place. that is, they may not have liked what the president did, but they weren't that eager to override him, either.\n\nthis dynamic gets at the heart of why the national emergency may have, in retrospect, been the best political move. it doesn't seem that voters in the center of the electorate felt that strongly about it. there is a big difference between something that is unpopular and something that actually affects feelings about the president.\n\nthe national emergency seems to have fallen into the former category. it was unpopular, but it wasn't a game changer for most people. that's very different from the shutdown, which did move the president's numbers in a negative fashion.\n\nfor a president heading into a presidential election, trump may have made the right move. he remains popular with his base ahead of a potential primary. he is at least viable in a general election against a democratic party that may nominate an unpopular candidate.
(cnn) california has reversed several years of slipping sign ups on its affordable care act exchange.\n\nthe key was restoring the penalty for remaining uninsured and boosting financial help to pay for coverage -- two state provisions that are new this year, said officials at the covered california exchange.\n\nthis led to a 1.6% increase in sign ups, to 1.54 million people, on the state-run exchange for 2020. the boost was driven by a 41% jump in new customers, which offset an 8% decline in renewals.\n\nit's absolutely clear the penalty provided motivation to shop. so it made a big difference, said peter lee, covered california's executive director. it's also clear that the federal and state subsidies helped people buy.\n\nimmigration, auto emissions, bolstering the affordable care act has been a priority of several blue states, as well as moderate presidential candidates, after the trump administration and republicans in congress moved to weaken it. defending the landmark health reform law has also allowed democratic governors, particularly california's gavin newsom, to draw contrasts between themselves and president donald trump. the two have tangled in recent years over abortion homelessness and presidential tax returns\n\nread more
washington (cnn) the democratic national committee, in cooperation with the biden white house, will kick off a sweeping effort to sell the newly signed covid-19 relief package to a politically divided american people on friday, releasing a new national ad bragging about the bill along with a detailed guide on how democrats across the country should tout the legislation.\n\nthe multi-prong effort is aimed at turning the bill into something democrats can run on, not run away from, in the coming years, including in the politically critical 2022 midterms. the ad, which is set to run nationally, in battleground markets and digitally in the coming weeks, is the centerpiece of the broader effort, which aims to turn the job of touting the bill into an all of party effort.\n\nif someone is running for dog catcher in des moines, or running to register deeds in wyoming, we want them to talk about this, dnc spokeswoman adrienne watson said. in fact, we will make sure they are armed to the teeth with what it does and why it's so historic.\n\nthe ad features remarks from biden after the senate passed the american rescue plan, intermixed with images of businesses reopening, american families together and vaccines speeding through factory lines.\n\nby passing the american rescue plan, we'll have heeded the voice of the american people, not ignored their voices, biden says in the spot, before going through some of the specific planks of the bill, including money to increase vaccine manufacturing, establish more vaccination sites, send stimulus checks to millions of americans and curb childhood poverty.\n\nwhen we took office ... i promised the american people that help was on the way, biden says in the close of the spot. today, i can say we've taken one more giant step forward in delivering on that promise.\n\nin addition to the ad, the dnc has sent a detailed strategy guide on touting the bill to state parties, dnc members and national democrats. they will also begin to train state party officials and grassroots community leaders on how to tout the bill. the sessions will be led by dnc senior adviser brad woodhouse.\n\nbiden's own messaging efforts to sell the bill will not be limited to solely this ad, however. a white house memo obtained by cnn this week detailed blitz by biden, vice president kamala harris and a host of other top administration officials in the coming weeks.\n\nin a video for state and local democrats, dnc chair jaime harrison argued that while the work of passing the legislation is done, the work of selling it to the american people is far from over. harrison tells local democrats that the party needs to make sure that voters know how we delivered for them when it counted most.\n\nthis is our time to help our friends and neighbors understand how the american rescue plan benefits them, and what democrats are able to deliver when we have their support, harrison says. we need to spread this message far and wide. tell everyone. scream it from the rooftops.\n\nthe concerted effort on biden's first major legislative achievement is an acknowledgment that the party in power is often punished in midterm elections, in part because of the opposing party's ability to seize on complicated legislation and use it to turn voters against the controlling party.\n\nand the urgency with which democrats feel they need to tout the relief bill is a clear sign that the party is trying to learn the lessons from legislative achievements early in barack obama's presidency, including the nearly $800 billion recovery act passed in 2009 and the fight over the affordable care act, the sweeping health care overhaul signed into law in 2010.\n\nwhile the latest relief package is more popular than either bill ever was, republicans seized on the lengthy, complicated bills in the earliest days of the obama administration. the results for democrats were disastrous: republicans took control of the house and narrowed the democratic margin in the senate, leading then-president barack obama to describe the midterms as a shellacking.\n\nno one really knows what the ultimate political impact will be 20 months from now, said doug heye, a republican operative who was communications director of the republican national committee during the fight over obamacare. in 2010, democrats were predicting political doom for any republican opposing the joe biden-led stimulus bill. republicans won 63 house seats that november.\n\nbiden recently told the house democratic caucus that democrats were not as focused on touting their achievements early in obama's tenure and that the party paid a price ... for that humility.\n\nkathleen sebelius, obama's health and human services secretary at the time, said one of the biggest issues with selling obamacare was that most americans saw no impact from the bill until 2014, something that is not the case with the covid relief package.\n\npeople have to feel the impact of what happens quickly, they have to know their lives are better, sebelius said. things that are very tangible have to happen visibly and quickly.\n\nrepublicans have responded by lambasting the bill as too expensive and a labeling it a socialist wish list. they have also attempted to tie it to house speaker nancy pelosi, not biden. michael mcadams, spokesman for the national republican congressional committee, said that history could repeat itself, even if the bill is popular now.\n\nwe are going to make sure voters understand the rampant waste that democrats snuck into this so-called covid relief bill, mcadams said. it's a socialist wish list for nancy pelosi and her democratic allies and it is going to hurt them in 2022.\n\npressed on the current popularity of the plan, mcadams added, when voters cast their ballots in 2022, there is going to be a very different sense of the bill's popularity.\n\nto date, republicans have not been able to do that with either the biden administration or this covid relief bill. a cnn poll released on wednesday found that 61% of americans supported the nearly $2 trillion economic relief package, with only 37% opposing the package, with several key provisions in the bill -- including providing larger tax credits for families, providing funding for student k-12 to return to the classroom, and sending stimulus checks worth up to $1,400 per person to most families and individuals -- polling better than the bill as a whole and with a majority of republicans surveyed supporting the provisions.\n\nto keep this bill popular, the biden white house is leaning on all levers of democratic power to tout and sell the proposal, specifically heralding direct payments to families, efforts to curb childhood poverty and speeding up vaccine distribution.\n\nthe democratic congressional campaign committee will begin by running digital ads touting the relief package in swing districts across the country on friday. the targeted ads specifically tout democrats in frontline districts who voted for the bill such as tom o´halleran, a democrat who has represented a competitive district in arizona since 2017.\n\nrep. sean patrick maloney, chair of the dccc, said he believes this bill gives democrats the messaging advantage going into the next two years, and was blunt when asked about republican attempts to attack the legislation.\n\ni really hope that kevin mccarthy is dumb enough to think that this is 2009 (again), because then he is going to enjoy the minority for a long time to come, maloney said, noting that attacking a bill that puts money directly in american pockets could prove difficult.\n\nour job is to tell people the good news of what is becoming law and to make sure they hear it and feel it and see it in their daily lives, maloney said. the republicans' job is to lie about what's going on and hope they can fool everybody. i think we have the better task.\n\nand sen. gary peters, the newly installed chair of the democratic senatorial campaign committee, told reporters recently that not only will the bill be something his members can run on in 2022, but it will be something they use against republican candidates.\n\nthis is an easy sale. this is a bill that helps people in a meaningful way, and it is clear recognition for folks as to where each of the parties stand where it comes to helping everyday folks, he said. we are confident they are going to remember. when it comes to election time next year, they are going to know who stood with them in their time of need and who abandoned them. it is very clear.\n\ndemocratic super pacs are also stepping up in the fight, including biden's top super pac during the 2020 campaign, priorities usa.\n\nthe super pac announced on wednesday that two ads -- one titled help is on the way that attacks republicans and another titled jumpstart that argued biden and democrats are getting right to work -- would begin airing in arizona, florida, georgia, nevada, pennsylvania and wisconsin, six swing states.\n\nthere is no such thing as doing too much. we need to constantly remind people of who stood for them when they needed it most, said guy cecil, chair of the super pac. anything short of that allows republicans to rewrite history and distract the country with the same divisive tactics they've deployed for the last decade.
(cnn) welcome to cnn's fact check coverage of the last democratic presidential debate before the voting begins with the iowa caucuses on february 3. we will post fact checks as we complete them.\n\nthe debate was hosted by cnn and the des moines register at drake university in des moines, iowa. it included six candidates who met the party's qualification criteria, the smallest number to date.\n\nthe candidates were former vice president joe biden; vermont sen. bernie sanders; massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren; former south bend, indiana, mayor pete buttigieg; minnesota sen. amy klobuchar; and businessman tom steyer.\n\nsanders on us health care spending\n\nsanders repeated a previous claim about the amount of money the us spends on health care.\n\nwe are now spending twice as much per person on health care as do the people of any other country. that is insane, sanders said.\n\nfacts first: this is an exaggeration. the us does not spend twice as much per capita as any other country on health care, though it does spend more than twice the average for the members of the organisation for economic co-operation and development, a group of 36 countries with large market economies.\n\nswitzerland, at $7,317 per capita, and norway, at $6,187 per capita, were well above half the us level, $10,586 per capita, in 2018, the last year for which international data is available. germany ($5,986), sweden ($5,447), austria ($5,395) and denmark ($5,299) were also above half though more narrowly.\n\nthe oecd average for 2018 was $3,992 per capita, so sanders would be correct if he had said the us spends more than twice the average for wealthy countries. but he has been using his incorrect wording since at least 2009, when fact-checkers at politifact first noted that it wasn't true. you can read a longer version of this fact check here\n\nit is possible that the health spending numbers were different in 2019 than they were in 2018 and in years prior, but that data is not yet available.\n\n- daniel dale\n\nklobuchar on obamacare's affordability\n\nin defending her plan to build on the affordable care act instead of pushing for the more sweeping medicare for all plans proposed by her rivals, klobuchar pointed out that more people support obamacare than approve of president donald trump.\n\ni would also note practically, that the affordable care act right now is 10 points more popular than the president of the united states, the minnesota democrat said at cnn's debate on tuesday night.\n\nfacts first: while no poll directly compares the two, it's true that obamacare is better liked. polls done in november show obamacare with a 10-point advantage over trump. subsequent polls also show former president barack obama's health reform law being more popular than the current president.\n\na november poll by the kaiser family foundation , which has tracked public opinion on the affordable care act since it was passed in 2010, found that 52% of american adults had a favorable opinion of the law.\n\nby contrast, a cnn poll conducted by ssrs in november found that 42% approve of trump's job as president. that figure stayed essentially the same in a december cnn poll, which found trump's favorability rating was 43%, but it was within the margin of error.\n\n- tami luhby\n\nsanders on wages of us childcare workers\n\nsanders said america's childcare system is an embarrassment, it is unaffordable, claiming that childcare workers take home lower paychecks than people working at mcdonald's.\n\nchildcare workers are making wages lower than mcdonald's workers, sanders said.\n\nfacts first: while some childcare workers undoubtedly make less than some mcdonald's workers, us government data from 2018 shows that childcare workers took home a higher mean hourly salary than fast food workers.\n\ndata from the bureau of labor statistics , says the average wage for fast food and counter workers was $22,260 in may 2018. that's a mean hourly salary of $10.70.\n\nus childcare workers make on average $24,610 a year, the 2018 bls data showed, more than the fast food workers. that corresponds to mean hourly wages of $11.83.\n\na proxy statement from mcdonald's , a worldwide company, filed in 2018 with the securities and exchange commission, shows that the company's median employee made $7,017 in 2017. what this number doesn't say is that mcdonald's median employee is a part-time restaurant crew member in poland, according to the proxy statement.\n\n- anneken tappe\n\nbiden on trump weakening sanctions on north korea\n\nbiden claimed president donald trump weakened sanctions against pyongyang in his pursuit of meetings with north korea's kim jong un.\n\nthe president showed up, met with him, gave him legitimacy, weakened the sanctions we have against him, biden said.\n\nfacts first: trump has not weakened the sanctions his administration has placed on north korea to date, and has in fact ratcheted them up from the obama administration. although trump did once spark mass confusion among his aides when he trump has not weakened the sanctions his administration has placed on north korea to date, and has in fact ratcheted them up from the obama administration. although trump did once spark mass confusion among his aides when he tweeted he was ordering the removal of sanctions on pyongyang that had not yet been imposed or even announced.\n\nbiden's claim that trump offered kim jong un the legitimacy north korea has long craved echoes a widespread criticism of the president's approach to dealing with the hermit kingdom.\n\nin march of last year, trump tweeted that he had ordered the withdrawal of additional large scale sanctions he claimed the treasury department had announced earlier that day. but his announcement sent white house officials scrambling. many aides quickly concluded that the president was referring to sanctions targeting two chinese shipping companies that have allegedly helped north korea skirt sanctions imposed by the united nations. those new actions were fulfilled under existing sanctions authority. but two sources familiar with trump's tweet said it was in fact not about those sanctions, but instead about additional large-scale sanctions targeting north korea that had been in the works.\n\nduring an oval office meeting a month later with his south korean counterpart, trump claimed he believed sanctions are at a fair level and acknowledged the dust-up, saying he had the option of significantly increasing them but decided he didn't think it was necessary.\n\nthe trump administration ratcheted up sanctions even as the president has met with kim jong un three times without preconditions. in the past, the trump administration has offered to provide relief from these sanctions only if pyongyang completely denuclearizes, an outcome that has looked increasingly unlikely as kim jong un has in recent days threatened to restart nuclear testing.\n\nso although some lawmakers have criticized trump's decision to embrace diplomacy with the brutal north korean leader while extracting no concessions, loosening sanctions has not been part of this administration's policy toward pyongyang.\n\n- sarah westwood and zachary cohen\n\nwarren on female electability\n\nduring an exchange about electability and whether a woman can win the presidency, warren compared the political careers of the men on the debate stage with the women.\n\ncan a woman beat donald trump? warren said. look at the men on this stage. collectively, they have lost ten elections. the only people on this stage who have won every single election that they've been in are the women. amy and me.\n\nfacts first: warren has the facts right. she and klobuchar are undefeated, and their male opponents have lost a total of 10 elections during their political careers. but warren's talking point ignores the fact that sanders, biden and buttigieg have also prevailed in more than two dozen elections since 1970.\n\nit's true that warren and klobuchar have won all their races. the statistics are more impressive for klobuchar -- she's been in politics since 1998, while warren has only competed in two races since 2012.\n\nduring the 1970s and 1980s, sanders waged several third-party and independent campaigns for governor and for us senate. he also lost the democratic presidential primary to hillary clinton in 2016. but in addition to these losses, sanders has won more than a dozen political campaigns, including successful campaign for mayor of burlington, vermont, and representing the state in the us house and senate.\n\nbiden waged two unsuccessful presidential campaigns in 1988 and 2008. but he also had a successful career in the senate -- winning elections 7 times starting in 1972 -- and two victorious national campaigns alongside barack obama in 2008 and 2012.\n\nsome of these campaigns were waged before buttigieg was born. during his political career, he won two campaigns for mayor of south bend, indiana, and lost a statewide race for treasurer of indiana in 2010.\n\nthe only other man on the race, steyer, has never been a candidate for public office.\n\nthe bottom line is that warren's talking point was accurate. but the men on the stage actually won more elections than they've lost over the years, undercutting warren's electability argument. and some of their losses at the polls were decades ago, so it's not clear how relevant they are to the 2020 race.\n\nlater in the debate, sanders followed up another comment from warren, where she said she was the only candidate who defeated a republican incumbent in the past three decades. sanders touted his 1990 campaign for us house, exactly 30 years ago, when he unseated republican rep. peter smith.\n\n- marshall cohen\n\nbuttigieg on trump administration admitting iran deal worked\n\nformer mayor pete buttigieg asserted during the debate on tuesday that the trump administration admitted that the iran nuclear deal was working before pulling out of it.\n\nbuttigieg said, by gutting the iran nuclear deal, one that, by the way, the trump administration itself admitted was working, certified that it was preventing progress toward a nuclear iran, by gutting that, they have made the region more dangerous and set off the chain of events that we are now dealing with as it escalates even closer to the brink of outright war.\n\nfacts first: this is basically true. by repeatedly recertifying the nuclear deal and waiving sanctions against tehran as a result, the trump administration effectively acknowledged that iran was abiding by the terms of the deal even as the president publicly criticized it.\n\nthe terms of the nuclear deal required the us president to reauthorize it every 120 days to keep sanctions from kicking in. trump didn't leave the deal until may 2018 and reauthorized it a handful of times after taking office.\n\ncnn previously reported that the president promised to kill the deal on the campaign trail but was persuaded by cabinet members and allies several times to recertify iran's compliance. former defense secretary james mattis told the senate armed services committee in april 2018 that the verification provisions in the pact were pretty robust though he did not publicly back the deal. despite his criticism of the deal, neither trump nor his aides had been able to say that iran was violating the terms of the agreement.\n\n- caroline kelly and zachary cohen\n\nsanders on cost of nafta and permanent normal trade relations with china\n\nsanders repeated his claim that nafta and permanent normal trade relations with china have cost the us some 4 million jobs.\n\ni am sick and tired, said sanders as he drew a contrast with former vice president joe biden, pointing to large multinational corporations that he says have reaped the benefits.\n\nfacts first: this is likely an overestimate of the impact trade agreements can have on the country's employment.\n\nit's difficult to measure the overall economic impact of the north american free trade agreement since trade and investment trends can be affected by a number of factors, including economic growth, inflation and even a weakening dollar, according to the congressional research service.\n\nmost estimates find that nafta had little if any impact on national employment levels, though the effect was uneven across regions and industries.\n\nthe left-leaning economic policy institute found that between 1993 and 2013, the us trade deficit with mexico and canada increased from $17 billion to $177.2 billion and displaced 851,700 us jobs.\n\nby contrast, the entry of china into the world trade organization in 2001 likely had a much larger impact because of sudden competition from cheaper imports. but even the high end of job loss estimates from epi found that the change in trade status for china caused a loss of 3.4 million jobs between 2001 and 2017.\n\nanother estimate, from a 2016 study by economists at the massachusetts institute of technology, found that normalizing trade relations with china cost the us between 2 million and 2.4 million jobs between 1999 and 2011.\n\n- donna borak\n\nbiden on iraq war stance\n\nbiden repeated his false claim that he opposed the war in iraq from the moment the war began.\n\nbiden said he made a mistake in casting a 2002 vote , as a senator from delaware, to give president george w. bush the authority to go to war in iraq. but he said he cast the vote because the bush administration had said they were just going to get inspectors into iraq to check for weapons of mass destruction -- and that, once bush actually went to war, he became immediately opposed: from that point on, i was in the position of making the case that it was a big, big mistake.\n\nfacts first: as fact checkers have repeatedly noted, biden did not oppose the war in iraq from the point it started in march 2003. he did begin calling as fact checkers have repeatedly noted, biden did not oppose the war in iraq from the point it started in march 2003. he did begin calling his 2002 vote a mistake in 2005 , two years into the war, but he was a vocal public supporter of the war in 2003 and 2004. and he made clear in 2002 and 2003, both before and after the war started, that he had known he was voting to authorize a possible war, not only to try to get inspectors into iraq.\n\ncnn's facts first team has debunked various versions of biden's claim that he opposed the war from the moment it started. read longer articles on that here here and here\n\nhere are a few representative biden quotes. in a february 2003 speech in delaware, he said , let everyone here be absolutely clear: i supported the resolution to go to war. i am not opposed to war to remove weapons of mass destruction from iraq. i am not opposed to war to remove saddam from those weapons if it comes to that.\n\nit's true that biden criticized bush's approach to diplomacy in the lead-up to the war, warned in the lead-up to the war that bush was not being honest about how hard the war would be, and he criticized bush's handling of the war from its first weeks on. but biden made clear that he supported the war despite that criticism.\n\nin a july 2003 speech at the brookings institution, biden said: nine months ago, i voted with my colleagues to give the president of the united states of america the authority to use force and i would vote that way again today. it was the right vote then and would be a correct vote today.\n\nduring the debate on tuesday, biden also offered a confusing timeline of his positions on the war, saying, i said 13 years ago it was a mistake to give the president the authority to go to war if, in fact, he couldn't get inspectors into iraq to stop -- what thought to be -- the attempt to get a nuclear weapon. it was a mistake. and i acknowledged that.\n\nwhen biden said 13 years ago, he appeared to be referring to how, in 2006 and 2007, he was calling his 2002 vote a mistake. the vote itself was more than 17 years ago.\n\n- daniel dale and nate mcdermott\n\nbiden on threat to us embassies\n\nbiden said that president donald trump flat-out lied when he claimed the us killed iran's top military general because he was targeting four us embassies.\n\nquite frankly, i think he's flat-out lied about saying that the reason he went after -- the reason he made the strike was because our embassies were about to be bombed, biden said.\n\nfacts first: trump has yet to provide evidence backing up his claim that iranian gen. qasem soleimani was actively planning new attacks against four us embassies and top administration officials have struggled to defend the president's comments. but there is no way to know if trump flat-out lied without seeing the underlying intelligence, which remains classified.\n\ntrump claimed at an ohio rally last week that soleimani was actively planning new attacks. he later told fox news, i believe it probably would've been four embassies, naming baghdad as one.\n\nsenior administration officials have repeatedly pointed to danger facing us embassies in the middle east.\n\ndefense secretary mark esper said this past weekend he didn't see a specific threat against four embassies in the intelligence.\n\nwhat the president said with regard to the four embassies is what i believe as well. he said that he believed that they probably, that they could have been targeting the embassies in the region, esper added.\n\nsimilarly, trump's national security adviser robert o'brien said in an interview on sunday with abc's this week that it was unclear whether embassies or us military bases would be targeted, but insisted trump's claim about four embassies being threatened was consistent with the intelligence.\n\nciting two state department officials, cnn reported on monday that state department officials involved in us embassy security were not made aware of imminent threats to four specific us embassies and didn't issue warnings about specific dangers to any us embassy before the administration targeted soleimani.\n\nthe state department sent a global warning to all us embassies before the strike occurred, a senior state department official said and the department spokesperson confirmed, but it was not directed at specific embassies and did not warn of an imminent attack.\n\n- zachary cohen\n\nthis is a breaking story and will be updated.

reversing guidelines put in place under former president barack obama, the trump administration is scaling back the use of fines against nursing homes that harm residents or place them in grave risk of injury.\n\nthe shift in the medicare program's penalty protocols was requested by the nursing home industry. the american health care association, the industry's main trade group, has complained that under obama inspectors focused excessively on catching wrongdoing rather than helping nursing homes improve.\n\nit is critical that we have relief, mark parkinson, the group's president, wrote in a letter to then-president-elect donald trump in december 2016.\n\nsince 2013, nearly 6,500 nursing homes — 4 out of every 10 — have been cited at least once for a serious violation, federal records show. medicare has fined two-thirds of those homes. common citations include failing to protect residents from avoidable accidents, neglect, mistreatment and bedsores.\n\nthe new guidelines discourage regulators from levying fines in some situations, even when they have resulted in a resident's death. the guidelines will also probably result in lower fines for many facilities.\n\nthe change in policy aligns with trump's promise to reduce bureaucracy, regulation and government intervention in business.\n\ndr. kate goodrich, director of clinical standards and quality at the centers for medicare & medicaid services (cms), said in a statement that unnecessary regulation was the main concern that health care providers raised with officials.\n\nrelated: rising obamacare costs frighten some early retirees\n\nrather than spending quality time with their patients, the providers are spending time complying with regulations that get in the way of caring for their patients and doesn't increase the quality of care they provide, goodrich said.\n\nbut advocates for nursing home residents say the revised penalties are weakening a valuable patient safety tool.\n\nthey've pretty much emasculated enforcement, which was already weak, said toby edelman, a senior attorney at the center for medicare advocacy.\n\nmedicare has different ways of applying penalties. it can impose a specific fine for a particular violation. it can assess a fine for each day that a nursing home was in violation. or it can deny payments for new admissions.\n\nthe average fine in recent years has been $33,453, but 531 nursing homes amassed combined federal fines above $100,000, records show. in 2016, congress increased the fines to factor in several years of inflation that had not been accounted for previously.\n\nthe new rules have been instituted gradually throughout the year.\n\nin october, cms discouraged its regional offices from levying fines, even in the most serious health violations, if the error was a one-time mistake. the centers said that intentional disregard for residents' health and safety or systemic errors should still merit fines.\n\na july memo from cms discouraged the directors of state agencies that survey nursing homes from issuing daily fines for violations that began before an inspection, favoring one-time fines instead. daily fines remain the recommended approach for major violations discovered during an inspection.\n\ndr. david gifford, the american health care association's senior vice president for quality, said daily fines were intended to prompt quick remedies but were pointless when applied to past errors that had already been fixed by the time inspectors discovered them.\n\nwhat was happening is you were seeing massive fines accumulating because they were applying them on a per-day basis retrospectively, gifford said.\n\nrelated: should your doctor offer a money-back guarantee?\n\nbut the change means that some nursing homes could be sheltered from fines above the maximum per-instance fine of $20,965, even for egregious mistakes.\n\nin september 2016, for instance, health inspectors faulted lincoln manor, a nursing home in decatur, illinois, for failing to monitor and treat the wound of a patient whose implanted pain-medication pump gradually slipped over eight days through a ruptured suture and protruded from her abdomen. the patient died.\n\ncms fined lincoln manor $282,954, including $10,091 a day for 28 days, from the time the nursing home noticed the problem with the wound until supervisors had retrained nurses to avoid similar errors. an administrative law judge called the penalties quite modest given the appalling care.\n\nthe fines were issued before the new guidelines took effect; if the agency had issued a one-time fine, the maximum would have been less than $21,000.\n\nlincoln manor closed in september. its owner could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer did not respond to an interview request.\n\nadvocates for nursing home residents say that relaxing penalties threatens to undo progress at deterring wrongdoing. janet wells, a consultant for california advocates for nursing home reform, said the changes come as some egregious violations and injuries to residents are being penalized — finally — at a level that gets the industry's attention and isn't just the cost of doing business.\n\nin november, the trump administration exempted nursing homes that violate eight new safety rules from penalties for 18 months. homes must still follow the rules, which are intended, among other things, to reduce the overuse of psychotropic drugs and to ensure that every home has adequate resources to assist residents with major psychological problems.\n\nrodney whitlock, a health policy consultant and former republican senate staffer, said health inspectors are out there looking for opportunities to show that the nursing homes are not living up to some extremely tight standards. he said while the motivation for tough regulation was understandable, the fines don't make it easier to hire people and doesn't make it easier to stay in business.\n\nin june, cms rescinded another obama administration action that banned nursing homes from preemptively requiring residents to submit to arbitration to settle disputes rather than going to court.\n\nwe publish nearly 11,000 pages of regulation every year, the agency's administrator, seema verma, said in a speech in october. that paperwork is taking doctors away from what matters most: patients.\n\nrelated: for millions of insured americans, state health laws don't apply\n\njanine finck-boyle, director of health regulations and policy at leadingage, a group of nonprofit nursing homes and other entities that care for older people, said the group's members had been struggling to cope with regulations.\n\nif you're a 50-bed rural facility out west or in the dakotas, she said, you don't have the resources to get everything done from a to z.\n\nkaiser health news, a nonprofit health newsroom whose stories appear in news outlets nationwide, is an editorially independent part of the kaiser family foundation.

sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. we're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from cnn and other outlets.\n\n(cnn) everything changed this week. the response to the worldwide spread of the covid-19 coronavirus upended all of our lives.\n\nworkplaces shut down. schools were closed. major league sports suspended their seasons. airlines cut their flight schedules. hospitals began preparing for a predicted surge of patients. and on friday, president donald trump declared a national emergency.\n\ninfectious disease expert, who warned in 2005 that time is running out to prepare for the next pandemic, said in a conversation withthat america faces a huge challenge:  we are worse off today than we were in 2017 because the health care system is stretched thinner now than ever. there is no excess capacity. and public health funding has been cut under this administration.\n\nsocial distancing is the new catchphrase for how we are advised to behave. by all accounts, staying away from other people is the best tool everyday people have to flatten the rising curve of contagion and lessen the potential impact on hospitals and caregivers.\n\nit's also a struggle for humans, who naturally depend on dozens of everyday social interactions. blaise pascal, the french thinker, mordantly captured the essence of our lives as social creatures 350 years ago : all of humanity's problems stem from man's inability to sit quietly in a room alone.\n\nthis is deadly serious, warned eli pariser. since older people are more susceptible to serious complications — and worse -- from the virus, members of the boomer generation had better pay attention, he wrote.\n\nreduce your social contact as much as possible , for everything that's not an emergency. cancel bowling, singing group, yoga, your book club, your other book club, that book club you've stopped going to anyway, and beers at the bar. if you go to church, skip that for now and pray at home. get vaccinated for flu and pneumonia. wash your hands and don't touch your face.\n\nkatie hawkins-gaar is worried about her 65-year-old mom, who will have to curtail an active life of volunteering at a local school and helping at church. these activities provide purpose and structure to her day, she wrote. without them, it's easy to feel lost and lonely.\n\nbut as isolating as social distancing is, it's also selfless, she added. remember that following guidance and isolating is ultimately a socially generous act, a gesture of community. her mother is finding ways to cope:

more americans are finding work. that's great news, and stocks soared wednesday morning, thanks to it. but the federal reserve threw some cold water on the bulls by the end of the day.\n\nthe dow surged nearly 200 points wednesday after payroll processor adp issued a strong jobs report about the private sector. that's raising hopes that the official government figures that will come out friday morning will also show healthy job gains.\n\nbut the market pulled back and gave up nearly all of its gains by the end of the day after minutes from the federal reserve showed that some members of the central bank felt that stocks were quite high.\n\nstill, more jobs gains could help the market. and adp said that 263,000 jobs were added in march, well ahead of forecasts for about 175,000.\n\nboth adp and the government reported solid jobs gains for february. so investors appear to be banking that the momentum in the labor market will continue.\n\ndespite wednesday's topsy-turvy trading, the market appears to be back on solid footing after a recent dip following president trump's failure to push forward on a deal to repeal and replace obamacare.\n\nbut investors have expressed hope that trump will be able to get a tax reform plan approved and possibly a big economic stimulus plan aimed at rebuilding roads, bridges and other infrastructure.\n\nrelated: jamie dimon compares trump to an airline pilot. you have to root for him\n\nbank stocks rallied early wednesday as well, after trump reiterated plans tuesday to try to undo parts of the dodd-frank financial reform law.\n\njpmorgan chase (jpm) ceo jamie dimon also said in his annual shareholder letter tuesday that regulations are holding the economy back.\n\nrelated: big oil could be ready for a big comeback\n\nthe recent stock rally has helped push tech stocks like apple (aapl), amazon (amzn) and microsoft (msft) to all-time highs. the nasdaq, which is home to these three as well as facebook (fb) and google parent alphabet (googl), again hit a new record earlier wednesday.\n\nthe nasdaq is now up almost 10% so far this year and is approaching the 6,000 milestone.\n\nand cnnmoney's fear & greed index, which measures seven indicators of market sentiment, has bounced back from the fear levels that it hit just a week ago.\n\nit's now in neutral mode and has inched closer to greed. a great jobs number friday might push the index back to greed -- and lift stocks even higher.\n\nbut a solid jobs report might also make the fed more likely to step up its pace of rate hikes. and wall street would not like that.
as it looks increasingly likely that former president trump's senate impeachment trial will end in acquittal, many democrats are hoping for a swift trial as short as a matter of days — and are ready to move on key items of president biden's agenda, starting with delivering a $1.9 trillion covid relief package.\n\ni think that there should be a trial and it can be relatively expeditious, a matter of days, not weeks, said sen. richard blumenthal, democrat from connecticut to cnn's jim sciutto on thursday.\n\ndemocrats are sensitive to ensuring trump has a full trial with clear evidence. but they worry a long trial will compete for floor time with biden's long list of legislative priorities — like his large covid relief package — and getting his cabinet and other top government officials confirmed.\n\ndemocrats are also arguing that because there is only one article of impeachment — incitement of insurrection — and lawmakers all witnessed the events firsthand, the proceedings should be able to move quickly.\n\nnew jersey democratic sen. bob menendez said i don't think based upon the limited nature of the impeachment article that it should take anywhere near the last impeachment (trial) — which took almost three weeks.\n\nthis is a much less complicated set of facts than when we were dealing with ukraine, added democratic sen. chris murphy, referring to trump's first senate impeachment trial where he was charged with two articles of impeachment, one for pressuring ukrainian officials to investigate his political rival, at the time, biden.\n\nit's not yet clear how long trump's impeachment trial will last — and the length will depend, in part, on how long house impeachment managers take to present their case, how long trump's defense team takes to respond, and when senators are ready to vote on a final judgement.\n\nthe house has to make a decision about how much time it's gonna take and what evidence it wants to put forward and trump's legal team has to get at least equal time, and probably more so that the fairness of the proceeding's assured, sen. sheldon whitehouse, democrat from rhode island, told reporters on wednesday.\n\nnow that democrats have won the presidency, house and senate, they're anxious to start moving on biden's $1.9 trillion relief legislation after settling for a smaller stimulus package in december, which democratic leaders said was just a start.\n\nto do a trial knowing you'll get 55 votes at the max, seems to me to be not the right prioritization of our time right now. obviously we do a trial, maybe we can do it fast, but my top priority is covid relief... and getting the biden cabinet approved, said virginia democratic sen. tim kaine.\n\ni would hope that we deal with that as quickly as possible to start addressing the needs of working families, said vermont independent sen. bernie sanders on wednesday.\n\nsen. brian schatz, democrat from hawaii, said thursday there's no reason trump's trial should take weeks when we don't even have a full complement of a biden cabinet nominees who have been confirmed.\n\nmany democrats also argue since the senators themselves were witnesses to the attack — there may not be a need to drag out the trial longer than a few days or a week.\n\nwhitehouse also speculated wednesday that perhaps it'll be in trump's best interest, as well, to have a quick trial.\n\nit may very well be perceived by trump's team and to be in his interest to minimize, minimize, minimize, rather than draw him out and continue the emphasis on this sort of episode, he added.\n\nnumerous democrats and republicans alike have pointed to the vote on kentucky republican sen. rand paul's point of order to vote on the constitutionality of trump's impeachment trial on tuesday as an indicator for how the trial's final vote will likely land. only five republicans joined all democrats to kill paul's motion and there is no sense that anywhere close to 17 republicans could get to yes at this point.

are almost completely redacted.\n\n\n\nnow, flynn also cooperated with the special counsel's investigation into links or coordination between the russian government and members of the trump campaign,

are big one-day moves. and 799 points, that sounds really scary. in point terms, it was the fourth largest drop in history. in percentage terms, that's 3.1 percent. i mean, certainly, a bad day but ranks as the 329th worst day ever percentage-wise.\n\n\n\nso, put that in perspective. we have seen far worse days. two things took stocks down. first, the realization of the trade war with china is not over. there's a mountain of hard work to do.\n\n\n\nand the president's boasts of progress, they weren't matched by the chinese rhetoric. the chinese haven't acknowledged there's a 90-day negotiation period underway. stock market losses accelerated when trump called himself tariff man in a tweet storm. markets did not like that.\n\n\n\nsecond, there's a technical move in the bond market in the past signaled a slowing economy or recession, it's called an inverted yield curve. that scared the stock market, too.\n\n\n\nperspective here. excuse me, stocks are still higher for the year. the dow is up 3.5 percent. the s&p 500 up almost 3 percent. the nasdaq composite up more than 6 percent for the year. so, still higher on a year, but it's been a volatile, volatile past couple

reaction here?\n\n\n\nsam kiley, cnn senior international correspondent: well, there has been, whether directly to this, it's difficult to say, but the turks announced that they would like -- they are going to issue arrest warrants for the former deputy head of intelligence, general asiri and mohammed bin salman's right-hand man in the palace, particularly when it comes to media issues, saud qahtani, both relieved of their positions but neither of whom in the saudi investigation have been accused or charged. unlike a number of others who have been and, indeed, the saudi prosecutor has said that they could face the death penalty for the alleged murder of jamal khashoggi.\n\n\n\non top of that, the turks are also saying why not extradite all of the accused to turkey to face the music there, face an open trial, and have this whole saga put to bed. of course, that does not and would not solve the riddle, which certainly as far as those senators are concerned, the cia, has satisfied them. the riddle of who gave the order. and that order as far as they're concerned for the murder of jamal khashoggi has been given by none other than the crown prince, coming at a very difficult time for saudi arabia as they embark on peace talks over the yemen.\n\n\n\nbriggs: significant pushback from the senators. you can't help but wonder if more calls for investigation from house democrats

(cnn) confirmation duels over joe biden's cabinet picks have suddenly turned nasty, ringing alarm bells about the cliffhanger nature of a 50-50 senate and bitter fights to come over the president's ambitious agenda.\n\ngrowing intrigue over a trio of controversial presidential picks is also underscoring the power of individual senators such as democrat joe manchin of west virginia and republican lisa murkowski of alaska, when the partisan balance is so evenly divided.\n\nwhile biden has seen blue-chip national security selections such as antony blinken as secretary of state and lloyd austin at the pentagon installed, the focus on nominees whose portfolios touch on some of the most sensitive domestic political issues is bringing the confirmation process to a contentious crescendo.\n\nthe nomination of neera tanden , biden's pick to lead the office of management and budget, is in deep peril after manchin jumped ship and a string of republicans signaled they couldn't support her.\n\nanother bruising hearing is looming on tuesday, for interior secretary nominee deb haaland , whose opposition to fossil fuels has gop members branding her as extreme, in a showdown that could also prove uncomfortable for moderate democrats.\n\nand xavier becerra , chosen by the president to lead the department of health and human services, has emerged as a culture war lightning rod over his stance on abortion and obamacare, a perennial fault line between republicans and democrats.\n\nit's not at all unusual for new presidents to run into trouble with some nominees -- or even to see several potential cabinet members fall. blocking a pick is one easy way for senators to flex their power and signal to a new white house that they can't be taken for granted. and the policy clashes clouding the confirmation hopes of candidates such as haaland and tanden are quite predictable, since they mirror the chasms between the parties.\n\nbut when a president has a reasonable governing majority in the senate, confirmations become easier. if democrats had a handful of seats to spare, for instance, a senator such as manchin, who must constantly judge the winds in his ultra-conservative state of west virginia, could be given a pass.\n\nbut when nominations depend on a party-line vote and a tiebreaker cast by vice president kamala harris, democratic leaders can't offer any political cover -- at least without some defections from gop ranks.\n\nfor now, the problem concerns individual cabinet nominees -- whose defeat would sting for biden and dent the bodywork of his governing machine. but in months to come, when it comes to sweeping and electorally radioactive issues such as climate change and immigration, his entire presidency will be on the line.\n\nwhile the situation is fraught now, it is not out of the question that an illness, incapacitation or even death among elderly senators could erase his governing majority for good.\n\na nomination on the brink\n\ntanden's struggles are characteristic of nominees who have issues stemming from their own political vulnerabilities but who also fall victim to wider political forces beyond their individual fates.\n\nstill, tanden, the president of the liberal think tank center for american progress, is in the slightly unique position of seeing her support fray on the right and the left -- a scenario that led some observers to register surprise when she was nominated.\n\nrepublican senators profess they are offended over some of her now-deleted tweets that blasted the gop and individual senators who she now needs to vote for her. of course, it's a little rich for republicans to complain about anyone's tweets after spending four years enabling a president whose social media vitriol left tanden in the dust. and then there is the question of whether tanden, a prominent female political figure born to indian immigrant parents, is a victim of prejudicial double standards.\n\nstill, hypocrisy is the grease that often makes the wheels go 'round in the senate. and tanden also has lukewarm support from her own side. she was forced to try to make up with sen. bernie sanders, a vermont independent who caucuses with democrats, who now chairs the budget committee and would be her principal contact. sanders' supporters accused tanden of being among democratic elites who they believe stacked the party's nominating race against him and in favor of former secretary of state hillary clinton in 2016. during her confirmation hearing, tanden had to apologize for what sanders complained were her vicious attacks on progressives.\n\ngiven her always-questionable prospects, there was not much incentive for a senator such as manchin to support her. the west virginian has backed the president's nominees who have come up for full votes so far. and he voted to convict former president donald trump in his senate impeachment trial -- in what was an unpleasant choice since his home state overwhelmingly supports the ex-president.\n\nso to safeguard his brand as a relatively independent voice, and to avoid being tarred as a rubber stamp for biden, manchin probably needed to make a stand somewhere. he explained that he could not support tanden because she represented the kind of divisive politics that biden wants to purge from washington.\n\ni don't know her, probably a very, very good person, just basically a little bit toxic right now, manchin told reporters on capitol hill on monday.\n\nthe senator from west virginia is also emerging at a pivot point of the battle to pass biden's $1.9 trillion covid relief bill, which all republicans are likely to oppose. he said monday that he would seek to amend the legislation to set a federal hourly minimum wage at $11 over two years, instead of the current democratic proposal for a hike to $15 over five years.\n\nonce manchin cut tanden loose, and after a string of republicans -- including sens. mitt romney of utah, susan collins of maine and rob portman of ohio -- followed suit, her prospects of confirmation became dire indeed, despite the white house insisting that it was standing by the pick monday.\n\nthey're going to have to pull her, one senior democratic senator told cnn's manu raju. tanden's thin hopes late monday probably relied on murkowski, who has yet to say how she will vote.\n\nthe alaska republican is an independent voice -- and she voted to convict trump in his second impeachment trial. but it's hard to see how she would have an incentive to rescue an already deeply embattled democratic cabinet nominee, especially with her own reelection race looming next year.\n\nproxy battle over climate change\n\nthe haaland nomination differs from the tanden case since the house member from new mexico is highly popular among most democrats. her nomination is historic since she would be the first native american cabinet member. she would also lead the interior department, an agency with a long record of discrimination against her community.\n\ndemocrats and white house officials told cnn on monday that they anticipate a tense few hours when haaland appears before the energy and natural resources committee on tuesday.\n\nand guess who could be the key senate voice on the panel and in the full senate on haaland's prospects? manchin again, who chairs the committee and has not yet committed to supporting her nomination.\n\nwe're very open to hearing her, and hopefully she'll have a good hearing, manchin, a longtime supporter of fossil fuel industries in his home state, said monday.\n\nhaaland is at risk of becoming the focal point of republican attacks on biden's recommitment of the united states to fighting global warming -- which saw him quickly rejoin the paris climate accord after taking office.\n\nin the past, haaland has opposed the issuing of new oil and gas drilling leases on federal land and has expressed support for a ban on fracking, a method of extracting natural gas. she has also supported the green new deal, the ambitious climate plan pushed by democratic rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york -- though not the biden administration.\n\nthe green new deal has been the target of republican attacks claiming its restrictions on fossil fuels would destroy the us economy. it's likely tuesday's hearing will turn into a preview of the bitter partisan battles likely to unfold when biden sends a climate bill to capitol hill.\n\na hearing -- at last\n\nnot all biden's nominees slipped into trouble on monday.\n\nthe pick who waited longest to get a confirmation hearing -- nearly five years, to be exact -- is attorney general nominee merrick garland . the former dc circuit court of appeals chief judge was nominated by president barack obama to be a supreme court justice but was blocked for months by senate then-majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-kentucky, in a power play that paved the way for the current conservative majority on the court.\n\nironically, the reputation for moderation and steady temperament that obama thought might ease garland's way through a republican-led senate to the high court helped him on monday in his confirmation hearing.\n\narch-trump supporter republican sen. lindsey graham of south carolina said monday that he would most likely support the nomination.

superstar saturated the internet, and a rolling stone cover story described spears as being a toy we'd all grown tired of playing with, a perfectly proportioned twenty-six-year-old porcelain doll with a nasty weave. long after the episode had passed, the meme if britney can survive 2007, you can handle today remained synonymous with the worst, most embarrassing kind of breakdown.\n\nphoto: holly thomas holly thomas\n\nafter tmz broke the news last week that spears had checked herself into a mental health facility, the coverage, though extensive, was comparatively muted. the consensus (rightly) seemed to be that spears, in the face of extreme stress, had done the responsible thing by seeking help. many other celebrities expressed their support, and voiced to their fans the importance of getting the care you need. spears, who announced earlier this year that she was taking some time out of the limelight to focus on her family, posted on her instagram page last week: we all need to take time for a little 'me' time.\n\nbut for the non-rich and famous, seeking help for mental health issues in america is often fraught with complications which make a mockery of well-meant encouragement.\n\naccording to new analysis of 300 emergency rooms published this week in jama pediatrics and reported by cnn, the number of children aged 5-18 who arrived with suicidal thoughts and suicide attempts doubled from 580,000 to 1.12 million between 2007 and 2015. the average age of those evaluated was 13, and 43% of the children visiting were aged between 5 and 11. while previously suicidal behavior made up 2% of pediatric emergency room visits, it now accounts for 3.5%.\n\nit's not just kids who are struggling. last year the centers for disease control and prevention reported that suicide among adults has risen in nearly every state over the last 20 years, in half by as much as 30%. depression and prior suicide attempts represent significant risk factors for suicide.\n\nthis is an emergency, but too often, the support millions of americans need is not available. and, as always, the poorest are hardest hit.\n\nafter the financial crisis in 2008, states cut mental health spending by billions of dollars. in 2014, a study published in jama psychiatry found that therapists were the least likely medical providers to accept insurance. the percentage that did was significantly lower than physicians in other specialties like cardiology or dermatology. therapy can cost hundreds of dollars per session, and is especially expensive in cities, where rates of depression are higher. most of the united states faces a severe shortage of practicing child and adolescent psychiatrists, with fewer than 17 providers available per 100,000 children, according to data from the american academy of child and adolescent psychiatry.\n\neven though i'm able to afford sessions out of pocket now, they're extremely expensive when i have to do that and a lot of the places that i need to go to don't accept my insurance, cori siren, an entertainer and jewelry maker from indiana told me. so, i'm left going to awful facilities that do accept my insurance and something always gets messed up.\n\nregardless of whether you have medical insurance or not, finding support can be a mission unto itself, and siren's story echoes others' who struggle to find timely access to appropriate care. this problem, a longstanding issue, has only grown worse over the course of the trump administration so far.\n\nin 2017, the trump administration froze a federal database which had helped direct people to services and interventions to treat mental health disorders and substance abuse. the 2019 fiscal year budget requested $68.4 billion for the department of health and human services – a 21% decrease from the budget enacted in 2017.\n\nin march, trump supported a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the affordable care act. this is the latest in a series of attacks, with the administration having already given states powers to weaken obamacare last october. about 30 million people covered would lose their health insurance if the affordable care act was repealed without a replacement plan, according to the economic policy institute. the expansion of medicaid under obamacare dramatically increased access to care for conditions such as substance addiction in the most-affected states.\n\nthe stress of seeking out evasive health care can have an impact over generations. watching parents struggle with bills, drown in forms and sink into debt can put children off engaging with an unwelcoming system in their own adulthood, and exacerbate the effects of the original condition. when you have a mental illness, even the most perfunctory daily tasks can feel like mountains to climb, let alone making important phone calls or filling out complex paperwork.\n\nthough mental illness remains stigmatized, and to hugely varying degrees across race and wealth status, the conversation around it has evolved. the media is moving away from some of the derogatory language it used so thoughtlessly even a few years ago. but for those not wealthy enough to check into rehab facilities or access even basic care, the right words are far from enough to tackle a growing and dangerous problem.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nwhile there is undoubtedly value in seeing a beloved celebrity handle mental health issues as judiciously as britney spears has in recent weeks, the real lesson we should take is that against all sense and justice, mental health care in america remains for too many (and even more if the trump administration has its way on healthcare policy) the domain of the privileged. until that is addressed, for many, urges to seek help will remain a hollow echo.

howard schultz says he believes there is something deeply wrong with the american health care system.\n\nit is in a crisis on many levels, he said on tuesday night.\n\nhe supports obamacare, but thinks it needs to be fixed.\n\nbut asked what, specifically, he would do, schultz again lacked much detail in his answers.\n\ni think everyone in america, every person, deserves to have the right for affordable care. every person, he declared -- the first of his three principles on the issue.\n\nthe second: there needs to be competition in the system and what i mean that is competition so that the american people can get access to prescription drugs at lower prices, schultz said, because right now the government is not allowed, under a federal law, to negotiate with (pharmaceutical companies).\n\nthe third principle echoed musings familiar from president donald trump's own statements in the past: a potential plan to change the rules governing how and where insurance companies sell their plans.\n\nwhen harlow pressed him for details on the way he would solve these problems -- how -- the question is how? -- schultz returned to speaking about prescription drug pricing.\n\nmostly, though, he again took the opportunity to rail at both parties: republicans, he said, had offered no alternative to obamacare. progressive democrats who are for pushing medicare for all, schultz claimed, had not accurately assessed the potential downside.\n\nthat would disrupt the entire system and it would cost 32 trillion dollars, he said. the price tag is about right, but his argument didn't take into account the money americans would, under the plan, save by having expenses like co-pays and deductibles wiped out.

he was firing dennis rodman on celebrity apprentice.\n\n\n\nrubio: if he builds the wall the way he built trump towers, he'll be using illegal immigrant labor to do it.\n\n\n\nserfaty: ... to u.s. trade relations with china and mexico...\n\n\n\nrubio: the second thing about the trade war, i don't understand, because your ties and the clothes you make is made in mexico and in china. so you're going to be starting a trade war against your own ties and clothing.\n\n\n\ntrump: they devalue their currency to such an extent that our businesses cannot compete with them. our workers lose their jobs. you don't know anything about it, because you're...\n\n\n\nrubio: well, i don't know anything about bankrupting poor people.\n\n\n\nyou lied about the polish workers.\n\n\n\ntrump: yes, yes, yes. thirty-eight years ago. thirty-eight years ago.\n\n\n\nrubio: oh, ok. he lied 38 years ago. all right. i guess there's a statute of limitations on lies.\n\n\n\nserfaty: ... to obamacare...\n\n\n\ntrump: you'll have different plans. you'll have competition. i have so many different plans.\n\n\n\nrubio: now he's repeating himself.\n\n\n\ntrump: no, no, no. i watched him repeat himself five times four weeks ago. and i'm going to tell you...\n\n\n\nrubio: i heard you repeat yourself five minutes ago.\n\n\n\ntrump: it was a meltdown. i watched it. i watched him melt down on the stage like i've never seen anybody. i thought he came out of the swimming pool.\n\n\n\nrubio: i said...\n\n\n\nunidentified female: let's talk about your plan.\n\n\n\nrubio: every night he says five things: everyone's dumb. he's going to make america great again. we're going to win, win, win. he's winning in the polls, and the line's around the street.\n\n\n\nserfaty: ... and hillary clinton...\n\n\n\ntrump: first of all, talking about the polls, i'm beating him awfully badly in the polls.\n\n\n\ncruz: you're not beating hillary.\n\n\n\ntrump: now, if i can't -- hey, if i can't beat her, you're really going to get killed.\n\n\n\nso let me ask you this, because you're really getting beaten badly. i know you're embarrassed; i know you're embarrassed. but keep fighting, keep swinging. swing for the fences.\n\n\n\nserfaty: trump eventually lashing out at both of the freshmen senators at the same time.\n\n\n\ntrump: you are all talk and no action. what i see up here -- i mean, first of all, this guy's a joke artist and this guy's a liar. you have a combination of factors. he can't do it for the obvious reason, and he can't do it, because he doesn't know how to tell the truth. i know politicians, believe it or not, better than you do, and it's not good.\n\n\n\ncruz: i believe it. i believe you know politicians much better than i do because for 40 years you've been funding liberal democratic politicians. and by the way...\n\n\n\n[07:05:08] trump: i funded you, too. gave you a check.\n\n\n\ncruz: donald, relax.\n\n\n\ntrump: i'm relaxed. you're the basket case. go ahead, go ahead. don't get nervous.\n\n\n\n(end videotape)\n\n\n\nserfaty: now, after all that, of course, the dust still settling here this morning, but the big question going forward is how will all of this change the dynamic of the race going forward. of course, chris, this is only four days before super tuesday.\n\n\n\ncuomo: i'll tell you what. it was real high political theater going on, on that debate stage last night. at times i felt like i didn't know if i was watching a debate or saturday night live. but i'll tell you, it certainly had an impact.\n\n\n\nlet's discuss how. we have with david gregory, noted journalist of meet the press fame; and michael smerconish, cnn familia and host of smerconish, as well as a cnn political commentator.\n\n\n\nso what did you see there last night? i'll tell you one thing. do you agree with me that i've never seen it like that before? that robust, that constant. that quick.\n\n\n\nmichael smerconish, cnn political commentator: i can't say it on cnn. it was a total s show. wasn't it?\n\n\n\ncuomo: vicente fox?\n\n\n\nsmerconish: i wonder if there was damage, though, to the brand long- term. remember, they limited. they tried to reign in these debates in that reince priebus autopsy, because there were some incidents in the last debate that they thought harmed the brand, long-term, of the party. regardless of who wins the nomination, do some of those perceptions linger and come back to harm whomever wins the nomination?\n\n\n\ncuomo: and yet, what was that a crucible of last night, david gregory, something you've talked about a lot. this crisis of confidence about who this party is, what that party is. you had that on fulsome, on full display last night. how do you think it mixed out?\n\n\n\ndavid gregory, former moderator, nbc's meet the press: you know, we can talk about the kinetics. we can talk about how robust it was. i agree with you. and from a debate performance point of view, you say, yes, rubio finally discovered google and finally discovered a way to attack donald trump, and so did ted cruz, and they got into it a little bit more.\n\n\n\ni'm not a prude about this. neither is michael. but i mean, this was a pitiful display of political discourse. it really was a new low for 2016 and i think the brand, i think the party has to deal with that because of the larger question, which is does it actually change anything?\n\n\n\nwhen you get beyond insults, the ultimate question is did they land some serious blows onto trump about his authenticity, whether he's a real conservative, whether you really know whenever he comes down on important issues and whether you can trust him. because does he tell the truth? will he follow through on certain positions? these are questions we simply don't know answers to with regard to his supporters.\n\n\n\ncuomo: david, i love you, brother, but your big intellect is getting in the way on this one. these are three guys who are battling it out for identity politics of what this party is and who they are and how they represented, and that's the way it gets settled.\n\n\n\nand i thought wolf did the right thing last night, letting them go at it.\n\n\n\nsmerconish: i agree with it. i agree with david.\n\n\n\ncuomo: but you're another big brain.\n\n\n\nsmerconish: not at all. but there's going to be a general election, right? i'm looking beyond what happened here in houston last night. i mean, marco rubio brought the heat last night. i don't think he's the beneficiary of anything that he did to bring trump down a couple of pegs.\n\n\n\ncuomo: they're second-guessing him. they're holding this meeting about a brokered convention. last night he went out there, and he answered the question to people.\n\n\n\nbut if you're a trump supporter who now has second thoughts. is he the guy you're going to, or is it ted cruz?\n\n\n\ncuomo: trump supporters -- i mean, isn't he over -- i'm not being facetious. isn't he over 75 percent full resolved with his support base? it's not about taking his people. it's about creating a base for himself.\n\n\n\nsmerconish: i think he was doing ted cruz's dirty work, is what i'm saying last night. i really think that it's probably too little too late for rubio.\n\n\n\ncuomo: david gregory, as a writer of things religious, did you feel any kind of connection with donald trump in the after-action interview when he said that he is getting audited by the irs because of his faith?\n\n\n\ngregory: no. i thought that was hyperbole in that interview that he did with you. i mean, i think, you know, that was kind of a short- handed way to say that, in his view, the irs has targeted conservatives. there has been, obviously, a lot of talk about tea party activists and others being targeted. no, i thought that was off-base.\n\n\n\nand by the way, i just want to go back to your point, because i'm really not that smart. and you know that? i understand identity politics, and i understand the kinetics on stage the stage last night. and that, by the way, is important, because the ability to show your supporters, to show donors, to show other people who might be wavering in this republican primary that you've about got some fight and you can take this guy on.\n\n\n\nthat's fine. but if you're a trump supporter and you want to get into the insult game, i still think that trump comes out on top on that, even if you look rattled at some point.\n\n\n\nthe point that smerconish made here, which i think is the right one here, which is if you're going to attack trump, you're already too late on this then. why did you wait until the tenth debate?\n\n\n\nand no. 2, you've got to have this as a sustained attack day after day after day in order to reach those persuadables, so i have no -- i have no complaint other than the candidates' behavior themselves and the way they talked to each other about the debate. i thought it was good that they were able to go after each other, because this is their debate, their chance to take each other on in the way that they see fit. whether the country thinks it's very palatable or not. the question is how do we gauge what impact it has? especially when it was this kind of two-on-one. and for me it's hard to gauge whether cruz benefits more than rubio.\n\n\n\ncuomo: well, look. of course, you're both making the right point, which is negative is supposed to be partnered with positive and you wind up showing the base that you have certain mettle but that you also have ideas to offer. and the proof is in john kasich last night, the governor of ohio, of course.\n\n\n\nduring the melee that was going on, he would interject every once in a while with really strong fundamental points about executive leadership and potential solutions to what the other guys were fighting about. what's the net-net on that, michael?\n\n\n\nsmerconish: well, i don't know that he's able to break out. i don't know that there really is a path. i think that he distinguishes himself by being on that stage and not participating in what was going on at the center of the stage.\n\n\n\nchris, i kept looking at bush 41 in the audience and thinking to myself, my god, what a contrast between the class and dignity, frankly, that he showed during his career.\n\n\n\ncuomo: and god bless him for being there.\n\n\n\nsmerconish: absolutely. and what was going on center stage.\n\n\n\ncuomo: and only kasich brought him up, showing a workable model of government. go ahead, david?\n\n\n\ngregory: can i just say on kasich, a positive and a negative? the positive answer on apple where he challenged president obama and said you've got a lead on this. bring the government and apple together and force a solution that balances these two concerns. a big negative for him: someone who wants to have more moderate\n\n\n\nsupport, wants to even be able to reach out to democrats, talking about the issue of same-sex marriage saying, listen, if you -- you have to be able to serve gays and lesbians if you make cupcakes and if -- you know, even if you're opposed to them, you can say a prayer for them and hoping they can change their behavior, talking about gays and lesbians being gay and lesbian because it's a choice, because of their behavior, i think that's going to be offend a lot of people.\n\n\n\ncuomo: well, nuance to people on questions of spirituality is not always a great way to go, certainly the primary. but i think it's worth -- do we have time to play the kasich argument against obama or should i just summarize it? all right. let's listen to it, because it was a really intelligent one. go ahead.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nkasich: the president of the united states should be convening a meeting, should have convened a meeting with apple and our security forces, and then you know what you do when you're the president? you lock the door, and you say, you're not coming out until you reach an agreement that both gives the security people what they need and protects the rights of americans. this is a failure of his leadership to get this done as an executive should be doing it.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncuomo: now, maybe too little too late, but i'll tell you something. i was raised by a governor, and i got one now as my best friend in my brother. that is what governors do. they do have the ability to get people in a room and lock the door and say, we're going to figure this out right now before the press gets to it. that was an interesting insight that no one else on that stage would make.\n\n\n\nsmerconish: i think the president, the current president, did bring them in and locked the door. but he wasn't able to get the deal done. i think that's what the tick tock shows. i was thinking as i watched kasich of what jeb bush initially said. you've got to be prepared to lose primaries to win a general.\n\n\n\ni still look at him and i'd say to myself that's the guy who's the strongest in a general election, whether he can survive, you know, this cattle call remains to be seen.\n\n\n\ndavid gregory, michael smerconish, thanks you very much for helping us understand what we all watched in awe -- alisyn.\n\n\n\ncamerota: absolutely. what a night.\n\n\n\nall right. well, one last full day now of campaigning before south carolina democrats head to the polls for saturday's primary. all polls point to a big win for hillary clinton and a boost heading into the super tuesday contest.\n\n\n\nbut bernie sanders insists he can make a big mark on super tuesday. cnn's joe johns is live in columbia, south carolina, for us. good morning, joe.\n\n\n\njoe johns, cnn correspondent: good morning, alisyn.\n\n\n\nhillary clinton's campaign spent the last 24 hours fighting on dual tracks for communications, firing out message against the republicans on everything from tax cuts to the state of the union.\n\n\n\nnow, meanwhile the one thing i think we can say that's going on here is they're trying to position her as a general election candidate. but on the ground in south carolina, it was all about the primary over the last 24 hours. the former secretary of state moving around south carolina with her husband, the former president. they're also going to be joined here by their daughter, chelsea clinton, later today.\n\n\n\nthis campaign is really trying to run up the vote to move into some more momentum as we get to super tuesday. one thing that has been dogging hillary clinton here in south carolina and elsewhere is bernie sanders' call for her to release transcripts of her wall street speeches. the new york times asking for her to do that.\n\n\n\nbernie sanders for his part has been moving across the midwest: illinois, ohio, and michigan, but will be back here in south carolina today.\n\n\n\nback to you.\n\n\n\ncamerota: ok, joe, thanks so much for the update on the democratic side.\n\n\n\nstay with cnn all day for the complete coverage of the south carolina democratic primary.\n\n\n\nwell, back to the debate, donald trump was the bull's-eye in cnn's gop debate last night. marco rubio and ted cruz hitting the republican front-runner hard. so how does donald trump think he did? trump's self-assessment next on new day.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\ncuomo: welcome back. this was the scene of the big gop debate. donald trump under attack from jump by both sides of him last night, senators rubio and cruz. they were seemingly united at points in their ambush of the republican front-runner. the sparring grew loud and proud.\n\n\n\n[07:20:02] so we grabbed donald trump right after the debate. that's a really important time frame before they get polished up by their advisers about what he thought took place on that stage, how he fared, and what was the real deal on his taxes. here's what he said.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\ntrump: they're politicians. they want to get elected, but they are doing badly. and i think cnn did a very good job, but i think they had a lot of focus on the three in the middle. and maybe that's the way it should have been. i don't know.\n\n\n\ncuomo: what did you think about that dynamic?\n\n\n\ntrump: i thought it was great. i thought it was exciting, and i thought it was a great.\n\n\n\ncuomo: what did you think of that dynamic of having to take both of them on?\n\n\n\ntrump: i felt it was fine. i've dealt with the toughest people over my lifetime and i've dealt with much tougher. i think that it was fine. i really enjoyed it. i enjoyed the debating process.\n\n\n\ncuomo: during that debate as it was going on, marco rubio started on his website selling watches, as a pretend gimmick to say that they were watches that, you know, would have been yours if you would have been selling, but they're just donations for him. it was a quick response during the actual debate. what do you make of the move?\n\n\n\ntrump: the problem with marco is he's a choke artist. he chokes. and he did it in front of chris christie. i've never seen anything like that. i was standing right next to him. i looked over and said, are you ok? i mean, he was -- it looked like he came out of a swimming pool. he was soaking wet. and he kept repeating himself, repeating himself.\n\n\n\ncuomo: he tried to use that on you tonight.\n\n\n\ntrump: no, no, but i didn't do it. repeating. i just say, hey. i just say what's needed. i didn't do that.\n\n\n\nbut he -- he really -- we can't have a choke artist. you know, one thing i've learned from sports, i was actually a very good athlete. when you're a choker, you're always a choker. we can't have that. we can't take any chances in this country.\n\n\n\ncuomo: how long, now that you're starting to get the votes in, and you're at the top, do you think that people should start thinking about leaving this race?\n\n\n\ntrump: i think so. but, you know, it's not for me to say. i would say that a few of them maybe should. and you know, marco, i'm 20 points up on him in florida. and with cruz, i'm even. it seems the last polls i'm even in texas and winning every other state.\n\n\n\nyes, i think so. i think it's going to be over fairly quickly, and i don't think there's going to be a convention.\n\n\n\ncuomo: it seemed like senator rubio was more intent on going after you directly tonight than even senator cruz. why do you think that was?\n\n\n\ntrump: i was a little surprised by it, but i liked it. i thought it was fine.\n\n\n\ncuomo: did he show you a toughness that you didn't see against christie?\n\n\n\ntrump: no, i think it was the same basic person. but he -- he's a meltdown guy. i mean, i'm looking at him, he's pouring sweat. i've never seen anything like it. i don't know what the problem is. but he's just pouring down sweat. we have to have somebody that doesn't sweat. i mean, we need somebody that, when they walk into putin's office or putin walks into our office or the chinese come to deal with us, that we know what they're doing. we want somebody that doesn't have whatever that is that he's got.\n\n\n\ncuomo: now online, there was an interesting observation. let me see if you share it, which is that sometimes you like to use tough language about people, certainly in tweets, as we know. tonight, they say you weren't doing it, that you were doubling down on your positions and trying to argue on a policy level more than a personal level. was that intentional?\n\n\n\ntrump: i think it was intentional, because i'm leading by so much. honestly it got me here. that attitude got me here. but now it's time, and i'm very focused on policy.\n\n\n\nlook, i'm somebody that went to the best college, and i got very good marks. policy is very easy. but when i started off with -- we had a total of 17 people. we're now down to five. that got me there. now i think i have a little bit of a different attitude.\n\n\n\ncuomo: do you think that the race is over for the nomination?\n\n\n\ntrump: no, i'd never say it's over. it's never over till it's over as our friend would say, right, yogi? but i think we're doing really well. i love that bloomberg poll. it did many of the southern states. and we're just leading by tremendous numbers.\n\n\n\ncuomo: they came at you tonight about something that's in the news right now that really is at your control, which is the tax returns. mitt romney during the debate was bringing it up again. you can show him in a second if you want to. why is trump delaying releasing?\n\n\n\ntrump: let me explain about mitt. mitt is a guy who was a horrible candidate. he lost a race that should have been won, and it should have been won easily. and i don't know what happened. he, like, disappeared the last two months.\n\n\n\nbut when mitt gave his tax returns, just so you understand, it was about six months from now in 2012. it was exactly september 21. and that's when he gave his tax return. we're in a different world.\n\n\n\nso, you know, mitt is just trying to remain relevant. nobody's talking to him much anymore. he got some publicity today. but the one problem i have is that i'm always audited by the irs, which i think is very unfair. i don't know, maybe because of religion, maybe because of something else, maybe because i'm doing this, although this is just recently.\n\n\n\ncuomo: what do you mean religion?\n\n\n\ntrump: well, because of the fact that i'm a strong christian, and i feel strongly about it. and maybe there's a bias.\n\n\n\ncuomo: do you think you're being audited for being a strong christian?\n\n\n\ntrump: you see what's happened. i mean, you have many religious groups that are complaining about that. they've been complaining about it for a long time.\n\n\n\ncuomo: what about the ones that aren't audited. this seems like an easy answer for you.\n\n\n\ntrump: no, i can't do that. i can't do that. we have to put it out there in a very unified way. they all relate to each other. i don't know if you saw the picture where i have almost a thousand.\n\n\n\ncuomo: big stacks of paper.\n\n\n\ntrump: the ones from previous relate to the ones later, and it doesn't make sense, unless they're already...\n\n\n\ncuomo: you know what you would do with this issue if somebody else had it. you'd say, what are you talking about? tax returns, just put them out. doesn't want to put them out.\n\n\n\ntrump: nobody that's under a regular audit -- i mean, it's just a regular audit. almost every year, i think for 12 years, 10 years, 12 years, i get audited. nobody would ever put out their returns that's under an audit.\n\n\n\n[07:25:11] it's very unfair that i'm audited all the time. by the way, i always pass the audit. i've always passed the audit.\n\n\n\ncuomo: excuse me. why wouldn't you put it out if you're being audited just so people would understand?\n\n\n\nof course, you wouldn't. your lawyers would never allow you to do that. it's a very simple audit. i think it perhaps will go fast and perhaps it won't. and when it's complete, you've got them. i love it. but i think until that audit is done, certainly you wouldn't do that.\n\n\n\ncuomo: have you heard anything from former mexican president vicente fox?\n\n\n\ntrump: well, i think he should apologize for his foul mouth. i think it's a disgusting thing to be saying, and i can tell you, i would not use that word. but if i did use that word, i probably wouldn't have even been allowed on the stage tonight.\n\n\n\ncuomo: you do understand there's a touch of irony in that, though? you're saying that someone...\n\n\n\ntrump: i don't know what the problem is, but i think he should apologize to a lot of people that heard that word. that was a very -- i heard t this afternoon. i couldn't believe it.\n\n\n\ncuomo: how do you feel after tonight?\n\n\n\ntrump: i feel a great. i mean, i think we're doing so well. i think the debate was really one of my best debates, considering the fact that i was being hit from all sides.\n\n\n\ncuomo: it's best to be tested, though.\n\n\n\ntrump: it was a good test. it was a really good test. i really liked it. i enjoyed it.\n\n\n\n(end videotape)\n\n\n\ncamerota: chris, fascinating interview there post-debate with donald trump. he said things that he didn't even say on the debate stage. now, the punditry that i'm reading this morning in the papers here, say that they believe that marco rubio won and not only was it his strongest. they say that it's, like, the strongest debate of any candidate in any debate thus far.\n\n\n\nhow -- what was the feeling in the room last night?\n\n\n\ncuomo: i'll tell you what. that crowd had a lot of energy going on, because it wasn't that big a crowd.\n\n\n\nnow, look. people who are going to spin it, you know, the pundits are in the business of having an opinion. they're in the business of keeping the race going. you know, you have to read all reviews through that light. this isn't like a car race where you can say objectively who won and who didn't.\n\n\n\ndid rubio discover a side of himself last night? it seemed that way. he was certainly different than he was when, you know, christie put him on his back. but what does that mean in terms of the net positive on it? does he wind up taking trump voters? i don't know. does he wind up strengthening a resolve of his own with all the skepticism around him? probably so.\n\n\n\ndid he wind up doing cruz's handiwork by going at trump, and therefore not being the positive force that he usually tries to be in these? so you have to look at it through the lens of what matters, and that gets very objective.\n\n\n\ncamerota: this morning marco rubio is continuing that line of attack on donald trump. he was calling him a con artist on another morning show. let me play that for you.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nrubio: a con artist is about to take over the republican party and the conservative movement. and we have to put a stop to it.\n\n\n\ndonald trump has portrayed himself now consistently as fighting for the working people. and he has a record of sticking it to working people for 35 years.\n\n\n\nif any other candidate in this race had his record, there would be non-stop reporting on it. but unfortunately, he's being pumped up because many in the media with a bias know that he'll be easy to beat in the general election. so we're going to put a stop to it now.\n\n\n\nthere's no way we're going to allow a con artist to take over the conservative movement, and donald trump is a con artist.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncamerota: it seems like marco rubio has found his voice and certainly found a phrase that he thinks resonates in con artist. and then, of course, trump calling rubio a choke artist. and the names are flying back and forth.\n\n\n\nchris, what did you think was an effective line of attack?\n\n\n\ncuomo: look, you always have to believe that people lose when the campaign is inherently negative and personal. my question to you is does it smack a little familiar for marco rubio to be discussing somebody as being pushed by the media as some type of alternative or something new? isn't that what he was benefiting from just a couple of weeks ago?\n\n\n\ncamerota: i don't know. to me, it sounds like a new -- it sounds to me like he's found his voice in being more aggressive against trump.\n\n\n\nnow i talked to his top adviser yesterday who said that he would be going against trump, and marco rubio fulfilled that promise, i would say, last night.\n\n\n\nbut chris, much more from you there in houston about the raucous night. so stick around if you would. we do want to get do some breaking news right now, because overnight there's been a terrible workplace shooting in rural kansas leaving three people dead, 14 others wounded.\n\n\n\ncnn's rosa flores is live at the scene in kansas. what have you learned?\n\n\n\nrosa flores, cnn correspondent: well, alisyn, good morning.\n\n\n\ni just spoke to the sheriff moments ago, and he tells me that they are still processing the scene. if you look closely behind me, you'll see some crime scene tape is still up. again, they're still processing. they have to interview between 150 and 200 people to try to figure out what the motive is.\n\n\n\nnow, the sheriff also tells me that they obtained a warrant for this subject's home and that they are working on exercising that warrant, trying to figure out if there are any clues inside his home.\n\n\n\n(begin videotape)\n\n\n\nflores (voice-over): breaking overnight, the gunman who stormed a lawn care manufacturing company in a small kansas town killing three people and wounding 14 others. sheriff t. walton, harvey county, kansas: law enforcement confronted\n\n\n\nthe shooter. gunfire was exchanged. law enforcement shot and killed the shooter.\n\n\n\nflores: identified by a co-worker as --
(cnn) senate democrats are staring down a massive undertaking as they plan to push ahead with reconciliation, a process that will be an early test of party unity even if it allows them to pass a $1.9 trillion covid relief proposal without any republican votes.\n\nthe house and senate could move as soon as next week on a budget resolution that gives committees instructions to begin work on the $1.9 trillion relief bill. while not every democrat has publicly voiced how they would vote on the resolution and the price tag of the bill is still up for debate, many have said they are comfortable taking that first step even if they have concerns about what will ultimately end up being included in a package.\n\ni would probably vote for it initially and then wait and see how the bill comes out, said sen. jon tester, a moderate democrat from montana.\n\nsen. joe manchin, a moderate democrat from west virginia who has expressed concerns about the $1.9 trillion price tag, wouldn't say if he'd back the budget resolution when repeatedly asked, saying, we're gonna try to make joe biden successful.\n\nrepublicans have publicly rejected the $1.9 trillion figure, but the white house hasn't backed off, signaling to democratic senators on a call thursday that they believe it's the right number.\n\ni think we would make a mistake to go too far below the mark that biden has set, sen. chris murphy, a democrat from connecticut, told cnn. it's a big number, but i think it is a big moment and i think we need to assume that this is our one chance to make the investments on covid and economic relief in 2021.\n\nschumer's challenge\n\nunderscoring the urgency is the reality for democrats that the economy is still struggling to reboot as covid continues to ravage the country. democrats are also cognizant of early mistakes in the obama administration when democrats spent months trying to win over republicans on health care only to ultimately move ahead on their own.\n\nasked whether biden officials brian deese, the director of the white house's national economic council, and jeff zients, the white house coronavirus coordinator, told democrats thursday to go ahead with budget reconciliation, sen. elizabeth warren said, they just want us to get this thing passed. they talked about the economic data, which are looking grimmer by the minute. the unemployment numbers are very worrisome as are the housing numbers.\n\nbut agreeing to get something passed and sorting out the details are two distinct steps. the complications will only intensify in the weeks ahead. once the budget passes, multiple committees in the house and senate will begin writing legislation that will force democrats to make tough decisions about where they want to go as a party -- not just on spending, but on issues like raising the minimum wage. while many democrats support a provision like raising the minimum wage to $15 in isolation, cramming it through using the budget reconciliation process has raised concern.\n\nwe are a big tent and that means that getting 50 votes on anything is not easy, murphy said. it's not possible to have a majority leader who has a better sense of where all the pieces need to be than schumer, but it is a challenge. nobody should take it for granted.\n\nschumer's challenge mirrors the one minority leader mitch mcconnell had in 2017. while senate republicans quickly passed a budget resolution that gave the committees instructions to repeal and replace obamacare, mcconnell never could get his members on the same page for a bill that could actually pass.\n\nit's very difficult -- we experienced this when republicans were in the majority -- very difficult to pass a budget. and so the process of getting to reconciliation when a party is doing it solo is a real challenge, said gop sen. jerry moran of kansas. so it would be a difficult scenario for the democrats to get to a point to use reconciliation for a covid-19 package.\n\nbill-writing process set for week of february 8\n\nthe process of writing the bill is set to begin the week of february 8 and span at least eight committees across the capitol. house ways and means chairman richard neal told cnn that his committee will be working in consultation with the senate's finance committee, but the massive process will also require work from the house and senate committees on small business, senate health education labor and pensions, house labor and house energy and commerce as well as senate banking.\n\nit is going to be an ongoing challenge, neal said.\n\nthose committees will also have to meet very specific and technical requirements so that the legislation can survive a review by the senate parliamentarian. it could take weeks to finalize language and win support within the democratic caucus.\n\nin the house, the margin for error is also small. house speaker nancy pelosi would only be able to lose a handful of votes both on the budget resolution and the final bill. while the expectation is the budget resolution passes easily, factions of her caucus are already laying down markers of what they think the package should ultimately look like. minnesota rep. ilhan omar led a group of 50 house progressives in sending a letter to biden and vice president kamala harris on thursday asking them to prioritize recurring direct checks in the next covid-19 relief package. members of the bipartisan problem solver's caucus, a moderate group, has been talking with white house officials about their own concerns on making the final relief bill more targeted.\n\nfor their party, republicans are outraged about the speed at which democrats are moving ahead, with one republican senator saying thursday that it would be a massive mistake for democrats to go ahead with reconciliation.\n\nthe white house has to help us. they cannot be staying silent and encouraging democrats to go forward, the senator said of reconciliation.\n\nit would be like declaring war around here at a time when it's bad enough and you have impeachment on top of it.

president-elect donald trump doesn't plan to sit back and wait for congress to repeal and replace obamacare.\n\nthe soon-to-be dealmaker-in-chief intends to wield his executive authority to help shift the nation from the affordable care act to a republican vision for health care.\n\nwe're working on a strategy, in concert with the leadership of the house and the senate, for both a legislative and executive action agenda to ensure that an orderly and smooth transition to a market-based health care reform system is achieved, said vice president-elect pence last week, emphasizing the shift will be stable.\n\npence's comments, however, left legal and health care experts -- as well as some congressional staffers working on obamacare's repeal and replacement -- scratching their heads as to what exactly trump plans to do. a request to the trump transition team for comment went unanswered.\n\nrepublicans must be careful in that the dems own the failed obamacare disaster, with its poor coverage and massive premium increases...... — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) january 4, 2017\n\nit's unclear from pence's comments whether trump plans to take executive action or, more authoritatively, issue executive orders. the vice president-elect used both terms at a gop press conference last wednesday, noting that the white house staff is currently working on a series of executive orders that will enable that orderly transition to take place even as the congress appropriately debates alternatives.\n\nwhile trump and congressional republicans have repeatedly vowed to swiftly end president obama's health care reform, their remarks have become more tempered since they won control of the white house in november. not only are they concerned about the political fallout of immediately kicking 20 million people off their health insurance, they don't have a detailed replacement plan in hand.\n\nso it doesn't seem likely that trump will try to upend obamacare as soon as he takes office on january 20. regardless, a president doesn't have the power to summarily overturn a law or nullify a regulation. for instance, he could not immediately dismantle the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, or stop paying premium subsidies -- at least not without being sued, experts said. only congress writes laws, and altering a regulation requires an agency to publish the proposed changes, allow the public to comment and then write the final rule, a process which usually takes two years, said david super, a law professor at georgetown university law center.\n\nrelated: americans split over trump's ability to fix health care\n\nbut presidents can issue executive orders -- which are signed and have the force of law -- to direct federal agencies and officials on how to execute laws and policies. obama issued only one executive order concerning the affordable care act, said tim jost, a health law professor at washington and lee university school of law. it directed several agencies to establish a mechanism to ensure that federal money flowing through obamacare -- such as the subsidies and community health centers funding -- would not be used for abortions, consistent with federal statute.\n\nexecutive actions are more informal and broad. they could be defined as any action that is typically relating to policy matters that the president or his subordinates in the executive branch, super said.\n\nhere's what trump might do:\n\nstop defending lawsuits: trump could take action on several court cases right away.\n\nhere's one example: he could end the administration's defense of a case involving cost-sharing subsidies that insurers must provide for low-income enrollees. house republicans sued the obama administration, arguing they never appropriated the funds to reimburse insurers for lowering the deductibles and co-payments of these policyholders.\n\nrelated: federal appeals court puts obamacare lawsuit on hold\n\nhowever, if trump dropped the administration's defense, it would end the reimbursements to insurers. that would wreak havoc in the individual market. many insurers depend on these cost-sharing payments -- without them, they might leave the market, which could lead to fewer choices and higher premiums for consumers. such a move would be at odds with the orderly transition pence stressed as important to the incoming president.\n\nthere are other legal battles with less dire consequences -- including a group of nuns fighting obamacare's mandate that employers and health insurers on the exchanges provide free contraceptives -- where trump also could opt not to defend the law. (there is an exemption for certain religious employers.)\n\nrevise guidance: the president-elect could direct federal agencies -- such as the department of health & human services and the internal revenue service -- to revise the guidance they've issued to carry out affordable care act regulations so they are more in line with republican ideals.\n\ntake the individual mandate, which requires most americans to be insured or pay a penalty unless they can prove a financial hardship. since congressional republicans want to do away with the mandate, trump could try to loosen the criteria for qualifying for a hardship exemption. that way fewer people would have to pay the penalty, which would be in line with republicans' charge that americans need relief from obamacare's exorbitant costs.\n\nchange enforcement priorities: another action trump could take would be to signal that his administration will not impose penalties for certain infractions of obamacare provisions.\n\none example: employers who provide contributions to workers to buy their own individual health insurance can be slapped with a penalty of $100 per day, per person. trump could suggest to his new irs commissioner that enforcing the rule is counterproductive and a waste of resources, especially when congress plans to replace obamacare.\n\nrelated: repealing obamacare affects everyone\n\nyou can't rewrite the law, but there are a lot of gray areas where you can change the emphasis, said tom miller, resident fellow at the american enterprise institute. where obama stretched the law to be tighter and more all-encompassing, trump will make it more flexible and less rigorous.\n\nincrease flexibility and issue more administrative fixes: following trump's lead, the health & human services department could be more flexible in granting waivers. so states that want to institute additional rules -- such as work requirements -- in their medicaid expansion programs would likely get the go-ahead, whereas they were denied permission under the obama administration.\n\nobama has also used executive power to make changes to the law. one example: in november 2013, he announced an administrative fix to address the outcry over insurers canceling people's pre-obamacare plans just as the exchanges initial open enrollment began. he opened the door for enrollees to temporarily keep their pre-obamacare plans by signaling to insurers that they could renew these policies if state insurance commissioners agreed. the move raised questions, but ultimately wasn't successfully challenged.\n\nthe executive branch can do a lot, until someone tries to stop them through the legal system, said larry levitt, senior vice president at the kaiser family foundation.\n\nrelated: how the tables are turning on obamacare\n\ntinkering with obamacare, however, could be at odds with pence's stated interest in a smooth transition, experts said. many of the law's provisions are intertwined, so changing one might have a more widespread effect.\n\nrelaxing the hardship exemption, for example, may lead to fewer healthy people enrolling, which could cause insurers to raise their premiums.\n\nthere's a delicate balance, said sabrina corlette, research professor at georgetown's center on health insurance reforms. every action will have a consequence.\n\nor, on the flip side, trump could take actions that seek to stabilize the market so insurers don't drop out before republicans can put a replacement plan into effect. these might include bolstering obamacare's risk program that aims to protect insurers with a disproportionate share of high-cost, sick enrollees or making it harder for americans to sign up for coverage outside the open enrollment period.\n\nit's also possible that the incoming administration might not yet have specific executive actions in mind, especially since gop lawmakers remain very divided about what a replacement plan will look like.\n\ni just spoke to @realdonaldtrump and he fully supports my plan to replace obamacare the same day we repeal it. the time to act is now. — senator rand paul (@randpaul) january 7, 2017\n\npence's comments may have been more political in nature -- serving to put congress on notice that trump wants a repeal and replace deal done soon, miller said. the president-elect may also want to calm fears that he's looking to dismantle obamacare immediately regardless of whether it leaves millions of enrollees uninsured. or he may want to let his base know that he's in charge.\n\nhe may want to force the issue or to diffuse an issue or just claim control...as long as he doesn't get the blame, miller said.

elect donald trump arrives on the west front of the u.s. capitol on january 20, 2017 in washington, dc. in today's inauguration ceremony donald j. trump becomes the 45th president of the united states.\n\n(cnn) —\n\none year in to donald trump's time in office, his approval ratings fall well below his predecessors' anniversary marks, and americans' expectations that he will keep major campaign promises have largely faded, according to a new cnn poll conducted by ssrs. but the president appears to be reaping some benefits from the best ratings of the economy since bill clinton occupied the oval office.\n\ntrump's numbers have rebounded from fall lows in overall approval (40%, up from 35% in december), approval on handling the economy (49%, up from 44% in december), approval on handling taxes (42%, up from 34% in december), and confidence in his ability to serve as president (59% say they've lost confidence in him since he took office, down from 64% saying the same in november).\n\nthose shifts, including the improvement in impressions of trump's handling of the presidency and the economy, stem largely from rebounds among independents. trump's 52% approval rating on the economy among independents is the only issue area tested where a majority of that group approves of his performance.\n\nthe public's perceptions of the economy have climbed dramatically since trump took office. overall, 69% now describe it in good shape, the highest since february 2001 and up 12 points since last january. the 20% who currently call the economy very good is the highest since the final week of bill clinton's time in office in january 2001.\n\nalmost half, 47%, say their personal financial situation is better than it was a year ago, about double the share who say their fortunes have worsened in the last year (23%).\n\nthe overall improvement in ratings of the economy over the last year is driven largely by shifts among republicans. it is typical for people of the president's party to rate the economy more highly than do those of the party out of office, but democrats' high marks for the economy under barack obama haven't faded as quickly since the transfer of power as republicans' and independents' reviews have improved. over that time, republicans positive ratings have climbed a whopping 48 points, as independents have ticked up 12 points. democratic ratings have dropped 13 points in the same time frame.\n\nthe economy no longer ranks as the most important problem facing the country. asked to name the most pressing issue, 18% cite immigration, 17% the economy, and 12% each name a foreign policy concern or an issue with the president himself as the nation's top concern.\n\njust 40% say trump's policies are moving the nation in the right direction more generally, down from 48% just ahead of his inauguration, and the public is split overall on whether he's doing a good job (46%) or a poor job (48%) keeping the important promises he made during the 2016 campaign. among his own partisans, 88% say he's doing a good job keeping his most important promises, a touch higher than the 83% of democrats who said the same about obama in january 2010.\n\nwhen asked to assess the likelihood trump will keep specific major promises, expectations appear to have faded on several of them.\n\ntrump has taken his largest hit on his promise to repeal and replace obamacare. just before taking office last year, 82% considered that very or somewhat likely to happen, now, just 54% say the same. expectations have also dipped significantly on fulfilling his promises to renegotiate nafta, and to create jobs in economically-challenged areas. there have been meaningful upticks in the share saying trump is not at all likely to reduce the amount of corruption in washington (from 35% to 43%), get mexico to reimburse the united states for the cost of a wall along the border (from 46% to 54%) and on the prospects for building that wall in the first place (from 29% to 34%).\n\nlooking abroad, just 35% approve of trump's performance handling foreign affairs, unchanged over the fall, and 65% say leaders of other countries around the world don't have much respect for him. trump's numbers on that score remain worse than obama's, george w. bush's or clinton's, according to cnn's polling. even among those who approve of trump's handling of the presidency more generally, nearly a quarter (24%) say he hasn't gained the respect of other world leaders.\n\non a personal level, trump's favorability rating stands at a net negative, 40% favorable to 57% unfavorable. that's well below current ratings for both obama (66% favorable) and bush (61% favorable), as well as below their favorability numbers near the first anniversary of their inauguration (83% viewed bush favorably in january of 2002; 58% saw obama positively in december 2009). trump outpaces bush's current numbers, however, among republicans – 89% have a favorable view of trump, 76% of bush.\n\nmany americans also doubt trump has much personal regard for people like them. overall, 46% say they think trump has no respect at all for people like them. that figure climbs to 81% among blacks, 66% among hispanics, 55% among women (including 74% among non-white women), and 65% among immigrants. the findings follow reports that trump described countries in africa using a negative expletive in an oval office meeting earlier this month.\n\nthe cnn poll was conducted by ssrs january 14-18 among a random national sample of 1,005 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. no interviewing was completed on january 16 due to weather conditions at call center locations. results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups.
birmingham's fight over the minimum wage, advocates say, echoes the city's epic civil rights campaign, memorialized in statues like this one.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthe schoolchildren who faced water hoses and police dogs in birmingham gave the civil rights movement one of its most iconic victories. but a new generation of activists has arisen in the city with another message:\n\nthe for colored only signs may be gone, but the jim crow economy remains.\n\nthat is the thrust of a lawsuit linking a three-year battle to raise the city's minimum wage with alabama's ugly racist heritage. oral arguments were heard in federal court on friday after a coalition of civil rights groups sued to preserve an attempt by birmingham's majority black government to raise the city's minimum wage.\n\nthe suit is the latest skirmish in a national battle over the minimum wage. at least 21 states and dc have raised their minimum wages above the federal level of $7.25 an hour in the last four years, and at least 41 localities have adopted wages above their state minimums. many have done so because of protests by fight for $15, a workers' movement that seeks to raise the minimum to $15 an hour.\n\nthey treated birmingham like it had whistled at a white woman. it was like an insult: how dare you raise your own minimum wage without our say-so. scott douglas, executive director of greater birmingham ministries\n\nlegislatures in at least 24 states, including alabama, have responded by passing pre-emption bills that either abolish or roll back those increases. what's different in birmingham is the racial dimension of its minimum wage battle – and the massive implications of a workers' movement gaining a victory in a southern city.\n\nbirmingham became the first city in the south to try to raise the minimum wage for anyone employed within its city limits. the primary beneficiaries of the raise would have been fast-food and retail workers.\n\nalabama lawmakers responded by passing a law that abolished the wage increase. every alabama lawmaker who voted against the raise was white, according to the lawsuit.\n\na coalition of groups that included fight for $15 activists sued the state in 2016, saying passage of the law was tainted by racial animus and relied on a state constitution that still has explicit language geared toward putting blacks in their place.\n\nthey treated birmingham like it had whistled at a white woman, says scott douglas, executive director of greater birmingham ministries, one of the plaintiffs in the suit. it was like an insult: 'how dare you raise your own minimum wage without our say-so.\n\nphoto: mike brown/the commercial appeal/ap dunetra merritt protests for higher wages in memphis, tennessee. some fight for $15 activists say their struggle is linked to the civil rights movement.\n\ncnn tried to reach at least four alabama lawmakers who voted to overturn birmingham's wage increase, including some of the most outspoken opponents. none responded. alabama's attorney general's office, though, made the state's position clear in a brief filed with the 11th us circuit court of appeals. the court is hearing an appeal by the plaintiffs after a federal judge dismissed their lawsuit. a decision is not expected for months.\n\nthe brief said alabama lawmakers were motivated in part by studies that suggest minimum wage increases cause more unemployment and don't reduce poverty. it said the state was well within its rights to oversee the economic regulations of its cities, and pointed out that numerous states had already passed similar laws preventing localities from enacting their own minimum wage laws.\n\nto get around this, the appellants asserted a dizzying array of legal theories casting alabama's minimum-wage law as state-sponsored racial discrimination, the brief said.\n\nliving on two ham sandwiches a day\n\nlinking a minimum wage battle in birmingham to water hoses and attack dogs may seem far-fetched, almost obscene. but the famed 1963 civil rights campaign was spawned by economic concerns in the city's black community as well. the initial goal of the campaign was to desegregate downtown stores for black shoppers and persuade merchants to hire black sales clerks.\n\nthe rev. martin luther king jr. often noted that racism and economic exploitation are intertwined.\n\nwhat does it profit a man to be able to eat at an integrated lunch counter if he doesn't have money to buy a hamburger? king said.\n\nblacks in birmingham still have trouble buying a hamburger, the plaintiffs argue. according to their suit, the city is about 74% black; 32% of its black residents earn below the federal poverty line; and the average black resident earns about $16,000 a year.\n\nphoto: hal yeager/ap a statue honoring the four girls killed in the 1963 bombing of birmingham's 16th street baptist church graces the corner of kelly ingram park.\n\npoverty in the city's black community has spilled into the closest thing to sacred ground in birmingham – a park dedicated to the 1963 campaign.\n\nkelly ingram park was the four-acre epicenter of the 1963 protests. it's where black school children were lashed with water hoses. it's now a civil rights monument, ringed with sculptures of king, statues of demonstrators facing off against lunging attack dogs, and benches adorned with photos of civil rights martyrs.\n\nhomeless black men also populate the park. they shuffle through the manicured grounds with soiled clothing and matted hair like zombies. some mutter to themselves, heads cast down. others sleep on park benches. one panhandler with a zz top silver beard and a toothless smile approached strangers on a recent day asking, gotta dollar?\n\nacross the street, antoin adams, a young man with gold teeth, leaned his lanky frame against a civil rights museum facing the park. he's not there to reflect on the past; he's trying to make some new history.\n\nadams, 24, is one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit. at the time he joined the suit, he was making $7.25 an hour at hardee's and lived in section 8 housing. his job came without health benefits, but he was making too much for medicaid. alabama refused to expand medicaid under obamacare, leaving him to call 911 for free breathing treatments for his chronic asthma.\n\nadams said he couldn't afford the cost of an inhaler.\n\ni know i need it for my asthma, but the bills need to be paid. it makes you kind of think of giving up, but you can't. life goes on.\n\nadams is joined by michelle jones, a fight for $15 activist. bubbly with a big smile, the 28-year-old said she could barely afford to eat after paying her bills and bus fare on her $7.25 an hour wage at mcdonald's.\n\ntwo ham sandwiches a day – one in the morning and one at night, she said when asked to describe her diet. sometimes it's just crackers and noodles.\n\njones and adams swapped stories about the grim choices needed to make a living on minimum wage: do you pay the water bill or gas bill? when you're in pain, how long do you wait before paying for a doctor's visit? how do you get to work on time when the buses you rely on often break down?\n\nbefore their conversation ended, they mentioned a startling detail. they said they'd sought out black veterans of the 1963 campaign to get advice and inspiration. instead they got shrugs.\n\nthey'll be like, 'it ain't going to happen. you're fighting for nothing,' adams said. i thought older people would motivate us. i never thought it would be like that.\n\nwhy some say alabama is 'the baddest of the bad'\n\ntheir pessimism may be understandable because of a geographic reality: it's difficult to organize any workers' movement in the south.\n\nthe region is the most hostile in the nation to workers' rights. every southern state has right-to-work laws that make it easy for companies to fire employees – and difficult for unions to organize. only five states have no state minimum wage. all five are in the south – including alabama.\n\nphoto: gary tramontina/bloomberg/getty images birmingham's black residents won a stirring victory in 1963, but many still struggle to make ends meet.\n\nthis southern hostility to workers isn't a coincidence. it's tradition. since the late 19th century, many southern states have embraced a similar economic approach, some historians say: slash taxes to attract corporations, pass laws that weaken unions and pull back on investing in public services like infrastructure and public schools.\n\nsome groups are starting to rebel against this economic approach. public school teachers in red states like west virginia and oklahoma have staged walkouts and protests over low pay and funding cuts, placing many state lawmakers on the defensive.\n\nsouthern political leaders, though, traditionally have been hostile to any measures – guaranteed health care, unemployment benefits, minimum wage laws – that would make workers less dependent on employers, these historians say.\n\nsome call this economic approach southernomics. after the birmingham lawsuit was filed, one woman described it as a fight against the jim crow economy.\n\nthe days of a jim crow economy should be long gone, said christine owens, executive director of the national employment law project, a nonprofit group that promotes policies to protect low-wage workers and the unemployed.\n\nbut sadly, the refusal of alabama's legislature to allow birmingham to meet local needs through appropriate local measures signals the past persists.\n\nphoto: jim weber/the commercial appeal/ap antonio cathey leads a crowd of fast food workers in a fight for $15 protest in memphis. the campaign has raised wages for low income workers but inspired a fierce counterattack by some lawmakers.\n\nadams, one of the lawsuit's plaintiffs, eventually moved to atlanta for better job prospects because the economic climate in alabama was so difficult. he is still a plaintiff in the lawsuit.\n\njim crow remains in other ways, too, the plaintiffs say in their suit.\n\nthey pointed to alabama's constitution, which they say state lawmakers relied on to abolish birmingham's wage increase. the constitution is explicitly racist. it calls for separate schools for white and colored children, and it still has references to poll taxes, which were used to prevent blacks from voting in the jim crow era. a referendum was held in 2012 to remove the language, but voters rejected it.\n\nthe suit also says the constitution was designed to concentrate power at the state level and prevent black people in cities from exercising control over their communities.\n\nthe notion of ordinary workers of color organizing for better pay is offensive to some white leaders in alabama, says douglas of greater birmingham ministries.\n\nthere's a culture of deifying corporate leaders, making them almost like gods, douglas says. it's a kind of deference where the model is the plantation owner.\n\nthere are still many people in alabama who reflect the sentiments of the state lawmakers who once wrote about educating white and colored children in separate schools. alabama was the last us state to overturn a ban on interracial marriage. voters did it in 2000 – but at least 40% of the state's residents voted to keep it.\n\nno place in the us has had white supremacy embedded so deeply in its everyday social culture as alabama, says james blaksher, a native of the state and one of the lawyers for the plaintiffs.\n\neven among the southern states, when it comes to race, alabama is the baddest of the bad.\n\na fight for $15 victory in birmingham could show that workers can win a victory anywhere, even in alabama, says richard rouco, another of the plaintiffs' attorneys.\n\nif this case succeeds, it will put limits on the power of the state to enact legislation that would deprive people of the ability to address what they think are racial inequalities in their community, he says. the deepest racial inequalities that exist in this country are economic.\n\nantoin adams may have already won a personal victory – to preserve some of his own self-worth.\n\nhe talks with pride about the time he was asked to deliver a speech before a huge fight for $15 rally in richmond, virginia. he quoted king and broke into rap, an homage to fight for $15 he composed.\n\nphoto: michael ochs archives/getty images black protesters came under attack by dogs and water cannons in 1963. activists say there's a link between those protests and birmingham's efforts to raise the minimum wage.\n\nas he sings his anthem for me, his gold teeth flash and he dips his shoulder to do a little dance. and once again, a young black activist is singing freedom songs in kelly ingram park:\n\nwell, first of all to tell the truth,\n\n7.25 is not going to do\n\nthat ain't right so let's stand up for what's right\n\nwe've been in the dark so long, it's time we've seen some light.\n\nbut this isn't 1963. adams isn't flanked by a group of fellow civil rights demonstrators. there is no king writing a letter from a birmingham jail. and there are no racist southern sheriffs for him to confront as the cameras roll. his main audience, at least for today, is a group of indifferent homeless men.\n\nand yet he continues to sing.\n\nthey say it can't happen, he says of his battle for a higher wage. but it can happen. the only way it won't happen if we don't try.

washington (cnn) the supreme court on wednesday grappled with the trump administration's attempt to weaken the so-called contraceptive mandate, the affordable care act's long controversial requirement that employer-provided health insurance plans cover birth control as a preventive service.\n\nthe case is the latest dispute concerning obamacare to come before the justices and pits supporters of the contraceptive provision against those who say it violates their religious and moral beliefs. president donald trump pledged from the rose garden in 2017 that he would prevent the federal government from bullying and even punishing americans for following their religious beliefs.\n\nwednesday's arguments were the third time the justices, because of the coronavirus, hear oral arguments by telephone\n\njustice ruth bader ginsburg joined the teleconference from a hospital, where she is being treated for a benign gallbladder condition\n\nginsburg made clear she is opposed to the trump administration's attempt to weaken the mandate and provide an exemption for more employers.\n\nthis leaves the women to hunt for other government programs that might cover them, she told solicitor general noel francisco.\n\nyou have just tossed entirely to the wind what congress thought was essential, that is that women be provided these services with no hassles, no cost to them, ginsburg added.\n\nwe have had a history of accommodation, for tolerance here, respect for the employer's workers and students who do not share the employers' or the universities' objections to contraceptives, she said.\n\nchief justice john roberts asked the administration at one point whether its rule might sweep too broadly. he also seemed unclear on why an accommodation could not be found between those with religious objections and women seeking coverage. is it really the case, he asked, that there is no way to resolve those differences?\n\njustice brett kavanaugh, whose vote could also be key, stressed the strong interests on both sides. but he seemed concerned with the judiciary's role and asked whether it was not to put limits on an agency's discretion.\n\nother liberals on the bench joined in with ginsburg's concerns. justice sonia sotomayor, for instance, pointed out that there would be a substantial number of women who wouldn't be able to get coverage. i understand the figure to be around 75,000 and 125,000 she said. and justice stephen breyer echoed roberts' thoughts. i don't understand why this can't be worked out, he said.\n\njustice samuel alito appeared to side with the administration. and justice clarence thomas repeatedly questioned whether the lower court was correct to block trump's rules nationwide. thomas has often criticized the relatively new phenomenon of lower courts barring a policy from taking effect across the country while appeals play out.\n\none unexpected consequence of the new telephone format is that thomas -- who once went a decade without asking a question -- has been an active participant, launching questions to advocates on both sides of the case.\n\nthe requirement\n\nthe affordable care act requires many group health plans and health insurers that offer health coverage to provide coverage for contraceptives, without cost sharing. churches and houses of worship are exempted and other entities such as religious universities, hospitals or charities with religious objections get an accommodation. the accommodation means that plan participants will still receive the coverage, but indirectly through the employer's health insurance company.\n\nover 61.4 million women in the us have birth control coverage with zero out-of-pocket costs, according the national women's law center.\n\nafter trump took office, the government moved in 2017 to allow exemptions for more employers. that includes not only those entities with religious objections, but also nonprofits, small businesses and individuals that have non-religious moral objections. the government did not extend moral exemptions to publicly traded businesses.\n\npennsylvania and other states challenged the federal government move in court, arguing in part that they would have to step in and provide coverage for women seeking coverage.\n\na federal appeals court blocked the rules nationwide, holding that the states would suffer irreparable harm and unredressable financial consequences from subsidizing contraceptive services and providing funds for medical care associated with unintended pregnancies. the court said that the states' financial injury outweighs any purported injury to religious exercise.\n\nthe trump administration and the little sisters of the poor, a roman catholic religious order for women, are asking the supreme court to reverse the lower court.\n\nthis is a dispute that is fundamentally about the rights of religious people and it only makes sense to have the little sisters in the case to express that position, said mark rienzi, the president of the becket fund that is representing the religious order.\n\nfrancisco argued in court papers that the accommodation still makes some entities feel complicit in providing contraceptive coverage to their employees. francisco said that federal law, called the religious freedom restoration act, designed to prohibit the federal government from substantially burdening a person's exercise of religion, gives agencies discretion to offer an exemption.\n\nrfra imposes a duty on agencies to avoid implementing federal law in a manner that imposes substantial burdens on religious exercise unnecessarily, francisco said.\n\nbut pennsylvania's attorney general josh shapiro, joined by new jersey's attorney general, told the supreme court that the lower court got it right. he pointed out that an accommodation is already in place that allows certain objecting employers to exclude contraception for the benefit packages and allowing third parties to provide the coverage directly.\n\nthis approach, shapiro said, balances the employers' sincere religious belief with the health of their female employees.\n\nhe said that such a balance was disrupted when the trump administration moved to allow more people, including publicly traded corporations and large universities, to receive an exemption.\n\nthe existing accommodation respects both the health of women and the religious liberty interests of employers, he argued.\n\nthe american civil liberties union filed a brief supporting the states noting the supreme court has already extended the accommodation for a chain of stores in a case called burwell v. hobby lobby , in 2014 and other closely held for profit companies.\n\nsolicitor general noel francisco\n\nreligious liberty is a fundamental value -- but allowing companies and universities to use religious beliefs to block employees' and students' birth control coverage is discrimination, not religious liberty, said brigitte amiri, deputy director of the aclu reproductive freedom project.\n\ntwenty states and the district of columbia support the states as well as house speaker nancy pelosi and 185 other members of congress.\n\ntexas and 19 other states support the trump administration and the little sisters, arguing that some employers believe sincerely that it is incompatible with their religious convictions to provide health insurance when it means contracting with a company that then, because of that relationship, becomes obligated to provide contraceptives that the employers regard as abortifacients.\n\nrobocalls\n\nafter the little sisters case, the justices took up the fate of a 1991 law that prohibits unwanted calls, sometimes referred to as robocalls, to cell phones.\n\nthe case pits consumers seeking respite from the calls against pollsters and fundraisers who are pressing for such automated technology to solicit donations or send politics-related messages.\n\nattorney paul clement\n\nthe telephone consumer protection act was enacted as a response to intrusive phone calls. but the ban does not cover all calls. one exemption, added by congress in 2015, concerns calls related to debts owed to the federal government. the government argued that the provision was necessary to ensure that debts owed to the united states could be collected as quickly and efficiently as possible.\n\nopponents of the law say that the exemption is unconstitutional, and because of that, the rest of the law should fall.\n\na federal appeals court ruled last year in favor of the political organizations, holding that the government-debt exception to the law violated the first amendment because it banned some calls based on content, but allowed other types. the justice department, the court held, failed to provide a compelling reason for the law and it had other means to collect the government debt.\n\nbut the court stopped short of invalidating the entire law.\n\nnow the justice department is appealing the decision to the supreme court. solicitor general francisco argues that the unlike other robocalls, calls to collect government backed debt serve a significant public and governmental interest in protecting the federal fisc .\n\nupdate: this story has been updated with details from oral arguments.

(cnn) former new york city mayor mike bloomberg said the final obamacare bill would do absolutely nothing to fix the big health care problems and also called the program a disgrace in comments made in 2010, just months after the law's passage.\n\nspeaking at dartmouth college in july of that year, bloomberg added that law was just another program that's going to cost a lot more money.\n\nit is just one of several comments from bloomberg identified by cnn's kfile criticizing the landmark affordable care act in the years following its passage, including saying the bill was  really dysfunctional  and did nothing to solve rising health care costs.\n\nnow, a decade later, as he hopes to become the democratic presidential nominee, bloomberg has fully embraced the affordable care act, even proposing an additional  medicare-like public option  that builds on the law.\n\nat the time bloomberg made his remarks, the law was seen as a political liability for democrats, and republicans were campaigning heavily against the bill on their way to victories in the 2010 midterm elections. bloomberg, who was initially elected as a republican, was governing as an independent at the time of his remarks. (he re-registered as a democrat in 2018 .)\n\nwe passed a health care bill that does absolutely nothing to fix the big health care problems in this country. it is just a disgrace, said bloomberg at the dartmouth presidential lecture in 2010. the president, in all fairness, started out by pointing out what the big problems were, but then turned it over to congress, which didn't pay any attention to any of those big problems and just created another program that's going to cost a lot of money.\n\nit's really sad because they say they've insured or provided coverage for another 45 million people, bloomberg added in the speech. except there's no doctors for 45 million more people and unless they fix immigration and let people who come here for medical education stay here, those people are just going to do the same thing. they're going to have to go to the emergency rooms where they've been except that now it's going to cost a lot more money.\n\njulie wood, a bloomberg campaign spokeswoman, told cnn in a statement this week that bloomberg had supported the bill, but was critical of the approach to pass it.\n\nmike bloomberg's support for president obama's affordable care act couldn't be clearer -- he lobbied for obamacare but wanted congress to go further than they did. as he references in these comments about washington dysfunction, congress failed to enact the public option that he argued for in 2009 and now proposes as part of his presidential campaign.\n\nit's clear that our health care system is broken, and that's why mike has a plan to expand to build on the aca and provide universal health coverage while substantially reducing health care costs and expanding access to health services, wood said.\n\nthe campaign noted bloomberg's support of efforts to reform health care in early 2009 and a press release in support of the house version of the affordable care act the day before it was passed . the campaign also pointed to an op-ed bloomberg wrote in 2009 where he appears to be supportive of the house bill that was being crafted around that time and to a 2013 radio interview of the bill in which bloomberg said, congress passed this, so let's try it at least.\n\nsome parts of obamacare i don't think will work, i don't think is fair, i don't think is intelligent, whatever. but i don't have a better answer other than let's try this, bloomberg also said.\n\nnone of bloomberg's criticism of the bill at the time, however, appeared to cite its lack of a public option for health care.\n\nhealth care has emerged as the top issue for voters in the first two democratic nominating contests , but voters remain divided over whether the future of health care should shift to a government-run medicare-for-all-style system or expand obamacare to include a public option. the emphasis on health care raises the stakes for bloomberg as he paves an unconventional path for the nomination after he sat out of iowa and new hampshire.\n\ntoday, bloomberg's current health care plan praises obamacare and makes steps to improve health care.\n\nthe aca made great strides in helping people who don't get health insurance through an employer afford coverage in the individual market, reads his health care plan . mike would reverse the trump administration's attempts at sabotage: he would expand enrollment efforts, restrict the sale of health plans that don't meet aca standards, and defend the law against politically motivated lawsuits. he would expand subsidies to cap premiums at 8.5% of a household's income.\n\na history of criticizing congress\n\nin a december 2009 appearance on nbc's meet the press, bloomberg appeared to contradict his own support for the house bill by questioning if congress had ever read the bill.\n\ni have asked congressperson after congressperson, not one can explain to me what's in the bill, even in the house version, certainly not in the other version, bloomberg said. and so for them to vote on a bill that they don't understand whatsoever, really, you've got to question what kind of government we have.\n\nbloomberg's comments critical of obamacare weren't limited to the months after the bill's passage, though they were certainly his harshest.\n\nin an appearance in february 2011 , bloomberg was asked about overcrowding in new york city hospitals.\n\nit's going to get worse with the health care bill and with the governor's cutbacks, bloomberg said.\n\nit's not addressing the two issues, bloomberg added of obamacare. number one, it's going to bankrupt us. and number two, europe seems to get more for that money. they say yes and then they go back to taking care of every special interest.\n\nwood said the it that would bankrupt us was not obamacare, but health care costs in general.\n\nmike said multiple times that the health care system as it existed before obamacare was going to bankrupt us and was in urgent need of reform -- here he's saying that obamacare did not fully solve that problem, she told cnn in an email.\n\nwarning about spiraling costs\n\nin another appearance on a radio program in 2011, bloomberg again reiterated his criticism that the bill did not solve the basic problems with health care and that health care would bankrupt us.\n\nwe're spending money we don't have, our health care system is going to bankrupt us, bloomberg said. the last health care bill did not solve the basic problems, two basic problems with health care -- which in all fairness -- the president, he did say at the very beginning and then that's what i got lost in all of the negotiations as every special interest in congress got a piece or lost a piece or negotiated about a piece.\n\nthe two big problems with health care is that we have a health care system that we just cannot afford. it is going to bankrupt us. it keeps getting bigger and bigger and bigger, he added. and number two, you want to provide good health care. and in western europe they seem to do it for less than half of what we do it.\n\nit's going to take a lot of years to adjust those bills to get to some place you should have been in the beginning, he said.

the far end of the political spectrum and who has practiced an aggressive, smashmouth style of politics that has sometimes made trump look tame.\n\nchampion of tea party conservatism\n\nthe senator from texas has never strayed from the right-wing of the gop. if republicans like mitt romney are looking for a candidate who can have broad appeal in the general election, cruz is not that person. throughout his relatively short congressional career, he has done more than almost any other politician to champion the ideas of tea party conservatism.\n\ncruz has taken a staunch stand against gay rights, emerging as one of the loudest opponents to the drive for same-sex marriage. he called a supreme court ruling that was sympathetic to same-sex marriage, tragic and indefensible. he has also opposed the passage of non-discrimination protection for lgbt americans.\n\nturning to immigration, cruz has called for an amendment that would deny citizenship to the children of persons who were in the u.s. illegally. cruz, who also wants to build a wall, has called for tripling the number of border patrol agents and vastly increasing the number of aircraft they have available, and greatly expanding the fencing separating the countries.\n\nhe would not admit most refugees who are trying to enter from syria, though he has indicated he would be more lenient if they were christian. there is no meaningful risk of christians committing acts of terror, he said in november 2015.\n\ncruz has been at the forefront of the fight to repeal obamacare and to kill funding for planned parenthood. he is one of the republicans who does not believe in scientific evidence about climate change. they're cooking the books, the senator said in reference to government research on the subject.\n\na month before he was sworn into office, according to jeffrey toobin, he urged his colleagues to stand firm against a u.n. treaty supporting the rights of the disabled. on foreign policy, cruz has repeatedly called for carpet-bombing isis, an idea most experts agree would be ineffective and dangerous, likely building support for the organization as a result of the civilians who would be killed.\n\nbesides his policy positions, cruz has also been connected to fringe elements of the conservative world. in virginia, he picked state senator richard black to co-chair his campaign. black has called for banning abortion in all cases, outlawing the morning-after-pill, and said that marital rape should not be a crime. he received the endorsement of mike bickle, the founder of the international house of prayer who claimed that homosexuality opens the door to the demonic realm. he was endorsed by and helped raise money for the gun owners of america, a radical gun rights organization that thinks the nra is too moderate.\n\namong his foreign policy advisers, for instance, are individuals who are known for their fiery anti-islamic statements and support of birtherism. former ronald reagan official frank gaffney, for instance, has voiced extreme statements about the dangers of muslims. indeed, trump cited data that came from his think tank when calling for a moratorium on muslims.\n\ngaffney, one of the early supporters of birther arguments, penned an op-ed in the washington times in 2009 in which he stated: applying the standard of identity politics and pandering to a special interest that earned mr. clinton the distinction of being called america's first black president, obama would have to be considered america's first muslim president. the southern poverty law center called gaffney one of america's most notorious islamophobes..\n\nspecialist in political obstruction\n\nand when it comes to radical political obstructionism, nobody has done it better than senator cruz. earlier this year the washington post gave him the title of obstructor in chief. he has been one of the champions of congressional practices that bring washington to a halt. he has steadfastly refused to enter into any kind of agreement with the administration, lobbying members of the house as well as the senate, and he has employed practices like the filibuster to new levels.\n\nin 2013, after his 21-hour filibuster, he was the driving force behind allowing the government to shut down over spending disputes. not a surprise from a politician who has called for the abolition of the irs as well as of the departments of education, energy, and hud. in contrast to trump, he has called for privatizing social security for younger workers.\n\nwhen it comes time to raise the debt level, he is one of the republicans willing to send the nation into default to prove a political point. during the confirmation hearings for chuck hagel to be secretary of defense in 2013, he engaged in guilt-by-association mccarthyite tactics by suggesting that the senator was too close to iran and north korea, a charge that even made some fellow republicans shake their heads. these were the kinds of actions that led south carolina sen. lindsay graham to joke, if you killed ted cruz on the floor of the senate, and the trial was in the senate, nobody would convict you.\n\nif donald trump is a blend of george wallace and p.t. barnum put together, senator cruz is much closer to barry goldwater in 1964, though without the interest in legislating. the only thing that has allowed him to position himself as a safer choice for the party has been donald trump's success.\n\nthe republicans who are willing to throw their support behind the senator as they take principled stands against trump reveal clearly how far the party has moved to the right in recent years and just how desperate some have become to keep the reality tv star off the ticket\n\njoin us on

(cnn) president joe biden is expected to reopen enrollment on the federal affordable care act exchanges on thursday as part of a series of executive actions related to health care, taking a step to help uninsured americans that his predecessor rejected.\n\nit will be biden's first move toward delivering on his campaign promise to bolster the landmark health reform law that he championed as vice president. and it comes as more americans could be facing the loss of coverage because of the pandemic-fueled economic downturn.\n\nopen enrollment on the federal exchanges, which the trump administration cut in half to six weeks, ended on december 15. but biden has the power to reopen sign-ups, which will allow the uninsured to select policies, under a special enrollment period.\n\nbiden has turned to executive actions in his first days in office to swiftly start putting in place his agenda and to wipe out that of his predecessor.\n\nthursday's focus is set to be on health care. biden is also expected to sign measures strengthening medicaid, as well as rescinding the mexico city policy on abortion and review the title x abortion referral restrictions.\n\naugmenting the affordable care act\n\nincreasing the number of insured americans by strengthening the affordable care act was at the heart of biden's health care campaign promises. however, his two main measures -- creating a government-run public option and increasing obamacare's federal premium subsidies -- will require congress and face plenty of opposition.\n\nreopening enrollment is a much easier lift, though it's unclear how much impact it will have.\n\nanyone who loses job-based health insurance coverage is already eligible to sign up on the exchanges within 60 days of becoming uninsured. enrollment in the first five months of 2020 jumped 46% compared to the same period the year before, the trump administration said in june.\n\nalso, more people have appeared to hold on to job-based coverage than expected, while those who have lost their employment and most of their income have turned to medicaid. between february and august, medicaid enrollment jumped by more than 5.8 million people, or 9.1%, according to federal data released in late december.\n\nduring the most recent open enrollment period, overall obamacare sign-ups for 2021 coverage increased when comparing the 36 states participating on the federal exchange both this year and last year -- the only time that happened under trump. but the number of new consumers for 2021 slid somewhat.\n\nmaking the changes work\n\nthe key to reopening enrollment will be publicizing it and providing help for people to sign up, according to a recent kaiser family foundation discussion with navigators who assist those looking for coverage on the exchanges. they also say the period should last more than six weeks.\n\nthe trump administration slashed advertising by 90% and deeply cut funding for enrollment assistance -- two measures biden is expected to reverse. unspent revenue from exchange user fees appear to have accumulated to more than $1 billion over fiscal years 2018 to 2020, according to kaiser.\n\njust over half of consumers who looked for coverage during the open enrollment period for 2020 coverage encountered difficulties, and nearly 5 million folks sought in-person help but couldn't get it, according to a kaiser family foundation analysis released monday.\n\nmany health care moves expected\n\nthursday's measures will likely be the first of many efforts to bolster the affordable care act and roll back trump administration health care actions.\n\namong biden's top priorities will likely be saving the law itself from being declared unconstitutional by the supreme court. the justices are currently considering a case brought of a coalition of republican state attorneys general -- and backed by the trump administration. it revolves around congress reducing the penalty for not having health insurance to zero several years ago, which the states argue rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional and the entire law invalid.\n\nthe case will continue even if the justice department under biden withdraws, because it originated with texas and other republican-led states. but the president could work with the new democratic majority in congress to short circuit the gop states' legal argument -- by setting the penalty at a $1, for instance.\n\nbiden will also likely want to reverse various measures the trump administration put in place to chip away at the affordable care act. these include broadening the duration of short-term health plans to a year, and, more recently, allowing georgia to stop using the federal exchange , healthcare.gov, and shift to a private sector model instead. the centers for medicare and medicaid services went a step further in recent weeks, establishing a pathway for all states to do this for 2023.\n\nbiden's health care officials are also expected to focus on medicaid.\n\nthe supreme court recently agreed to consider the approval of work requirements in arkansas and new hampshire, which were voided by lower courts.\n\nthese measures run counter to biden's promise to expand access to medicaid so his administration is expected to seek to limit or undo these waivers during his term, as well as possibly restore the criteria on waivers' impact on increasing coverage.\n\nalso, congress has limited states' ability to trim their medicaid rolls during the public health emergency. the biden administration may want to continue some of those provisions after it ends.
washington (cnn) president donald trump made 44 false claims last week, 30 of them in a press conference and two interviews during his two-day trip to the world economic forum in davos, switzerland.\n\ntrump made 16 false claims about ukraine, 13 about impeachment and nine about the economy.\n\nhe made 12 false claims in his davos press conference . he added 10 in his interview with maria bartiromo of fox business and eight in his interview with joe kernen of cnbc.\n\nwhile 44 false claims in one week would be a lot for most politicians, it is below trump's average of about 60 false claims per week since july 8, when we started tracking this data at cnn. the week we're discussing here, from january 20 through january 26, ranks 22nd out of the 29 weeks we have tracked.\n\ntrump is now up to 1,729 false claims since july 8.\n\nthe most egregious false claim: obama and trade\n\ntrump, who frequently seems to have his predecessor on his mind for no particular reason , is fond of claiming he has managed to do things president barack obama could not -- whether or not obama actually failed to do these things.\n\nlast week, touting his trade discussions with the european union, trump said at the davos press conference: they haven't wanted to negotiate with past presidents, but they're going to negotiate with me. he continued later: ...our country wanted to make a deal under president obama. the eu refused to talk to him.\n\nthe european union didn't only talk to obama on trade -- it engaged in three years of extensive though unsuccessful negotiations with obama's administration on a proposed free trade agreement, the transatlantic trade and investment partnership.\n\nthe most revealing false claim: manufacturing jobs\n\nthe economy has added 487,000 manufacturing jobs under trump. manufacturing job growth slowed significantly in 2019, with a total gain of just 29,000 jobs from january through december, but the president still has a pretty good true story to tell here.\n\ninstead, trump often chooses to spout fiction. he said in a speech to mayors last week: we've created 700,000 manufacturing jobs.\n\ntrump has consistently exaggerated manufacturing job growth -- and as the actual number of jobs created has continued to grow, he has continually increased the inaccurate figure he uses. when the actual number was around 350,000, he said it was almost 500,000. when it was just over 400,000, he said it was 600,000.\n\nthe most absurd false claim: trump's lying\n\ntrump noted at the davos press conference that he had opposed the impeachment of president bill clinton. he mused, though, that clinton did a lot of bad things -- such as a lot of lying.\n\nfair enough. but then trump said the following with a straight face: now, with me, there's no lying.\n\nhere's this week's full list of 44 false claims, starting with the ones we haven't previously included in one of these weekly roundups.\n\nimpeachment\n\ntrump's lying\n\ntrump said of his opposition to clinton's impeachment: but in a certain way, i was sticking up for clinton -- for bill clinton...i mean, what he did was nothing good. there was a lot of lying going on. there were a lot of things -- a lot of bad things. now, with me, there's no lying. there's no nothing. -- january 22 press conference in davos, switzerland\n\nfacts first: trump's claim that with me, there's no lying is itself clearly false. he has been so broadly dishonest about ukraine and impeachment that we were able to compile a : trump's claim that with me, there's no lying is itself clearly false. he has been so broadly dishonest about ukraine and impeachment that we were able to compile a list of 65 different false claims he had made on the subject.\n\njohn bolton and the democrats\n\nthey didn't want john bolton and others in the house. they were in too much of a rush. now they want them all in the senate. not supposed to be that way! -- january 20 tweet\n\nfacts first: trump can criticize house democrats for being in too much of a rush with their impeachment inquiry to subpoena bolton, trump's former national security adviser. but it's not true that they didn't want bolton. democrats asked bolton on october 30 to testify voluntarily on november 7. he declined to appear -- because trump's white house directed current and former administration officials not to participate in the inquiry.\n\ndemocrats decided against issuing a subpoena because they were concerned about the possibility of a lengthy court battle. you can read a full fact check here\n\nwhat happened after trump released the transcript\n\nwhen schiff made up the phony story, and he repeated it to congress and the world -- and it was a totally phony story -- then i released the transcript...when we released that conversation, all hell broke out with the democrats, because they say, 'wait a minute. this is much different than shifty schiff told us.' -- january 22 press conference in davos, switzerland\n\nfacts first: as we have repeatedly : as we have repeatedly noted , trump released the rough transcript of his july phone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky before, not after, house intelligence chairman adam schiff delivered an exaggerated rendition of the call at a committee meeting. when trump released the transcript, therefore, democrats did not say it was different than what schiff had said.\n\na fox news poll on the impeachment trial\n\nmajority of people say 'the u.s. senate already has enough information!' @foxnews -- january 26 tweet\n\nfacts first: the fox news poll trump : the fox news poll trump appeared to be referencing found that 48% of people questioned said the senate already has enough information to make its decision on trump's articles of impeachment, versus 44% who said the senate needs to hear more witness testimony. forty-eight to 44 is a plurality, not a majority.\n\naccomplishments\n\nmark zuckerberg's white house visit\n\n...and mark zuckerberg was in the white house two weeks ago and he said, 'you're number one on facebook.' -- january 22 interview with fox business' maria bartiromo\n\nfacts first: zuckerberg, the chairman and chief executive officer of facebook, has not been to the white house since a : zuckerberg, the chairman and chief executive officer of facebook, has not been to the white house since a dinner with trump there in october, about three months prior to this trump claim, facebook spokesman dave arnold told cnn. arnold declined to comment on what zuckerberg said to trump, and trump wasn't clear what he meant by number one.\n\ntrump has a long history of moving past events closer to the present, intentionally or unintentionally.\n\nthe individual mandate and obamacare\n\nwe've done well with health care anyway. we got rid of the individual mandate. and if you look at that, that was a big thing with obamacare. that was the end of obamacare. -- january 22 interview with fox business' maria bartiromo\n\nfacts first: the individual mandate, which required americans to obtain health insurance, was indeed a key part of obamacare -- but it was not the end of obamacare when republicans : the individual mandate, which required americans to obtain health insurance, was indeed a key part of obamacare -- but it was not the end of obamacare when republicans repealed the mandate in their 2017 tax bill. key components of obamacare remain.\n\nthe bill did not eliminate obamacare's expansion of the medicaid insurance program for low-income people, the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage, or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases. while trump continued to take other steps to weaken obamacare , much of it still exists.\n\nobama, the european union and trade\n\ntrump said he was going to start negotiating a trade deal with the president of the european commission, then added, they haven't wanted to negotiate with past presidents, but they're going to negotiate with me. he also said: ...our country wanted to make a deal under president obama. the eu refused to talk to him. -- january 22 press conference in davos, switzerland\n\nfacts first: it's not true that the european union refused to talk to obama about trade. in fact, the european union : it's not true that the european union refused to talk to obama about trade. in fact, the european union engaged in three years of negotiations with the obama administration on a possible us-eu free trade agreement, the transatlantic trade and investment partnership. the negotiations faltered in 2016\n\nmichael bloomberg and hillary clinton\n\nbut he (bloomberg) had a deal with hillary clinton that he was going to become secretary of state. it was very simple. people know that. and it wasn't going to happen. it was going to go to terry mcauliffe. i mean, so they were playing with michael. -- january 22 interview with cnbc's joe kernen\n\nfacts first: there is no evidence clinton had a deal to give the secretary of state post to either bloomberg, the former new york city mayor now running for the democratic presidential nomination, or mcauliffe, the former governor of virginia.\n\ntrump may have been basing his claim on a hacked 2015 email exchange released by wikileaks in 2016. clinton adviser neera tanden asked bloomberg adviser howard wolfson about a media report about some democrats having approached bloomberg to run against clinton in the 2016 election.\n\nas the new york post reported , wolfson responded that the idea was laughable. tanden soon asked what role bloomberg might want in a clinton administration, saying, is like ambassador of china way too small. wolfson responded, secty of state which ain't gonna happen.\n\ntanden then forwarded the exchange to clinton campaign chairman john podesta, but the emails do not show any kind of deal. bloomberg's campaign did not respond this week to a request for comment; tanden told cnn this week: there was absolutely no deal. period. it was a random email from me to a good friend, who works for him.\n\ntanden said she has never even heard any discussions about mcauliffe as secretary of state, like ever. at cnn's request, chris bolling, executive director of mcauliffe political action committee common good va, put trump's claim to mcauliffe, then quickly called back laughing. he said mcauliffe had said, i would love to be secretary of state, but i had no deal to be secretary of sate.\n\nthe length of drug trials\n\npraising china for cracking down on illegal fentanyl, trump said china's quick trials last merely one day. he continued: ours take 15 years; theirs take one day. -- january 24 speech to mayors\n\nfacts first: trump might have been intending this as non-literal hyperbole, but nonetheless, us drug trials do not last 15 years. even the : trump might have been intending this as non-literal hyperbole, but nonetheless, us drug trials do not last 15 years. even the trial of drug lord joaquin el chapo guzman took three months.\n\nchina's legal system, of course, affords few rights to accused people, almost all of whom are swiftly convicted . in the us, some cases last longer than others, and appeals can extend the process, but veteran lawyers said trump was way off. kenyen brown, a former us attorney in alabama who now has a private litigation practice, said trump's comment was hyperbole to the point of being ridiculous.\n\nthe typical possession with intent to distribute or drug conspiracy federal drug trial concludes after two to three days tops. of course there are outliers in a few more complicated cases but the president's comment is nonsensical, he said in an email.\n\ntrump was exaggerating even if he was describing the timeline for an entire case, not just the trial alone. president trump's statement is a gross exaggeration and it is not true, said david haas, a former federal prosecutor in florida who is now a criminal defense lawyer and has represented people accused of drug trafficking. most federal cases are resolved, either by plea or trial, within months of being filed. that length can vary but it would be unusual for any federal case to be pending longer than 12-18 months.\n\nrepeats\n\nhere are the repeat false claims we have previously fact checked in a weekly roundup:\n\nimpeachment\n\nthe timing of schiff's comments\n\nremember this: when schiff made up the phony story, and he repeated it to congress and the world -- and it was a totally phony story -- then i released the transcript. and: we have people that are corrupt, like adam schiff, who misquotes -- i don't mean 'misquotes' -- makes up a statement. he had no idea that i was going to release the transcript. he never thought i'd do that. and for that, i thank the president of ukraine, because we got their approval. he had no idea i was going to do that. -- january 22 press conference in davos, switzerland\n\nit was so bad, where he goes before congress, and he makes a statement that i made, and it was a total fraud. i never made it...that's why i released the conversation, because if i didn't release it, people would have said that i made the statement that he made. -- january 22 interview with fox business' maria bartiromo\n\nit's a fraud. i watched schiff prior to this, he wouldn't say it now -- can't -- but he tried to make up a statement that i made. that's why i released the transcript. -- january 24 interview with fox news' raymond arroyo\n\nfacts first: trump can reasonably criticize schiff for schiff's comments at a house intelligence committee hearing in september; as we've written : trump can reasonably criticize schiff for schiff's comments at a house intelligence committee hearing in september; as we've written before , schiff's mix of near-quotes from trump's phone call with zelensky, his own analysis, and supposed parody was at the very least confusing. but schiff spoke the day after trump released the rough transcript, not before trump released the transcript.\n\nschiff's comments and the law\n\nshifty is now exposed for illegally making up my phone call, & more! -- january 26 tweet\n\nfacts first: schiff's words were not illegal. as trump previously : schiff's words were not illegal. as trump previously acknowledged , the constitution includes a specific provision that gives members of congress immunity from legal jeopardy for comments during official meetings.\n\nmarie yovanovitch and trump's portrait\n\nbut i am not a fan of that ambassador, just so you understand. from what i understand, and i heard this a long time ago -- she wouldn't put my picture up. -- january 24 interview with fox news' raymond arroyo\n\nfacts first: there is no evidence that yovanovitch refused to hang trump's photo at the us embassy in ukraine. it took the trump administration more than nine months after his inauguration to distribute an official photo of trump to government buildings such as embassies, cnbc : there is no evidence that yovanovitch refused to hang trump's photo at the us embassy in ukraine. it took the trump administration more than nine months after his inauguration to distribute an official photo of trump to government buildings such as embassies, cnbc reported in 2017. more than seven months into the term, the white house told the washington post that trump had not yet sat for the photo.\n\na state department official who has recently served in kiev said the former ambassador never sought to prevent trump's photo from being put up at the embassy. the official said the photo did not arrive until late 2017.\n\nyovanovitch's legal team did not respond to cnn's request for comment, but nbc received this response from a person connected to her legal team: the embassy in kyiv hung the official photographs of the president, vice president, and secretary of state as soon as they arrived from washington, d.c.\n\nthe timing of aid to ukraine\n\nremember this, they got their money and they got it early. -- january 22 interview with fox business' maria bartiromo\n\nso they got the money. in fact they got it very early. -- january 22 interview with cnbc's joe kernen\n\nnow, here's the other thing: they got their money long before schedule. they got all their money. -- january 22 press conference in davos, switzerland\n\nfacts first: the aid to ukraine : the aid to ukraine did not arrive early or before schedule.\n\nwhile trump did lift his freeze on the aid on september 11 , more than two weeks before a september 30 legal deadline, the delay caused by trump's freeze meant that $35 million of the $391 million in aid could not make it out the door in time to meet the deadline, according to impeachment testimony from mark sandy, deputy associate director for national security in the office of management and budget. to deal with this problem, congress had to pass an extension of the deadline. had that provision not been included, then any unobligated funds as of september 30 would have expired, sandy testified.\n\nthe government accountability office, a nonpartisan watchdog agency that works for congress, concluded that the aid freeze broke a law, the impoundment control act. (the office's report was released the week after trump made this comment. you can read a full story here .)\n\nthe whistleblowers disappearing\n\nthere was supposed to be a second whistleblower. what happened to him?...there was supposed to be an informer. what happened to the informer? all of these people disappeared. and when they saw this transcript, they said, 'we got problems.' but they went ahead because they were already there because they -- they had a phony, concocted story made up. -- january 22 press conference in davos, switzerland\n\n...the second whistleblower (who vanished after i released the transcripts)... -- january 23 tweet\n\nfacts first: there is no evidence that either the second whistleblower or a source for the first whistleblower, whom trump calls the informer, have disappeared, much less that they said we got problems when trump released the rough transcript of the july call with zelensky. the second whistleblower's lawyers had always said that this person -- who was revealed after trump released the rough transcript -- : there is no evidence that either the second whistleblower or a source for the first whistleblower, whom trump calls the informer, have disappeared, much less that they said we got problems when trump released the rough transcript of the july call with zelensky. the second whistleblower's lawyers had always said that this person -- who was revealed after trump released the rough transcript -- never planned to file a separate whistleblower complaint, merely to offer corroborating information in private.\n\nthe whistleblowers have not vanished, bradley moss, a colleague of mark zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on twitter in october, when trump made another version of this claim.\n\neuropean aid to ukraine\n\nwhat nobody says -- this is very important to me: why isn't germany paying? why isn't uk paying? why isn't france paying? why aren't the european nations paying? why is it always the sucker -- united states? that's one. -- january 22 press conference in davos, switzerland\n\nbut i want to make sure, also, in addition to collusion, there's something else i'm always stressing. why isn't germany and france and uk and all these other countries in europe that are much more affected than us -- why aren't they paying something? -- january 22 interview with fox business' maria bartiromo\n\nfacts first: european countries, including france and germany, have provided hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of assistance to ukraine since russia's invasion in 2014.\n\nzelensky acknowledged european help during his meeting with trump at the united nations in september, though he said the world's efforts had been inadequate so far: and, i'm sorry, but we don't need help; we need support. real support. and we thank -- thank everybody, thank all of the european countries; they each help us. but we also want to have more -- more.\n\nyou can read a full fact check here\n\npeople talking about trump's calls with ukraine's president\n\nand i watched -- they don't talk about my conversation. they don't talk about my transcripts. and: when we have the head of the world trade organization here, and he has to listen to this nonsense about a call that was perfect, that nobody talks about. i never see them talking about the transcription. i never see them talking

don't mention the calls, though. they never mention the calls. they talk about everything but the calls. -- january 22 interview with cnbc's joe kernen\n\nfacts first: to the contrary, trump's call with ukraine's president was the subject of widespread discussion among members of congress and in the media at the time; it was a central focus of democrats' impeachment push.\n\nrep. al green's comments\n\nas congressman green said -- al green. he's a beauty. as congressman green said, 'we got to beat him by impeachment because we can't beat him in the election.' -- january 22 press conference in davos, switzerland\n\nfacts first: trump was at least slightly exaggerating green's comments. in may, green said this: i'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get reelected. in september, when trump previously claimed green had said we can't beat trump without impeachment, green told cnn, i never said we can't beat the president.\n\nobama's aid to ukraine\n\npresident obama gave them nothing. he gave them pillows and sheets and things like that, and i gave them tank busters. -- january 22 interview with cnbc's joe kernen\n\nfacts first: obama

other side of the call saying it was good. -- january 22 press conference in davos, switzerland\n\nfacts first: ukraine's president and foreign minister have made comments that bolster trump's argument that he did not pressure ukraine to investigate his opponents in order to receive us military aid -- but the president and foreign minister have never called the phone call perfect.\n\nthe foreign minister, vadym prystaiko, has said, i have never seen a direct relationship between investigations and security assistance, according to reuters, citing russian news service interfax. and prystaiko has said trump's july phone call with zelensky was friendly and that i think there was no pressure.\n\nzelensky did say there had been no pressure from trump and made other statements to that effect, but he has not gone so far as to say trump did nothing wrong.\n\nin an interview published by time magazine in early december, zelensky did say, look, i never talked to the president from the position of a quid pro quo. that's not my thing. but zelensky continued: i don't want us to look like beggars. but you have to understand. we're at war. if you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us. i think that's just about fairness. it's not about a quid pro quo. it just goes without saying.\n\nthe accuracy of the whistleblower\n\nin a january 23 tweet , trump referred to the whistleblower who complained about his dealings with ukraine as the fake whistleblower.\n\nfacts first: the whistleblower's allegations have been proven highly accurate. in fact, the

mayors\n\nfacts first: mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the us border in particular. cnn reported on november 2: nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to mexico's northern border, where they've set up 20 checkpoints, mexican defense minister luis cresencio sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country's security strategy. at the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints.\n\nacting us customs and border protection commissioner mark morgan has offered similar numbers, telling reporters in

the economy added 487,000 manufacturing jobs between january 2017, when trump took office, and december 2019, : trump was exaggerating. the economy added 487,000 manufacturing jobs between january 2017, when trump took office, and december 2019, official data shows . the number is 514,000 jobs added if you go back to november 2016, the month of trump's election, as trump often likes to do.\n\nwhat obama said about manufacturing jobs\n\ni've created almost 700,000 manufacturing jobs. the past administration said manufacturing is dead, which i said, 'tell me about that. how do you -- you can't do that.' -- january 22 interview with cnbc's joe kernen\n\na lot of that goes to farmers and manufacturers. and we've created 700,000 manufacturing jobs, which we were told by past administrations -- but one, in particular -- that you would never have manufacturing jobs. i would say, you have to be -- i mean, how can you not have manufacturing jobs? so we're at 700,000 manufacturing jobs. -- january 24 speech to mayors\n\nfacts first: trump's comments appeared to refer to a remark obama made at a pbs : trump's comments appeared to refer to a remark obama made at a pbs town hall in 2016 -- but he was inaccurately describing what obama said.\n\nobama scoffed at trump's promises to bring back what obama called jobs of the past without providing specifics on how he would do so. contrary to trump's claims, though, obama didn't say manufacturing was dead or that new manufacturing jobs could not be created; obama boasted of how many manufacturing jobs were being created during his presidency, saying, we actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we've had in most of our history.\n\nwhy the european union was formed\n\nbut we find, i find, that the european union is tougher to deal with than anybody. they've taken advantage of our country for many, many years. it was actually formed for the purpose of taking advantage of the united states, if you really think about it. -- january 22 interview with fox business' maria bartiromo\n\nfacts first: experts on the european union say it was not formed to take advantage of the united states.\n\nthe president's claims are preposterous. the european communities (forerunner of the eu) were formed in the 1950s as part of a joint us-western european plan to stabilize and secure western europe and promote prosperity, by means of trade liberalization and economic growth, throughout the shared transatlantic space, desmond dinan, a public policy professor at george mason university who is an expert in the history of european integration, said in response to a previous version of this claim.\n\nus presidents have consistently supported european integration efforts.\n\nthe eu was launched in 1993, on the shoulders of the european communities, to promote peace and prosperity in the post-cold war era, an era also of rapid globalization. american officials may have had their doubts about the feasibility of monetary union, and about the possibility of a common (european) security and defense policy, but the us administration strongly supported further european integration in the 1990s, dinan said.\n\nthe trade deficit with the european union\n\ntrump claimed three times that the us has long had a trade deficit with the european union of $150 billion per year, or more.\n\nfacts first: the trade deficit with the european union was $114.6 billion in 2018, $101.2 billion in 2017, $92.5 billion in 2016. the deficit was $169.6 billion in 2018 if you only count trade in goods and ignore trade in services. but trump, as usual, failed to specify that he was using this more limited measure.\n\nwe'll ignore trump's characterization of trade deficits as losses, which is sharply disputed by many economists.\n\nmedian household income\n\ntrump claimed twice that median household income has increased by about $10,000 during his presidency. (he once said over $10,000 a family, once said almost a $10,000 increase.)\n\nfacts first: it's not true that household income gains under trump have already hit $10,000 in less than three years. a firm called : it's not true that household income gains under trump have already hit $10,000 in less than three years. a firm called sentier research found pre-tax income gains of about $5,500 between january 2017 and october 2019.\n\nyou can read a longer fact check here\n\nchina's economic performance\n\nyou know, they're having the worst year that they've had in 67 years, right? -- january 22 interview with fox business' maria bartiromo\n\nfacts first: china's second-quarter gdp growth of 6.2% and third-quarter and fourth-quarter gdp growth of 6% each were its : china's second-quarter gdp growth of 6.2% and third-quarter and fourth-quarter gdp growth of 6% each were its worst since 1992 , 27 years ago. trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that 27 years is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason.\n\nchina's agricultural spending\n\nthe fact is: we love our farmers, but they were doing -- the maximum they ever did was $16 billion in one year to china. -- january 24 speech to mayors\n\nfacts first: china spent $25.9 billion on american agricultural products in 2012, according to figures from the department of agriculture.\n\nhighway approval time\n\ntrump claimed that highways used to take 21 years to get approved, but we have that down to two years now. and we think we'll have it down to one year. -- january 24 speech to mayors\n\nfacts first: there is no apparent basis for trump's claim that it now takes just two years to get environmental approvals for highways. according to the federal highway administration's national environmental policy act (nepa) : there is no apparent basis for trump's claim that it now takes just two years to get environmental approvals for highways. according to the federal highway administration's national environmental policy act (nepa) page , the department's median environmental impact statement completion time was 47 months in 2018, up from 46 months in 2017 and 44 months in 2016.\n\nat a trump event earlier in january, council on environmental quality chairwoman mary neumayr said , the council on environmental quality has found that the average time for federal agencies to complete environmental impact statements is four and half years. further, for highway projects, it takes over seven years on average.\n\nbrad karkkainen, a university of minnesota law professor and expert on environmental and land use law, said in an email that he has never heard of a highway project taking 18 or 20 years, though it's certainly possible that when the median time was six or seven years, a few projects took twice as long, perhaps more. he said some projects can sail through much faster than the median time, but to suggest as trump does that the typical time has gone from 17+ years to two years is just nonsense.\n\nthe electoral college margin in 2016\n\ntrump claimed that his electoral college margin of victory in 2016 was 306 to 223. -- january 22 interview with fox business' maria bartiromo\n\nfacts first: hillary clinton earned 232 votes in the electoral college, not 223. this was not a one-time slip; trump has habitually said 223.\n\nair quality\n\nwe want to have the cleanest water on earth. we want to have the cleanest air on earth. our numbers, as you saw -- we had record numbers come out very recently. our numbers are very, very good -- our environmental numbers. our water numbers, our -- our numbers on air are tremendous...but we are doing better right now than we've ever done, in terms of cleanliness, in terms of numbers. -- january 22 press conference in davos, switzerland\n\nfacts first: by several measures, us air was : by several measures, us air was cleaner under obama than it has been under trump . three of the six types of pollutants identified by the clean air act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before trump took office, according to environmental protection agency data.\n\nadditionally, there were more unhealthy air days for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 american cities surveyed by the epa, up from 702. though there were significantly more unhealthy air days in obama's first term than there have been in trump's, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under obama.\n\nmilitary spending by nato members\n\nwell, you look at what i did with nato, $530 billion more. not total. more. -- january 22 interview with fox business' maria bartiromo\n\nfacts first: trump's math was wrong. stoltenberg explained during a meeting with trump on december 3 that non-us nato members have added a total of $130 billion to their defense budgets since 2016. by 2024, stoltenberg : trump's math was wrong. stoltenberg explained during a meeting with trump on december 3 that non-us nato members have added a total of $130 billion to their defense budgets since 2016. by 2024, stoltenberg said , this number will increase to $400 billion.\n\nthe $130 billion current increase cannot be added to the $400 billion increase expected by 2024; the $400 billion is a cumulative figure that includes the $130 billion.\n\njudicial confirmations\n\n191 federal judges (a record)... -- january 26 tweet\n\nfacts first: trump had not set a record for total judges appointed as of this point in a first presidential term.\n\naccording to data from russell wheeler, a visiting fellow at the brookings institution who tracks judicial appointments, trump had appointed 187 judges as of the day after this tweet -- two supreme court justices, 50 appeals court judges and 135 district court judges. wheeler said it's possible to get to a total of 191 judges by adding trump's three appointments to the court of federal claims and his designation of a sitting judge on that court as chief judge -- though he noted that claims court judges are generally not included in such counts.\n\nregardless, trump did not hold the record at the time: president jimmy carter had appointed 197 judges as of the same date in his presidency, wheeler said. and as a percentage of the federal judiciary, trump's 187 appointments represented 21% of all judgeships -- lower than the percentage for president richard nixon (32%), carter (29%) and clinton (22%).\n\ntrump did have the record for the total number of appeals court judges appointed, wheeler said.
washington, dc - february 27: senate minority leader charles schumer (d-ny) (l) and house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-ca) deliver a 'prebuttal' to president donald trump's upcoming address to a joint session of congress at the national press club february 27, 2017 in washington, dc. trump has been invited by speaker of the house paul ryan (r-wi) to deliver a speech tuesday on the floor of the house of representatives.

[picks up a knife, bangs its base on the table.] the gavel makes all the difference in the world … i didn't mean to pick up the knife. [laughter.] the awesome power. the speaker has awesome power.\n\nyou don't have to take it from pelosi – the national review, a conservative magazine and website, called the omnibus spending bill a self-humiliation and trump, hearing that criticism from across the gop spectrum, has made noises about trying to cut some of the spending democrats secured in negotiating the $1.3 billion deal.\n\non how she keeps democrats united\n\npelosi: i'm really good at what i do. i'm a legislative virtuoso. i really love legislating. it takes knowledge, and experience, institutional memory. i was forged in the intelligence committee and especially the appropriations committee. i know how you can reach agreement.\n\nher fundraising prowess hasn't hurt either. but again, her ability to keep her side together – where, as an example, house republicans since taking over the majority have been faced with repeated factional clashes – is remarkable in an age when more junior members are increasingly willing to take on leadership.\n\non former house speaker john boehner's new gig on the board of a cannabis company\n\npelosi: transactional. transactional.\n\ni'm joining the board of #acreageholdings because my thinking on cannabis has evolved, boehner announced back in april. i'm convinced de-scheduling the drug is needed so we can do research, help our veterans, and reverse the opioid epidemic ravaging our communities.\n\npelosi, it seems, doesn't quite buy that account.\n\non the 'tim ryans or seth moultons' who might challenge or back a challenge to her leadership\n\npelosi: inconsequential. they don't have a following in our caucus. none.\n\nmaybe she's out of touch or, much more likely, she's done the math, knows the caucus has her back and decided to play some chin music for her would-be challengers.\n\non who will succeed her and who, she's pretty sure, will not\n\npelosi: i don't know. i think there are lots of people who have worked very hard, and are more in line for what will happen one of these times. but they're not to be considered [among] who those people would be. i mean, there are people who work very hard to win the elections, who have been in legislative battles. people who paid their dues. not to put anybody down. anybody is consequential. but i have great support in my caucus. i'm not worried about that. and i'm certainly not worried about them.\n\nsee above.\n\non the push to get her to stand down and whether democrats managing only a small majority in the midterms would add pressure\n\npelosi: i think some of it is a little bit on the sexist side – although i wouldn't normally say that. except it's like, really? has anyone asked whatshisname, the one who's the head of senate?\n\n[aide jorge aguilar who is sitting beside pelosi] mcconnell.\n\nmcconnell. i mean he's got the lowest numbers of anybody in the world. have you ever gone up to him and said, 'how much longer do you think you'll stay in this job?'\n\nnobody ever went up to harry reid and said that. nobody ever says that to anybody except a woman. but it's a thing.\n\nand you know what? you get the upside and the downside of it. the one thing i want women to know is that you don't walk away from a fight. you don't let them make your decisions for you. i don't mean to sound arrogant. but i am confident. i am confident.\n\ndemocrats – especially the progressive left – have been making the case that the party needs to operate more ruthlessly and with less concern for airs and appearances. here, pelosi shrugs off a line of attack on her leadership while tucking in a jab – just for fun! – at mcconnell.
las vegas (cnn) michael bloomberg remained a target of his democratic presidential rivals thursday night, as former vice president joe biden and sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts harshly criticized the former new york city mayor during cnn town halls in las vegas .\n\ntheir criticism came the day after bloomberg was assailed for his past support for stop-and-frisk policing, offensive remarks he's accused of making about women, and more in his first appearance on the democratic presidential debate stage.\n\nhere are four takeaways from the biden and warren town halls:\n\nwarren hits bloomberg's nondisclosure agreements again\n\nwarren opened her town hall by keeping up her attacks on bloomberg for refusing to release women who have signed nondisclosure agreements at his company, saying they should be able to tell their stories.\n\nshe arrived onstage with a draft release document that she said she had written and would send to bloomberg.\n\nso i used to teach contract law. and i thought i would make this easy. i wrote up a release and covenant not to sue. and all that mayor bloomberg has to do is download it. i'll text it, she said. sign it. and then the women, or men, will be free to speak and tell their own stories.\n\nwarren next read aloud, verbatim, what the document said. then she added: i think that the mayor should sign this and that we all have a right to see.\n\nshe said that failing to release the women from the nondisclosure agreements would be disqualifying for bloomberg. but, when pressed by cnn's erin burnett, warren said she'd still vote for him over president donald trump.\n\n'barack's best buddy'\n\nbiden, meanwhile, took issue with the more than $400 million bloomberg has spent on advertising -- with spots featuring former president barack obama praising the billionaire.\n\nhe's advertising himself to be barack's best buddy, biden said, referring to bloomberg's ads that feature obama's voice praising him.\n\nbut, biden said, the former mayor had opposed obamacare and was at odds with the obama administration on bloomberg's controversial stop-and-frisk policing policy.\n\nand the way he refers to people of color. ... i'm not even going to repeat the language he used about why he was doing this, biden said.\n\nlike warren, he lambasted bloomberg for failing to release the women at his company who had alleged misconduct from nondisclosure agreements.\n\nit's just wrong, biden said. how can you run against donald trump when you have, what is it, 10, 12, 14 ndas?\n\nbiden hits sanders on guns\n\nbiden also criticized sen. bernie sanders, saying the vermont independent has not lived up to his rhetoric on guns and has not done enough about the issue. he pointed to sanders' 1990s votes against gun control measures, when sanders was in the house of representatives.\n\nthe comments at his cnn town hall built on comments biden had made earlier in the day, when he called out sanders -- by name -- for opposing the brady act, which mandated federal background checks and a waiting period for some handgun purchases.\n\nit is not so much what you say you believe, biden said. it is what did you do and when did you do it.\n\nhe added: the fact is bernie has had a very different record than me for a long time. for example, i am the guy, as chairman of the judiciary committee, worked to pass very difficult legislation. the brady bill, which had background checks, as well as waiting period. bernie, when he was running for the senate of vermont and said it was a tough state to run in, he voted against it five times in the house of representatives.\n\nbiden then hit sanders for voting to exempt gun manufacturers from any liability. zero. they cannot be sued.\n\nwarren keeps on poking at sanders\n\nwarren has spent the last couple of days lighting up bloomberg, but she's also taken more subtle swipes at sanders.\n\non thursday night, warren continued on that path, questioning how any candidate -- including senator sanders -- plans to execute on their vision without blowing up the senate filibuster. later on, she suggested that sanders would have trouble bringing together democratic factions and other voters outside the party to defeat trump in november.\n\ndemocratic voters, she said, are nervous about a narrow vision that just doesn't speak to the americans who see real problems and want to see real change. but they are also worried about gambling on a revolution that won't bring along a majority of this country. she didn't name sanders then, but the implication was clear.\n\ni am a democrat, through and through, warren added. i have rock-solid values and i know how to get things done. i speak to all parts of our party and with things like the wealth tax, speak to independents and republicans.\n\nher criticisms came after she cast doubt on sanders' strategy -- or lack thereof -- for delivering on his medicare for all plan and did not let him off the hook over his medical records, saying he had made a promise to release all his medical records and i thought that was what he was going to do.

story highlights johnson said republicans don't have total agreement on a plan to replace obamacare the wisconsin republican said he expects the health law to be reformed step by step\n\n(cnn) —\n\nsen. ron johnson said thursday he will freely admit that republicans in the house and senate don't have total agreement on an obamacare replacement plan despite a late-night budget move to begin repealing the law.\n\nbut the wisconsin republican, speaking on cnn's new day, expressed confidence that congressional republicans could coalesce around a plan despite multiple competing proposals. he also suggested that the strategy to replace obamacare would involve a series of piecemeal reforms as opposed to a complete overhaul.\n\ni don't think you're going to see one massive plan like obamacare. you're going to see a step-by-step approach targeting the individual damage of the individual reforms, and we'll put in replacements for each individual one of those problems, johnson said. anyway, that would be my approach. other people have different ideas.\n\nthe wisconsin senator explained that the elements are pretty common across the competing obamacare replacement proposals.\n\nrepealing obamacare affects everyone\n\nfree market reforms, patient-centered, turning more and more of the decisions of insurance back to individuals and back to the states in terms of regulatory environment. all the essential health benefits. i mean, all these marked reforms that have caused premiums to double and triple those are things that need to be replaced with things that work, free market based reforms, johnson said.\n\njohnson's comments came the morning after an exhaustive legislation session that ended early thursday morning, with the senate gop advancing a budget resolution on party lines – 51 to 48 – that would initiate the long process of repealing obamacare, also known as the affordable care act.\n\nthe house is expected take a swift vote on the resolution, possibly as early as friday, which would trigger congressional committees to begin crafting a second bill that would roll back major parts of obamacare. though it will be weeks before congress votes on that bill, thursday still marked a victory for the republican party as it moves toward overhauling the country's health care system.\n\nstill, the largely symbolic exercise in the senate this week masks the fact that congressional republicans still haven't made significant progress on drawing up an obamacare replacement plan.\n\nand despite johnson's suggestion that the health law will be repealed and reformed step-by-step over an extended time frame, president-elect donald trump has turned up the pressure on the gop, saying at a news conference wednesday that repeal and replace will happen essentially simultaneously.
(cnn) —\n\none week ago we found out that special counsel robert mueller had concluded his 22-month investigation into russian interference.\n\nfive days ago, we got a four-page summary letter of mueller's report authored by attorney general william barr that made clear no conspiracy between the trump campaign and the russians had been established and that mueller did not reach a conclusion as to whether trump obstructed the investigation.\n\nand now, so closely removed to those two massive developments, which everyone – me included – expected to fundamentally alter trump's presidency and the course of the 2020 race, it appears as though most people have, well, moved on.\n\nfor his part, trump has taken on two new high-profile fights: joining a suit to repeal obamacare wholly and pledging, on twitter on friday, to close our southern border totally if and when two migrant caravans moving through mexico make it there.\n\nhe's already moved into weaponizing the mueller report – its full nearly 400 pages are yet to be released, though they're expected to be sent to congress in mid-april if not sooner – as an example of the broad-scale conspiracy by the so-called deep state against him. (he offers no evidence for those claims, of course.)\n\ndemocrats are divided as to the best next steps.\n\nsome (many?) argue that until the full mueller report is released, there can be no definitive conclusion about what trump did (or didn't do). and there are those, such as intelligence committee chairman adam schiff (d-calif.), who insist evidence of collusion already exists.\n\nothers in the party believe that short of exposing a cover-up by barr of what is really in the report, the main message to the american public will be that mueller didn't find collusion – and, therefore, democrats need to focus on health care, immigration and other issues a) that voters care more about and b) on which voters tend to favor democrats.\n\nthere's no question that when the mueller report comes out (which will likely be sometime next month) there will be another bump of interest. but if barr's summary hit the main points – and no collusion or obstruction is proven – then it's uniquely possible both parties won't be spending nearly as much (or any) time on the mueller report in six months.\n\nthe point: predicting how something like the mueller report lands with the public is a tricky thing – particularly when we don't know for sure what's in it. and it's possible that once we do know more of what mueller found – as opposed to just barr's top lines – perceptions could change. but the most likely outcome today is that the report goes out with more of a whimper than a bang – in political terms.\n\nmonday:\n\ntuesday:\n\nwednesday:\n\nthursday:\n\nfriday:\n\nsubscribe to the point newsletter for updates like this – and get a special 2020 edition delivered to your inbox this sunday night!

(photo by scott olson/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nwhat kind of president will donald trump actually be?\n\nthat was the big question in late 2016 and early 2017, following trump's gobsmacking election triumph. even after some 16 months on the campaign trail, the incoming president arrived in washington as something of a mystery to many americans, including, as it turned out, a few of those poised to work close at his side.\n\npolitical prognosticators, white house aides and even trump's outgoing predecessor would weigh in with a mix of predictions, promises and old truisms, the kinds of assessments that greet every new president. but trump quickly made clear, through words and deeds, that the old standards no longer applied.\n\nhere are four ideas about trump and his presidency that all held at least some mainstream currency at this time about a year ago – each of them now, if not laughable, then a testament to how profoundly the conventional wisdom surrounding the presidency, and the person inhabiting it, have changed.\n\n1. trump will change once he assumes the responsibility of the office\n\n04:03 - source: cnn barack obama's entire post-election news conference\n\nmaybe it was wishful thinking or a nudge to one particular audience member, but none other than then-president barack obama suggested, during a news conference days after the election, that the weight of the job alone might tamp down trump's boisterous tendencies.\n\nthis office has a way of waking you up, obama told reporters. those aspects of his positions or predispositions that don't match up with reality, he will find shaken up pretty quick because reality has a way of asserting itself.\n\nobama seemed to be referencing his own experience and calling back to an old chestnut about how the awesome power of the presidency can subdue, or reorient, its occupant. not so for trump, who has carried on during his first year in the oval office pretty much as he did on the stump in 2015 and 2016.\n\nthe former first lady, michelle obama, offered what turned out to be a more prescient take while campaigning for hillary clinton.\n\nthe presidency doesn't change who you are, it reveals who you are, she said, revisiting a line she'd used before while stumping for her husband.\n\n2. trump will be a master negotiator\n\none of trump's big selling points throughout the campaign, especially at the onset, as he sought to distinguish himself from the career politicians vying for the republican nomination, was his reputation as a deal-maker. the story always had some holes in it, but enough voters were clearly interested in seeing how his decades in private business would translate into a different kind of executive job.\n\nagain, though, reality has clashed with those hopes and expectations. though trump is clearly inclined to do deals, and relishes taking the big seat in any boardroom situation, he's failed to pass any meaningful legislation across party lines. his signature tax reform was done with a bare republican majority utilizing budget reconciliation measures even though it's likely to add $1 trillion to the deficits. he also struggled to bridge gaps within the gop congressional conference, which failed to repeal and replace obamacare when negotiations broke down in the senate.\n\ntrump's penchant for moving the goalposts – promising insurance for everyone or, as alleged more recently, shifting positions on a daca deal within a couple of hours – has actually been a hindrance to potential deal-making.\n\nhis grasp of the issues, too, has come under tons of scrutiny, most recently and notably when he openly agreed – on live tv – to democratic sen. dianne feinstein's suggestion that congress pass a bill to protect daca recipients before and separately from the gop's other immigration concerns. house majority leader kevin mccarthy jumped in to quash the prospect seconds later, but the incident further undermined trump's claims to being a top-level negotiator.\n\n3. he should be taken seriously, not literally\n\n01:38 - source: cnn how to take trump literally ... or seriously\n\nhe wasn't the first one to say it. in fact, he was only one of what seemed like millions. peter thiel, the billionaire investor and trump supporter, summed up his candidate's appeal – and what the press didn't understand – not long before election day.\n\ni think one thing that should be distinguished here is that the media is always taking trump literally, he said. it never takes him seriously, but it always takes him literally.\n\nthe root of this point, one intended more as an inverse analysis of trump's supporters than the man himself, spread over time and began to color views of what his presidency might be like. but it was, at least for those on the left, mostly wishful thinking.\n\nas we reported early and often, on the major issues trump has been – or tried to be – exactly the kind of president he pitched to american voters.\n\n4. trump will set off a lasting populist revolution\n\nphoto: evan vucci/ap white house chief strategist steve bannon listens at right as president donald trump speaks during a meeting on cyber security in the roosevelt room of the white house in washington, tuesday, january 31, 2017.\n\nthis view was promoted most clearly by since-deposed former chief strategist and campaign chief steve bannon, who shared his view of a future dominated by trumpism not long after his old boss became the president-elect.\n\nhere's how he explained it in a 2016 interview with, you guessed it, michael wolff in the hollywood reporter:\n\n 'the globalists gutted the american working class and created a middle class in asia. the issue now is about americans looking to not get f—ed over. if we deliver' — by 'we' he means the trump white house — 'we'll get 60 percent of the white vote, and 40 percent of the black and hispanic vote and we'll govern for 50 years. that's what the democrats missed. they were talking to these people with companies with a $9 billion market cap employing nine people. it's not reality. they lost sight of what the world is about.' \n\nas usual, bannon covers a lot of (shaky) ground in quick bursts of chatter, but his fundamental argument – that americans were ready to sign on for a half-century of right-wing populism in the halls of federal power – so obviously misunderstands trump and his way of thinking.\n\nfrom the jump, trump has employed a cadre of wall street veterans (the same globalists bannon derided and did battle with during his time at the white house) and pursued economic policies in line with establishment republican dogma. the tax cuts he signed last year were the logical end point, giving massive, permanent breaks to corporations and, well, a mixed bag to individuals and lower-earners.\n\nthe populist part of trump's presidency, as it turned out, has been more evident in his culture warrior tweeting than any meaningful policy initiatives. not quite the stuff that feeds and sustains a multi-generational movement.

(chip somodevilla/getty images)\n\nwhy is health care in the us so expensive?\n\n(cnn) —\n\na year ago, insurers were fleeing the affordable care act exchanges, worried about the law's uncertain future with republicans in control of the white house and congress.\n\n2019 is shaping up very differently … at least so far.\n\nlast july, it looked like 42,000 people in 61 counties were at risk of having no choice of carriers for 2018 – though ultimately, every county had at least one option after state regulators scrambled to convince insurers to cover the bare areas. still, the number of carriers who filed to participate in the exchanges for 2018 had dropped to 132, down from 167 a year earlier.\n\nnow, insurers are entering or returning to at least a dozen states, while others are expanding their presence in the states in which they operate. and last year's worries that some obamacare enrollees could be left stranded have not resurfaced.\n\nthis is a complete 180 from where were this time last year, said cynthia cox, director for the kaiser family foundation's program for the study of health reform and private insurance.\n\ni'm counting over a dozen new entrants to 2019

covered, and there's still time for these 38 https://t.co/rgyfh4rdns pic.twitter.com/pdmc2byllz — cynthia cox (@cynthiaccox) july 5, 2017\n\nthough some uncertainty still looms over obamacare, insurers are in a much better place this year than last, experts said. many have started making a profit in the individual market and the threat of congress repealing the law has waned.\n\ninsurers had several rough years on the affordable care act exchanges, with some racking up hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. the red ink led some insurers to leave or shrink their involvement in 2017 and 2018.\n\nthe election of president donald trump, who campaigned on repealing the health reform law on his first day in office, and congress' attempts to upend obamacare last year sent even more insurers running for the exits.\n\nthose that stayed jacked up their rates by 27%, on average, for 2018. this increase, which comes on top of a 21% hike the year before, helped them cover their policyholders' medical care. as of late 2017, many insurers had profitable individual market businesses, cox said.\n\nrelated: trump administration unveils alternative to obamacare\n\nalso, obamacare will remain the law of the land for now since republicans in congress can't muster enough votes to repeal it. insurers are monitoring two big actions that will affect the law – congress' repeal of the individual mandate penalty for 2019 and the trump administration's broadening of two alternatives to obamacare – but many feel they can cover those changes through increases in next year's premiums.\n\nthey can price for that, cox said, of the changes. they at least know the rules of the game.\n\nsome carriers are looking to return to markets they exited. take molina healthcare, which aggressively expanded on the exchanges until its board sent the ceo packing last year. the insurer then shrunk its presence for 2018, but is now looking to grow again. it has filed preliminary rate requests in utah and wisconsin for 2019 after having pulled out this year.\n\nwe will continue to evaluate our participation on a market-by-market basis, and are optimistic about the opportunity of offering to more prospective members our high quality, affordable options through the marketplace, the company said in a statement.\n\nother insurers are expanding their footprint. anthem, a major player on the exchanges, has filed to offer policies in an additional 17 counties in kentucky for 2019, for instance. this partially reverses the insurance titan's shrinkage of its coverage territory in the bluegrass state.\n\nasked why anthem decided to expand in kentucky this year, a spokeswoman replied with a statement saying ensuring consumers have access to individual health plans that offer greater affordability and access to quality health care remains our focus at anthem.\n\nanthem, which provided obamacare coverage in 14 states in 2017, but only nine this year, has not yet announced its participation in other states next year, she said. the insurer attributed its decision to downsize for 2018 to uncertainty in federal rules and operations, as well as a deteriorating individual market.\n\nrelated: anthem pulls out of virginia's obamacare exchange\n\nthe insurers' expansion means that more states will have at least two carriers in 2019, ensuring more competition for consumers. medica plans to cover every county in oklahoma, while wellmark will be everywhere in iowa. both these states have only one carrier this year.\n\nseveral of the insurers that are broadening their coverage territory are small start-ups. this includes oscar health, which started in new york when the exchanges opened in 2014. it has slowly been increasing its footprint, mainly adding large cities, such as dallas, los angeles and nashville.\n\nnext year, it plans to enter three new states – florida, arizona and michigan – and expand into new areas in ohio, tennessee and texas. the insurer feels the affordable care act market is stable in many parts of the country.\n\nwe believe it is and will be a great market for insurers, said nick reber, a senior vice president at oscar.
but on monday, he claimed credit for being the person who saved pre-existing conditions in your healthcare in a tweet blasting an ad by former new york city mayor and 2020 democratic candidate michael bloomberg that attacks the president's record on health care.\n\nthe ad is one of three bloomberg health care spots running in at least 26 states, according to the campaign.\n\nmini mike bloomberg is spending a lot of money on false advertising. i was the person who saved pre-existing conditions in your healthcare, you have it now, while at the same time winning the fight to rid you of the expensive, unfair and very unpopular individual mandate.....\n\nfacts first: trump's claim about protecting those with pre-existing conditions is false. though trump says he would do this, his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the affordable care act -- including joining a lawsuit aimed at striking down the law -- without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits.\n\nthe affordable care act barred insurers in the individual market from denying people policies or charging them higher premiums because of their health histories. also, carriers had to provide comprehensive coverage -- offering 10 essential health benefits, including maternity, mental health and prescription drugs.\n\nabout 54 million people had a pre-existing condition in 2018 that would have led them to be denied coverage prior to obamacare, according to the kaiser family foundation , a non-partisan research group. as many as 135 million people -- or about half of non-elderly americans -- could have faced discrimination in the individual market before the law was passed, according to the center for american progress , a left-leaning advocacy organization, which based its figure on a department of health & human services report released in the waning days of the obama administration.\n\ntrump has worked to undermine the affordable care act from his first day in office, when he issued an executive order directing agencies to interpret its regulations as loosely as possible. he championed congressional republicans' bills that year that would have weakened the law's protections -- which are among its most popular provisions and helped democrats retake the house of representatives in 2018.\n\nand his justice department is siding with a coalition of republican states that are fighting in federal court to invalidate the affordable care act. an appellate panel last month upheld a lower court ruling that found obamacare's individual mandate unconstitutional but sent the case back to the lower court to decide whether the entire law must fall.\n\nbloomberg, who called trump's prior assertions to protect those with pre-existing conditions a broken promise in the ad, responded on twitter that the president should ask the justice department to drop the lawsuit.\n\nthe law remains in effect while the case works its way through the court system. the administration last week told the supreme court in a filing that there's no rush for them to review the appellate court's ruling -- which obamacare's defenders , a coalition of democratic states and the house of representatives, are pushing justices to do. they argue that the lower court opinion poses a severe, immediate and ongoing threat to the nation's health care markets.\n\nthe president has said repeatedly that he would roll out a new health care plan that would protect those with pre-existing conditions, but he has yet to do so. last april, he backed away from pushing for a vote on a replacement plan until after the 2020 election.\n\nmeanwhile, he issued another executive order in late 2017 that would make it easier for americans to buy alternatives to the affordable care act that are cheaper, but offer fewer protections, such as short-term health plans . the law's defenders, however, fear that such plans could siphon off younger and healthier people, which could cause premiums to rise for those left buying policies in the obamacare exchanges.\n\nhis administration is also allowing states to make major changes to their obamacare markets, which could also leave low-income, older or sicker residents with few choices and higher costs. few states have taken the federal government up on this offer so far.\n\nthe white house defended trump's actions, saying in a statement: president trump has repeatedly stated his commitment to protect individuals with pre-existing conditions and his track record shows that he has consistently done what is necessary to improve care for the vulnerable by opening affordable options for those who were priced out of the market by obamacare, combating the opioid epidemic, protecting and improving medicare, enacting right-to-try, advancing kidney health, approving more generic drugs than ever before, committing to end hiv/aids within 10 years, and much more. while the media refuses to cover the ineffective provisions of obamacare that have made health care too expensive for too many, the radical left is doing americans with pre-existing conditions a disservice by making them a political pawn in their agenda to expand the scope of government.

(cnn) — el presidente de estados unidos, donald trump, atacó duramente a los medios el sábado durante un evento masivo en pennsylvania en el que promovió sus logros de los primeros 100 días de su gobierno, con un tono tanto divisorio como determinado mientras se alineaba con los sentimientos populistas de una ruidosa multitud.\n\n«es hora de que recordemos que somos un solo pueblo con un gran destino estadounidense, e independientemente de que seamos negros, cafés o blancos, todos tenemos la misma sangre roja de los patriotas, y todos compartimos las gloriosas libertades de nuestra magnífica nación», dijo trump, evocando la retórica populista de su discurso de inauguración, luego de pasar gran parte del sábado quejándose de las supuestas deficiencias de la prensa establecida.\n\nentre los favoritos de la multitud en los eventos de trump están los ataques del presidente a la prensa, lo cual volvió a ocurrir el sábado, mientras muchos de los medios asistían a la cena anual de corresponsales de la casa blanca.\n\n«un extenso grupo de actores de hollywood y medios de washington se están consolando los unos a los otros en un salón de hotel en la capital de nuestro país en estos momentos», dijo trump ante la multitud. «se han reunido para la cena de corresponsales de la casa blanca –sin el presidente. y yo no podría estar más emocionado que estando a 100 millas de distancia del pantano de washington, pasando la noche con todos ustedes y con una multitud más grande y con mucho mejores personas».\n\ntrump mantuvo ese tono divisorio durante todo su discurso, lo que llevó al antiguo asesor presidencial y analista político de cnn david gergen a calificar las declaraciones de «profundamente preocupantes» durante una edición especial del programa «cnn newsroom».\n\n«este fue el discurso más divisorio que le he escuchado a un presidente en funciones», dijo gergen. «otros podrían no estar de acuerdo. se dirigió a su base y trató a los otros oyentes, el resto de la gente a los que ha perturbado o que se la han opuesto, los trató básicamente como 'me importa un bledo lo que piensen porque ustedes francamente son el enemigo'. creo que fue un discurso profundamente preocupante».\n\npublicidad\n\ncomo se esperaba, el presidente abordó algunos de los problemas más importantes que ha intentado atajar durante los primeros 100 días de su gobierno. la amenaza de corea del norte, la aprobación de un plan de salud y la renegociación del acuerdo ambiental de parís estuvieron entre los temas abordados durante el discurso de casi una hora.\n\n«tomaré una decisión muy importante sobre el acuerdo de parís en las próximas dos semanas, y veremos qué sucede», dijo trump el mismo día en que manifestantes a favor de las acciones contra el cambio climático tomaron las calles de washington y otras ciudades de estados unidos.\n\nesta fue la primera ocasión en 36 años que un presidente de estados unidos en funciones no acude ni participa en la cena de corresponsales de la casa blanca. el presidente ronald reagan faltó a la cena por estar en el hospital cuando se recuperaba de un atentado, pero dio declaraciones vía telefónica. richard nixon fue el último presidente en saltarse la cena completamente.\n\npero sin importar donde estuviera, los reflectores estaban sobre trump el sábado dado que la fecha marcaba un importante hito en la carrera de cualquier presidente. después de servir como comandante en jefe durante 100 días, sus logros, así como sus fracasos, fueron ampliamente escrutados.\n\nen el papel, trump carece de un gran logro legislativo, tiene el menor nivel de aprobación de cualquier nuevo comandante en jefe desde la segunda guerra mundial, ha visto cómo algunas de sus metas claves en cuanto a inmigración han sido frenadas en los tribunales y no ha cumplido con su promesa de revisar el sistema de salud.\n\nel único mayor logro de trump ha sido la exitosa nominación del juez neil gorsuch a la suprema corte de justicia –algo que ningún presidente había logrado en sus primeros 100 días desde hace 136 años.\n\nlos primeros 100 días de trump también han estado plagados de controversia, por nombrar a su hija ivanka y a su yerno jared kuchner en puestos clave de la casa blanca o por las acusaciones de posibles nexos de algunos de sus asistentes de campaña con rusia.\n\nsus promesas de campaña en asuntos mayores como echar abajo la reforma de salud del expresidente barack obama, el obamacare, y la revisión del código fiscal aún deben ser promulgadas.\n\nincluso su promesa de construir un muro en la frontera con méxico se ha quedado atrapada en un debate sobre los gastos, sin apoyo de los demócratas y poco o nada de avances.

(though when i noted that on twitter, someone ironically, and correctly, shot back: good point! we're fortunate that pardons, general mayhem, and nuclear annihilation can't occur on weekends or holidays.)\n\nthe reality, though, is that the constitutional mechanisms to remove him are cumbersome and give him the benefit of the doubt. in the 25th amendment scenario, bolton suggested you could end up with trump and pence dueling over who has power as president: do you think donald trump will back down when he gets a letter from mike pence? think again. so are we better off with two presidents competing with each other in the last 13 days? i think you risk making the situation which is as bad as it is, far worse.\n\nrevulsion grows. it's clear there's bipartisan disgust with trump's fomenting the angry mob that attacked the capitol on wednesday. following chao's resignation thursday, it's clear there's bipartisan disgust with trump's fomenting the angry mob that attacked the capitol on wednesday. following chao's resignation thursday, education secretary betsy devos announced her early departure , too. a number of aides have also resigned from the white house.\n\neven the editorial board of the wall street journal called on trump to spare the country another impeachment fight and instead go away quietly, making the case that he should follow the example set by richard nixon.\n\nformer top officials also condemned their former boss.\n\nformer attorney general william barr: the president's behavior was a betrayal of his office and supporters.\n\nformer defense secretary james mattis: trump fomented mob rule and was enabled by pseudo political leaders whose names will live in infamy as profiles in cowardice.\n\nformer dhs secretary and white house chief of staff john kelly said he'd vote to remove trump from office if he were still at the white house.\n\nkelly's successor as chief of staff, mick mulvaney, left his ambassadorial post in protest.\n\nand facebook suspended trump's account at least through the end of his presidency.\n\nhow to deal with trump's enablers?\n\nthere is some satisfaction each time a former trump aide or official finally cuts ties with him. it is a validation of what many have long warned: that his unstable presidency is a threat.\n\nbut it is also -- after four years of remarkably consistent outrageous behavior and lack of leadership by the president -- too late.\n\nmcconnell stood up. he cast what he called the most important vote of his career against the effort, led by trump, to overthrow the electoral college.\n\nbut it comes after four years of mcconnell doing everything he could to keep quiet about the president while wringing as many conservative judges as possible from the equation.\n\ncotton stood up. good on republican sen. tom cotton of arkansas for condemning his fellow republican sens. josh hawley of missouri and ted cruz of texas, who helped carry out trump's agenda by seconding house objections to the electoral votes that were based on trump's own false claims.\n\neven graham! republican sen. lindsey graham of south carolina almost made a joke of his break with trump during a speech on the senate floor wednesday night, saying he'd been on a republican sen. lindsey graham of south carolina almost made a joke of his break with trump during a speech on the senate floor wednesday night, saying he'd been on a hell of a journey with trump but he's had enough now. he's been trump's most loyal foot soldier in congress.\n\nfacebook and twitter stood up. but how many falsehoods were spread by trump on facebook and twitter before they started marking them during the election season and suspended his accounts when he tried to spark a rebellion against congress?\n\nthe writing was on the wall. couldn't any of these organizations or people have woken up a smidge earlier? perhaps when trump was lying his way through his impeachment?\n\na last-minute conversion is better than no conversion at all. but it doesn't erase what came before. and it doesn't inoculate them from what's to come.\n\ntrump will leave office, somehow. but he won't go away entirely, even if his twitter account is deactivated. and the nerve he touched was there before his election and it will be there when he leaves.\n\ncotton, hawley and cruz -- i'd be willing to bet all three men run for president in 2024. and they'll be fighting for trump voters.\n\nmcconnell will be creating new and creative methods of obstruction as soon as he can.\n\nand facebook and twitter will need to figure out how to better deal with conspiracy theories spreading on their platforms.\n\ni haven't even gotten into fox news here. that's a whole different animal, since the network's anchors were quickly pivoting, somehow, to pin blame for the insurrection on antifa, the golem of liberal protesters they've helped conjure.\n\nthere's still a virulent strain of trumpism in the gop. just a few senators supported objections to the electoral vote after trump's mob entered their chamber. more than half of house republicans did. ( just a few senators supported objections to the electoral vote after trump's mob entered their chamber. more than half of house republicans did. ( tracker here .)\n\nwhen lawmakers and pundits say what we all witnessed wednesday isn't who we are as a country, they are wrong. it may not be who anyone wants the us to be, but trump's brand of violent, racist politics is now part of the american political landscape. it will take work to weed it out.\n\nthe capitol should not be vulnerable\n\nthere are going to be many rightful recriminations for the rioters' ability to walk, smiling, up to capitol hill, break through barricades, shatter windows and have their way with the capitol.\n\nwhy weren't they all ready for a protest that had been long planned and how can anyone justify the fortress planning for black lives matter protesters versus the fear police had of some trump supporters, many of them dressed in battle gear and surely toting guns?\n\nthere's also the question of the national guard, which took so very long to mobilize. there should be answers for that.\n\nwhy spend $700b on the military if they can't defend the capitol from attack? asked connecticut's democratic sen. chris murphy on twitter.\n\ndon't just shut the capitol down, please. one great and important feature of the us capitol, the seat of a democracy, is openness and accessibility. it's the seat of power, and yet the public could go inside, see the debates, talk to the lawmakers. i hope an end result of this stupidity is not a complete clampdown.\n\nthe view from abroad\n\none way to view what's going on is from the outside. i was riveted by the british journalist robert moore's itv report -- reminded me of old-school nightline, actually -- because his tone is that of an outsider who can't believe this is going on in the us, of all places. watch it here\n\namerica's long journey as a stable democracy appears to be in genuine doubt, he says at the end, over pictures of rioters and police going at it.\n\nit has been a long journey, but not as long as we americans like to tell ourselves.\n\na friend sent me a clip of the comedian seth meyers , who took the jokes out of his show wednesday and made the point that universal suffrage to men and women has been in place in this country only since the 1960s.\n\nmultiracial, pluralistic democracy is fragile and precious and requires our vigilant stewardship and protection, he said. and anyone not willing to forward that project with the fullness of their effort must be shamed and disgraced and removed from office. and that must start immediately with donald trump.\n\nthat's a remarkable thing to hear on network television, which is not known for its political statements. it was no less weird than another thing that happened wednesday, which was that the national association of manufacturers -- a trade group not usually involved in radical politics -- called for trump's removal.\n\nit is certainly proof that the more despicably trump and his mob act, the further isolated they become from the country's mainstream.\n\njustice takes a long time\n\ni also spent some time thinking today about what we might be talking about a year or two from now, long after trump is out of office, whichever way that happens.\n\njust about exactly 160 years after it seceded from the union on jan'ry 19, 1861, over the issue of african slavery, and specifically because it feared the presidency of abraham lincoln, georgia is sending a black man to the us senate\n\ndon't let one ugly day of backlash and the disgusting images of rioters carrying confederate flags through the capitol completely distract you from that power shift. the confederate flag-toting rioter is the extremist, quickly kicked out of the building. the black man is the senator with the six-year term.\n\nreading georgia's 1861 secession declaration, which i found at the library of congress website , it strikes me that back then, secessionists were trying to repeal their association with the constitution. today, rioters are more likely to say they're protecting it, even though their effort to stop the counting of georgia's electoral votes, which this year went to the candidate who made a point of rejecting racism, would actually rip the constitution to shreds.\n\nclarification: an earlier version of this story suggested pelosi had committed to moving ahead with impeachment, but those discussions are still underway. this story has also been updated with additional developments.
washington (cnn) a federal appeals court on wednesday rejected a request to reconsider last month's ruling that declared the individual mandate of the affordable care act unconstitutional.\n\nin an 8-6 vote, judges on the 5th us circuit court of appeals said the court would not rehear the case. a three-judge panel of the 5th circuit, in a 2-1 split , had sided with texas, other republican states and the trump administration in december by ruling against the president barack obama-signed health care law.\n\ncalifornia and other democratic-led states defending obamacare have appealed the ruling to the us supreme court, which has denied a request to fast-track the appeal -- meaning it is possible a supreme court decision may not be issued until after the 2020 presidential election.\n\nwednesday's request for the 5th circuit to reconsider the case en banc, meaning as a full panel rather than only the three judges, was made by one of the judges on the appeals court, who was not identified in the docket. all eight judges who voted against hearing the case were appointed by republican presidents. five of the six who said they would rehear the case were appointed by democrats, including three by obama.\n\nthe affordable care act remains in effect as the appeals play out.

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\ntrump: i never was a fan of mccain, i never will be\n\n(cnn) —\n\nfor donald trump, feuding comes as easily as breathing.\n\nhis latest shots at the late john mccain and his escalating social media altercation with george conway, the husband of white house counselor kellyanne conway, are the latest examples of how the president just cannot resist a fight. but they also offer a fresh glimpse into a personality that is built on conflict, the search for an enemy and an insatiable quest for personal victories.\n\nsometimes the president initiates a clash. at other times he revives old battles like a warrior consumed by previous victories.\n\neven though mccain died nearly seven months ago, trump cannot put their acrimony – which caused the late arizona senator to plan his funeral as an extended rebuke to the president, to rest.\n\nhe explained to reporters in the oval office tuesday why he is still taking shots at the vietnam war hero, including in a recent twitter rant.\n\ni was never a fan of john mccain and i never will be, trump said, citing his foe's vote against a gop effort to repeal obamacare.\n\ni think that's disgraceful, plus there are other things, he said.\n\ntrump complained during weekend that mccain spread the fake and totally discredited dossier drawn up by former british spy christopher steele that alleged that he was compromised by russia. mccain said he provided a copy of the dossier to the fbi. and one of his associates, david kramer shared a copy with buzzfeed, according to court records.\n\nfor his critics, trump's obsessions with mccain and other foes are not just unseemly. they are a sign of a man who is poorly suited to the job of president, and even temperamentally unfit to serve as commander in chief in a dangerous world.\n\nbut trump's refusal to let bygones be bygones is also a political device. he's used the endless personal battles to stir up his base and give them something to unite against. the feuds offer definition to his life, his business, his 2016 campaign – where he picked off a golden generation of gop candidates one by one – and now his presidency.\n\nthe president reopened hostilities with george conway on tuesday morning, after the well-known lawyer on monday tweeted a definition of narcissistic personality disorder to suggest that trump showed many of the symptoms.\n\na total loser! trump wrote, while retweeting a claim by his 2020 campaign manager brad parscale that conway was sore because trump refused to give him an administration job he wanted.\n\nconway was quick to double down in their feud, tweeting at the president: congratulations! you just guaranteed that millions of more people are going to learn about narcissistic personality disorder and malignant narcissism! great job!\n\nkellyanne conway said monday she did not share her husband's concerns about trump's mental state.\n\nold feuds burn bright\n\ntrump's propensity to wage old feuds was evident in his wild tweet storms this weekend. he again went after john mccain – even though the republican senator from arizona has been dead for nearly seven months.\n\nthe president mocked the vietnam war hero, inaccurately for coming in last in his class, and rebuked him for voting against a gop bid to repeal obamacare.\n\ntrump can rarely leave crooked hillary clinton alone either – apparently not content with beating her in the 2016 election.\n\nhe rarely gets through a week without taking a shot at former president barack obama – and often seems largely motivated by undoing his predecessor's legacy – perhaps in revenge for being mocked at the white house correspondent's dinner in 2011.\n\nand he's still simmering over past showdowns with other nemeses, such as the nfl: some of the league's aficionados have traced trump's fury over players taking a knee and team owners' reactions to his anger at failing to secure a franchise in the league in the 1980s.\n\nthe $40,000,000 commissioner must now make a stand, trump demanded in a tweet at the start of last season.\n\nformer attorney general jeff sessions was never allowed to forget the president's fury at sessions' recusing himself from the russia investigation – and trump's anger is prone to pop up from time to time even though the former alabama senator left office last year.\n\nthe president, for instance, blasted sessions as another beauty in a tweet storm against senior justice department officials in february.\n\nfor a time, trump was involved in an ugly personal spat with nba superstar lebron james – insinuating in a tweet last year that king james wasn't very smart – one of many of the president's altercations that have seemed to have racial overtones.\n\nthe president fed another ancient grudge over the weekend – taking a new shot at nbc's saturday night live, which has caught his ire repeatedly because of alec baldwin's searing impression of him.\n\nand he never lets up on his duel with reporters, who he has called enemies of the people.\n\ntrump has his foreign targets too, and returns to them again and again. he harbors a particular grudge for german chancellor angela merkel – but any us ally that he sees as freeloading off american generosity is especially likely to get a tongue lashing.\n\nnever let it go\n\nfor trump's critics, his refusal to let a fight go – even ones that he has won – speaks of a brittle personality that is not just off-putting but is dangerous in a commander in chief. trump's tweet storms over the last three days, in which he blasted gm, the fake news media, mccain, insufficiently supportive fox news anchors, joe biden and other targets came as much of the world was consumed by a true outrage: the aftermath of attacks on mosques in new zealand, which killed 50 people.\n\nthough trump condemned the attacks on friday, he shrugged off questions about a worrying rise in white supremacist groups and did not offer direct empathy to muslims – raising new questions about his history of anti-muslim rhetoric.\n\nit was a performance that prompted george conway, the husband of white house counselor kellyanne conway, to suggest that his wife's boss was suffering from a narcissistic personality disorder.\n\nyet the president's boiling feuds are just one area in which opinion about him is irrevocably polarized.\n\nthe trump base has never had much time for mccain – even if taking potshots at a dead war hero might appear unseemly.\n\nthe lock her up chants that ring through trump rallies express his supporters' views of clinton.\n\nin fact, the endless battles that trump wages, while rendering him unfit for office in the eyes of critics, are exactly the kind of politically incorrect behavior that made him so popular with his supporters in the first place.\n\nthose americans don't believe trump is on a mental precipice or that his frenzied, self-obsessed tweeting makes him unfit for the presidency.\n\na lesson of the last three years in politics is that the outrage of the media and elite opinion in cosmopolitan cities doesn't just fail to weaken the president, it often strengthens him – one reason why he picks the fights he does.\n\nnot every audience interprets trump's flights of outrage the same way.\n\nafter an expansive attempt to discredit special counsel robert mueller, facilitated by conservative media, trump may insulate himself to some extent from the outcome of the russia investigation.\n\nhis weekend assaults on management and the unions linked to the closure of a gm auto plant in ohio could be seen as gross presidential interference in the affairs of a private company. but the fact that the president is so fixated on the issue on a sunday afternoon could be interpreted by others as evidence that he cares about honoring a campaign promise to reinvigorate us manufacturing.\n\nin many cases – i am not saying in every case – he is saying a lot of the same things that people are talking about around their neighborhoods, around their dining tables, at their watering holes, said marc lotter, strategic communications director for trump's 2020 campaign, on cnn.\n\nand that is why he is connecting with people, he said.\n\napproval rating\n\ntrump's all-fighting-all-the-time presidency certainly works with those americans who like him best. though the cycle of constant conflict is one reason why his re-election is far from assured even with the economy cruising and with unemployment as low as it's been in 50 years.\n\na new cnn/ssrs poll released monday showed that the president's approval rating has ticked up to 42%.\n\nconservatives are likely to be far less concerned than trump's opponents about his condemnation of the attacks in new zealand, which he called a horrible massacre on sacred places of worship while not condemning the white supremacist extremism that seems to have been their trigger.\n\nit doesn't look like not reaching out to muslims after the attack is going to hurt him with the base much either.\n\nfor much of the weekend, however, it seemed as though trump had walked into a trap in the oval office on friday when he told reporters that he didn't think white supremacist movements were a growing problem around the world.\n\nhis comment unleashed a global torrent of criticism and critical media coverage.\n\nbut if trump's intention was to ensure he did not get too far out ahead of his base he may have been the one springing the trap – positioning himself yet on one side of a confrontation with the media likely to solidify his base.\n\nthe fake news media is working overtime to blame me for the horrible attack in new zealand. they will have to work very hard to prove that one. so ridiculous! trump tweeted on monday.\n\nyet trump's strategy – constantly feeding his base's more inflammatory political instincts to solidify his position – comes with risks.\n\na more popular rival than his old sparring partner, clinton, and a more energetic democratic base could make his path to re-election even more narrow.\n\nif so, governing by feud may turn out to have been a big mistake.

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthis country is stuck with obamacare. republicans can't find the votes to repeal or replace it. democrats can't agree on how to make it better. president donald trump just wants to move on from it. but it's so ingrained at this point that if the courts suddenly end it, it could completely disrupt the us health insurance system – and not just for people who buy insurance on the exchanges created by the law.\n\nif you have health insurance or you at some point would like to have health insurance, what happens to obamacare will affect you.\n\nthe passage, the supreme court decision, the implementation and the attempted repeal of the law that remade the american health care system have each been separate dramas over the past nine years. now begins chapter 5: the second court drama.\n\nthe trump administration's about-face endorsement of a federal judge's december decision in texas that the affordable care act is unconstitutional could create an untenable situation since, essentially, all americans with health insurance have obamacare now.\n\ninvalidating the entire law could strip coverage from tens of millions of americans and strip protections for coverage enjoyed by hundreds of millions more. cnn's tami luhby has documented exactly how the law touches every american – not just the more than 20 million who have obtained medicaid or insurance through a state or federal health insurance exchange.\n\nthe fact is that exactly nine years after its passage, the affordable care act, sometimes referred to as obamacare, has remade the us health insurance system.\n\nno sign of a white house plan\n\ndespite trump's tweet tuesday that the gop will become the party of healthcare!, his pledge to take care of people with pre-existing conditions, and his complaint wednesday that health care coverage is too expensive, it is increasingly, glaringly, alarmingly clear that the white house has no plan for what comes next if courts ultimately agree that the affordable care act is now unconstitutional.\n\nthe department of justice is part of the executive branch, and the president has faith in his department of justice to do the right thing, senior adviser kellyanne conway told reporters tuesday. and we're watching litigation. we don't predict the outcomes of litigation like that. we'll see what happens.\n\nit's a law that touches every american and gives millions of people coverage – and we'll see what happens?\n\nthere's a good chance the supreme court will ultimately weigh in, a process that could take years. but the new harder stance from trump's justice department gave the case renewed and immediate interest.\n\ni'm flabbergasted, john kasich said tuesday after the court filing. he's a republican former ohio governor who has emerged as a frequent trump critic and is now a cnn contributor. as governor, he took federal money for ohio to expand medicaid under the law even though he has long pointed to its problems. but kasich said the country has to address the problems, not cut out the old law. he's pushed a proposal hashed out with a bipartisan group of governors.\n\nthese things can all be fixed, but you don't need to just rip coverage away from 20 million people, he said. that's ridiculous.\n\nhow to undo something that's part of society\n\nthe main trunks of the law are a massive expansion of medicaid and a total re-creation of the individual insurance market, but it mandated new protections in the group insurance market, forcing insurers to cover americans with pre-existing conditions and allowing insured people to keep covering their adult children up to age 26.\n\nit also rewrote rules for medicare, for hospitals and for prescription drug coverage.\n\npeople have forgotten what it was like before the affordable care act, said gary cohen, the vice president of government affairs for blue shield of california, one of the country's largest insurers. before that he worked in the obama administration and helped implement the affordable care act.\n\nnot only if you were sick, but if you had ever been sick, you were priced out and charged differently than other individuals, cohen said.\n\nto trump's point that health care still seems too expensive, cohen agreed that prices are too high, but he argued they would be higher without the affordable care act.\n\ni'm sure that people aren't focused on what the trend in health care was before and after, but there's a lot of research that the prices have moderated, he said.\n\nwhile the administration now supports invalidating the entire law through the courts, how the affordable care act would be undone is causing experts to scratch their heads.\n\nthe affordable care act is now so woven into the rest of the health care system that trying to take it out could upset things that were not even related, julie rovner of kaiser health news said tuesday on cnn.\n\nstates have spent years modifying their medicaid programs around the affordable care act, for instance. that process continues as the states that have not accepted obamacare funding to expand medicaid with federal dollars slowly move in that direction now that the government is allowing them waivers from certain requirements or to impose new rules that people work before qualifying to receive medicaid.\n\nyou think about how long the bill was and how many regulations have been put in place around the law over that nine-year period. it affected every source of how people get health care, said sara collins, a vice president at the commonwealth fund, which researches health care issues and pushes for improvements to the health care system.\n\ni cannot overstate how disruptive this would be, she said.\n\ntrump's quest to end the affordable care act\n\ntrump's efforts along with republicans on capitol hill to repeal the law failed in 2017, but his administration's attempts to chip away at it have continued, most importantly when they used a new tax law to lower the tax assessed for not having health insurance to $0.\n\nit is the lowering of the penalty that kicked off this latest drama. the judge in texas agreed with a group of republican state attorneys general that a $0 tax isn't a tax and so chief justice john roberts' tortured decision upholding the affordable care act was thrown into jeopardy. that's a turn of events worthy of a mystery novel. what will happen to obamacare next!?\n\nthat john roberts, who – thanks to a new book by cnn's joan biskupic – we know vacillated on how to deal with the law the first time around, might now be invested in it.\n\nopponents of the law said the possibility of it being undone should be a wake-up call to congress to fix it.\n\nthe doj's announcement is yet another data point that congress needs to pass legislation that helps, not harms, americans' ability to achieve their goals of lower health care costs, better choices, and access to care when they are sick, said marie fishpaw of the conservative heritage foundation, who endorses a plan that would give more power to states.\n\namerican voters respond to health care\n\ndemocrats paid a political price for passing the affordable care act, losing control of the house of representatives in a wave of backlash and conservative anger.\n\nthen republicans paid a political price for coming so close to repealing it, losing control of the house last fall, and 41% of voters said in exit polls that the most important issue facing the country was health care. democrats bombarded swing districts with ads about health care and warnings about the threat of losing insurance market protections like the ban on insurance companies excluding people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nat the same time, 69% of voters in 2016 said the health care system needs major changes. those sentiments have given democratic presidential candidates new energy to push the health care system further left, with new proposals for a public health insurance option or even a socialized health care system where the government takes over the insurance market. that debate was temporarily sidelined tuesday as democrats rallied around protecting the affordable care act.\n\nmore recently, american voters say by 55% to 32% that they'd rather improve the current health care system than replace it, according to a new quinnipiac survey. those results were published in the context of the debate pushed by democrats about whether to move toward a single-payer health insurance system, but they're interesting in terms of the possibility the trump administration could go in the other direction and have the entire affordable care act invalidated. the number of americans with favorable views of the law itself has grown and hovered around 50% in recent years, according to the kaiser family foundation, as the percentage of americans with unfavorable views has fallen below 40%.\n\nred states moving toward medicaid\n\nthe effort to undo the law in the courts continues even as more red states find ways to expand medicaid under it. kasich was among the first republican governors to buy into the almost entirely federally funded expansion of medicaid, and he has defended that decision ever since.\n\nbut even more conservative governors are following suit, especially now that the federal government is agreeing to special waivers from rules for accepting the money, like requiring the insured to work.\n\nthere were developments in georgia this week, for instance, where the gop-controlled legislature gave new power to the republican governor.\n\nfourteen states have rejected the expansion of medicaid envisioned by the affordable care act. they're mainly in the south, although wisconsin is also represented. every one of them supported trump in 2016. but 16 states that supported him have expanded medicaid.\n\nin all, 4.9 million people who would otherwise be eligible for medicaid under the affordable care act aren't currently. some of those qualify for help to buy private insurance, but more than 2.5 million are caught in a technicality of the law: they make too much to qualify for medicaid but not enough to qualify for help to buy private insurance. nearly half of these in the so-called coverage gap are spread across texas and florida, according to the kaiser family foundation.\n\neven as red states come around and take medicaid funds, it doesn't mean the republicans who run those states will be supporting the law anytime soon, but it could make it so much more difficult for so many more people if the courts suddenly take it away.

choice: go back to the drawing board, give up or reach across the aisle? even before the loss friday morning, there was bipartisan recognition it was time for the parties to hold hearings\n\n(cnn) —\n\nsenate republicans returned to capitol hill on monday evening after still smarting from the dramatic collapse of their obamacare repeal bill last week.\n\nmany were in agreement: it's simply time to move on.\n\nif the question is should we stay on health care until we get it done, i think it's time to move on to something else, sen. roy blunt of missouri said as he walked into a leadership meeting. come back to health care when we have more time to get beyond the moment we are in. see if we can put some wins on the board.\n\nsen. john thune, the third-ranking gop leader, said that until someone shows us how to get that elusive 50th vote, i think it's over.\n\nfinance committee chairman orrin hatch of utah, whose panel oversees both health care and tax policy, said he was ready to tackle taxes.\n\ni think we are moving on to tax reform but that doesn't mean we can't do more than one thing at a time, he said, adding that senate republicans should not vote on health care again unless there is a reasonable chance of success.\n\nthe glum outlook from key gop senators on monday came just days after senate republicans were unable to pass a bill to repeal key provisions of obamacare. in a surprise move, republican sen. john mccain joined sens. lisa murkowski and susan collins in voting no early friday, denying senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and president donald trump a significant political victory.\n\nover the weekend, trump urged the senate to try again.\n\nunless the republican senators are total quitters, repeal & replace is not dead! trump tweeted. demand another vote before voting on any other bill.\n\noffice of management and budget director mick mulvaney said on cnn's state of the union that it is officially the white house position that members stay in washington until they've passed something.\n\nwhat you're seeing there is the president simply reflecting the mood of the people, mulvaney said. you promised folks you would do this for seven years.\n\nbut those remarks drew swift pushback from senate majority whip john cornyn.\n\ni don't think he's got much experience in the senate as i recall, cornyn said of mulvaney. he's got a big job. he ought to do that job, and let us do our job.\n\nfor the senate, valuable time has already been wasted and there is no signal that any member who voted to defeat the bill friday is going to be ready to change his or her vote.\n\nmcconnell already spent two months trying to hammer out a health care deal with his conference in endless private meetings and exhaustive lunches. in the end, the only thing he could offer was a skinny repeal that did away with obamacare's mandates and temporarily repealed the medical device tax. mcconnell's closing argument was simply to pass something so that republicans senators could go to conference with the house. that wasn't enough.\n\nnow, mcconnell has other things on his plate. the senate needs to pass a defense bill, raise the debt ceiling and fund the government.\n\nbut trump isn't the only one urging the senate to keep trying.\n\non friday, house republicans gathered for a conference where they bemoaned the senate's dysfunction, playing at the top of their gathering gordon lightfoot's the wreck of edmund fitzgerald, a song about a ship disaster.\n\nthey played it, one gop member told cnn, as an analogy to the senate quitting on the verge of victory.\n\nnow, senate republicans face a daunting choice. do they go back to the drawing board, give up or reach across the aisle?\n\ntwo gop senators – bill cassidy of louisiana and rand paul of kentucky – went to the white house on monday to try to continue negotiations. cassidy was asked later if he would like to see additional votes on the issue before the senate recesses in the next few days. he said that decision was entirely up to mcconnell, and that getting one of the three no senators to change his or her mind would be a tough task.\n\nmeanwhile, fresh calls for bipartisanship came from both sides of the capitol.\n\ncollins of maine, one of the three republicans who voted no on friday, said it was time for congress to search for a bipartisan solution to problems like high premiums, unaffordable deductibles and the lack of choices for patients.\n\ncollins called on senators to produce a series of bills aimed at addressing pressing issues in health care. she said the first issue the senate should focus on would be to stabilize the insurance markets.\n\ni certainly hope the administration does not do anything in the meantime to hasten that collapse, collins said on state of the union.\n\nnew jersey rep. leonard lance, a moderate republican who had voted against the house bill to repeal obamacare earlier this year, reacted to the senate vote by saying it is now time to work in a bipartisan capacity.\n\ni would encourage our democratic colleagues to come to the table, lance said.\n\nthere are signs that democrats are ready to negotiate. instead of gloating after the republican loss, democratic leaders in the house and senate had both reached out to house speaker paul ryan by friday morning. senate minority leader chuck schumer had gone as far as silencing collective democratic cheers on the senate floor during the 2 a.m. vote when arizona republican sen. john mccain voted down the bill.\n\nschumer said in a press conference friday morning that he did that in hopes that republicans and democrats can work together in a bipartisan way.\n\neven before the loss on friday morning, there was some bipartisan recognition that it was time for the parties to hold hearings on health care. sen. lamar alexander, the chairman of the senate's health committee, announced he would hold hearings. and sen. ron johnson, the chairman of the homeland security and government affairs panel, announced friday he plans to work through his committee as well.\n\none of the top items on democrats' agenda is to stabilize the obamacare exchanges.\n\nit's unclear if the administration is going to be willing to help, however.\n\ntrump has suggested that republicans could just let the market collapse. right now, the trump administration is responsible for making cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers. if the administration stopped, it could lead to more uncertainty.\n\nhe's going to make that decision this week, white house counselor kellyanne conway said on fox news sunday. and that's a decision that only he can make.\n\non saturday, trump tweeted: if a new healthcare bill is not approved quickly, bailouts for insurance companies and bailouts for members of congress will end very soon!\n\nwill senate move?\n\nall eyes are on the senate. house republicans, who passed a comprehensive repeal-and-replace bill, say that if something is going to happen on health care it will have to come from across the capitol.\n\ngop rep. tom cole said friday that he did not expect any real push by house republicans to restart any obamacare repeal efforts, particularly because the house has such a full calendar in september.\n\nif the party wants to keep health care on the front burner, cole said, that is entirely on the senate.\n\nwe're prepared to go forward if the senate does anything, but it seems to me the first thing that has to happen is the senate needs to figure out what it can do, cole told cnn. i don't think there's appetite in the house to launch anything.
(cnn) president-elect joe biden unveiled a $1.9 trillion relief package thursday that included more stimulus payments and other direct aid, but don't expect to see those funds in your bank account anytime soon.\n\nthere's a lot that has to happen before biden's plan -- which is chock-full of measures long favored by democrats -- becomes law. and even though democrats will soon control the white house and both chambers of congress, that doesn't mean lawmakers will follow biden's suggestions to the letter.\n\nthe earliest the money could start flowing? maybe mid- to late february, said kevin kosar, resident scholar at the right-leaning american enterprise institute and co-editor of the book congress overwhelmed.\n\nbut it also calls for making some larger structural changes, such as mandating a $15 hourly minimum wage, expanding obamacare premium subsidies and broadening tax credits for low-income americans for a year.\n\nit's the first of two measures biden has planned to right the nation's economy and fight the coronavirus. he intends to announce a recovery strategy at his first appearance before a joint session of congress next month.\n\na president can propose ideas, but congress passes the laws\n\nbiden's relief proposal now shifts to congress, where it may change substantially as democratic leaders transform it into a bill. they must decide whether they want to use a special legislative process called reconciliation, which would require only a simple majority of votes to pass the senate -- eliminating the need for republican support -- but would limit the provisions that could be included. also, reconciliation could be used only sparingly each year.\n\nanother factor that could determine the path and speed at which lawmakers act is the health of the economy, said john hudak, a senior fellow at the brookings institution. if the nation's jobs report in early february shows a continued deterioration of the labor market , for instance, congress may be spurred to move faster and approve more assistance.\n\nwhatever leaders decide, the effort is expected to have an easier time passing in the house -- which approved a $3 trillion relief package last may that contained measures similar to those in biden's plan -- even though democrats now hold a slimmer majority there.\n\nspeaker nancy pelosi, a california democrat, will have to maintain the support of nearly all of her party's members, including some progressive lawmakers who have already said they want to send even more help to americans in need.\n\ndemocratic rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york told the washington post on thursday that people should get an additional $2,000 in stimulus checks on top of the $600 they received as part of the $900 billion relief package lawmakers passed last month -- more than the $1,400 top-off payment biden is suggesting.\n\na narrow margin in the senate will mean compromises\n\nthe senate is where a multitude of hurdles lie. democratic sen. chuck schumer of new york will soon take over as majority leader from republican sen. mitch mcconnell of kentucky, but the chamber will be split 50-50, with vice president-elect kamala harris available to break any tie votes.\n\nin coming weeks, senators will have their hands full with president donald trump's impeachment trial and with voting on the president-elect's cabinet nominees , none of whom have been confirmed yet.\n\nin his speech thursday night, biden said he would like to work with members of both parties to enact his american rescue plan, indicating that he wants to go the traditional route, which would require the backing of at least 10 republican senators.\n\nbiden will play an important role in the negotiations on capitol hill.\n\na new president and a new tone from the white house can put some pretty significant pressure when pressure is needed, hudak said. for this to happen in some expedited time, it's really going to require significant influence from the president, especially on key senators.\n\none of those senators is joe manchin, a moderate democrat from west virginia. he has recently expressed doubts over providing $2,000 in stimulus payments, preferring a more targeted approach.\n\ni'm on board by helping people that need help, people that really can't make it, people that don't have a job, manchin told cnn's jake tapper on sunday. sending checks to people that basically already have a check and aren't going to be able to spend that or are not going to spend it -- usually are putting it in their savings account right now -- that's not who we are.\n\nsecuring support can be a laborious process.\n\nall the work of getting people lined up -- that's likely going to take a lot of time, kosar said.
washington (cnn) president donald trump made 115 false claims over the last two weeks of february, during which he faced a growing crisis over the coronavirus pandemic , visited india, held four campaign rallies and addressed the conservative political action conference.\n\ntrump made 67 false claims from february 17 through february 23; that was the 11th-highest total of the 34 weeks we've fact checked at cnn. he added 48 false claims from february 24 through march 1; that week ranked 25th out of 34. as usual, many of the false claims were ones he has uttered before.\n\ntrump made 55 of the 115 total false claims at the four rallies: 19 in las vegas, 17 in phoenix, 10 in colorado springs and nine in north charleston, south carolina. he added 13 false claims in his speech to cpac, nine in his press conference in new delhi and six apiece at three events -- one of which was a press conference on the coronavirus.\n\nas concerns about the possible economic impact of the virus mounted, trump made 27 false claims about the economy. he made 16 about health care, 15 about trade, 14 about china.\n\ntrump is now up to 1,990 false claims since july 8, when we started our counting at cnn. he is averaging about 59 false claims per week.\n\nthe most egregious false claim: russia, if you're listening\n\ntrump was at a press conference at his doral resort in florida in 2016 when he made his russia, if you're listening request for help obtaining hillary clinton emails. the journalists in the room were silent as he spoke.\n\nthe fact that there is notorious video footage showing all this has not stopped trump from making up an alternative history. he told cpac on february 29 that he said russia, if you're listening as a joke, in front 25,000 people, and he was laughing afterward along with others in the crowd -- but the media cut off the clip so quick at the end so that people couldn't hear all of this laughing.\n\nas we've explained before , trump's version of the story is imaginary.\n\nthe most revealing false claim: the flu mortality rate\n\ndr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at the national institutes of health, told usa today on february 17 that the mortality rate for the seasonal flu is about 0.1%, 0.2% at the most.\n\non february 26, fauci appeared with trump at a white house press conference. there, another doctor, cnn chief medical correspondent sanjay gupta, told trump that the flu has a mortality rate of 0.1%. trump said, correct. but then, moments later, trump said, and the flu is higher than that. the flu is much higher than that.\n\nit is not. trump, though, has preferred during the coronavirus crisis to own the spotlight himself, while frequently providing inaccurate or incomplete information, rather than cede airtime to experts who could convey accurate information.\n\nthe most absurd false claim: ronald reagan's crowds\n\ntrump's need to exaggerate the size of his crowds and to compare himself favorably to previous presidents combined to produce this doozy of a false claim, made during his rally in las vegas on february 21, about ronald reagan: i thought he was a great guy, great president, didn't like his policy on trade, that's ok ... but if he came to las vegas, you know, they'd have a ballroom. they'd have 500, maybe a thousand people.\n\nit took one google search to find out that an estimated 7,000 people attended a reagan rally at las vegas' convention center in 1982.\n\nhere is the full list of 115 false claims, starting with the ones we haven't included in one of these roundups before:\n\nviruses\n\nawareness of ebola in 2014\n\ncomparing the coronavirus outbreak with the ebola situation of 2014, trump said, at that time, nobody had ever even heard of ebola. -- february 25 press conference in new delhi, india\n\nnobody knew anything about it. nobody had ever heard of anything like this. -- february 26 coronavirus press conference\n\nfacts first: some americans certainly didn't know a whole lot about ebola before 2014, but the claims that nobody had ever even heard of ebola and that nobody knew anything about it are absurd. ebola was discovered : some americans certainly didn't know a whole lot about ebola before 2014, but the claims that nobody had ever even heard of ebola and that nobody knew anything about it are absurd. ebola was discovered in 1976 . it had been the subject of considerable media coverage in the next three decades, not to mention scientific study.\n\nebola mortality\n\non two occasions, trump contrasted the fatality rate for the coronavirus with the fatality rate for the ebola outbreak of 2014 to 2016, saying in the other case (ebola), it was a virtual hundred percent and that with ebola -- we were talking about it before -- you disintegrated. if you got ebola, that was it.\n\nfacts first: while the ebola outbreak of 2014 to 2016 certainly had a much higher death rate than the coronavirus, the ebola rate was never virtually 100%; for the entire epidemic, it was : while the ebola outbreak of 2014 to 2016 certainly had a much higher death rate than the coronavirus, the ebola rate was never virtually 100%; for the entire epidemic, it was about 40% overall in the three african countries at the center of the situation. it was higher in the early stages of the outbreak, but it was never true that every infected person disintegrated.\n\nthere were 28,616 suspected, probable, and confirmed cases in guinea, sierra leone, and liberia and 11,310 deaths, according to the centers for disease control and prevention.\n\nas of mid-september 2014, world health organization (who) researchers reported that there was an estimated fatality rate of 70.8%. but the rate fell later in the epidemic with lessons learned in improving treatment, said julie fischer, associate research professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at georgetown university and director of the elizabeth r. griffin program. still, even at 70.8%, death was never guaranteed for infected people, as trump suggested when he said if you got ebola, that was it.\n\nit was never 100%. that is just patently untrue, fischer said.\n\nthe flu death rate\n\ngupta, cnn chief medical correspondent, told trump at a press conference, mr. president, you talked about the flu and then in comparison to the coronavirus. the flu has a fatality ratio of about 0.1%. trump said, correct. but trump later disputed the figure, saying, and the flu is higher than that. the flu is much higher than that. -- february 26 coronavirus press conference\n\nfacts first: even if trump meant that the flu has a much higher fatality rate than 0.1% -- rather than meaning that the flu's mortality rate is much higher than that of the novel coronavirus -- he was wrong. the mortality rate for seasonal flu is about 0.1%, 0.2% at the most, fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at the national institutes of health -- who appeared with trump at this same news conference -- : even if trump meant that the flu has a much higher fatality rate than 0.1% -- rather than meaning that the flu's mortality rate is much higher than that of the novel coronavirus -- he was wrong. the mortality rate for seasonal flu is about 0.1%, 0.2% at the most, fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases at the national institutes of health -- who appeared with trump at this same news conference -- told this to usa today in mid-february, echoing the comments of other experts and centers for disease control and prevention data since 2010\n\napple and china\n\nand if you read, tim cook of apple said that they are now in full operation again in china. and: you probably saw that -- as i mentioned, tim just came out and he said apple is back to normal in terms of production in their facilities in china. they've made a lot of progress. -- february 29 coronavirus press conference\n\nfacts first: trump was overstating what cook told fox business. cook had not said apple's production in china was back to normal or that plants in china were in full operation. rather, he : trump was overstating what cook told fox business. cook had not said apple's production in china was back to normal or that plants in china were in full operation. rather, he said that plants in china were getting back to normal.\n\nwhen you look at the parts that are done in china, we have reopened factories, so the factories were able to work through the conditions to reopen. they're reopening. they're also in ramp, and so i think of this as sort of the third phase of getting back to normal. and we're in phase three of the ramp mode, cook said.\n\nimmigration\n\nwho is paying for the border wall\n\ntrump claimed that mexico is paying for his border wall, saying, without explanation, yes, they are, actually. you know what i mean, right? they are paying for it. he added, and they're ok with it because they understand that's fair.\n\nbernie sanders and deportations\n\nbernie said he'll never do a deportation. right? remember what he said? i better save this stuff. maybe he won't get the nomination. -- february 29 speech at conservative political action conference\n\nfacts first: sanders has not said he will never do a deportation. he is calling for a temporary deportation freeze, not a permanent ban. while he is also proposing a permanent end to deportations of undocumented immigrants who have been in the us for five or more years, this is just one portion of the undocumented population.\n\nsanders' immigration plan calls for a moratorium on deportations until a thorough audit of past practices and policies is complete. (his campaign manager said in late february that the moratorium would not apply to violent criminals. the plan also says he will use executive authority to allow undocumented immigrants who have resided in the united states for five or more years to remain free from threat of deportation.\n\ncrowds and rallies\n\nthe time of trump's las vegas rally\n\ntrump boasted about the size of the crowd at his rally in las vegas and said, you know this thing was supposed to be for this evening and they said, 'let me get back to washington, do it early,' so we gave you almost no notice -- february 21 campaign rally in las vegas, nevada\n\nfacts first: it's not true that people were given almost no notice for the time or date of trump's rally at noon las vegas time on friday, february 21. noon was the time the campaign listed when it : it's not true that people were given almost no notice for the time or date of trump's rally at noon las vegas time on friday, february 21. noon was the time the campaign listed when it announced the rally -- six days before the event was held.\n\ntrump's 2015 rally in phoenix\n\ntrump said of phoenix: we won this state, and it was my first -- my first speech as a candidate, as you remember, in the convention center, and it was a tremendous success. so we -- i love this state ... well, we came and we had 15,000 people, and it held a lot less...and that was actually my first speech as a potential candidate. so it was something very special. -- february 19 interview with fox 10 phoenix\n\nfacts first: though trump did have a major rally at the phoenix convention center in july 2015, it was not his first speech as a presidential candidate or as a potential candidate; he had launched his campaign nearly a month prior with a speech at trump tower in manhattan, then : though trump did have a major rally at the phoenix convention center in july 2015, it was not his first speech as a presidential candidate or as a potential candidate; he had launched his campaign nearly a month prior with a speech at trump tower in manhattan, then held a rally in new hampshire . and the crowd in phoenix was smaller than 15,000; the phoenix fire department cut off attendance at 4,169, a spokesperson told politifact in 2015 . (there is no evidence for trump's 2015 claim that the convention center broke the fire code by allowing 12-15,000 people in 4,000 code room.)\n\ntrump was vague about what he meant by we had 15,000 people; he might perhaps have been referring to his campaign's claim that 15,000 tickets had been distributed. in the past, though, he has made clear he was talking about the size of the crowd in attendance. (media reports said that hundreds of trump supporters were outside the venue , but there is no evidence 11,000 were outside.)\n\npresident ronald reagan's crowds in las vegas\n\nthere's never been this. you know, ronald reagan was great. i thought he was a great guy, great president, didn't like his policy on trade, that's ok ... but if he came to las vegas, you know, they'd have a ballroom. they'd have 500, maybe a thousand people. -- february 21 campaign rally in las vegas, nevada\n\nfacts first: about 7,000 people attended a reagan rally at las vegas' convention center in 1982, according to a news : about 7,000 people attended a reagan rally at las vegas' convention center in 1982, according to a news report at the time.\n\nrussia, the russia investigation and criminal justice\n\nrussia, if you're listening and the media\n\nremember this thing, 'russia, if you're listening'? remember, it was a big thing -- in front of 25,000 people. 'russia if you're ...' it was all said in a joke. they cut it off right at the end so that you don't then see the laughter, the joke. and they said, 'he asked. he asked for help.' right? 'russia, if you're listening ...' a very famous -- they cut that thing so quick at the end because they didn't want to hear the laughter in the place and me laughing. it was just 'boom.' -- february 29 speech at conservative political action conference\n\nfacts first: trump's story was comprehensively inaccurate. trump did not make his famous 2016 russia, if you're listening request -- for help obtaining deleted hillary clinton emails -- at an event with 25,000 people, nor did he laugh after he said it; he made the comment at a july 2016 news conference, with a straight face, and there was no audible laughter in the room. news outlets did not deceptively edit the footage.\n\nroger stone and the trump campaign\n\nroger stone, just so you know, never worked -- he didn't work for my campaign. there might've been a time -- way early, long before i announced -- where he was somehow involved a little bit. but he was not involved in our campaign at all. -- february 18 exchange with reporters before air force one departure\n\nroger was never involved in the trump campaign for president. he wasn't involved. i think early on, long before i announced, he may have done a little consulting work or something, but he was not involved when i ran for president. and he's a person who, again, he knows a lot of people having to do with politics. his whole life is politics. that's what he is. -- february 20 speech to hope for prisoners graduation ceremony\n\nfacts first: stone officially worked for the trump campaign until august 2015, about a month and a half after trump announced his candidacy, when the campaign announced he had been fired. (stone : stone officially worked for the trump campaign until august 2015, about a month and a half after trump announced his candidacy, when the campaign announced he had been fired. (stone said he resigned . regardless, he could not have been ousted if he had never been on the campaign in the first place.) stone remained an informal adviser after that -- and communicated with top trump campaign officials in 2016 about the activities of wikileaks, according to witness testimony and phone records presented at stone's trial. stone also communicated in 2016 with trump himself.\n\nyou can read a longer fact check here\n\nthe jury foreperson in the roger stone trial\n\ntrump accused the foreperson of the jury in roger stone's trial of bias. he added, and you know how they caught her? when he was convicted and then a statement was made, she started jumping up and down screaming, 'yes, yes.' -- february 21 campaign rally in las vegas, nevada\n\nfacts first: while stone's legal team has also accused the foreperson of bias -- judge amy berman jackson held a hearing on stone's request for a new trial and will issue a : while stone's legal team has also accused the foreperson of bias -- judge amy berman jackson held a hearing on stone's request for a new trial and will issue a decision -- it is not true that the foreperson jumped up and down screaming upon stone's conviction or at any other point in the proceedings.\n\nstone's legal team challenged the juror on a tweet she issued, featuring hearts, fists and a link to a facebook post that is no longer available, in the hours before the jury announced its guilty verdict on november 15, 2019. the foreperson said under questioning, i don't know what this was in reference to and that she was absolutely not celebrating the coming verdict. regardless of what she meant, though, a tweet is not the same as a juror jumping up and down screaming in court as trump suggested.\n\nnavy sailor kristian saucier\n\ntrump told the story of navy sailor kristian saucier, who pleaded guilty in 2016 to one count of unauthorized possession and retention of national defense information after he took photos in 2009 of classified areas of the nuclear-powered attack submarine he worked on. (trump pardoned saucier in 2018.) trump claimed: and they had these pictures, and they put him in jail. he sent them to his mother and to his friend. trump first said the photos were considered classified, but, later in his comments, said that what he did was, it was 'confidential.' 'confidential' is a much lower class than 'classified.' -- february 20 speech to hope for prisoners graduation ceremony\n\nfacts first: trump was minimizing the severity of saucier's acts by falsely claiming that confidential is a much lower class than classified. in fact, confidential material is classified; confidential is a : trump was minimizing the severity of saucier's acts by falsely claiming that confidential is a much lower class than classified. in fact, confidential material is classified; confidential is a level of classification , not a separate, lesser thing. (confidential is a lower level of classification than secret and top secret, but prosecutors said it is the highest level of classification of nuclear related equipment found aboard a nuclear submarine.) in addition, saucier was not accused of sending the photos to his mother. the photos were discovered on a cell phone he had discarded in 2012 at a garbage dump in connecticut; prosecutors said they later learned saucier had shown them to someone he had served with and a woman he had lived with, and that his (former) wife had also seen them.\n\nthis was not a one-time slip about how classification levels work. trump also told fox news' sean hannity in 2019: i remember he had confidential information which is a much, much lower standard than classified.\n\nthe fbi and go get him\n\ntrump appeared to reference a report issued in 2019 by the department of justice inspector general michael horowitz about comey's conduct in releasing information from his memos about conversations he had with trump in 2017. trump said: and if you would have read the report written about comey -- 78 pages of kill, with a reference of 'go get him.' they really said it: 'go get him.' -- february 20 speech to hope for prisoners graduation ceremony\n\nfacts first: there is no mention of anyone saying the words go get him in this 2019 report. nor do those words appear in horowitz's 2018 : there is no mention of anyone saying the words go get him in this 2019 report. nor do those words appear in horowitz's 2018 report on actions taken by the fbi and justice department in advance of the 2016 election or horowitz's 2019 report on aspects of the fbi's investigation into the trump campaign and russia.\n\ntrump was vague here about what he was referring to when he invoked the phrase go get him. but the best clue comes from a 2019 interview in which trump claimed that former fbi official peter strzok meant we're gonna go get him -- go get trump -- when strzok texted colleague lisa page in 2016 about having an insurance policy for what strzok saw as the unlikely event trump would win the election against hillary clinton.\n\nstrzok and page have testified that the insurance policy meant that they needed to probe trump and his team over their dealings with russia so that, if anything nefarious was occurring and trump did become president, the country could be protected. trump and his allies argue that strzok meant something more biased. regardless, there is no evidence he said go get him.\n\ndemocrats\n\nbloomberg's endorsers and campaign finance law\n\nwhat mini mike is doing is nothing less than a large scale illegal campaign contribution. he is 'spreading' money all over the place, only to have recipients of his cash payments, many former opponents, happily joining or supporting his campaign. isn't that called a payoff? mini is illegally buying the democrat nomination. -- february 18 tweet\n\nis corrupt bloomberg news going to say what a pathetic debater mini mike is, that he doesn't respect our great farmers, or that he has violated campaign finance laws at the highest and most sinister level with 'payoffs' all over the place? -- february 19 tweet\n\nand there are a lot of campaign finance violations there. there's no way you can do what he's doing. you know, you go into a town, you give somebody a contribution, two days later the guy comes, 'i'd like to support mini mike bloomberg.' there's something strange with that whole deal. -- february 29 speech at conservative political action conference\n\nfacts first: there is no evidence that former democratic presidential candidate michael bloomberg has broken campaign finance law either with his heavy campaign : there is no evidence that former democratic presidential candidate michael bloomberg has broken campaign finance law either with his heavy campaign spending or by previously having donated to the political campaigns or favored causes of people who have now endorsed him. (we know of no cases in which someone endorsed bloomberg this year two days after receiving some sort of contribution from him.) there is no legal limit on how much someone can spend on their own presidential campaign. it is also not illegal for someone who has benefited in the past from political or charitable contributions from someone to later endorse that person for office.\n\nso long as we are talking about campaign contributions within statutory limits made without an explicit promise to do or not do something, there is nothing illegal going on, said richard hasen, a professor of law and political science at the university of california, irvine and an expert on elections law.\n\nchuck schumer and trump's deal with china\n\ntrump claimed on three occasions that senate minority leader chuck schumer had falsely claimed trump's phase one trade deal with china involved trump taking off tariffs.\n\nfacts first: trump's deal with china reduces, but does not eliminate, some of the us tariffs on imported chinese products. schumer accurately described the tariff changes in a january : trump's deal with china reduces, but does not eliminate, some of the us tariffs on imported chinese products. schumer accurately described the tariff changes in a january letter in which he argued that trump had given away leverage with a temporary deal of some reduced tariffs in exchange for american goods and vague promises of reform.\n\nafter trump made a previous version of this accusation on january 15, schumer responded the same day: i know what's in the deal. i'm not sure the president does. if he knows what's in the deal -- he should throw it away and take china back to the negotiating table. i will cheer him on if he does.\n\nbiden's debate claim about guns\n\nsleepy joe biden also said that guns killed 150 million americans last year... -- march 1 tweet\n\nfacts first: biden did make a gaffe -- but trump was inaccurately describing what biden inaccurately said. biden : biden did make a gaffe -- but trump was inaccurately describing what biden inaccurately said. biden said at the democratic debate in charleston, south carolina, that 150 million people had been killed by guns since 2007, not that this many people had been killed last year. (biden's campaign said he had meant to say 150,000, which is roughly accurate.)\n\nhunter biden\n\ntrump claimed hunter biden, the son of biden, didn't have a job until his father became vice president. -- february 21 campaign rally in las vegas, nevada\n\nfacts first: hunter biden had several jobs before joe biden became vice president in 2009. hunter biden, a lawyer who graduated from yale law school, became a partner at a law and lobbying firm in 2001. (he stopped lobbying : hunter biden had several jobs before joe biden became vice president in 2009. hunter biden, a lawyer who graduated from yale law school, became a partner at a law and lobbying firm in 2001. (he stopped lobbying late in the 2008 campaign .) before that, he had worked for financial services company mbna, rising to senior vice president, and for the us commerce department. and president george w. bush appointed him to the board of directors of amtrak.)\n\nat the time hunter biden was appointed to the board of ukrainian natural gas company burisma holdings in 2014, he was a lawyer at the firm boies schiller flexner, an adjunct professor at georgetown university's foreign service program, chairman of the board of world food program usa, and chief executive officer and chairman of rosemont seneca advisors, an investment advisory firm. he also served on other boards.\n\nnone of this is to say that hunter biden's name was not a factor in his career advancement. he has acknowledged that he would probably not have been asked to be on the burisma board if he were not a biden. but trump's repeated portrayal of him as an unemployed man is inaccurate.\n\ntom steyer's performance in new hampshire\n\ntrump mocked now-former democratic presidential candidate tom steyer for his poor performance in iowa and new hampshire after spending heavily on his own campaign, saying, he got one-third of 1% in iowa. and in new hampshire, he did much better. he got less than 3%. -- february 19 campaign rally in phoenix, arizona\n\nfacts first: trump was correct about steyer's : trump was correct about steyer's iowa showing but understated steyer's new hampshire showing. steyer got 3.6% of the vote in the new hampshire primary, not less than 3%.\n\nmark kelly\n\ntrump said of mark kelly, a democratic senate candidate in arizona: he wants to raise your taxes, open your borders, give away free health care to illegal immigrants, and he wants to obliterate your second amendment. -- february 19 campaign rally in phoenix, arizona\n\nfacts first: trump was misrepresenting kelly's immigration positions.\n\nwhile kelly does oppose trump's tax cuts for wealthy people, he does not support open borders: i'm not for open borders. i think we need border security. we also have to treat people fairly, kelly said in response to trump's comments at this rally. kelly is also opposed to free health care for undocumented immigrants, saying in 2019 that the us is having a hard enough time providing health care for americans.\n\nthe claim that kelly would obliterate the second amendment is vague, but kelly says he is the owner of multiple guns and supports the second amendment, though he wants common sense policy changes to keep people safer.\n\nkelly, a former astronaut and navy pilot, is married to former congresswoman gabrielle giffords, who was shot and seriously wounded in 2011. kelly has become a prominent advocate of universal background checks for gun purchasers. he also supports some other gun control measures, like red flag laws that allow guns to be temporarily taken from people deemed a danger to others or themselves.\n\nmedia coverage of trump donating his salary\n\ntrump talked about how he donates his presidential salary, then said, i never had a story -- i don't think i've had a story that i give it. but i guarantee if i was ever late -- because it comes in quarterly -- if i was ever late, it would be a front-page story... -- february 27 remarks in meeting with black leaders\n\nfacts first: it's not even close to true that there has never been a story about trump donating his salary. you can read some of the cnn stories about trump's quarterly donations : it's not even close to true that there has never been a story about trump donating his salary. you can read some of the cnn stories about trump's quarterly donations here here , and here\n\ncalifornia water rules\n\nnow that they're rationing water for people, they're saying you're going to get, very shortly -- i heard the governor saying you get 50 gallons. fifty gallons sounds okay. people tell me it's like nothing. by the time you do with your showers, and your hands, and your tissues, and everything, 50 gallons is very, very little. can you imagine a state being rationed, when you have millions and millions and millions of gallons being poured out into the pacific ocean that you could have? and you'd have more water than knew what to do with. it's crazy. crazy. crazy. -- february 19 remarks to rural stakeholders on california water accessibility\n\nfacts first: california is not rationing water for people. trump was mischaracterizing : california is not rationing water for people. trump was mischaracterizing new state laws that set targets for water utilities but do not impose any limits on individuals or businesses.\n\nin 2030 -- 10 years from now, not immediately -- the target for water utilities will be 50 gallons per capita of indoor water use for their customers. water suppliers can be fined if they do not meet the target, but no individual person, household or company will face fines or cut-offs for using too much water. (the target system will come into effect in 2023 at a target of 55 gallons, then get more stringent.)\n\nwhen qasem soleimani was killed\n\nso we took out al-baghdadi, and then, we just took out two weeks ago, the world's top terrorist qasem soleimani of iran and his evil reign of terror forever. -- february 21 campaign rally in las vegas, nevada\n\nfacts first: soleimani was killed on january 3, seven weeks before trump spoke here. we might let this go if it were a one-time slip, but, intentionally or unintentionally, trump has : soleimani was killed on january 3, seven weeks before trump spoke here. we might let this go if it were a one-time slip, but, intentionally or unintentionally, trump has habitually moved the dates of his accomplishments much closer to the present.\n\na labor dispute in 2016\n\nlast time i had a strike in my building during the election. the only reason -- we would've won this state. like brilliantly -- to save three cents. i could have settled the strike before the election. i wanted to save two dollars. total. that was a brilliant move ... but we almost won the state despite i had a big strike. -- february 21 campaign rally in las vegas, nevada\n\nfacts first: there was a dispute between trump and labor unions in las vegas during the 2016 election, and workers did picket his hotel, but there was not a strike; workers did not walk off the job, and trump's company had not recognized the union in the first place.\n\nthe dispute centered around an effort by trump's company, the trump organization, to fight a unionization effort by hotel employees; the company had refused to negotiate a collective agreement despite a worker vote to unionize. though the workers protested, they did not cease working.\n\ntrump's company settled the dispute after his election, agreeing to a four-year contract.\n\nwaivers for military athletes\n\ntrump touted his decision to give athletes from us military academies who have a chance to play professional sports the right to apply for a waiver allowing them to delay their active-duty service. he said, they'd been after the waiver ... i did the rule and we got it through congress and you don't have to serve. you go directly into the major leagues, into the nfl, and you serve your time after when you get out ... and we did it. they'd been trying to get that for so many years. -- february 20 campaign rally in colorado springs, colorado\n\nfacts first: the waiver policy was not achieved through congress; it was created with a : the waiver policy was not achieved through congress; it was created with a memo from defense secretary mark esper. and it's not true that people had been trying to get waivers allowed for so many years; a similar policy was put in place by the obama administration in 2016, but trump's first defense secretary, james mattis, rescinded it in 2017.\n\nthe muslim population of india\n\ntrump said of indian prime minister narendra modi: and, as far as muslims are concerned, as he told me, i guess they have ... 200 million muslims in india. and a fairly short while ago, they had 14 million. -- february 25 press conference in new delhi, india\n\nfacts first: we can't know what modi might have told trump in private, but it's not true that there were 14 million muslims in india at any point that can reasonably considered a fairly short while ago. after the partition of british india in 1947, which created the modern states of india and pakistan, the muslim population that remained in india was : we can't know what modi might have told trump in private, but it's not true that there were 14 million muslims in india at any point that can reasonably considered a fairly short while ago. after the partition of british india in 1947, which created the modern states of india and pakistan, the muslim population that remained in india was about 35 million , noted muqtedar khan, professor of islam and global affairs in the department of political science and international relations at the university of delaware. when asked about trump's claim, christophe jaffrelot, professor of indian politics and sociology at the king's india institute at king's college london, said it is truly ridiculous!\n\ntrump's 200 million figure for the present muslim population is about right.\n\nthe ratings of 'the apprentice'\n\ntrump claimed that the apprentice, his reality television show, steadily climbed in ratings all the way to the very top: and then the show goes -- started at 10, went to eight, went to seven, went to five, went to four, went to two, it went to one. i had the number one show in all of television. number one. -- february 21 campaign rally in las vegas, nevada\n\nfacts first: trump had it backward: the apprentice performed best in the ratings in its first season, then steadily declined. trump has a : trump had it backward: the apprentice performed best in the ratings in its first season, then steadily declined. trump has a long history of making the false claim that the apprentice was the top-rated show on tv. (when he made this claim about celebrity apprentice at an event with television critics in january 2015, he was mocked by the critics on twitter and greeted with laughter in the room -- eventually claiming , when challenged, that he had merely heard it was number one.)\n\nchicago tribune culture journalist steve johnson wrote in 2016: 'the apprentice' was a genuine hit in that first season, ending as the seventh-most-watched tv show of the year, averaging almost 21 million viewers a week, but its ratings declined steadily each year after that, to 11th place overall in its second season, then 15th, then 38th. when, after its sixth season in 2007, it finished as the 75th-most-watched show (with 7.5 million viewers on average), nbc decided to scrap real people as contestants and bring on celebrities...the celebrity show did better, but it has been middle of the pack all the way, with finishes ranking from 46th to 84th before trump announced his candidacy and nbc replaced him with arnold schwarzenegger.\n\nthere are various ways to slice and dice television ratings, so trump might be able to point to some specific night, time slot, show category or viewer group in which the apprentice was number one. but it certainly wasn't the top-rated show in all of tv, as he has long suggested.\n\nrepeats\n\nhere are the repeat false claims we have previously included in one of these roundups:\n\neconomy\n\nthe estate tax\n\ntrump claimed four times that he had eliminated the estate tax.\n\nfacts first: trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. his 2017 tax law : trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. his 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but did not get rid of the tax entirely.\n\napple and factories\n\ntrump said of apple: ...they're building plants. i just left one -- they just opened one in texas; i just left it. and they're building another one, and a lot of things are happening.\n\nfacts first: trump : trump did not visit a newly opened apple plant in texas; the facility he visited in texas in november 2019, owned by flex ltd., had been making apple's mac pro computers since 2013 . and there is no public indication that apple is building another one in the united states.\n\nit is perhaps possible that trump was genuinely confused about the facility he visited in texas, though he has made this claim before. apple announced the same day of trump's visit that it had broken ground on a new $1 billion campus in austin. trump accurately made reference to this campus in a tweet the morning after his visit.\n\nthe steel industry\n\ntrump claimed that, before him, the steel industry was dead. absolutely dead in the united states.\n\nfacts first: while some american steel companies were struggling before trump took office and before he imposed his tariffs on steel imports in 2018, others : while some american steel companies were struggling before trump took office and before he imposed his tariffs on steel imports in 2018, others were thriving . and trump has regularly overstated how well american steel companies have done since his tariffs; the stock prices of major steelmakers, including nucor, steel dynamics and us steel, have fallen substantially since then.\n\nenergy production\n\ntrump claimed to have ended the war on american energy, then said, the us is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the entire world, by far.\n\nfacts first: the us has not just now become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot : the us has not just now become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012 , according to the us government's energy information administration -- under the very obama administration trump is accusing of perpetrating a war on the industry.\n\nwage growth\n\ntrump said wages are rising for the first time in 21 years.\n\nfacts first: wages have been : wages have been rising since 2014, using one common measure.\n\nmedian usual weekly warnings went from $330 per week in the second quarter of 2014 to $349 per week in the fourth quarter of 2016.\n\nthe dow's starting point under trump\n\ntrump touted gains in the dow jones industrial average during his presidency, saying , and we started off at 16,000...\n\nfacts first: the dow didn't start the trump era at 16,000 points -- whether you're looking at its level on trump's first day in office or whether you go back to the day after his election, as he sometimes argues we should. the dow opened and closed above 19,700 points on trump's inauguration day in january 2017; the dow opened above 18,300 the day after trump's election in november 2016.\n\nwomen's unemployment\n\ntrump claimed three times that the women's unemployment rate is the lowest in 71 years.\n\nfacts first: it had been just over 66 years, not 71 years, since the women's unemployment rate was as low as it was in january 2020, : it had been just over 66 years, not 71 years, since the women's unemployment rate was as low as it was in january 2020, 3.5% ; it hit that level in late 1953. it was also 3.5% or 3.4% during previous months of trump's presidency, but we'll ignore those for fairness to trump.\n\nthe unemployment rate\n\ntrump claimed three times that the unemployment rate is at its lowest level in over 51 years.\n\nfacts first: this was a very : this was a very small exaggeration , but an exaggeration nonetheless. (trump habitually exaggerates even legitimate accomplishments.) the unemployment rate for january 2020, 3.6% , was the lowest since december 1969 if you don't count previous months under trump when it was 3.5%. that is 50 years and one month prior, not over 51 years.\n\nivanka trump and jobs\n\ntrump claimed twice that ivanka trump is responsible for 15 million jobs or more through the pledge to america's workers initiative.\n\nfacts first: ivanka trump has obviously not created over 15 million jobs; at the time, roughly 7 million jobs had been created during the : ivanka trump has obviously not created over 15 million jobs; at the time, roughly 7 million jobs had been created during the entire trump presidency . as of march 2, 2020, the pledge website said companies had promised to create 15.7 million opportunities -- but many of these opportunities are internal training programs, not new jobs. also, as cnn has previously reported, many of the companies had already planned these opportunities before ivanka trump launched the initiative.\n\nthe waters of the united states and puddles\n\ntrump claimed of the obama-era waters of the united states rule: they took away their rights. if you had a puddle in the middle of your farm, they said it was a lake, it was a river, it was a -- i mean, they virtually said it was an ocean, right? you had no right; you couldn't get anywhere near it.\n\nfacts first: puddles were not covered by the obama-era waters of the united states environmental regulation; the rule explicitly : puddles were not covered by the obama-era waters of the united states environmental regulation; the rule explicitly says puddles do not qualify as one of the waters in question.\n\nvenezuela's wealth\n\ntrump said : here's a case where a country was wealthy 15 years ago and very wealthy 20 years ago. very, very wealthy. the wealthiest in all of latin, south america. the wealthiest and -- by far. not even a contest.\n\nfacts first: venezuela was not the wealthiest country in latin america or south america either 15 or 20 years ago.\n\nvenezuela was one of the richest countries in the world 60 years ago. the richest in latin america 40 years ago. but not 20 years ago, ricardo hausmann, a former venezuelan planning minister and central bank board member, said in response to a previous version of this trump claim. hausmann, now a harvard university professor, was chief economist of the inter-american development bank from 1994 to 2000.\n\nvenezuela's per capita gross domestic product in 2005 ($5,420) was lower than that of mexico ($8,189) and chile ($7,600), according to international monetary fund figures from 2019. venezuela's per capita gross domestic product in 2000 ($4,824) was lower than that of argentina ($8,387), mexico ($7,016), uruguay ($6,817) and chile ($5,072).\n\ntrade and china\n\nwho is paying for trump's tariffs on china\n\ntrump claimed three times that the revenue from his tariffs on chinese imports came from china.\n\nfacts first: study after study has shown that americans are bearing the vast majority of the cost of the tariffs. and it is americans who make the actual tariff payments.\n\nthe trade deficit with china\n\non two separate occasions, trump claimed that the us used to have a trade deficit with china of $500 billion or more than $500 billion.\n\nfacts first: the us has never had a $500 billion trade deficit with china.\n\nchina's peak agricultural spending\n\ntrump said three times that china had never spent more than $16 billion on us agricultural products in a year.\n\nfacts first: china spent $25.9 billion in 2012, according to figures from the department of agriculture.\n\nthe size of trump's trade agreement with china\n\ntrump claimed that his trade agreement with china was the biggest trade deal ever made.\n\nfacts first: it is not. alan deardorff, a university of michigan professor of international economics who focuses on trade, said the china deal is smaller, in terms of the volume of trade covered, than both the trans-pacific partnership negotiated by the obama administration and the uruguay round that created the world trade organization. you can read a longer fact check : it is not. alan deardorff, a university of michigan professor of international economics who focuses on trade, said the china deal is smaller, in terms of the volume of trade covered, than both the trans-pacific partnership negotiated by the obama administration and the uruguay round that created the world trade organization. you can read a longer fact check here\n\nthe us record at the world trade organization\n\ntrump touted a recent us victory in a world trade organization case over illegal european subsidies to aerospace company airbus, then claimed that, before he made it clear that he would withdraw from the wto if the us was not treated more fairly, we weren't winning anything. he added, all of a sudden, we're winning all these cases.\n\nfacts first: the us has long won cases at the world trade organization, and there is no evidence that wto adjudicators have suddenly changed their behavior. trump's own council of economic advisers : the us has long won cases at the world trade organization, and there is no evidence that wto adjudicators have suddenly changed their behavior. trump's own council of economic advisers said in a report in february 2018 that the us had won 86% of the cases it has brought since 1995. the global average was 84%. a bloomberg law review in march 2019 found that the us success rate in cases it brings to the wto had increased very slightly since trump took office, from 84.8% in 2016 to 85.4%.\n\nthe history of tariffs on china\n\ntrump claimed that, prior to his tariffs on china, we didn't get 10 cents forever from china.\n\nfacts first: again, americans, not china, are paying most of the cost of trump's tariffs. aside from that, it's not true that the treasury had never received 10 cents from tariffs on china. factcheck.org : again, americans, not china, are paying most of the cost of trump's tariffs. aside from that, it's not true that the treasury had never received 10 cents from tariffs on china. factcheck.org reported that the us generated an average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the u.s. international trade commission dataweb.\n\nchina's economic performance\n\ntrump said china had its worst economic year in the last 67 years.\n\nfacts first: china's officially : china's officially reported 2019 growth rate, 6.1%, was the lowest since 1990, 29 years prior . while china's official figures are unreliable, there is no basis for the 67 years claim; trump has habitually exaggerated how long it had been since china's growth was as slow as it was in 2019, steadily inflating the figure over time.\n\nhealth care\n\npre-existing conditions\n\ntrump claimed four times that he will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.\n\nfacts first: we don't usually fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. the trump administration and congressional republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed : we don't usually fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. the trump administration and congressional republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\n\nthe obamacare website\n\ntrump claimed twice that the obamacare website, healthcare.gov, was so problem-plagued that it cost $5 billion.\n\nfacts first: the site did have major problems when it was : the site did have major problems when it was unveiled in 2013 , but $5 billion is an exaggeration. in may 2014, the obama administration said the website cost $834 million. a september 2014 analysis by the information service bloomberg government, which looked at contracts related to the website, put the total at $2.1 billion.\n\nright to try\n\non two separate occasions, trump claimed that, before he signed a right to try bill in 2018, others had tried to get this done for 44 years and for 51 years.\n\nfacts first: there had not been a 44-year effort to get a federal right to try law, which aims to make it easier for terminally ill patients to access medications that have not been granted final approval. trump signed the bill i : there had not been a 44-year effort to get a federal right to try law, which aims to make it easier for terminally ill patients to access medications that have not been granted final approval. trump signed the bill i n 2018 ; similar laws have been passed at the state level only since 2014, after the goldwater institute, a libertarian think tank, began pushing for them.\n\nukraine and impeachment\n\nthe whistleblower's accuracy\n\ntrump claimed twice that the whistleblower who filed a complaint about his dealings with ukraine was fake, saying both times that the whistleblower's account of his july call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky was shown to be highly inaccurate when he released a (rough) transcript of the call.\n\nfacts first: the whistleblower's account of the call has been proven largely accurate. in fact, the rough transcript trump released showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. you can read a full fact check : the whistleblower's account of the call has been proven largely accurate. in fact, the rough transcript trump released showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. you can read a full fact check here\n\nthe second whistleblower\n\ntrump claimed that there was supposed to be a second whistleblower, but as soon as i released the transcripts, the second whistleblower was gone.\n\nfacts first: the existence of a second whistleblower related to trump's dealings with ukraine was revealed : the existence of a second whistleblower related to trump's dealings with ukraine was revealed after , not before, trump released the rough transcript of his july call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky; it's not true that this person vanished after he released the call. in addition, the second whistleblower's lawyers had always said that this person never planned to file a separate whistleblower complaint, merely to offer corroborating information in private.\n\nlt. col. alexander vindman and the rough transcript\n\ntrump claimed the transcript of the zelensky call is now 100% accurate, even according to lieutenant colonel vindman.\n\nfacts first: vindman testified that two substantive changes he suggested to the rough transcript were not made, though also he said i didn't see that as nefarious and didn't see it as that big a deal. you can read a longer fact check : vindman testified that two substantive changes he suggested to the rough transcript were not made, though also he said i didn't see that as nefarious and didn't see it as that big a deal. you can read a longer fact check here\n\npopularity and accomplishments\n\ntrump's approval with republicans\n\ntrump claimed that he has a 95% approval rating in the republican party, a record.\n\nfacts first: though his approval rating with republicans in some polls has crept up to around 95% -- he was at 93% with republicans in the latest : though his approval rating with republicans in some polls has crept up to around 95% -- he was at 93% with republicans in the latest gallup poll , 94% in the gallup poll before that -- that is not a record. george w. bush hit 99% in gallup polling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001, and his father, george h.w. bush, hit 97% at the end of the gulf war in 1991.\n\ntrump's crowd in new jersey\n\ntrump claimed there were tens of thousands of people outside of his january rally in wildwood, new jersey.\n\nfacts first: trump was exaggerating. ben rose, director of marketing and public relations for the greater wildwoods tourism improvement and development authority, told cnn that the authority estimates there were between 3,000 and 3,500 people in the parking lot outside trump's rally venue and between 2,000 and 2,500 people at a park across the street. trump was given an inflated number during the rally by rep. jeff van drew, but nonetheless, it was wrong.\n\nempty seats\n\ntrump claimed at two rallies that there has never been an empty seat at one of his events since he launched his campaign in 2015.\n\nfacts first: there have been empty seats at various trump rallies, including an october 2019 rally minneapolis, a july 2019 rally in greenville, north carolina, an october 2018 rally in houston and an april 2017 rally in harrisburg, pennsylvania, according to journalists on the scene.\n\npresidents and handshakes\n\ntrump told a story about how he shook the hand of every graduate in the air force academy class to which he gave a commencement address in 2019 -- all 1,156 cadets. he said he was told by a general that other presidents did not shake every hand -- only 30, 40 or 50, or the top 10 out of the class.\n\nfacts first: there were : there were 989 graduates in the class trump spoke to, not 1,156. and while we don't know what a general may or may not have told trump, previous presidents have also shaken every hand at service academy graduations; contemporaneous news reports about barack obama and george w. bush, for example, noted that they shook every hand at the graduations they attended.\n\nveterans choice\n\ntrump claimed five times to have been the one who got the veterans choice health care program created.\n\nfacts first: the veterans choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators bernie sanders and the late john mccain, was signed into law by barack obama : the veterans choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators bernie sanders and the late john mccain, was signed into law by barack obama in 2014 . in 2018, trump signed the va mission act, which expanded and changed the program.\n\nprescription drug prices\n\ntrump claimed twice that last year was the first year in 51 years where prescription drug prices went down.\n\nfacts first: the decline -- shown in the consumer price index, but not in some other measures -- happened in 2018, not last year. and trump was exaggerating how long it had been since the 2018 decline; it had been 46 years, not 51. you can read a longer fact check : the decline -- shown in the consumer price index, but not in some other measures -- happened in 2018, not last year. and trump was exaggerating how long it had been since the 2018 decline; it had been 46 years, not 51. you can read a longer fact check here\n\nelectoral votes in 2016\n\ntrump claimed to have beaten hillary clinton in the electoral college by a margin of 306 to 223.\n\nfacts first: clinton earned 232 electoral votes in 2016, not 223. this was not a one-time slip; trump has habitually said 223.\n\noverdose deaths\n\nat three rallies, trump claimed that overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years, for the first time in nearly 32 years and for the first time in 34 years.\n\nfacts first: this was another of trump's : this was another of trump's little exaggerations . the 2018 decline in overdose deaths was the first since 1990, 28 years prior.\n\npeople crying\n\ntrump claimed that, at the event he held in 2017 to sign an executive order rolling back the waters of the united states rule, i had a lot of people -- a lot of farmers and construction workers and a lot of people behind me. and these are people that didn't cry when they were babies. they would -- never cried in their life, and they were crying.\n\nthe history of the president donating his salary\n\ntrump said that they don't think any other president has ever donated his salary; he added that to the best of our knowledge, we have not found another president that gave.\n\nfacts first: trump does donate his salary, but the rest of his claim was inaccurate. he is not the only president to have donated the official salary; both john f. kennedy and herbert hoover did so.\n\nmedian household income\n\ntrump claimed twice that median household income has increased by $10,000 during his presidency. on one of these occasions, he said it was $10,000 a year.\n\nfacts first: it's not true that there have been $10,000 in median household income gains under trump, let alone

massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren , do not support completely unrestricted migration, as trump suggests.\n\nmexican soldiers and the border\n\ntrump claimed three times that mexico has deployed 27,000 soldiers to the us border.\n\nfacts first: mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the us border in particular; mexico's defense minister said in october that it was about 15,000 on the us border, about 12,000 on mexico's own southern border.\n\ndeportations to guatemala, honduras, el salvador and mexico\n\ntrump claimed that guatemala, honduras, el salvador and mexico used to refuse to accept back people the us wanted to deport, but now has stopped doing that. (facts first: trump was mixing up two separate issues. while the trump administration does have new agreements with all four countries, those agreements are related to the handling of people who have come or are trying to come to the us seeking asylum, not criminals the us is seeking to deport. in 2016, prior to trump's presidency, none of the four countries was on the list of countries that immigration and customs enforcement (ice) considered recalcitrant (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the us. you can read a longer fact check here .)\n\ndemocrats\n\nhillary clinton's campaign spending\n\ntrump claimed hillary clinton's 2016 campaign spent at least three times more than we did and spent like $2 billion on negative ads.\n\nfacts first: clinton's campaign spent about $563 million total, not $2 billion on ads alone, according to the : clinton's campaign spent about $563 million total, not $2 billion on ads alone, according to the center for responsive politics , a money-in-politics watchdog group. if you add in spending by outside groups supportive of clinton's candidacy, the total is still just under $770 million, according to the center for responsive politics. clinton did outspend trump, but by less than double, not at least three times.\n\nobama and aids\n\ntrump claimed he has started the process of ending the aids epidemic in america, then said the obama administration didn't start it.\n\nfacts first: it's not even close to true that the obama administration did not try to stop hiv/aids in the united states, experts say and budget data proves. the obama administration spent more than $5.5 billion per year on the three primary domestic programs to combat hiv/aids, according to figures provided by the kaiser family foundation, which closely tracks health care spending. obama also introduced a comprehensive national strategy on combating hiv/aids. and experts note that the affordable care act helped people with hiv gain health insurance coverage. you can read a longer fact check : it's not even close to true that the obama administration did not try to stop hiv/aids in the united states, experts say and budget data proves. the obama administration spent more than $5.5 billion per year on the three primary domestic programs to combat hiv/aids, according to figures provided by the kaiser family foundation, which closely tracks health care spending. obama also introduced a comprehensive national strategy on combating hiv/aids. and experts note that the affordable care act helped people with hiv gain health insurance coverage. you can read a longer fact check here\n\na quote from rep. al green\n\ntrump said democratic rep. al green had said, we can't beat him, so we have to impeach him.\n\nfacts first: trump was at least slightly exaggerating green's comments. in may, green said this: i'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get reelected. in september, when trump previously claimed green had said we can't beat trump without impeachment, green told cnn, i never said we can't beat the president.\n\ncnn\n\na story about van jones\n\ntrump twice repeated a previous false story about cnn host van jones. he said jones asked him to help with criminal justice reform, but then, after trump signed a criminal justice reform bill, jones then gave an address, televised on msnbc, in which jones thanked the rev. al sharpton and others for the bill but never thanked trump. (in one of the two new versions of the story, trump said jones had been actually in tears when he had asked trump for help with justice reform.)\n\nfacts first: aside from the fact that jones did seek trump's help with criminal justice reform, trump's story is fictional.\n\njones is a cnn host who does not make speeches on msnbc. jones has habitually given trump credit for the justice reform bill, and he says he has never given an address in which he has thanked sharpton for it and not trump. jones also says he has never cried when speaking with trump about criminal justice reform.

(cnn) the trump administration on thursday took another significant step in overhauling medicaid, allowing states to ask for a set amount of federal financing for part of their programs in exchange for more local control.\n\ntitled healthy adult opportunity, the guidance permits states to apply for so-called block grants to cover certain low-income adults, particularly those who gained benefits under the affordable care act's medicaid expansion provision. federal funding, which is now open-ended, would be capped, with states receiving either a lump sum or a specific amount per enrollee.\n\nthe plan is the latest move by the trump administration to inject conservative ideals into the 55-year-old health program for low-income people, coming two years after it allowed states to require certain beneficiaries to work , an effort that's largely been halted by the courts.\n\nrepublicans have long wanted to implement block grants as a way to curtail medicaid spending, but its inclusion in the gop bills to repeal and replace obamacare helped doom the legislation in 2017. the description of the guidance given to journalists doesn't mention the words block grant.\n\nconsumer advocates, health care industry associations and democrats swiftly condemned the effort, even before it was formally announced. it will likely be challenged in court.\n\nthe effort will hurt people with pre-existing conditions, said a coalition of 27 patient and consumer groups, including the american heart association, the arthritis foundation and the american cancer society cancer action network.\n\nsimply put, block grants and per capita caps will reduce access to quality and affordable health care for patients with serious and chronic health conditions, said the coalition, which represents millions of people.\n\npresident donald trump and other republicans have repeatedly said they will protect those with pre-existing conditions.\n\na group of house democrats, led by massachusetts rep. joe kennedy iii, sent a letter wednesday to health & human services secretary alex azar and centers for medicare and medicaid services administrator seema verma opposing the plan, saying it defies congress and the federal medicaid statute.\n\nmedicaid block grants necessitate cost-cutting measures like restricting enrollment, decreasing provider reimbursement and limiting eligibility and benefits through managed care, the letter said. the actions endanger the lives of the most vulnerable patients, the population medicaid was created to protect.\n\nthe guidance would like encourage states to undermine coverage, said aviva aron-dine, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning center on budget and policy priorities.\n\nmedicaid's coverage guarantee means that coverage is there when you need it, she wrote in an online post.\n\nweakening that guarantee -- or eliminating the federal standards and oversight that ensure that states, health plans, and providers comply with it -- would worsen access to care, health, and financial security for beneficiaries and likely increase providers' uncompensated care costs, she added.\n\namong the main concerns about block grant funding is that the lump sum model cannot adjust to economic downturns, when enrollment typically increases, and that both the fixed annual amount and the per person cap versions would have difficulty handling spikes in health care treatment costs, as is happening in the opioid epidemic.\n\nstates' funding would be based on their prior spending levels. for the lump sum model, it would be increased annually based either on the state's historic growth rate or a medical inflation rate, whichever is less. the agency could work with states to readjust the funding levels under special circumstances, verma said.\n\nthe caps, however, are designed to reduce federal spending on medicaid, said cindy mann, a partner with manatt health, a professional services firm that works with states. states would not be allowed to set caps on enrollment, so if they exceeded their federal funding limits, they would have to clamp down on eligibility, benefits or provider payments -- or be fully on the hook for the additional costs.\n\nwhen states look under the hood a little bit on some of these flexibilities, they'll find that most of them have already been offered and made available in waivers where they don't have to take a cap, mann said.\n\nmedicaid covers more than 70 million americans, or roughly one in five people, particularly low-income children, pregnant women, the elderly and people with disabilities. some 36 states, plus the district of columbia, have opted to expand benefits to low-income adults under the affordable care act, adding about 15 million recipients to the program.\n\ntotal medicaid spending in fiscal 2018 was $593 billion, with 62.5% paid by the federal government and 37.5% shouldered by states, according to the kaiser family foundation.\n\nfunding is now open-ended. conservatives complain that the financing formula encourages states to spend more so they can secure more federal money, while a block grant would prompt them to better control costs. medicaid is typically one of the top two expenditures for states, and governors and lawmakers often complain that the state contribution eats up money that could be spent on education, infrastructure and other needs.\n\nthe newly issued guidance is targeted at working age, able-bodied adults and does not apply to most of medicaid's traditional beneficiaries, including children, seniors or the disabled. however, states that did not expand medicaid could apply for fixed funding to cover certain low-income adults in their programs.\n\nalso, states that opt to receive a set annual amount could keep a portion of any unused funds, though they must show that access to and quality of care has not declined and they must reinvest that money into state-funded health programs.\n\nand they could request to add new conditions for eligibility for these recipients, change their benefits, require them to pay up to 5% of their income and limit their drug coverage by implementing a list of approved medications. states could also limit retroactive coverage, which could hurt hospitals and other providers, since they often sign up eligible patients when they seek care.\n\nstates will be required to report quarterly on enrollment, retention of beneficiaries, complaints, financial management and several other metrics.\n\nour focus with our healthy adult opportunity program is to change the whole paradigm and to reset the framework of how we're working with states, verma said.\n\nthursday's notice comes four months after tennessee unveiled a plan to shift most of its medicaid program into a block grant-type model. the state, which did not expand medicaid, is seeking to exclude certain costly expenses from the block grant and to allow federal funding to increase if enrollment rises.\n\nanother provision: if the state spends less than the block grant amount, it gets to keep 50% of the federal share of those savings.\n\nhowever, tennessee's proposal does not fall into the parameters of the new guidance because it would move many of its traditional medicaid enrollees into the block grant, which is wider than the federal program would allow. the centers for medicare and medicaid services is working with the state, verma said.\n\nother states are also looking to change how their medicaid programs are funded. alaska has commissioned a study of block grants.\n\noklahoma republican gov. kevin stitt, who attended the unveiling of the guidance on thursday, said he would seek to apply for such a waiver. oklahoma has not expanded medicaid but a measure to do so will be on the ballot this year. voters in four other states have approved broadening the program to low-income adults in recent years.\n\nthis story has been updated

(ap photo/mark humphrey)\n\n(cnn) —\n\ndemocrats maintain a wide lead over republicans in the race for control of the house of representatives, a new cnn poll conducted by ssrs finds, including a 10-point lead among those most likely to turn out this november.\n\nin a generic ballot test, 52% of likely voters back the democratic candidate for house of representatives in their district while 42% back the republican. among all registered voters, democrats hold a 12-point margin over the gop, suggesting preferences have not shifted much since an august cnn poll, which did not include an assessment of likely voters.\n\nrelated: full poll results.\n\nthe new poll marks the first time this election season cnn has looked at preferences among likely voters. typically, likely voters in midterm elections are a bit more republican-leaning than the broader pool of registered voters. this year, democrats are expressing just as much interest in voting as republicans, and voters who are democrats or democratic-leaning independents continue to be more enthusiastic about casting a ballot for congress than those who tilt toward the gop (56% are extremely or very enthusiastic vs. 50% of republican voters).\n\nthe results of the poll suggest a midterm environment that is looking a lot like 2006, when democrats took control of the house amid widespread voter dissatisfaction with republican president george w. bush and his handling of the war in iraq. in 2010, backlash to president barack obama and the passage of obamacare led to the organization of the ideological tea party movement, which boosted republicans back into control of the house. in september of 2006, cnn polling also found democrats with a 10-point lead over republicans on the generic ballot.\n\nthe president is a negative motivator for a majority of voters, according to the poll, with 54% saying they would be more apt to support a candidate who opposes president trump. about a third (36%) say they're partial to supporting a candidate who backs the president. those figures have shifted against trump since the question was last asked in may (48% said they'd prefer an anti-trump candidate in that poll, 43% a pro-trump one).\n\nviews of the president are closely tied to preferences in the house ballot: among those likely voters who approve of the way the president is handling his job, 89% plan to back the republican in their district, while 87% of those who disapprove favor the democrat.\n\nand more americans say the country would be better off (40%) than worse off (28%) should democrats take control of congress in this november's elections. that's a wider margin that felt the nation would be better off should republicans take control back in 2010. only about a quarter now (27%) say it doesn't make a difference, fewer than felt that way in 2014 or 2010, suggesting voters see this year's contest as more consequential.\n\nthe results come as multiple polls show similar shifts in the democrats' favor in the dynamics of the midterm race. it is the third poll released in the past two days to show democrats with a double-digit lead over republicans on a generic ballot question.\n\nthe poll shows democrats with a huge advantage among women likely voters, 60% say they back the democrat in their district compared with 36% for the republican. among men, republicans hold a slim 5-point edge. and as in 2016, education is a sharp divider among white voters. those without college degrees broadly back the republican (57% for the republican to 38% for the democrat) while those who hold four-year degrees favor the democrat by a similar margin (59% to 37%).\n\nvoters on both sides of the battle for the house say they are largely casting votes to support their candidate rather than to make a stand against their opponent. about 6 in 10 voters who choose the democrat in their district say they are doing so more to vote for the democrat than against the republican. likewise, 60% of republican backers say they're casting a supportive vote for the gop more than one against the democrats.\n\ndiverse candidates\n\nas this year's primary season comes to a close, the slate of candidates chosen includes a diversity of backgrounds not often seen in american politics. with a record number of female candidates on major party tickets for congress and groundbreaking candidates from racial, ethnic and religious minorities landing on ballots across the country, many americans are now choosing among candidates who resemble them for the first time. the new poll finds a majority of americans feel it is extremely or very important for congress to represent the country's demographic makeup (62% say so), about the same share who say it's that important for congress to represent the nation's political makeup in partisanship and ideology (63%). more, 67%, say it's critical for congress to represent the nation's economic diversity.\n\nwomen (69%) and non-whites (70%) are more apt than men or whites to consider a demographically-representative congress deeply important. democrats (82%) say it's more important than republicans (44%). democrats are also more likely than republicans to say it's important for congress to represent the nation's political makeup in terms of partisanship and ideology (76% among democrats to 55% among republicans). the economic makeup of congress is also important to democrats, who say congress should represent the country in terms of income and education (78% among democrats to 59% among republicans).\n\nlooking ahead to 2020 democrats\n\nand looking ahead to the next major election to come – the presidential nominating contests – the democrats who are among the top contenders for their party's presidential nomination are generally viewed more favorably than unfavorably by their partisans. but outside of the very top tier of candidates, many potential presidential hopefuls are widely unknown.\n\nformer vice president joe biden earns near universal positive reviews among his partisans, 86% have a favorable opinion. bernie sanders, who finished second to hillary clinton in 2016, isn't far behind with 78% of democrats and democratic-leaning independents holding positive views of him. massachusetts senator elizabeth warren also earns majority-positive ratings among the democratic electorate at 57% favorability.\n\nmajorities of the democratic electorate are unsure, however, about cory booker (53%), kamala harris (55%) and deval patrick (84%). among those who do have an opinion about each of them, the reviews are largely positive.\n\nthe cnn poll was conducted by ssrs september 6 through 9 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points, for the subset of 923 registered voters, it is plus or minus 3.9 and for the 775 likely voters plus or minus 4.3 percentage points.
the medicare for all plan would leave intact the current infrastructure of doctors, hospitals and other health care providers, but nationalize the health insurance industry. nearly all the money individuals and employers currently pay into the system as well as much of the money states pay would, under sanders' plan, instead go through the federal government.\n\nsen. bernie sanders has been pushing a single-payer health care system for decades. it's the centerpiece of his vision for a more democratic socialist america. there are several such proposals for a single-payer system, but what's below is from the 100-page draft bill most recently introduced, with tweaks, by sanders in 2019.\n\ns. 1129 to establish a medicare-for-all national health insurance program. in the senate of the united states april 10, 2019 mr. sanders (for himself, ms. baldwin, mr. blumenthal, mr. booker, mrs. gillibrand, ms. harris, mr. leahy, mr. markey, mr. merkley, mr. schatz, mr. udall, ms. warren, mr. whitehouse, ms. hirono, and mr. heinrich) introduced the following bill; which was read twice and referred to the committee on finance from page 1\n\nthe first thing to note is that sanders' proposal has only 14 co-sponsors in the senate. that's not even a majority of democrats. that's less than a third of the 60 votes usually required to overcome a filibuster and pass major legislation, although he has said he would use budget rules to maneuver around the practice of the filibuster in order to get medicare for all passed.\n\nsec. 102. universal entitlement. (a) in general.—every individual who is a resident of the united states is entitled to benefits for health care services under this act. the secretary shall promulgate a rule that provides criteria for determining residency for eligibility purposes under this act. (b) treatment of other individuals.—the secretary— (1) may make eligible for benefits for health care services under this act other individuals not described in subsection (a) and regulate their eligibility to ensure that every person in the united states has access to health care; and (2) shall promulgate a rule, consistent with federal immigration laws, to prevent an individual from traveling to the united states for the sole purpose of obtaining health care services provided under this act. from page 4\n\nin sanders' proposal, everyone who is a us resident, including undocumented immigrants, gets coverage. that would be a likely point of contention with this plan. there is a prohibition on traveling to the us for free medical care.\n\nsec. 103. freedom of choice. any individual entitled to benefits under this act may obtain health services from any institution, agency, or individual qualified to participate under this act. from page 5\n\nmedicare for all is meant to be an extremely egalitarian proposal in which everyone has access to any provider. that's certainly not the current system in the us, in which there are extreme differences based on the quality of a patient's insurance and wealth.\n\nsec. 104. non-discrimination. (a) in general.—no person shall, on the basis of race, color, national origin, age, disability, or sex, including sex stereotyping, gender identity, sexual orientation, and pregnancy and related medical conditions (including termination of pregnancy), be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination by any participating provider as defined in section 301, or any entity conducting, administering, or funding a health program or activity, including contracts of insurance, pursuant to this act. from page 5\n\nthis is a general nondiscrimination statement except it includes the language including termination of pregnancy. the issue of how the federal government should (or should not) provide access to abortion nearly sank passage of the affordable care act in 2009 and 2010. here sanders appears to go in the opposite direction and enshrine abortion rights in the language.\n\nthe bill also says the health and human services secretary will lay out a system by which claims of discrimination should be adjudicated and that courts can grant damages.\n\nsec. 105. enrollment. (a) in general.—the secretary shall provide a mechanism for the enrollment of individuals eligible for benefits under this act. the mechanism shall— (1) include a process for the automatic enrollment of individuals at the time of birth in the united states or upon the establishment of residency in the united states; from page 6\n\namericans would be automatically enrolled for benefits at birth or when they move to the us. a subsequent section describes a universal medicare card.\n\nsec. 106. effective date of benefits. (a) in general.—except as provided in subsection (b), benefits shall first be available under this act for items and services furnished on january 1 of the fourth calendar year that begins after the date of enactment of this act. from page 7\n\nsanders envisions a four-year transition period. children under 19 would get universal coverage one year after the bill is signed into law. everyone else would have the option of keeping their current coverage during the transition or of buying into medicare or a transitional public plan. four years to transition from a mostly private system to an entirely public one would be a quick pace. automatic enrollment is also a departure from the current medicare system. there would be no precedent for administering this kind of federal program in the us.\n\nsec. 107. prohibition against duplicating coverage. (a) in general.—beginning on the effective date described in section 106(a), it shall be unlawful for— (1) a private health insurer to sell health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits provided under this act; or (2) an employer to provide benefits for an employee, former employee, or the dependents of an employee or former employee that duplicate the benefits provided under this act. from page 8\n\nthis is the most controversial element of this bill. sanders would make it illegal to sell private health insurance that covers the benefits offered by medicare for all. this provision would certainly be subject to lawsuits. a subsequent section says additional benefits not covered by medicare for all (cosmetic surgery, for instance) could be covered by a supplemental insurance plan.\n\nthis is the nationalization of an industry in an unprecedented way. it's important to note here that about one-third of the american seniors who currently get medicare get it through private medicare advantage plans offered by health insurance companies. those plans would go away.\n\nsec. 201. comprehensive benefits. (a) in general.—subject to the other provisions of this title and titles iv through ix, individuals enrolled for benefits under this act are entitled to have payment made by the secretary to an eligible provider for the following items and services if medically necessary or appropriate for the maintenance of health or for the diagnosis, treatment, or rehabilitation of a health condition: from page 8\n\nthere is a generous list of covered health, vision and dental benefits, and some long-term care benefits including:\n\n(1) hospital services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital care, including 24-hour-a-day emergency services and inpatient prescription drugs. (2) ambulatory patient services. (3) primary and preventive services, including chronic disease management. (4) prescription drugs, medical devices, biological products, including outpatient prescription drugs, medical devices, and biological products. (5) mental health and substance abuse treatment services, including inpatient care. (6) laboratory and diagnostic services. (7) comprehensive reproductive, maternity, and newborn care. (8) pediatrics, including early and periodic screening, diagnostic, and treatment services (as defined in section 1905(r) of the social security act (42 u.s.c. 1396d(r))). (9) oral health, audiology, and vision services. (10) short-term rehabilitative and habilitative services and devices. (11) emergency services and transportation. (12) necessary transportation to receive health care services for individuals with disabilities and low income individuals. (13) home and community-based long-term services and supports from page 9\n\nthe hhs secretary would be in charge of regularly recommending improvements and adjustments to the benefits package for congress to consider. states can offer their residents supplementary benefits, but can't offer their own version of medicare for all benefits.\n\nsec. 202. no cost-sharing. (a) in general.—the secretary shall ensure that no cost-sharing, including deductibles, coinsurance, copayments, or similar charges, be imposed on an individual for any benefits provided under this act, except as described in subsection (b). (b) exceptions.—the secretary may set a cost sharing schedule for prescription drugs and biological products— from page 13\n\npeople who get medicare for all would not pay for any part of their health care except, in some cases, up to $200 for prescription drugs for individuals making more than $25,200 annually or families of four making more than $52,400 (200% of the federal poverty level in 2020). the average cost of drugs per person per year in the us is currently more than $1,000 for drugs bought at pharmacies, but the average out-of-pocket spending per person is only $144. however, the current costs are concentrated more on some people than others. this would spread those costs.\n\nsec. 203. exclusions and limitations. (a) in general.—benefits for services are not available under this act unless the services meet the standards specified in section 201(a), as defined by the secretary. (b) treatment of experimental services and drugs.— (1) in general.—in applying subsection (a), the secretary shall make national coverage determinations with respect to services that are experimental in nature. from page 14\n\nthe hhs secretary has a lot of power in this plan to determine what is covered, including what experimental and new services are covered. currently, for people with private health insurance, those determinations are made by insurance companies.\n\nsec. 204. coverage of institutional long-term care services under medicaid. title xix of the social security act (42 u.s.c. 1396 et seq.) is amended by inserting the following section after section 1946: state plan for providing institutional long term care services from page 15\n\nsanders changed his plan in 2019 to include home- and community-based long-term care after lobbying by disability rights groups and to come more in line with a single-payer insurance plan put forward by progressives in the house. but this portion of his proposal, which stretches over multiple pages, would rely on a state plan to provide institutional long-term care services. separately, he gives states the ability to set their own standards under medicare for all as long as they are not less generous than the federal system.\n\nsec. 301. provider participation and standards. (a) in general.—an individual or other entity furnishing any covered service under this act is not a qualified provider unless the individual or entity— (1) is a qualified provider of the services under section 302; (2) has filed with the secretary a participation agreement described in subsection (b); and (3) meets, as applicable, such other qualifications and conditions with respect to a provider of services under title xviii of the social security act as described in section 1866 of the social security act (42 u.s.c. 1395cc). from page 22\n\nsanders promises americans access to the doctors they currently see and more. but his system assumes that doctors will take part. just as many doctors do not take part in the current medicare and insurance systems, some would likely sidestep the government program and seek payment on a fee-for-service basis outside medicare for all.\n\nwhile providers would have protections under the plan, they would also have responsibilities. and it is an either-or scenario. either they enroll as a medicare for all provider or they go outside the system.\n\nsec. 303. use of private contracts. (a) in general.—subject to the provisions of this subsection, nothing in this act shall prohibit an institutional or individual provider from entering into a private contract with an enrolled individual for any item or service— from page 29\n\nthe bill does specifically envision private agreements — not insurance — between individuals and providers or groups of providers outside of medicare for all. but providers, once they enter into such agreements, cannot participate in the government program for a year.\n\nsec. 401. administration. (a) general duties of the secretary.— (1) in general.—the secretary shall develop policies, procedures, guidelines, and requirements to carry out this act, including related to— (a) eligibility for benefits; (b) enrollment; (c) benefits provided; (d) provider participation standards from page 33\n\nthis would be a massive new federal bureaucracy, replacing, by some estimates, 2 million us insurance and health industry jobs. setting up, enforcing and evolving a health care system for about 320 million people and transitioning more than 200 million from a private system to a public one would be a gargantuan undertaking. sanders' proposal imagines a regional administration system that would coordinate individual states and filter up to the hhs secretary, who would be in charge of setting policies. an official ombudsman would collect and hear grievances.\n\nsec. 411. application of federal sanctions to all fraud and abuse under universal medicare program. the following sections of the social security act shall apply to this act in the same manner as they apply to state medical assistance plans under title xix of such act: from page 44\n\nwhen the federal government takes over trillions of dollars in spending, there is a real danger of waste, fraud and abuse. sanders envisions applying existing protections that govern medicaid funding to protect this medicare for all investment. there are also sections that mandate the creation of an annual health care budget and a focus on cost containment.\n\na key selling point of a single-payer system is that the government can keep costs down by setting prices to pay doctors, hospitals and drug companies. it's also why the industries will fight this tooth and nail. it would almost definitely set lower payments to doctors and hospitals than private insurers. more on that in a moment.\n\n(4) temporary worker assistance.—for up to 5 years following the date on which benefits first become available as described in section 106(a), up to 1 percent of the budget may be allocated to programs providing assistance to workers who perform functions in the administration of the health insurance system and who may experience economic dislocation as a result of the implementation of this act. from page 47\n\nby replacing the entire health insurance industry, the government could displace 2 million workers, according to some estimates. some of those would find jobs in the new government systems. others could be eligible for up to five years of temporary assistance.\n\n(5) reserve fund.—the secretary shall establish and maintain a reserve fund to respond to the costs of treating an epidemic, pandemic, natural disaster, or other such health emergency. from page 48\n\ncoronavirus? hurricane? earthquake. the government should be prepared.\n\n(a) application of payment processes under title xviii.—except as otherwise provided in this section, the secretary shall establish, by regulation, fee schedules that establish payment amounts for benefits under this act in a manner that is consistent with processes for determining payments for items and services under title xviii of the social security act from page 49\n\none fact of us health care is that american doctors make more money than their counterparts in other countries. there are many reasons for that, but one clear way to contain the cost of health care is to contain the amount doctors are paid. granted, they should have a much simpler time being reimbursed under a single-payer system and more of their time will be spent treating patients. but their bottom lines might also shrink. that's one reason some doctors could opt out. hospitals too. in the current system, private insurance pays higher rates to hospitals and doctors than medicare and medicaid do.\n\nsec. 613. office of primary health care. (a) in general.—there is established within the agency for healthcare research and quality an office of primary health care, responsible for coordinating with the secretary, the health resources and services administration, and other offices in the department as necessary, from page 54\n\nthe federal government would take a much bigger role in assessing the landscape of educating doctors and determining how many specialists are needed in a given field. the us currently has a system that prioritizes specialization over general medicine. and that's not saving anyone money.\n\nsec. 614. payments for prescription drugs and approved devices and equipment. (a) negotiated prices.—the prices to be paid for covered pharmaceuticals, medical supplies, and medically necessary assistive equipment shall be negotiated annually by the secretary. from page 55\n\ndrug companies are going to fight this with all their might (and they have a lot of money). instead of setting a price in the market for a drug, they'd have fewer people to negotiate with and may have to accept what the government gives them. it's no coincidence that americans pay a lot more for the same prescription drugs than people in countries with single-payer systems. so, yes, this would remove some of the profit motive of the pharmaceutical industry. on the other hand, it's not at all an agreed-upon fact that drug companies should be able to charge exorbitant prices for lifesaving drugs.\n\nsec. 701. universal medicare trust fund. (a) in general.—there is hereby created on the books of the treasury of the united states a trust fund from page 56\n\nthis is a massive new program and paying for it isn't going to be easy. sanders has plenty of ideas, however. for starters, everything that goes into the medicare trust fund would now go into this new, larger fund. so would money that now goes toward the health care of veterans and pays states to provide medicaid.\n\nthe federal government gives tax breaks to employers for providing health insurance. with those benefits now outlawed, the savings in tax breaks would go into the trust fund.\n\nbut it's certainly not clear how the numbers would add up. sanders has proposed a menu of options to offset the costs of this program. they are not all outlined in this text. the dollars and cents of this are less important to sanders than the moral imperative. here's a look at sanders' math.\n\nsec. 901. relationship to existing federal health programs. from page 63\n\nthere are many pages of this bill that deal with sunsetting the bramble of ways the us government currently helps americans with health care — medicare, obamacare, tricare, federal employee benefits and more — and unifying them in this new plan.\n\ntitle x—transition 19 subtitle a—transitional medicare buy-in option and transitional public option from page 67\n\nduring the four years during which sanders envisions the medicare for all system being set up, there is a rolling admission to traditional medicare, with its low premiums, starting with 55-year-olds in the first year after the law is passed, 45-year-olds in the second and 35-year-olds in the third.\n\nthere would similarly be a public health insurance option offered on the individual market for those not yet qualified for medicare.\n\nthe rest of the bill concerns this transition period. it zeroes out some medicare premiums during that period and accounts for subsidies some americans get under obamacare.
return to transcripts main page\n\ninside politics\n\npaul ryan explains health care bill; ryan defends health care bill. aired 12-12:30p et\n\naired march 9, 2017 - 12:00 et\n\nthis is a rush transcript. this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\n\n\n[12:00:00] rep. paul ryan (r), house speaker: they had a great risk pool reinsurance system in utah. a good one in washington state. all those are gone under obamacare.\n\n\n\nryan: here's how they work and here's how our system would work. we would directly support the people with pre-existing conditions. let me get you a sense of this.\n\n\n\none percent of the people in these markets drive 23 percent of the costs. one percent of people in the individual health insurance market drive 23 percent of the costs.\n\n\n\nso a reinsurance program is to cover more than just the 1 percent, to cover the people who have high health care costs. so by having state innovation funds to go to the states, to set up these reinsurance programs, we would directly subsidize the people who have pre-existing conditions. direct support for the people with pre- existing conditions, so that everybody else has cheaper health insurance.\n\n\n\nwhat you do when you do this is, the individual market, the people who don't have pre-existing conditions, they have much more stable prices.\n\n\n\nlet me give you an example.\n\n\n\ntake a small business that has 40 employees. let's say that four people in that business get cancer. well, under that business, that business has to pay for all those cancer patients, all those cancer treatments. so the other 36 people in that 40-person pool, have -- get hit with much, much higher premiums to pay for the four that got cancer.\n\n\n\nthat's how insurance works today. and that is one of the reasons why this thing is going bankrupt.\n\n\n\nhere's our solution. let's make sure we just cover the people who have pre-existing conditions, make sure that reinsurance or risk pools kick in for those four people in that small business that get cancer, subsidize that coverage. and what you do by doing that, is you dramatically lower and stabilize the price of insurance for everybody else. so those other 36 people, in that small business have predictable prices, lower prices.\n\n\n\nthat brings you more choice, more competition and lower prices for the vast, vast majority of americans who are not in the pre- existing condition category.\n\n\n\nso directly subsidize them through state-based risk and reinsurance pool programs that we would finance with support from the federal government to attack this problem, and let health insurance stabilize, go down in price.\n\n\n\nhere's another thing that we think is extremely important.\n\n\n\none of the problems we have is we don't really have a consumer dynamic in health care. people don't always care what things cost or how good care's going to be, because they don't get that information. we actually immunize or block the ability for people to actually see what things cost in health care, or to act like a consumer.\n\n\n\nlet me give an example.\n\n\n\njanna and i have three kids. they are 33 months apart. we call them irish triplets. our three kids had three tonsillectomies over the course of three years in janesville, wisconsin, from the same ent at the same hospital. at each one of these times, i tried to find out, what's this tonsillectomy going to cost? never could i get that answer to that question.\n\n\n\ni only found out what it cost months after those procedures, when i got various bills from the ent, the ear nose and throat doctor, from the anesthesiologist, from the hospital. and the variation of price between those three procedures from the same doctor and the same hospital within three years was huge.\n\n\n\none of them, the recovery bill, the recovery for my son, he sat in a lazy-boy, ate jell-o, watched spongebob for two hours, that was $1,400.\n\n\n\ni mean, this is stuff that's crazy.\n\n\n\nwe don't shop like this for anything else we buy in our life. why should we shop like this for health care?\n\n\n\nand so what health savings accounts achieves -- this is a law that i helped write in 2003, something that we as conservatives have been fighting for for the whole time -- is we want to increase health savings accounts, which is what we do in this bill, so we have more competition and lower costs.\n\n\n\nhere's the point i'm trying to make.\n\n\n\nin 2000, i got lasik surgery. the reason i can see you all so well, is because in 2000, i got this lasik surgery, which was elective; insurance didn't cover it. and so i knew exactly what the procedure was going to cost up front.\n\n\n\nand since then, this excimer laser that does this procedure has been revolutionized three times, and the price is lower. so, in this area of health care, quality went up and cost went down because i cared as a consumer what it was.\n\n\n\nso it's not that that dynamic cannot happen in health care, it's that it isn't happening throughout most of health care.\n\n\n\nand what health savings accounts does, is it helps hardworking taxpayers get access to affordable solutions to help them pay for their out-of-pocket costs, but it's also their skin in the game, their money.\n\n\n\nif they save money by saying to a hospital or a doctor or a health care provider, what is this going to cost me? where's the best value for my money? if we can bring that consumer pressure to bear in health care, we can dramatically enlist the support of millions of americans to help us fix this health care problem.\n\n\n\n[12:05:00]\n\n\n\nryan: and that's one of the critical things we're trying to achieve here. instead of using opm -- other people's money -- to pay for health care that you don't care what things cost, we want to harness the power of the marketplace, the power of the consumer, of the patient and the doctor to demand better services, to demand better quality. we want transparency on price, on quality, and an economic incentive to act on that thing so that we can bring consumers to the bear.\n\n\n\nthis what we say -- this is what we mean when we say we want a patient health care system.\n\n\n\nok, here is a really important part of our american health care act: refundable tax credits. i want to explain exactly what we mean when we say this.\n\n\n\nunder the current obamacare system, we have a washington- controlled system with skyrocketing premiums and dwindling choices. it's a death spiral. it's collapsing. the government makes you buy what you want to buy. and it's an open-ended subsidy for a lot of americans.\n\n\n\nour solution is a portable monthly tax credit. this is why we believe this is the right way to go.\n\n\n\nwe want a market-based system which will give us lower cost, more competition, and more choices.\n\n\n\nthere's a real problem in the tax code today in that the tax code discriminates against people who don't get health care from their job. if you're working and you're not on medicaid, and you have a job that's paying you 10, 12, 15 bucks an hour, and that job does not give you health insurance, there's nothing that the tax code does to help you buy health insurance. if you do have health care from your job, you have an open-ended tax benefit.\n\n\n\nso, what we're saying is that's really kinda not fair to the -- to the man or woman who is working at a job that doesn't get health insurance offered to them. let's equalize the tax treatment of health care and give people the same kind of tax benefit to go buy health insurance if they don't get it from their job. and giving a person a monthly portable tax credit gives them the ability upfront to go buy health insurance of their choosing.\n\n\n\nand here's the key: you buy what you want to buy. if you don't want to use your tax credit to go buy health insurance, you don't have to. if you don't want to buy this plan, you want to buy that plan, go for it.\n\n\n\nit's your choice. it's freedom. it's called free-market health care.\n\n\n\nthe states get to set up their own health insurance systems. the states get to set up their own regulations so that you can buy whatever you want to buy where you live.\n\n\n\nthat is called patient's choice. that is called a patient- centered system.\n\n\n\nand that is one of the biggest tools we believe can be used to replace obamacare. this is part of replacing obamacare with a system that works to give everybody universal access to affordable coverage.\n\n\n\nnow, here is where we stand.\n\n\n\nthe current system is riddled with endless regulations that are driving up costs and limiting choices for consumers. and you see how the collapse is occurring.\n\n\n\nour solution: greater consumer options.\n\n\n\nthe patient is the nucleus of the health care system.\n\n\n\nwe don't want insurance companies becoming monopolies, looking for favoritism in a cronyistic way at washington. we want health insurers, hospitals, doctors, all providers of health care benefits competing against each other for our business as consumers.\n\n\n\nthat is how the great american free enterprise system works in all other aspects of our lives and our economy. that's what should work in this system as well.\n\n\n\nso, the result: you choose the plan that meets your needs. you buy what you want to buy, not what the government tells you to buy.\n\n\n\nso, our goal here is -- final -- is this: lower costs, more choices, patients in control, universal access to care.\n\n\n\nthere are two points i would make in conclusion.\n\n\n\nwe, as republicans, have been waiting seven years to do this. we, as republicans, who fought the creation of this law and accurately predicted that it would not work, ran for office in 2010, in 2012, in 2014 and in 2016 on a promise that we would -- if given the ability, we would repeal and replace this law.\n\n\n\nhow many people running for congress and the senate did you hear say that? how many times did you hear president donald trump, when he was candidate donald trump, say that?\n\n\n\nthis is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing obamacare. the time is here. the time is now. this is the moment. and this is the closest this will ever happen.\n\n\n\nit really comes down to a binary choice. we now have the ability, through the budget rules that we have in the senate, with our three- pronged approach, to actually make good on our word.\n\n\n\nwe told people in 2016 what it would look like when we had the chance to replace obamacare. that was our better way plan. that's what this is.\n\n\n\nso we said in 2016 to our citizens, to the american people, to our constituents, if you give us this chance, this opportunity, this is what we'll do. now is our chance and our opportunity to do it.\n\n\n\nryan: questions? chad (ph)?\n\n\n\nquestion: thank you, mr. speaker.\n\n\n\nyou say this is a binary choice. a two-part question: why would somebody not believe this is take-it-or-leave-it when you hear from members of the freedom caucus and conservatives, say, take your bill or change it?\n\n\n\nand number two, when the democrats approved cap-and-trade in the summer of 2009, there was much criticism of a manager's amendment which was put in at the end to make that bill ripe for passage on the floor. when we hear these criticisms from republicans, why would we expect something like that not to emerge in this case to make that bill ok, to pass, and get their votes?\n\n\n\nryan: so, i would answer it in this way.\n\n\n\nwhat people are talking about -- there's a lot of frustration, a lot of confusion, frankly, out there among conservative groups and even among members -- is reconciliation has certain limits. so there are folks who would love to see us put in this reconciliation bill all these other ideas.\n\n\n\none conservative group is saying by golly, you better put shopping across state lines in this bill or else we're not going to support it. guess what, chad? if we did that, we wouldn't be able to pass this bill. it would be filibustered in the senate. it wouldn't even come up for a vote.\n\n\n\nso, the last thing we want to do is prevent our ability to actually get law made. so, it really is a conversation about the third prong approach -- the other bills we're going to pass outside of reconciliation, which in the house we're a majority body we can pass -- that go the senate.\n\n\n\nso much of the conversations are about moving this other agenda on the same track around the same time to get these things done. the last point is, as you know the process, but a lot of people don't,\n\n\n\nwe're going through four different committees. that's how legislation works in the regulator order. we just did the ways and means committee last night. we're in the middle of the commerce committee. next week, it goes to the budget committee. and then it goes to the rules committee before it goes to the house floor. the bill will be out there for three weeks to be looked at. go to readthebill.gop. it's a 123-page bill. it's not 2,000 pages of something that they just whipped together and flipped to the floor like they did. they didn't -- we didn't write it in harry reid's office on christmas eve. this was written by our committees.\n\n\n\nand let's back up a second even further. this bill has been worked on for a year. this bill was worked on from january to june last year so that we could offer our constituents and the american people, in our better way agenda, what we'd replace obamacare with. we offered it up in june. we ran on it all through the election. and now we've translated it into legislation.\n\n\n\nand even backing up further, these two key components -- block- granting medicaid back to the states; de-federalizing entitlements; putting a cap on it -- that is something that conservatives have been talking about and dreaming about for decades.\n\n\n\nand repealing another entitlement, obamacare -- its mandates, its subsidies, its taxes, and replacing it with republican free market health care tax policy. if you told me two, 10 years ago where we would be, i think i'd be in a dream. i'd be doing back-flips.\n\n\n\nto conservatives who've been fighting for health care reform, this is so exciting. and so what's happening now is members realize this the chance. this is the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\n\n\nso naturally in the legislative process, people are saying, well, i'd love to have this in there; i'd love to have that in there. that's the legislative process. that's what we're going through. and what people are sort of learning is this reconciliation tool is pretty tight. there's a lot of stuff we would love to put in the bill, but unfortunately the senate rules don't allow us to do that.\n\n\n\nand that's where you see a lot of confusion and a lot of frustration, understandably so. but that's also why we have a three- pronged approach: administrative actions by tom price at hhs; and the additional legislation that we're going to move as well.\n\n\n\nquestion: so just to clarify, not to belabor the point, so you're saying that this bill was crafted in a way so it would meet the reconciliation byrd test in the senate.\n\n\n\nryan: correct.\n\n\n\nquestion: ergo, there couldn't be much change to this...\n\n\n\nryan: correct.\n\n\n\nquestion: ... and you (inaudible) other options. so (inaudible) not many changes...\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nryan: well, we'll see -- we'll see what we have to do when we get our score. because as you know, you don't -- when you go to authorizing committees, you typically don't go with your score ready. when we get our score, i'm sure we'll probably have to make some tweaks and adjustments. that happens every time we do reconciliation.\n\n\n\nbut yes, this is written -- this bill is written so that -- it's called privileged. this bill is written so that it can't be filibustered; so that they have to bring it up and vote on it in the senate. and if we put things in this bill that take that privilege off of it, so that it's not reconciliation, they won't even vote on it. they will filibuster it and they won't even vote on it.\n\n\n\nso that's what i mean when i say this is the closest we've been to repealing and replacing obamacare. and let me just say it again. this is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing obamacare.\n\n\n\nyes?\n\n\n\nquestion: mr. speaker, how did you come up with the amount that you would give out in tax credits? and why should a family that makes $140,000 a year get the same amount as a family that makes $40,000?\n\n\n\nryan: that's a really good question.\n\n\n\nso, the amount of the tax credits is based upon the way insurance works. and it's modeled after the tom price legislation, which he had last year, which is adjust for age and family size. because, the older a person gets, the more costly their health care is. that's how insurance is written.\n\n\n\nso the tax credit adjusts more tax credit for the person's age, and obviously, if you have a bigger family you have more health care costs, so a bigger tax credit.\n\n\n\nnow why is the crap (ph) set where it is? and that's something -- by the way, 12 members of the freedom caucus, for example, were co- sponsors of the price legislation just last december, which is this kind of a tax credit situation.\n\n\n\na lot of our members through our feedback -- we had seven member listening sessions in february, four conferences, getting feedback from our members on this draft of this legislation, getting their ideas. and one of the concerns was, we should cap this credit. so, like a millionaire, that doesn't get health care from their work, but is a millionaire, doesn't get a tax credit.\n\n\n\nso that was something that everybody agreed with and the ways and means committee made that adjustment.\n\n\n\nbut the reason it's set where it is is, we don't want to have a job penalty. go back a few years ago and when cbo said obamacare produces job lock. obamacare says that the equivalent of 2 million to 3 million people will not go into the workforce, will not take jobs, because of the way the obamacare subsidies work.\n\n\n\nwhat i mean when i say that is, if you set that credit limit too low, and a person loses their credit by getting a raise, or -- or -- or advancing in life, you don't want to disincentivize that.\n\n\n\nso they're set at such a level that that wouldn't occur. but they're set at such a level so that really is for a middle-income family, or even an upper-middle income family -- so that we never tell a person, don't take that raise, don't get that job, don't take that promotion. we don't want federal tax law or tax credits to ever encourage a person not to advance, not to take a job, not to get a raise. that's why.\n\n\n\nquestion: where does that $2,000 (ph) figure come from? ryan: i'm gonna go in the back.\n\n\n\nquestion: (inaudible) companies on board to provide the (inaudible) talking about, and almost every industry organization has come out against it. the reason why there isn't as much participation (ph) as the customers might like, is because these companies can't offer these products (inaudible).\n\n\n\nryan: yes.\n\n\n\nquestion: how does (inaudible).\n\n\n\nryan: it's -- it's a great example.\n\n\n\nhere's what people are not seeing, which is number two.\n\n\n\ntom price, for legal reasons, can't tell you what he's thinking about doing. there's -- there's -- there's laws that prevent that.\n\n\n\nwe can do so much deregulation through the executive branch, by the secretary of health and human services. he actually just put one regulation out the other day which will go a long way toward lowering the cost of health insurance.\n\n\n\nso they haven't even seen yet what our secretary of hhs can do in -- in number two, in -- in -- in phase two here, where they actually can dramatically lower the price of health insurance. so those companies haven't seen that yet.\n\n\n\nquestion: (inaudible)\n\n\n\nryan: so let me just finish. don't interrupt me, if you don't mind.\n\n\n\nhere's the other point.\n\n\n\nwe have basically a few options in front of us.\n\n\n\nnumber one, do nothing, let the system collapse.\n\n\n\nwhat the insurers are telling us is, if you thought a 25 percent average premium increase was rough in 2017, it's going to be a whole lot more of -- than that in 2018 and more and more insurers are going to pull out.\n\n\n\nso the insurers are telling us, if we don't know what's going on come late spring, we're going to have massive premium increases and pull- outs and it will collapse the individual market. what they also tell us, though, is if you only appeal the law, just gut and repeal the law, as some folks are suggesting, then you'll have triple-digit premium increases and you'll collapse the individual market.\n\n\n\nyou've got to remember, if we just repeal obamacare, it's not like life and the world goes back to life before obamacare. obamacare did so much damage to the u.s. health insurance system, that it's not as if you can just go back to the day before. so that's why we are offering a better way. that's why we are offering the american health care act. that's why we're offering a system that brings choice and competition back into the marketplace, gives people, through the use of risk pools, health savings accounts and tax credits, the ability to go find affordable coverage, and that brings insurers back into the marketplace.\n\n\n\nthe insurers are telling us, that will bring insurers back into the marketplace. if they can actually offer the plans that people want to buy, not the plans that people are making them buy, they'll have more plans being offered, there'll be more choice and more competition.\n\n\n\nthat is what brings down cost. and in conjunction with all the administrative things that tom price can do, those efforts together can help dramatically save our system and give us low-cost health insurance, better quality health insurance and access to affordable health insurance.\n\n\n\nryan: don't forget how all this works together. subsidize the sick and the pre-existing condition through risk pools and reinsurance. the health savings accounts to bring the consumer in the marketplace, to put pressure on providers to compete for our business based on cost and quality. and then give families who have jobs, but don't have the kind of jobs that gives them health insurance benefits, the same kind of tax benefit everybody else gets, so they too, at the beginning of the year -- at the beginning of the month, can go buy a plan that best meets their needs.\n\n\n\nthat is how you fix and save this system from the crash that is -- is occurring. and we're very, very confident that will work that way.\n\n\n\nthank for you indulging me. thank you for putting up with my town hall presentation.\n\n\n\ni just think it's really important to try and iron out all the differences, to show that there's folks who say, gosh, you should have this and that in this bill. reconciliation doesn't let you do it. we're doing it here. people who say, well, these regulations are so expensive and so costly, tom price at hhs can fix those things.\n\n\n\nwe can fix this problem. we promised the american people we would fix this problem. and the way to fix this problem is to repeal obamacare and replace it with a patient-centered market-based system. this is something that we, as conservatives, have been dreaming about for decades. this is the chance, and the best and only chance we're gonna get. and that's why i'm really excited.\n\n\n\nthank you very much. appreciate it.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: thank you, mr. speaker.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: are you willing to speak then off camera with some health care journalists (ph) --\n\n\n\ndana bash, cnn anchor: what you have been watching is classic, vintage paul ryan. this is the reason why he rose through the ranks as a young man because he is a policy wonk and likes to explain the policy that he supports. and in this case, as you just saw, shirt - suit jacket off, shirt sleeves rolled up, going through his powerpoint presentation, trying to sell his health care plan to, not democrats, not voters out there generally, but fellow conservatives.\n\n\n\nwelcome to inside politics. thank you so much for joining us. i'm dana bash. john king is off today.\n\n\n\nlet's talk about what we just saw. first and foremost, as i said, that's classic paul ryan. the fact that they're doing this on capitol hill, he's the guy explaining the policy, he's the guy selling in that way, not donald trump, what does that tell you?\n\n\n\nphil mattingly, cnn congressional correspondent: well, that he understands the policy. and i don't mean that in a negative sense to the president, but the president's team worked with speaker ryan's team and speaker ryan on the policy.\n\n\n\nbut this is speaker ryan's baby. this was his drive and he was the driving force behind this. his team was the driving legislative force behind what we're looking at right now, that house bill. and his team has really been working on this, as you've noted, not just for a year or two years, but particularly when it comes to the entitlement sections of this, years on end, powerpoints on end. one story in particular, the president's top adviser, reince priebus, steve bannon, gary cohn, all of those individuals were treated to a similar powerpoint behind closed doors a couple months ago as this process all started. when they need an explainer in chief, the speaker's the guy.\n\n\n\nbash: he is, explainer in chief, but then the question is, does he - has he wrapped himself up in this to own this issue? i should be introducing you guys. julia pace with the associated press. everybody knows phil mattingly, our local -\n\n\n\njulie pace, associated press: no introduction needed.\n\n\n\nbash: exactly, no introduction needed. but as i come to you on this, i was told from some conservatives who were in a meeting with president trump last night that what they're hearing from their grassroots is anger, but not necessarily at the president.\n\n\n\npace: right. bash: they do see this as just yet another move by the republican establishment, paul ryan leading the charge, to not listen to what conservatives really want.\n\n\n\npace: and you also hear this difference between what paul ryan is saying where he says this is the only choice. not only does he think it's the best choice, but it's the only choice, and what the president seems to be saying in some of these private meetings, which is leaving the door open to negotiation, to having some flexibility around it, that's the dealmaker side of him coming out. but how ryan and trump try to close that gap and appeal to these conservatives, you know, trump wants a win here, but he doesn't want to tie himself to something that's going to be unpopular for the sake of that win.\n\n\n\nbash: and, laura meckler, i just want to also add that as he was speaking, i was texting with some people in his office noting, i think what was abundantly clear, but that this is where he's in his element. he feels that he can explain it probably better than anyone. and, most importantly, admitting that they need to sell this to the conservatives who are becoming more and more fiercely opposed to this.\n\n\n\nlaura meckler, the wall street journal: and it's not just the conservatives in the house or in the senate.\n\n\n\nbash: exactly.\n\n\n\nmeckler: it's a lot of conservative groups that are out there. think tanks. the kind of support you would expect that you would have for a piece of major legislation. paul ryan is really in a bind here. this is his moment. he's been talking about this for so long. they've had years to talk about how they would replace the affordable care act if they had the chance. now they have the chance. sort of the all - everything's in place for this legislative action to go forward. and if he can't get it through, that's going to be a - just a huge defeat for him. and i think that it - but it stands in i think real contrast to what we saw in 2009 when president obama was trying to pass the law in the first place and you saw an incredible effort having learned from president clinton's failed effort to try to round up supportive groups and really try to keep everybody in the tent. and, obviously, they barely did it, but they did do it. i just wonder, given how difficult it was for obama to get it over the line, whether when they're starting out -\n\n\n\n[12:25:24] bash: exactly.\n\n\n\nmeckler: with so much opposition, whether they're going to ultimately be able to do this.\n\n\n\nbash: it's a great question. and olivier knox, i want to just say, i think one of the most important things that paul ryan said was, this is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing obamacare. like, listen, folks, you're used to being in the opposition. this is called legislating. this is the best we're going to do in the reality that we're in.\n\n\n\nolivier knox, yahoo! news: it's also the core - as julie alluded to be, it's one of the core messages. it's this or nothing, which is a very interesting argument, especially with - when the president is saying, hold on, well, maybe the - maybe it's an opening bid. it's really interesting to watch how this white house is ramping up its pressure campaign to get this passed. it looks - with the exception of the president's tweets - it's pretty conventional. it is a lot of regional interviews from the white house grounds. it is presidential and vice presidential travel. vice president pence is going to kentucky this weekend. and it's this. this is another - this is another component of this multipronged attack.\n\n\n\nbash: no question. ok, stand by, everybody. we're going to talk a lot more about the meat of this and what has happened overnight on capitol hill. high drama, high stakes in the wee hours. lawmakers, they did burn the midnight oil. hours and hours of discussion on this republican plan we just heard from paul ryan talking about. and, guess what? they're still going. we'll be right back.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)

(it's actually a bit more complicated than that, sir.)\n\nperhaps you resent the way he has been lionized since his passing. and maybe you still nurse a grudge over some of the things he said about you. you've got to get over it.\n\nthe senator once called me an idiot.\n\nhe didn't like the way i answered a question about isis from the pentagon podium and unloaded on me. i was a serving flag officer at the time, a two-star admiral, so i wasn't at liberty to respond.\n\nfriends and colleagues urged me not to take it personally. he says that about everybody, they told me, you're in great company!\n\nbut it didn't feel that way at all. it hurt. and not because i bristled at being called an idiot. i've been called a helluva lot worse than that. take a look at my twitter feed or, better yet, ask any of my four brothers how they would describe growing up with me.\n\nit hurt because it came from the likes of john mccain. it felt like i was falling short of the expectations of someone i deeply admired.\n\na man like mccain comes along only once in a generation or so. right or wrong – and by his own admission, he was plenty of both – he casts a long shadow. i imagine it's a bit chilly for you sitting in that shadow.\n\nmy advice, mr. president, such as you might accept it, is to start casting your own long shadow. stop denigrating yourself by trying to denigrate john mccain. admit, as i did, that it hurts to fall short of his example and then move on. focus on your own accomplishments.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nyou seem to admire andrew jackson, another flawed but famous politician. if you don't want to listen to me, maybe you should listen to him:\n\nany man worth his salt will stick up for what he believes right, jackson once said, but it takes a slightly better man to acknowledge instantly and without reservation that he is in error.\n\nyou've been terribly in error, mr. president. embarrassingly so. acknowledge that, please, and be a slightly better man.\n\nvery respectfully,\n\njohn f. kirby\n\nrear admiral, us navy (ret)

source: cnn trump blames democrats for daca ending\n\ncongress wasn't able to do it properly, and a six-month arbitrary timeline trump set came and went. the courts have temporarily iced his plans to end it. washington has been trying for more than a decade, with presidents from both parties and majorities from both parties, to pass comprehensive immigration reform, but neither the pressure of trump's daca threat nor his family separation zero-tolerance gambit have yet changed the calculus. moderate republicans in the house seemed close to a revolt against the status quo over daca, but it appears to have fizzled for now.\n\ntrump's tactics haven't been isolated to immigration, either. when republicans couldn't muster the votes to repeal obamacare on their own, he said that was democrats' fault too, for not coming to the negotiating table and helping to unravel former president barack obama's signature legislative accomplishment.\n\nso he acted unilaterally and did everything he could to strangle the law he couldn't kill, like zeroing out the penalty for not having insurance and also ending government cost-sharing reduction payments to insurance companies. it was a move designed to make premium prices go up. to inflict pain and force democrats to the negotiating table. we know this is true because he said at the time it'd be democrats fault when his action had its intended effect.\n\nany increase in obamacare premiums is the fault of the democrats for giving us a 'product' that never had a chance of working, he said on twitter.\n\nin another tweet, he said they should call him to fix the problem but he didn't mention he had made the decision to end the payments on his own.\n\nthe democrats obamacare is imploding. massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped dems should call me to fix!\n\nin announcing tariffs against china, his press team said, they were china's doing, not trump's. blame china for any short-term pain and raised consumer prices.\n\nsanders: look, china created this problem, not president trump. but we finally actually have a president who's willing to stand up and say 'enough is enough, we're gonna stop the unfair trade practices' https://t.co/yso3wnjslq — cnn politics (@cnnpolitics) april 4, 2018\n\nhe's promised he won't pass another big omnibus spending bill – the only kind congress seems able to pass in recent years. if it comes across his desk, he's said he could veto it.\n\nyou can guess who he'll blame if his veto causes a government shutdown. probably won't be him.\n\nin addition to trump's willingness to threaten personal pain at the negotiating table, these three examples also share the fact that none of the problems have been solved. that could all change tomorrow, but given the rhetoric from democrats, who are touring detention centers in texas rather than calling trump, it seems more likely these standoffs will continue into november.\n\nthe public is against trump on immigration, but he maintains support among republicans, according to a new cnn's poll released monday. trump learned in 2016 that immigration is a top issue for republicans. getting them to the polls will be key if they want to keep majorities in the house or senate.

enhance election integrity in texas\n\n(cnn) —\n\npresident donald trump likes to spin his finger in a circle and make a whirring noise when he's making fun of wind turbines as a source of renewable energy. but it was the president's policies that were spinning this week as he retreated from a number of bold pronouncements, policy ideas and nominees.\n\nif you're keeping score:\n\nthe border with mexico will not be closed.\n\nrepublicans will not soon present a replacement for the affordable care act.\n\nhe doesn't actually think the mueller report on russian election interference should be publicly released.\n\nhis nominee to head immigration and customs enforcement is his nominee no longer.\n\nwhat's on display is a president who just says things that pop into his head or announces policies via twitter – then must find ways to retreat from them or make them real.\n\ndid he ever really believe he would close the entire border with mexico, or was it just bluster? after the utter disappointment of failing to repeal obamacare, for which trump still carries a festering grudge, did he sincerely think it would get another vote?\n\nthat trump often says incorrect things about issues big and small has been well-documented. just this week, for some mystifying reason, he repeated his untrue contention that his father was born in germany. but his credibility, such as it is, faces new questions as the week draws to a close.\n\nfor example, declaring the us would close its southern border had wide implications that caused consternation in many quarters. but trump has now retreated from the closure threat and subbed in a threat for new auto tariffs on mexico a year from now. should the mexican government take that seriously? and should americans believe that trump can deliver on a new health care plan after the 2020 election? what is his credibility on any policy proposal if they don't seem to be much more than thoughts that suddenly occur to him?\n\nhere's a closer look at a week of flip-flops.\n\nfull retreat on health care\n\ntrump is no stranger to bold pronouncements, but this week found him rebuked, uncharacteristically, by the actions and words of republicans in the senate.\n\nwhen the president overruled his attorney general and health and human services secretary to endorse a texas judge's decision a few months ago that the entire affordable care act should be invalidated, it underlined the fact that republicans don't have a plan to replace obamacare at the moment and the party had largely given up on it even as the gop sought new ways to starve and undermine the law.\n\ntrump promised the public that a new plan would be forthcoming and republicans would be the party of health care!\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell, however, broke it to the president that no such plan would get a vote on capitol hill since the democrats who now control the house have very different ideas about how to fix the problem of unaffordable health insurance.\n\ntrump retreated late monday in a tweet.\n\nthe republicans are developing a really great healthcare plan with far lower premiums (cost) & deductibles than obamacare. in other words it will be far less expensive & much more usable than obamacare. vote will be taken right after the election when republicans hold the senate & win back the house. it will be truly great healthcare that will work for america, he said.\n\na staggered retreat on closing the border\n\na similar dose of truth-telling appears to have made him retreat from repeated threats to close the border with mexico, which almost everyone in government said would be an economic disaster.\n\nmcconnell said it would have a catastrophic impact, but while he told trump no, essentially, on health care, on the border wall he simply expressed his desire.\n\nclosing down the border would have potentially catastrophic economic impact on our country, and i would hope we would not be doing that, he said tuesday.\n\non wednesday, trump said he didn't mind the economic impact.\n\nsecurity is more important to me than trade, the president said during an appearance in the oval office. so we're going to have a secure border.\n\nbut on thursday, he twice changed his tune, first giving mexico an ultimatum.\n\nwe're going to give them a one-year warning, and if the drugs don't stop or (are) largely stopped, we're going to put tariffs on mexico and products, in particular, the cars … and if that doesn't stop the drugs, we close the border, trump said.\n\nlater that day he seemed to be laying the groundwork to back off his earlier threat to shut the border.\n\ni don't think we'll ever have to close the border because the penalty of tariffs on cars coming into the united states from mexico, at 25%, will be massive, the president said.\n\nbusiness leaders and lawmakers are still nervous about tariffs. and as trump hopes to finalize his new trade deal with mexico and canada, it's a serious and legitimate question: is this tariff threat real or just part of an effort to mask his retreat?\n\ngiving one nominee the unexpected boot and sticking by other picks\n\nit wasn't just policy on which trump was pivoting when, as he left washington on his way to california for a visit to the border on friday, he announced to reporters that he was pulling his nominee to lead the immigration and customs enforcement agency, ron vitiello. while the health care and border retreats were caused by trump running into political and economic realities, this one had his allies confused.\n\nwe're going in a little different direction. ron's a good man, but we're going in a tougher direction. we want to go in a tougher direction, trump said.\n\nhe didn't mention the very difficult confirmation fight acting director vitiello had faced. but the move was announced so quickly that it caught the department of homeland security off guard and leadership at ice thought the move was a clerical error friday morning.\n\non the other hand, trump wants to nominate herman cain to a powerful spot on the federal reserve board, and the president made clear to reporters that his people would have to figure out how to make it happen. cain, a former business executive and a 2012 republican presidential hopeful whose campaign was troubled by allegations of sexual harassment, has no direct monetary policy experience.\n\ni've recommended herman cain, trump said thursday. a terrific man, a terrific person. he's a friend of mine, the president told reporters in the oval office. i've recommended him highly for the fed. i've told my folks that that's the man and he's doing some pre-checking now and i would imagine he'd be in great shape.\n\ntrump is also standing behind his pick for another open fed seat, stephen moore of the conservative heritage foundation, a former cnn analyst. moore seems likely to immediately push for interest rate cuts urged by trump, which has set off alarm bells on wall street. he has also faced criticism for failing to pay spousal and child support, according to the new york times, and $75,000 in taxes.\n\na switch on the mueller report\n\nbefore attorney general william barr boiled down special counsel robert mueller's nearly 400-page report on russian election interference into a four-page summary that was very beneficial to trump – though it did not exonerate him on the issue of obstruction of justice – the president said the whole report should be released.\n\nbut now that barr's summary of the report is public, trump has evolved over the past two weeks and doesn't see the need for full disclosure.\n\nbarr is working on a redacted version of the full report that scrubs out certain material that is classified or comes from grand jury information. nearly every page is thought to have redactions, according to the justice department. democrats are already moving in the direction of a subpoena to see the full report, even though the attorney general has not yet released barr's version.\n\nit's a 400-page report, right? we could give them 800 pages, and it wouldn't be enough. they'll always come back and say it is not enough, trump said tuesday.\n\nthat trump makes bold pronouncements he can't deliver on is nothing new. that's how a complete ban on muslim people entering the country ultimately became a targeted ban on some people from certain countries.\n\nthat he sours on some people without explanation while sticking blindly with others has been a theme of his hiring and firing at the white house.\n\nthat he would say he supports something unexpected and then actively work against it has been at the heart of several of his positions on the mueller investigation and on transparency. he said he would happily give testimony in person for the investigation and then his legal team fought very hard for him not to. he promised to release his tax returns once he wasn't being audited, but it's doubtful he ever will.\n\nbut the increasingly rapid pace of flips and spins, of the time it takes to go from bold trump statement to complete retreat, has exposed a continuing problem for his presidency:\n\nnobody – not voters, policymakers, heads of state or his own staff – knows when they can trust what he says.
(cnn) the $1.9 trillion covid relief bill that president joe biden championed even before taking office is expected to land on his desk in coming days, but it could take some time for struggling americans to see all the benefits.\n\nwhile the $1,400 stimulus payments could hit people's bank accounts within days of biden signing the bill, the extension of federal unemployment benefits as well as the enhanced child tax credit and more generous affordable care act subsidies may take a few weeks -- or even a few months -- to arrive. the exact timing would depend on when federal departments can write the guidelines and how long it takes them and state agencies to then implement the new provisions.\n\nwhen it comes to unemployment benefits, there is little time to waste. more than 11 million americans are set to start seeing their pandemic unemployment benefits lapse this weekend.\n\nthe house is moving to approve the senate version of the bill as soon as wednesday. if biden signs it quickly after that, the jobless may see little or no break in payments. but it depends on which state they live in.\n\nthe bill passed by the senate last weekend would continue the existing $300 weekly federal boost and two key pandemic unemployment programs through september 6. the pandemic unemployment assistance program provides benefits to freelancers, gig workers, independent contractors and certain people affected by the pandemic, while the pandemic emergency unemployment compensation program increases the duration of payments for those in the traditional state unemployment system.\n\nsome states are moving fast\n\nsome states say they expect to be able to continue sending out benefits without pause -- as long as they don't have to make many changes to their unemployment systems.\n\nif president biden signs the bill soon and there are no additional program requirements in the bill, we should be able to implement the extensions without any interruption in payments, said kersha cartwright, a spokeswoman for georgia's department of labor. that is a lot of assumptions, though.\n\nin oregon, the employment department is already interpreting the legislation and preparing for the programming changes it will need to make to carry out the new provisions.\n\nour goal is to minimize any delays or disruptions for oregonians who are relying on these critical benefits, said melanni rosales, the agency's communications director.\n\narizona's department of economic security has also started planning for an extension, but the timing on when benefits would go out would depend on guidance from the us department of labor, said tasya peterson, the agency's press secretary.\n\nunlike the relief package congress approved in december, this legislation should be signed before any laid-off workers run out of benefits, and there are far fewer changes than in the prior bill, said andrew stettner, senior fellow at the century foundation.\n\nmost states should start sending out the jobless benefits in less than three weeks, he said.\n\nwhen congress passed the last relief bill extending the unemployment programs, some states were able to enact the new provisions swiftly, but others took more than a month. the delays left the unemployed waiting for $17.6 billion in benefits in january, according to an analysis by the century foundation.\n\nsome jobless oregonians, for instance, had no disruption in payments after the prior relief bill, but others had to wait until mid-february for their benefits to restart. in california, it took until early march to fully implement the december relief bill's provisions.\n\nstimulus checks will go out quickly\n\nthe stimulus payments are expected to go out starting this month, white house press secretary jen psaki told reporters on tuesday.\n\nin late december. but it's possible that for the previous pandemic stimulus bill, the internal revenue service started sending out the second round of payments -- that were worth up to $600 -- three days after then-president donald trump signed that billn late december. but it's possible that tax filing season , which is currently underway, could slow down the process this time.\n\nthe payments do not go all out at once. those whose bank information is on file with the irs would likely get the money first because it would be directly deposited into their accounts. others may receive paper checks or prepaid debit cards in the mail.\n\nstill, millions of people could be at risk of missing out because the irs does not know how to reach them. an estimated 8 million eligible people did not get the first stimulus payment, worth up to $1,200, which was approved last year and delivered over the spring and summer. while most people received the money automatically, very low-income people who don't normally file tax returns may have to take an extra step to register online or file a 2020 tax return.\n\nthis time, individuals earning less than $75,000 and couples earning less than $150,000 would receive the full $1,400 payment, plus an additional $1,400 per dependent. but the third round of checks would phase out faster than earlier payments -- completely cutting off individuals who earn more than $80,000 a year and married couples earning more than $160,000, regardless of how many children they have.\n\nchild tax credit\n\nfamilies are not expected to see the boost in the child tax credit until the summer, at the earliest.\n\nthe relief package calls for increasing the credit to $3,600 for each child younger than 6 and to $3,000 for each child between 6 and 17 in 2021 for qualifying families. it is currently a $2,000 credit for kids between the ages of 6 and 16.\n\nthe credit would also become fully refundable for the year and may be paid out monthly, rather than as a lump sum at tax time.\n\nfamilies could receive half their total credit as a periodic payment starting in july and running through the rest of the year, according to the legislation. they could then claim the remaining half on their 2021 tax returns.\n\nbut that schedule would also depend on whether the irs could implement the changes that quickly, which might be a heavy lift considering its thin staffing and other responsibilities. the legislation gives the agency some leeway -- saying that the treasury secretary could direct the payments to be issued as frequently as possible if a monthly timetable isn't feasible.\n\nhealth insurance subsidies\n\namericans who would qualify for the relief package's heftier federal premium subsidies for affordable care act policies would need to wait until the new regulations are programmed into the obamacare exchange.\n\nthe department of health and human services, which did not return a query about timing, is expected to move quickly to implement the law once it is signed, but it could still take several days or weeks.\n\nhealth insurers are waiting for critical details, including when the changes will go live, said kelley schultz, executive director of the commercial product policy group at america's health insurance plans, one of the industry's main trade associations.\n\nonce those back-end updates are complete, people should be able to shop for plans with new subsidies fairly quickly, she said.\n\nthe agency also must provide information about whether existing enrollees would need to return to the exchange to access the more generous assistance.\n\nunder the legislation, enrollees would pay no more than 8.5% of their income towards coverage, down from nearly 10% now. also, those earning more than the current cap of 400% of the federal poverty level -- about $51,000 for an individual and $104,800 for a family of four in 2021 -- would become eligible for help. the provision, which is retroactive to january, would last for two years.\n\nlower-income enrollees could have their premiums eliminated completely for the same period, and those collecting unemployment benefits could sign up for coverage with no premiums in 2021. the latter provision may take more time to set up since it is new.\n\nthe uninsured have until may 15 to enroll in 2021 coverage on the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, and have extended sign-up periods in most states that run their own marketplaces. biden directed the reopening of the federal exchange through an executive order in late january.\n\nalso, the senate legislation provides a full premium subsidy through the end of september to laid-off workers who want to remain on their employer health insurance plans through cobra.\n\nthe provision should take effect april 1, but when folks would be able to access it would depend on federal guidance, as well as their former employers and administrators of the cobra plans, schultz said. the subsidy is set up to be a credit against employers' quarterly federal payroll taxes.\n\nfood stamps\n\nfood stamp recipients would continue to get

source: hln spicer on time in trump white house\n\ntrump's image is under siege, and fire and fury seems certain to widen the perception between the version of himself that the president wants america to see and the one that emerges from behind-the-scenes reports.\n\nafter a slow start wednesday, when the white house seemed almost as staggered as the rest of washington about bannon's betrayal, trump aides and friends sprang to his defense in a belated damage control effort.\n\nwhite house press secretary sarah sanders blasted the book as tabloid gossip, and pointedly pushed back at suggestions by wolff that trump did not want to win the election in 2016.\n\nif you guys know anything, you know that donald trump is a winner and he's not going to do something for the purpose of not coming out on top and not coming out as a winner, she said. that's one of the most ridiculous things.\n\ntrump's lawyers fired off cease and desist letters to bannon and to wolff's publisher. trump friends anthony scaramucci and christopher ruddy toured cable news television studios to defend the president.\n\nthe publisher, for its part, responded by moving up the release date to friday.\n\nbut any day when the white house has to rebut questions about the president's mental stability is hardly a good one.\n\nand the trump team's attempt to discredit wolff faces another complication: the fact that his book broadly tends to corroborate many themes that have arisen in existing news reports about trump's personality.\n\nin october, for instance, republican sen. bob corker of tennessee raised questions about trump's temperament by describing his white house as an adult day care center.\n\nlast april, axios quoted senior administration officials as saying there was a need to keep smart, sane people around trump to fight his worst impulses.\n\n01:24 - source: cnn ex-aide: trump knows the constitution\n\nand questions about trump's focus and struggle to master policy details have been around as long as his presidency.\n\nafter the initial failure of an obamacare repeal effort last march, a senior congressional source told cnn that staff was for details, trump was for closing, adding that when it came to the intricacies of the bill, the president didn't know, didn't care or both.\n\nsam nunberg, a former campaign aide to trump, is quoted in fire and fury as saying he was sent to explain the constitution to the candidate – and got only as far as the fourth amendment before his finger is pulling down on his lip and his eyes are rolling back in his head.\n\nnunberg, appearing on cnn's erin burnett outfront on thursday, did not deny the anecdote but suggested nuance was missing from wolff's account, saying as that as a candidate who was also running a business, trump had a ton of things to do.

the trump administration has halted up to $5 million worth of obamacare advertising in the crucial days ahead of the final enrollment deadline on jan. 31.\n\nwe aren't going to continue spending millions of taxpayers' dollars promoting a failed government program, a health and human services department spokesman said. once an assessment was made, we pulled back the most expensive and least efficient part of this massive ad campaign, which was set to run over the weekend.\n\nthe money will be returned to the u.s. treasury, the spokesman said.\n\nthe obama administration had a roughly $75 million contract with a private advertising firm to promote open enrollment, which began nov. 1. the final $4 million to $5 million of television and radio ads were pulled.\n\nsome television spots, however, could not be canceled and will continue to air. also, open enrollment information remains available through the web site, emails, robo-dial calls, twitter and other online sites. agency personnel continue to answer all emails and phone calls related to enrollment questions.\n\nan email stressing the final enrollment deadline was sent out by the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, on friday. it noted that most consumers are eligible for subsidies and can find plans for $50 to $100.\n\nstill, the move could dampen final enrollment numbers for 2017. outreach is critical in the final days of the enrollment period to remind consumers -- particularly younger ones -- of the deadline. sign ups typically surge during this time. a year ago, nearly 700,000 people selected plans a week before the final deadline.\n\nmore than 11.5 million people had signed up for coverage through the federal exchange and the 12 state-based exchanges, as of dec. 24, according to federal data. that was 286,000 more than the comparable time a year ago.\n\nrelated: obamacare remains popular, with 11.5 million sign ups so far\n\nthe obama administration in october projected some 13.8 million people would sign up for plans during open enrollment, which began nov. 1. enrollment isn't final until consumers pay their first month's premium.\n\npresident trump, however, has made it clear that he intends to dismantle the law as soon as possible. hours after taking office, he signed an executive order aimed at weakening obamacare. congress has begun the process of repealing major provisions of the law, but remains divided over how to replace it.\n\nrelated: trump issues executive order to start rolling back obamacare\n\neven if lawmakers repeal parts of obamacare soon, the program will likely remain in effect for another year or two to give government agencies and insurers time to adjust. the trump administration has promised a smooth transition during this period.\n\ninsurers, who are already skittish about participating in the exchanges next year, responded to the ad cancellation by stressing the importance of open enrollment.\n\nevery american deserves coverage, and open enrollment is the best opportunity people have to get coverage that gives them access to high-quality care, said kristine grow, spokeswoman for america's health insurance plans, the industry's main lobbying group. at a time when the individual market faces challenges, we need as many people as possible to participate - so that costs go down for everyone.\n\nbalancing out the risk pool is an important action that can be taken now to help stabilize the market, improve affordability, and send strong signals as health plans develop their products for 2018, she continued.\n\nthe advertising campaign, which was planned prior to the election, included promotions on television, as well as youtube, instagram, facebook and the social gaming platform twitch. former hhs officials were focusing on getting more young adults to sign up since they are often healthier and offset the higher costs of older enrollees.\n\na source with knowledge of the matter told cnn on friday that hhs pulled its ads from facebook on thursday.\n\nthe abrupt end to the advertising campaign did not affect the federal exchange website, healthcare.gov, which continues to operate and accept new applications. also, the agency's website continues to direct viewers to enroll in an affordable health plan at healthcare.gov.\n\nformer hhs officials and supporters of the law were angered by the trump administration's move.\n\nthe trump administration's outrageous decision tonight to sabotage open enrollment will mean coverage could cost more next year and insurers could drop out of the marketplace, said kevin counihan, former ceo of healthcare.gov. having health insurance is still law of the land. if the president and republicans in congress want to change that, they should come up with a plan and show it to the american people, rather than depriving americans of the chance to sign up for coverage and financial assistance they remain eligible for.\n\nron pollack, executive director of health care advocacy group families usa, called the action mean-spirited, noting the ads were already paid for. it belies president trump's promise that he wants to make sure everybody gets health care, said pollack.\n\nrelated: federal agency website still praises obamacare\n\nthe obama administration boosted outreach efforts last fall in hopes of enticing more people to sign up for coverage, recognizing that enrollment was critical to the program's stability. hhs officials doubled down after trump's victory, hoping that larger enrollment figures would make it harder for republicans to repeal the landmark health reform law.\n\nyounger consumers also make coverage decisions closer to the deadline, so these final reminders prompt them to sign up, said leslie dach, a former senior official at the agency.\n\nin addition to the tv and online promotion, the agency was scheduled to send more than 10 million mailings, targeting people who were recently uninsured, recently lost coverage or sought coverage in the past through the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, or a state medicaid program.\n\nthe messaging focused on affordability, highlighting the availability of subsidies to lower- and moderate-income enrollees, and on deadlines to enroll. also, it reminded consumers about the penalty for remaining uninsured, which is $695 or 2.5% of income, whichever is higher.
(cnn) —\n\nit's easy to mistake a march, or a moment, for a movement.\n\nthe organizers behind this past weekend's rallies for gun reform understood this. they made a point of harping on the distinction, making it one of the prevailing rhetorical themes of the demonstrations, which flooded washington on saturday and clogged thoroughfares in dozens of other major cities across the us and around the world.\n\nbut acknowledging the difference, and pushing for sustained direct action, is only a start. envisioning a finish is more difficult, especially when it comes to such a politically intractable issue. the question now for the movement: what does winning really look like?\n\namong the most vocal post-parkland gun control activists, many of them teens and young millennials, there is an intrinsic understanding that public opinion alone is not a driver of legislative change. they grew up in a cycle where mass shootings – typically of white people, by white people, in affluent areas – temporarily jacked up interest, setting off doomed efforts to tighten gun laws, followed by abrupt returns to the status quo ante.\n\non the fundamental question, poll numbers have almost always been on the young activists' side. americans generally support tougher gun laws. but those surveys measure sentiment and sentiment, as we've seen over the years, cannot adequately fuel and sustain the kind of disciplined, strategic grassroots work required to alter specific policies and change underlying – and deep-seated – political dynamics.\n\nsuccessful progressive pressure campaigns, no matter their cause, share a handful of distinguishing characteristics.\n\namong them are a willingness to name enemies and, as importantly, demand more of would-be allies in office – in the same way, to give a recent example, liberal activists pressured democrats, even those facing reelection challenges in red states, to maintain the party line in the fight to save obamacare.\n\nif this weekend marked a breakthrough, perhaps the best symbol was the increased militancy – in their speeches, on their signs, etc. – of the demonstrators. the nra and its elected allies, of course, took their lumps, but in an encouraging shift for activists, so too did individuals who prioritize gun rights over the potential upside to tightening restrictions. it's easy to yell about the gun lobby; it's much more difficult to condemn your neighbor.\n\nthe nra is taking note of the shift. in a tweet on friday, less than 24 hours before the marches kicked off, the group linked to a blog post titled, the stigmatization of gun owners, then added: the idea is to shift public opinion to such a point that something once socially acceptable – owning a gun – is now socially unacceptable.\n\nwell, yeah.\n\nthe nra, which is good at politics (and not just, as some critics suggest, paying off politicians), understands why this kind of shift in social norms would be so damaging to its interests. hence their effort to stigmatize not just the message, but the desired strategic outcome. that most protesters this weekend would've happily endorsed the tweet, and the goal it decries, is yet another green shoot for the movement.\n\nbut there are two more crucial pieces that continue to stand between the movement and a clearer path to achieving its aims.\n\nfirst, we have yet to see consistent signs that gun control supporters are prepared to prioritize the issue, like their opponents do, on election day. a pew research center report from last november underlined the enthusiasm gap with its finding that americans who believe gun laws should be less strict are more likely to contact public officials on the issue than those who think gun laws should be stricter or are about right.\n\nif real reform is going to be possible, that will have to change. and if it does, the second step might become more feasible: the election of federal lawmakers, en masse, who campaign on platforms demanding legislative action. we've seen some shifts in this direction on the state level and among entrenched congressional democrats.\n\na study in contrasts:\n\n\n\nthe @nra is spending $1 million on ed gillespie's behalf.\n\n\n\nmeanwhile, ralph is proud of his f-rating. #vagovdebate — ralph northam (@ralphnortham) october 9, 2017\n\nvirginia gov. ralph northam, though running for an executive job, trumpeted his f rating by the nra. in a washington post op-ed published after northam's victory last year, pollsters for his campaign argued that it was time to rethink a long-held political axiom: democrats lose when they campaign on stronger gun laws. this past weekend, georgia rep. john lewis drew some headlines by declaring he was proud to wear that 'f.'\n\nthere are tougher tests up ahead. if democrats retake congress and the white house, would they be willing to spend the required political capital to pass new gun laws? the answer, for now at least, is probably not. there are more galvanizing priorities, like expanding public health care programs or access to higher education, that would almost surely come first.\n\nabsent those levels of urgency, and a sense among enough lawmakers that actively supporting new restrictions is a pragmatic requirement, one they'll be confident defending in the next campaign, action is unlikely. but even that might not be enough. the issue is too simply too hot. the backlash is inevitable and, for politicians, unavoidable. ultimately, something more will be required.\n\nif the gun control movement is going to win, it must find allies in government willing to lose.
análisis: ideas económicas en la contienda biden vs sanders 6:11\n\nwashington (cnn) — los resultados que el exvicepresidente de estados unidos joe biden obtuvo durante el supermartes plantearon una competencia cara a cara con el senador por vermont bernie sanders sobre el liderazgo en el partido demócrata y sobre quién enfrentará al presidente donald trump en noviembre.\n\nbiden continúa el legado de los ocho años que sirvió junto al presidente barack obama mientras que sanders, un independiente, ofrece una plataforma socialista democrática con una visión radicalmente diferente para estados unidos.\n\nambos aspirantes presentarán sus respectivas plataformas antes de las contiendas del martes en idaho, michigan, mississippi, missouri, dakota del norte y washington. también están programados para reunirse en el debate de cnn/univisión en arizona el 15 de marzo.\n\naquí hay un vistazo a sus propuestas sobre temas clave.\n\nsalud\n\nbiden\n\npublicidad\n\nbiden se ha apegado a la ley del cuidado de salud a bajo precio, el plan de salud característico de obama, pero ha ofrecido propuestas de enormes subsidios nuevos para hacer que la cobertura a través de los intercambios de obamacare sea menos costosa. su plan incluye una nueva «opción pública» que permitiría a las personas comprar un programa que, según su campaña, sería similar a medicare.\n\nla propuesta tendría un precio de 750.000 millones de dólares durante 10 años, dijo su campaña.\n\nbiden propone pagar el proyecto de ley elevando los impuestos sobre la renta de los estadounidenses más ricos al 39,6%, revirtiendo parte de la ley de reducción de impuestos apoyada por un congreso de mayoría republicana en 2017, y al exigir a quienes ganan más de un millón de dólares al año que paguen 39,6% de impuestos sobre las ganancias de capital, en lugar del 20% actual.\n\nsanders\n\nel programa de atención médica «medicare para todos» propuesto por sanders es la base de su plataforma progresista.\n\nsu plan dejaría intacta la infraestructura actual de médicos, hospitales y otros proveedores de atención médica, pero nacionalizaría la industria de los seguros de salud. casi todo el dinero que las personas y los empleadores pagan actualmente a través de las aseguradoras, así como gran parte del dinero que pagan los estados, según el plan de sanders, en su lugar sería pagado por el gobierno federal.\n\nsanders ha sugerido que medicare para todos terminaría reduciendo la cantidad que el país gasta en atención médica, lo que los expertos dicen que no es el caso, aunque los hogares individuales podrían terminar teniendo ventaja.\n\nmúltiples estimaciones han fijado el costo de medicare para todos en más de 30 billones de dólares en una década, un gran cambio para que los contribuyentes lo cubran.\n\nsanders ha dicho que pagaría el programa al revertir los recortes de impuestos republicanos de 2017, imponiendo impuestos adicionales sobre los ricos y los impuestos sobre las ganancias de capital.\n\nparte de la financiación también procedería de la recaudación de dinero que los empleadores y las personas pagan actualmente a las aseguradoras privadas, es decir, cambiar las cotizaciones por impuestos más altos.\n\ncrisis climática\n\nbiden\n\nbiden ha propuesto un plan de crisis climática que pondría a estados unidos en camino de eliminar las emisiones netas de gases de efecto invernadero para 2050.\n\nla propuesta abarca elementos del progresivo nuevo pacto verde y busca ir «mucho más allá» de la metas de cambio climático de obama.\n\ncomo parte de la propuesta, biden está pidiendo el fin de los subsidios a los combustibles fósiles y la prohibición de nuevos permisos de petróleo y gas en tierras públicas. al igual que otros demócratas, también volvería a entrar en el acuerdo climático de parís, el histórico acuerdo de 2015 sobre reducciones de emisiones del que trump se retiró durante su primer año en el cargo.\n\nel plan de biden deja al congreso decidir qué mecanismo de aplicación se usaría para exigir a las corporaciones en estados unidos que cumplan con los objetivos que él establece, y penalizarlos si se quedan cortos.\n\nel plan tiene un precio de 1,7 billones de dólares en sus primeros 10 años, incluyendo 400.000 millones para investigación entre universidades y el sector privado.\n\nbiden lo pagaría deshaciendo los recortes de impuestos promulgados por trump y los republicanos en el congreso.\n\nsanders\n\nsanders, que criticó a trump por retirarse del acuerdo de parís, es uno de los principales defensores del nuevo pacto verde y está pidiendo un ambicioso plan de crisis climática que incluya una vasta movilización para detener e invertir los efectos del calentamiento global durante una década.\n\nlos objetivos principales incluyen alcanzar el objetivo del panel intergubernamental sobre cambio climático de energía 100% renovable para electricidad y transporte para 2030; reducir las emisiones nacionales en un 71% durante ese período; crear una «red inteligente» eléctrica de 526.000 millones de dólares; invertir 200.000 millones de dólares en el fondo verde para el clima, y priorizar lo que los activistas llaman una «transición justa» para los trabajadores de combustibles fósiles que serían desplazados durante la transición.\n\nen el proceso, según la campaña, crearía 20 millones de nuevos empleos en «fabricación de acero y automóviles, construcción, modernización de la eficiencia energética, codificación y granjas de servidores, y plantas de energía renovable».\n\nel plan viene con un precio de 16,3 billones de dólares, pero sanders ha dicho que «se pagará por sí mismo en 15 años».\n\nla mayor fuente de financiamiento potencial, un estimado de 6,4 billones de dólares, provendría de los ingresos generados por la venta de energía limpia, que será administrada por empresas de servicios públicos, entre 2023 y 2035.\n\nantes de eso, sanders recortaría el gasto militar utilizado para proteger intereses energéticos globales por más de 1,2 billones de dólares mientras impacta a las compañías de combustibles fósiles por más de 3 billones de dólares en «litigios (contra contaminantes), tarifas e impuestos».\n\nla campaña dice que se recaudarán 2,3 billones de dólares adicionales de los impuestos pagados sobre los 20 millones de nuevos empleos que promete crear.\n\nmira: fracasa el nuevo pacto verde de alexandria ocasio cortez en el senado, ¿por qué? (2019)\n\ninmigración\n\nbiden\n\nla plataforma de inmigración de biden describe un camino hacia la ciudadanía para los inmigrantes indocumentados al tiempo que llama a revertir las políticas fronterizas de trump.\n\nel plan de biden invertiría 4.000 millones de dólares en centroamérica en un esfuerzo por lograr «reducciones cuantificables» en la violencia para frenar la migración a estados unidos.\n\nsu plataforma también aumentaría el límite de admisión de refugiados en ee.uu. de los actuales 18.000 a 125.000.\n\nen una entrevista con cnn en julio de 2019, biden dijo que se opone a la despenalización de cruzar la frontera sin documentación. «creo que las personas deberían tener que hacer cola, pero si vienen porque realmente buscan asilo, deberían tener la oportunidad de presentar su caso».\n\nsanders\n\nla plataforma de inmigración de sanders exige una reestructuración del sistema a gran escala a través de acciones legislativas y una serie de decretos presidenciales.\n\npondría una moratoria sobre las deportaciones, acabaría con las redadas del servicio de inmigración y control de aduanas, detendría la construcción del muro en la frontera entre estados unidos y méxico, terminaría con las separaciones familiares y cerraría centros de detención con fines de lucro.\n\nsanders también revocaría la llamada regla de carga pública de trump y se aseguraría de que los inmigrantes no sean discriminados en función de sus ingresos o discapacidad, al tiempo que extendería el estado de protección temporal hasta que existan resoluciones más permanentes.\n\nel plan también reestructuraría el departamento de seguridad nacional, de acuerdo con la propuesta, el gobierno crearía un programa para dar la bienvenida a los migrantes desplazados por el cambio climático y establecería una meta de aceptar al menos 50.000 personas durante su primer año en el cargo.\n\nopinión: esta nueva regla de inmigración no es estadounidense\n\neducación\n\nbiden\n\nla plataforma educativa de biden aumentaría los fondos para las escuelas en áreas de bajos ingresos, ayudaría a los maestros a pagar su deuda educativa y duplicaría el número de profesionales de la salud que trabajan en las escuelas.\n\nel plan priorizaría el pago competitivo para los maestros, ampliando el acceso al preescolar para niños de 3 y 4 años y distritos que ofrecen cursos rigurosos.\n\ndespués de eso, el plan de biden dejaría que los distritos escolares identifiquen sus mayores necesidades para abordar con el tope de fondos restante.\n\ndice que «la mayor parte» de sus propuestas educativas pueden convertirse en ley, incluso si los republicanos mantienen el control del senado después de las elecciones de 2020.\n\nbiden no ha ofrecido detalles sobre cuánto costaría el plan en general o cómo propone pagarlo.\n\nun plan separado enfocado en la educación superior propone dos años gratis de colegio comunitario que, según su campaña, costaría 750.000 millones por año.\n\nsanders\n\nel plan de política educativa de sanders establece una agenda de 10 puntos que exige el fin de las escuelas charter con fines de lucro, crea un piso salarial para los maestros de las escuelas públicas, garantiza comidas escolares gratuitas para todos los estudiantes y se expande después de las clases y los programas de escuela de verano.\n\nla plataforma propone un piso salarial de 60.000 dólares al año para los maestros vinculados al costo de vida y un aumento en la deducción de impuestos por encima de la línea para gastos de bolsillo en suministros.\n\nsu plan también exige una prohibición total de las escuelas autónomas con fines de lucro y una moratoria en la financiación de toda la expansión de las escuelas públicas autónomas hasta que se complete una auditoría nacional de las escuelas.\n\nsi bien sanders no ofreció fuentes de financiamiento específicas para el plan, aludió al hecho de que reducir los recortes de impuestos promulgados durante la administración trump ayudaría a pagar la factura.\n\npara la educación superior, sanders ha impulsado un ambicioso programa de «universidad para todos» que eliminaría la deuda de préstamos estudiantiles de todos los estadounidenses y exige una matrícula gratuita en todos los colegios y universidades públicas de cuatro años, así como en los colegios comunitarios.\n\nsanders ha dicho que los nuevos impuestos en wall street recaudarían los 2,2 billones de dólares necesarios para pagar este programa y sus otros planes de financiación universitaria.\n\nesto incluirá un impuesto de 0,5% sobre las transacciones de acciones (o 50 centavos por cada 100 dólares en acciones), una tarifa de 0,1% sobre bonos y una tarifa de 0,005% sobre derivados. sanders cree que podría recaudar más de 2,4 billones de dólares en los próximos 10 años.\n\nviolencia armada\n\nbiden\n\nel plan de control de armas de biden requeriría que los propietarios de rifles de asalto vendan sus armas de fuego a través de un programa voluntario de recompra o las registren en el gobierno federal.\n\nel plan abordaría la violencia armada urbana con un programa de ocho años y 900 millones de dólares que se destinaría a los esfuerzos para combatir los tiroteos en 40 ciudades con las tasas más altas de violencia armada.\n\neliminaría las protecciones legales que impiden que los fabricantes de armas sean responsables por cómo se utilizan sus productos.\n\nbiden también propone una serie de medidas que han sido ampliamente respaldadas en las primarias demócratas, incluido el cierre de lagunas en las verificaciones de antecedentes antes de la compra de armas, la prohibición de la venta de rifles de asalto y cargadores de cupo extra, y permitir establece implementar leyes de «bandera roja».\n\nmira: el mundo se pregunta cuándo implementará ee.uu. un control de armas\n\nsanders\n\nsanders, quien ha sido criticado por biden por sus votos pasados en el senado sobre el control de armas, está presionando para que se realicen más verificaciones de antecedentes y para cerrar varias lagunas en las compras de armas de fuego.\n\nla política de sanders apunta a regular las armas de asalto «de la misma manera que actualmente regulamos las armas totalmente automáticas, un sistema que esencialmente las hace ilegales de poseer».\n\nsu plan

as congress weighs repeal of the affordable care act, the home state of vice president mike pence is seeking to keep its conservative-style medicaid expansion that the federal health law made possible.\n\nindiana applied to the trump administration tuesday to extend a regulatory waiver and funding for its healthy indiana plan until jan. 31, 2021. this would allow it to extend its innovative package of incentives and penalties that are intended to encourage low-income hoosiers on medicaid to adopt healthy behaviors. beneficiaries pay premiums, get health savings accounts and can lose their benefits if they miss payments.\n\nthough pence now supports the health law's repeal, the healthy indiana plan that he established in 2015 as the state's governor has brought medicaid coverage to more than 350,000 people. the architect of the plan was health care consultant seema verma, who has been nominated to head the centers for medicare & medicaid services.\n\nrelated: major changes for medicaid coming under trump and the gop\n\nwithout trump administration approval, federal money for indiana's expansion will run out jan. 31, 2018. indiana officials said the medicaid expansion would continue even if washington follows through on a republican proposal to distribute federal medicaid funds through a block grant program that would give states more flexibility in setting benefits and eligibility levels.\n\nstate officials refused to say whether the expansion would continue if congress repealed obamacare and eliminated funds for medicaid expansions. if that happened, it's unlikely states would have the money to make up for the lost federal aid.\n\nindiana's effort to continue its medicaid expansion demonstrates how states that expanded medicaid under the affordable care act — even republican-controlled ones — are counting on additional federal dollars to pay for those expansions. it also reflects deadline pressure: they can't wait for congress to finish its debate over the future of the health law because they need to set budgets and programs now for next year.\n\naccording to indiana's request, continuing the medicaid expansion will cost indiana $1.5 billion but bring $8.6 billion in federal funding from 2018 to 2020.\n\nrelated: trump's hhs pick: right to medicaid may not be guaranteed under block grants\n\nindiana has built a program that is delivering real results in a responsible, efficient, and effective way, gov. eric holcomb, a republican, said in a statement. i look forward to maintaining the flexibility to grow this remarkably successful tool and to preserve our ability to respond to the unique needs of hoosiers.\n\nseveral other states including kentucky and ohio are considering adopting features of indiana's medicaid plan.\n\ntuesday's filing continues most core elements of the healthy indiana plan, but also expands beneficiaries access to substance abuse treatment and adds incentives for members to quit smoking, use chronic disease management programs and take part in voluntary job referral and training programs.\n\ncertainly i think the new administration would give the waiver a friendly reception, said joan alker, executive director of the center for children and families at georgetown university. but again that doesn't answer the question about whether the money is going away, if congress repeals the health law and the medicaid expansion.\n\nrep. susan brooks broke the news of the waiver submission plans at a house committee hearing on medicaid on tuesday.\n\nrelated: why gop governors like medicaid under obamacare\n\nit's an outstanding program that i hope folks on both sides of the aisle see it is a way to save and help people who truly need it, and it can be replicated, brooks said.\n\nsome republican plans to scrap and replace the affordable care act don't include a medicaid expansion. republicans have argued for years that the medicaid program is broken and non-disabled adults who gained coverage under the expansion should not be covered.\n\nunder expansion, states received additional federal funding to expand eligibility to everyone with annual incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level, or about $16,000.\n\nholcomb isn't the only republican governor counting on medicaid expansion and the additional federal funding continuing at least through 2018.\n\nohio gov. john kasich proposed a budget monday that maintains expansion coverage for 700,000 individuals.\n\nbut kasich plans to switch from a traditional medicaid expansion to a more conservative version that will require beneficiaries to pay more out of pocket.\n\nkaiser health news is national health policy news service that is part of the nonpartisan henry j. kaiser family foundation.
washington (cnn) the senate judiciary committee heard testimony wednesday morning as part of the confirmation hearing for justin walker , a 37-year-old federal judge backed by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell for a seat on the most powerful appeals court in the country.\n\nthe nomination exemplifies mcconnell's enduring pledge to make the confirmation of judges his top priority, and infuriates walker's critics who say he is unqualified in part because he only graduated from law school a little more than a decade ago. they are opposed to positions he has taken on the affordable care act as well as his defense of then-supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh.\n\nthe nearly three-hour hearing went relatively smoothly, with chairman lindsey graham, a south carolina republican senator, saying at its conclusion that walker acquitted himself well during the proceedings and thanking senators on the panel -- some of whom attended virtually.\n\ndemocrats spent most of the hearing questioning walker's experience and pointing to past comments he's made that were critical of the supreme court and its 2012 affordable care act decision. the panel's republicans, meanwhile, heaped praise on the judge while also quizzing him on his views on different constitutional provisions.\n\nat one point, sen. amy klobuchar, a minnesota democrat, brought up an opinion piece walker penned two years ago critical of the obamacare decision, asking if he still holds the views expressed in the piece.\n\nsenator, the statement i made was made as an academic and as a private citizen engaging in matter of public concern, walker replied, and my role now as a judge is not to give a thumbs up or a thumbs down to particular supreme court precedence.\n\nas the hearing unfolded, both mcconnell and senate minority leader chuck schumer addressed it in statements on the senate floor, with the majority leader calling walker an impressive individual and urging the committee to approve his nomination.\n\nschumer, a democrat from new york, slammed the committee in his statements, saying it would waste precious time by holding the hearing amid the coronavirus pandemic, and called walker mcconnell's protégé.\n\nat the start of wednesday's hearing, republican sen. rand paul of kentucky, introduced the nominee to the panel, saying that in walker's short time as a district judge he has shown an unwavering fidelity to the constitution.\n\nduring opening statements, democrats on the committee also blasted mcconnell for focusing on the nomination amid the pandemic, with sen. dick durbin of illinois laying out a lengthy list of things he said the panel could be doing instead to address the crisis.\n\nwe're in the middle of one of the greatest public health crisis in the history our nation. we're sitting in a committee with jurisdiction in so many critical areas when it comes to this crisis and instead sen. mcconnell is unwilling to set aside his wish list fulfilling the courts, durbin said. the american people deserve better.\n\nmcconnell's 'judicial all-star'\n\nafter being sworn in, walker, who had removed the face mask he was wearing, delivered a brief opening statement thanking mcconnell and paul for their support as well as members of his family and president donald trump for the nomination.\n\nthe dc appeals court is considered a breeding ground for future supreme court justices. chief justice john roberts served there as well as justices clarence thomas, ruth bader ginsburg and kavanaugh.\n\nit was only last fall that the senate confirmed walker for his current post as a federal judge in kentucky in a party-line 50-41 vote, despite drawing a not qualified rating from the american bar association in part due to his lack of judicial experience.\n\ntuesday, the group cited walker's experience on the federal bench and rated him well-qualified  for the appeals court spot.\n\nmcconnell has called walker a judicial all-star.\n\ni think you cannot credibly argue that justin walker is not a judicial all-star, the majority leader told the washington post last month . i thought it might be a good idea to go outside the beltway... there are plenty of dc lawyers that salivate over this job.\n\nin early march, as coronavirus fears began to grip the country, mcconnell and kavanaugh traveled to kentucky to attend walker's formal investiture for his current seat on a district court in kentucky.\n\nwalker noted that as an 8-year-old he remembered a campaign sign for mcconnell in his front yard.\n\nit has been extremely important to me that kentucky's senior senator is mitch mcconnell, walker said.\n\nhe also gave a rousing speech outlining the judicial philosophy he shares with his mentor.\n\nat the heart of a judge's every case, is the separation of powers, walker said.\n\nthat's because every case requires a judge to respect his limited role in our constitution's structure, and when at issue, to observe the limits our people put on congress, and the president and the administrative state, he said.\n\nwalker ended with a flourish: judges at their best vindicate those limits and today i swore to respect those limits for the rest of my life, he said.\n\nthe two celebrated with a fist bump.\n\ndemocrats on the senate judiciary committee asked graham last week to delay the hearing and instead focus on matters directly related to the coronavirus pandemic. now is not the time to process routine judicial nominations, the letter read.\n\n'nothing deplorable' about defending the constitution\n\nwalker directly addressed the aba's rating, calling the organization out by name.\n\ni want to thank my nomination's opponents, including the american bar association, he said in comments that ringed similar to a campaign. conservatives have criticized the group, saying it tends to favor liberals and is biased against certain candidates.\n\nthank you for serving as an enduring reminder that although my legal principles are prevalent, they have not yet prevailed, he said.\n\nand although we are winning, we have not won, and although we celebrate today, we cannot take for granted tomorrow or we will lose our courts and our country to critics who call us terrifying and who describe us as deplorable, he added.\n\nthe use of the word deplorable had more than a hint of politics. hillary clinton was widely criticized in 2016 for comments in which she said half of trump's supporters are deplorables. she later said she regretted the comment.\n\nwell my friends, there's nothing terrifying about the original meaning of our constitution and there is nothing deplorable about defending it, walker said.\n\nkavanaugh and obamacare\n\nat the investiture, walker saved his most lavish praise for kavanaugh who hired him in 2010 as a clerk when he served on the same dc-based appellate court before his elevation to the supreme court.\n\nduring kavanaugh's controversial confirmation hearing, walker was one of his most constant supporters in print and over the air waves.\n\njustice, kavanaugh what can i say, walker joked at the investiture, that i have not already said on fox news?\n\nbut then he got serious.\n\nyou are like st. paul, hard pressed on every side but not crushed. perplexed but not in despair. persecuted but not abandoned, struck down but not destroyed. because in brett kavanaugh's america we will not surrender while you wage war on our work or our cause or our hope or our dream.\n\nand walker nodded to retired supreme court justice anthony kennedy who was his boss for a clerkship from 2011-2012 but had been unable to travel to the event. it was during walker's term at the court that chief justice roberts sided with the liberals on the bench to uphold the affordable care act under congress' taxing power.\n\nwalker said that kennedy was as kind and decent a man as i have ever met.\n\nhe told the audience, the greatest words you can hear from justice kennedy, are 'you're hired.\n\nthe comment elicited nervous laughter from the audience as it realized walker was referring to the health care decision.\n\njustin walker is in every way the wrong nominee at the wrong time for the d.c. circuit, said marge baker, executive vice president for policy and program of the liberal group people for the american way. in the middle of a pandemic, the idea that mitch mcconnell would prioritize the advancement of a demonstrably anti-health care judicial nominee is outrageous, she said.\n\neaster services ruling\n\nwalker's critics are also seizing on an opinion he wrote in april, sitting as a district court judge. walker issued a temporary restraining order blocking louisville mayor greg fischer from forbidding drive-in church services on easter sunday.\n\nout of health concerns related to covid-19, the mayor had said, we are not allowing churches to gather, either in-person or any kind of drive-thru capacity.\n\nlouisville's on fire christian center, inc sued.\n\nbefore the full briefing, walker acted, issuing the temporary restraining order in an opinion loaded with references to religious persecution.\n\non holy thursday, an american mayor criminalized the communal celebration of easter, walker wrote\n\nthat sentence is one that this court never expected to see outside the pages of a dystopian novel, or perhaps the pages of the onion, he continued.\n\nwalker called the mayor's decision stunning and unconstitutional.\n\nwalker's opinion is what you would expect from someone rated 'not qualified' by his peers -- ignoring the facts and evidence in order to try to score political points, christopher kang, general counsel for demand justice, a group opposed to trump's nominees, told cnn.\n\nkang said that louisville had not actually banned the drive-in church services.\n\nwalker -- like many other trump judges -- seems to relish using partisan judicial opinions to audition and bolster his standing among conservative extremists, kang said.\n\nmike davis, who runs the article 3 project in support of trump's nominees, defended walker's actions.\n\nas judge justin walker correctly ruled, governments have a lot of latitude to deal with the coronavirus crisis-but they cannot act arbitrarily or single out believers,  he said.\n\nmcconnell was quick to tweet about the opinion and back walker as well.\n\ngrateful for this strong, eloquent ruling defending kentuckians' religious liberty from judge justin walker, @potus's outstanding nominee for the d.c. circuit. of course church parking lots cannot be singled out with unfair standards that differ from other establishments.\n\ngrateful for this strong, eloquent ruling defending kentuckians' religious liberty from

more than 600,000 people signed up for obamacare in the first four days of open enrollment, far outpacing last year's rate.\n\nnearly a quarter were enrolling for the first time, while the rest renewed coverage, according to statistics released thursday by the trump administration. the period covers nov. 1 through nov. 4.\n\nthe data provides the first look at how obamacare will fare under an administration determined to dismantle the health reform law. while trump officials are maintaining the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, they have slashed open enrollment advertising and support. also, consumers will have only six weeks to sign up for coverage on the federal exchange, rather than the three months or more they had in previous years.\n\naffordable care act supporters were quick to jump on the data, noting that the average daily pace was nearly double that of last year's.\n\nrelated: 5 changes for obamacare open enrollment for 2018\n\nthis is a great start to open enrollment and is further evidence that people want health insurance and that they're finding coverage they can afford, said lori lodes, a former obama official and co-founder of get america covered, which is aiming to boost sign ups.\n\nsome states that run their own exchanges are also reporting brisk business. they are heavily promoting enrollment, running ads and providing assistance to those who want to sign up. many have extended the enrollment deadline beyond dec. 15.\n\nmore than 14,000 maryland residents picked plans in the first eight days, more than twice as many as last year. the maryland health connection website, which usually closes at 11 p.m., had to stay open an hour later on the first day of open enrollment because 300 people were still online.\n\nin washington, the number of new enrollees jumped by more than 50% in the first week, while visits to the state's exchange rose 24%, as compared to a year ago.\n\nwe are very pleased to see this level of interest so early in open enrollment, said pam macewan, ceo of the washington health benefit exchange.\n\nconnecticut's marketplace saw a 15% increase in volume for both its website and call center on its first day, compared to last year.\n\nmichael mashoney, 55, was concerned about signing up for coverage this year because of all of the uncertainty surrounding the health reform law. a self-employed consultant from the woodlands, texas, mashoney was uninsured before the obamacare exchanges debuted in 2014.\n\nbut he was happy to see that his carrier, community health choice, is returning for 2018. though he doesn't qualify for subsidies and his premium is going up about $200 a month, he likes knowing he has a safety net.\n\nif i get really, really sick and i have to go to the hospital, at least i'm not going bankrupt, said mashoney, noting that obamacare limits how much he has to pay out-of-pocket for care. those things are very important to me.\n\nstrong initial sign-ups, however, don't necessarily result in record enrollment. last year, many consumers rushed to pick policies in november and december, particularly after president trump was elected.\n\nrelated: these states are doing obamacare open enrollment their own way\n\nultimately, however, half a million fewer americans signed up for obamacare coverage for 2017 by the end of the enrollment period on jan. 31. (consumers are not actually enrolled until they pay their first month's premium.)\n\nshopping for coverage for 2018 is more important than ever. premiums for the benchmark silver obamacare plan will soar 37%, on average.\n\nbut eight in 10 consumers will be able to find policies for $75 or less. that's because the price spike means many enrollees will receive more generous premium subsidies, and some may be able to afford gold policies with lower deductibles or find bronze plans with no premiums.\n\nstill, the rate increase will hit some in the middle class since they don't qualify for premium subsidies. several have written to cnnmoney to say that their premiums are skyrocketing for next year.\n\nmary and reed christensen are bracing for a sharp spike in premiums. they will have to pay $2,300 a month for an obamacare policy next year, up from $1,522 now. the blair, nebraska, couple are meeting their insurance agent on friday, but they don't have many choices -- their current insurer, aetna, dropped out of the market so medica is the only option.\n\nmary christensen, 60, would rather go back to the days before obamacare, when they paid $557 a month for coverage that fit their needs. they rarely go to the doctor and bristle at the idea that they have to buy a policy that covers pediatric dental benefits, even though their daughters are grown.\n\nthe high premiums have forced them to dip into their retirement savings and forgo purchasing things they need.\n\nwe won't be contributing to the economy because we are going broke paying our health insurance, said christensen, a substitute teacher who also grows vegetables and flowers to sell at a farmer's market. but there is that one ounce of doubt that we may need it for a huge medical expense next year -- you never know.\n\nare you shopping for obamacare coverage for 2018? what has your experience been? tell us about it at healthcarestories@cnn.com and you could be featured in a cnnmoney story.

across cnn selects key statements and rates them true; mostly true; true but misleading; false; or it's complicated\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthe republican candidates for president gathered in detroit on thursday for their 11th debate, and cnn's reality check team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the test.\n\nthe team of reporters, researchers and editors across cnn selected key statements and rated them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it's complicated.\n\nmarco rubio\n\nreality check: rubio on trump's diminutive digits\n\nby chip grabow, cnn\n\nit wasn't long into thursday night's gop presidential debate in detroit that the size of donald trump's hands came under the microscope.\n\nflorida sen. marco rubio was asked, after long denouncing the use of personal attacks in the campaign, why he recently changed tactics and chose to make more personal attacks on trump. moderator chris wallace noted that in recent days, rubio made very personal attacks, including a jab he made at the size of trump's hands during a campaign rally in virginia on sunday.\n\nrubio responded to wallace, saying the focus should be on the issues that matter to this country. but trump wanted to talk about rubio's hand slur: nobody has ever hit my hands. i have never heard of this, trump said. look at those hands. are they small hands? and he referred to my hands if they are small, something else must be small. i guarantee you there is no problem. i guarantee you.\n\ntrump seemed to think rubio's hand slur was a lightly veiled insult to trump's manhood.\n\nso what did rubio actually say?\n\nrubio told the virginia rally: he's always calling me little marco. and i'll admit he's taller than me, he's like 6'$2 2, which is why i don't understand why his hands are the size of someone who is 5'$2 2. have you seen his hands? they're like this. and you know what they say about men with small hands? you can't trust them.\n\nwhile rubio's comment wasn't an explicit reference to trump's masculine endowment, it does appear rubio's jab at trump was aimed, well, below the belt.\n\nverdict: true.\n\ndonald trump\n\nreality check: trump on rubio's worst senate absentee record\n\nby sonam vashi, cnn\n\ntrump brought up rubio's truancy record in the senate a couple times.\n\nthis guy has a number one, the number one absentee record in the united states senate, trump said.\n\nhe later added, the real con artist is sen. marco rubio, who was elected in florida and who has the worst voting record in the united states senate. he doesn't go to vote. he's absent.\n\nrubio has missed 224 of 1,512 roll call votes, or 15%, since he has been in the u.s. senate, according to govtrack, a leading government transparency website. compared with a median of 1.7% of missed roll call votes from the lifetime records of current senators, rubio's percentage is quite high. rubio also had the worst voting attendance record of any senator for 2015.\n\nrubio has defended his absences, citing the presidential campaign and saying that voting is only one part of a job that also requires constituent services. his office has previously stated that rubio is one of the few senators with young children who do not live in washington, and he spends as much time in florida with them as possible.\n\nhowever, govtrack also analyzed how presidential campaigns affect candidates' voting records and found that rubio's missed votes were still the most of current and former senator presidential candidates from the 2016 election cycle – higher than sen. ted cruz. but it was lower than the missed votes from the 2008 election candidates; both president (and former sen.) barack obama and sen. john mccain had worse voting attendance records during a comparable time frame.\n\nthe most no-show senator of all time was sen. maryon allen, who served for five months in 1978 after her husband died in office. she missed 43.5% of the roll call votes during that time.\n\ntrump doesn't specify a time frame for his claim, but because rubio had the no. 1 absentee record last year, we rate trump's claim as true.\n\nreality check: trump on spending cuts\n\nby tami luhby, cnnmoney\n\ntrump has said the country can afford his tax cuts, which will add trillions to the nation's deficit, because he will cut waste, fraud and abuse. asked on thursday for specifics, he cited cutting down the department of education and the environmental protection agency, as well as squeezing better discounts out of drug companies.\n\ndepartment of education. we're cutting common core. we're getting rid of common core. we're bringing education locally. department of environmental protection. we are going to get rid of it in almost every form … because of the fact that the pharmaceutical companies are not mandated to bid properly, they have hundreds of billions of dollars in waste, trump said.\n\ncnnmoney looked at this in january. it found that even if trump cut the epa and education department entirely, it would save less than 3% of the $3.7 trillion the federal government spent in the past year. the nation spent $90 billion on education and $7 billion on the epa.\n\nas for saving hundreds of billions from negotiating with pharmaceutical companies, that would be hard to do since medicare is estimated to have spent $77 billion on drugs in 2015, according to the congressional budget office. total spending on drugs, which includes outlays by private insurers, was just under $300 billion in total in 2014, federal national health expenditures data.\n\ncan trump make up for his tax cuts by cutting two federal agencies and negotiating with drug companies? our verdict: false.\n\nreality check: trump on 9/11 hijackers' wives\n\nby ryan browne, cnn\n\ntrump was asked whether he still supported targeting the family of terrorists as part of a u.s. counterterrorism strategy. trump reaffirmed his stance and referenced the families of the terrorists who perpetrated the 9/11 attacks, claiming they had prior knowledge of the 9/11 attacks and saying that this knowledge justified including the families of terrorists on a list of targets.\n\ntrump said: the wife knew exactly what was happening. they left two days early with respect to the world trade center and they went back to where they went and they watched their husband on television flying into the world trade center, flying into the pentagon, and probably trying to fly into the white house, except we had some very, very brave souls on that third plane. all right? i have no problem with it.\n\nthe 9/11 commission report, the most exhaustive report on the attacks and the 19 hijackers, does not show any evidence to support this claim.\n\naccording to the report, only two of the hijackers were married, and there is no evidence that either of the wives of the two hijackers had ever traveled to the united states, much less left the u.s. two days before the attacks.\n\nnone of the 9/11 terrorists could have 'sent their wives home' before the attacks because, as you suggest, none of them brought female companions to the united states, philip d. zelikow, executive director of the 9/11 commission, told the washington post in december.\n\none of the hijackers did have a german girlfriend that had visited him in the united states, but her last visit to america was months before the attacks.\n\nthe 9/11 commission contains no evidence that supports trump's claim.\n\nverdict: false.\n\nted cruz\n\nreality check: cruz beat trump five times\n\nby chip grabow, cnn\n\ntexas sen. ted cruz claimed he has beaten trump five times during the primaries.\n\nduring a plea to voters who think nominating donald trump would be a disaster, cruz said, we have demonstrated not once, not twice, not three times, but five separate times we have beat donald and if you don't want him to be the nominee, then i ask you to stand with us as a broad coalition of people who believe in the constitution, believe in freedom, and want to turn this country around.\n\na quick look at results in the states that have held primaries or caucuses shows cruz's record as having only won four states so far: iowa, texas, oklahoma and alaska.\n\nbut cruz said five separate times we have beat donald. the key word being beat… so in what states did cruz do better than trump?\n\nminnesota, where rubio took the most votes. but cruz came in second ahead of trump's third-place finish.\n\nour verdict on cruz's claim he has beat donald five separate times is true.\n\nreality check: cruz on obamacare as a job-killer\n\nby tami luhby, cnnmoney\n\nasked how he would bring back manufacturing jobs to detroit, cruz said he would lift regulations. and his no. 1 target is obamacare.\n\nas president, i will repeal obamacare, the biggest job-killer in america, he said.\n\nin fact, obamacare is not a job-killer, according to the kaiser family foundation/health research and education trust survey released in september.\n\nthe report showed that only 4% of employers with at least 50 employees said they shifted some staffers to part-time hours so they wouldn't qualify for health care, and another 4% said they were reducing the number of full-time employees they planned to hire because of the cost of health benefits. kaiser found that 10% of employers reported that they were changing workers from part-time to full-time status to enable them to obtain coverage.\n\nan adp research institute study had similar findings. one reason may be that the economy has been improving. some companies interviewed by adp said they may increase their part-timers' hours to retain talent and reduce training costs.\n\nas to whether employers are cutting jobs because of obamacare, it's nearly impossible to determine from labor department data since the economy is recovering and adding jobs. the number of people who can only find part-time jobs has declined in recent years, signifying companies are hiring more full-time workers.\n\nverdict: false.\n\nreality check: cruz on trump hiring immigrants\n\nby eve bower, cnn\n\none of trump's most frequent claims on the campaign trail is that he will do the most for american workers, in part because he has a long record of creating jobs and employing tens of thousands of people. on thursday night, cruz sought to weaken this claim, saying that many of those who were hired were brought in from overseas, including at trump's mar-a-lago club resort: down in florida that hotel has brought in hundreds of foreign workers.\n\nin august, reuters analyzed data from the department of labor and found that, since 2000, companies owned by trump had sought to import at least 1,100 foreign workers on temporary visas, including about 70 foreign workers who had recently been requested to serve as cooks, wait staff and cleaners at the florida resort.\n\ncruz noted that though the resort jobs were in high demand in palm beach, few locals have actually been hired: roughly 300 applied. donald hired 17, he said, referring to federal data published in the new york times last week.\n\nit's almost impossible to get help, trump has said.\n\ncruz's accusations about trump hiring workers from overseas are true.\n\nbut from there, cruz departed into claims that were more difficult to substantiate: his record right now is one of repeatedly hiring illegal aliens and abusing american workers.\n\ncnn has previously investigated claims that trump hired undocumented workers from poland in the early 1980s, the most specific claim about trump and undocumented workers that has been made. trump has denied ever knowing that the workers were undocumented since the hiring was made by a contracting company.\n\na subsequent legal case regarding trump's involvement in withholding wages from the workers was settled out of court. because of an appeal that was pending at the time, there was never a final verdict on trump's knowledge of the workers' status.\n\nif trump has since repeatedly hired undocumented workers, that has also not been proved; the thousands of workers his companies have brought to the united states have come through legal channels, frequently on temporary visas.\n\nwe rate cruz's second claim as it's complicated.\n\nreality check: cruz on trump's donations to hillary clinton\n\nby lisa rose, cnn\n\nted cruz questioned how effective trump will be squaring off against hillary clinton in a general election, given his history of donating money to her political campaigns.\n\ndonald trump in 2008 wrote four checks to elect hillary clinton as president, cruz said. how can you stand on a debate stage with her and say you don't think she should be president?\n\nthat's not quite right, according to the federal election commission and the center for responsive politics..\n\ntrump donated one $600 check to clinton's presidential campaign in 2007. but trump also contributed to 2008 gop nominee sen. john mccain's campaign, and gave him more, to boot.\n\nin response to cruz, trump acknowledged donating to clinton. i supported clinton, trump said. i supported many other people, by the way.\n\nindeed, the businessman, his family and his companies donated more than $10,000 to clinton dating back to her days as a new york senator in 2002. it's also true that trump has donated lots of money to a broad array of politicians. his fec profile is a testament to his prolific efforts funding candidates, democrats and republicans alike.\n\namid all the filings, however, we couldn't find any records of trump contributions to clinton in 2008.\n\nverdict: false.\n\nmarco rubio and donald trump\n\nreality check: rubio and trump on results\n\nby jamie crawford, cnn\n\nrubio said the following: there is no doubt that donald has done well in these elections, there's no doubt about that, the numbers are there. the numbers also say, two-thirds of the people who have cast a vote in a republican primary or caucus have voted against you, they do not want you to be our nominee.\n\nbased on cnn's total of the 15 states that have held primaries or caucuses so far, there have been 9,634,058 votes cast for republican candidates; 6,268,191 votes went for candidates other than trump, while the remaining 3,365,867 went to trump. that figure for candidates other than trump accounts for 65% of total votes going to a candidate other than trump, which is pretty close to two-thirds of 100%.\n\nthe numbers he cites are well within the margin of error. for that reason, we rate this as true.\n\ntrump said the following of the most recent cnn/orc poll of the state of the republican race: cnn just came out with a poll, a national poll, where he is at 15 (rubio) and he's at 14 (cruz) and i'm at 49. trump was correct in saying the latest cnn poll found him with 49% of likely republican voters based on the sample of voters across the country. the same poll showed rubio with 16% of support in the poll, and cruz had 15% support. trump was only off by 1% for both rubio and cruz, again within the margin of error, so we rate his claim as true.\n\nreality check: rubio and trump on trump university\n\nby theodore schleifer, cnn\n\nrubio has argued that trump's namesake school, trump university, is part of an elaborate con by the businessman. a key data point: its rating from the better business bureau.\n\nwe have an 'a' from the better business bureau, trump said.\n\nthat's false, rubio shot back, claiming it is actually a d-minus.\n\nit is right now an 'a.' once they had the information, it got switched. the only reason it was a 'd' was because we didn't care, we didn't give them the information. when they got the information, it became an 'a.' \n\ntrump pledged to give the information proving that his rating had been elevated.\n\nas the moderators told him – and rubio argued – the last available rating was indeed a 'd-minus.' the school, now known as the trump entrepreneur institute, currently has no rating: the trump entrepreneur initiative is believed to be out of business! the bureau's site reads.\n\nmedia reports at the time say that the school did receive a d- in 2010. and katherine hutt, a spokesman for the agency, told politifact that the company's bbb rating has fluctuated between an a+ and a d-.\n\nand the school has long been investigated by state agencies, including a $40 million lawsuit by the new york attorney general's office.\n\ntrump's claim is that the school has an a right now. that is not true. it currently has no rating, even if that may indeed be because of the lack of information he provided.\n\nbut rubio is also incorrect: it is not a d- now, even if it was previously.\n\nwe rate both trump and rubio's claims as false.\n\ncnn's lauren jackson and david siegel contributed to this round-up.
(cnn) democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders is tying himself to former president barack obama in a new tv ad despite years of criticizing him and his administration.\n\nwhile sanders frequently praised many aspects of obama-era policies and defended the then-president's agenda from what he said was an obstructionist republican party, a cnn kfile review of sanders' comments during obama's years in office shows the vermont senator was also sharply critical of the president.\n\non at least four occasions, sanders said it would be good for obama to face a primary challenge while running for reelection in 2012. he challenged obama from the left on discussions of cutting social security and medicare . and he said obama hadn't done enough on regulating wall street or improving healthcare. he also said obama was wrong on trade policies.\n\ni think one of the reasons the president has been able to move so far to the right is that there is no primary opposition to him, said sanders in a july 2011 radio interview. and i think it would do this country a good deal of service if people started thinking about candidates out there to begin contrasting what is a progressive agenda as opposed to what obama is doing.\n\nthe sanders campaign noted he was far from obama's only left wing critic, flagging that progressive groups like moveon and the progressive campaign change committee also challenged obama from the left on issues. mike casca, a sanders campaign spokesman, said the senator was proud to work with president barack obama.\n\nbernie is proud of so many of the accomplishments of president obama and his administration, which is why he fought hard to protect the affordable care act and the iran nuclear deal from donald trump's attacks, casca told cnn in an email.\n\nin the ad, obama praised sanders for having the virtue of saying exactly what he believes. great authenticity, great passion, and is fearless, though a transcript of the comments shows the ad omits obama's admission that he didn't know sanders as well since he didn't serve in his administration.\n\nobama also exclaimed, feel the bern! at the end of the ad, suggesting a possible endorsement from obama. however, the exclamation was said at the 2016 democratic national convention in an effort to get sanders' supporters to vote for clinton. obama has not endorsed anyone in the 2020 election\n\nthe ad now signals a new direction for the sanders campaign as it seeks to stop biden's momentum from clinching the democratic nomination.\n\neven when defending obama during his presidency, sanders argued he wasn't a huge supporter of obama.\n\nsanders, who worked with obama on a host of issues, maintained that obama was not a progressive , but instead a centrist in the democratic party. he said obama hadn't stood up to extremism in the republican party.\n\ni think he's a pretty honest guy and the president as you may recall just a few weeks ago, said that if we were in the 1980s he would have been considered something like a moderate republican, sanders said on wnyc in 2013 after obama had been elected to a second term. and i think he's kind of a centrist somewhere in the middle of the democratic party. but no, i don't think he is a progressive.\n\ni was very disappointed in terms of his unwillingness to be more aggressive in standing up to what has increasingly become a right wing extremist republican party, sanders added. and he really hasn't, to my mind, done that effectively.\n\nspeaking on cnn's crossfire in 2013, sanders' critiqued obamacare, saying, though he voted for it, he wouldn't argue with someone who said it was too complicated.\n\nlet me be very clear, sanders said. i voted for obamacare. but to be very honest with you, i'm not going to argue with anybody who says that it is too complicated. i am an advocate of a 'medicare for all' single payer program. i think obamacare is a good republican romney type program, which has worked in massachusetts. it's a moderate program which addresses some needs.\n\none of obama's biggest mistakes as president, sanders said in september 2011, was abandoning his grassroots supporters and not following through on his campaign promises.\n\nin terms of wall street, in terms of the economy, in terms of taxes, terms of civil liberties, the president has clearly been disappointing to many people and nowhere near as strong as we had hoped that he would be, sanders said.\n\ni believe he ran one of the greatest campaigns that i've ever seen in my lifetime. he inspired people, galvanized people, brought people together, he added. but for whatever reasons, he has not followed through with a lot of the issues that he discussed in his campaign and i think has not stood up to the right wing extremism that is so potent in washington right now. and the answer was what you're asking is what do we do? well, the only thing that i know to do is to rally the american people around the progressive agenda.\n\nthis story has been updated with additional comment from the sanders campaign.
washington (cnn) the supreme court is unlikely to consider the fate of the affordable care act before the 2020 presidential election after denying a request tuesday from supporters of the law to fast-track consideration of the case.\n\nthe ruling sets aside the potential for another major shift in the political landscape prior to the election on an issue that has dominated american politics for the last decade.\n\npresident donald trump's effort to repeal obamacare was central to democrats sweeping into power in the house in the 2018 midterms -- a victory that came eight years after republicans had gained the house majority on their opposition to obama's signature health care law.\n\nbut in the decade since the affordable care act became law, elements of it -- such as requirements that insurers cover those with pre-existing conditions -- have become popular, turning health care politics in democrats' favor.\n\nit's already sure to be a focal point of the 2020 election. the law's future is at the center of the democratic presidential primary, with more moderate candidates like former vice president joe biden and former south bend, indiana, mayor pete buttigieg saying they want to expand on obamacare by allowing americans to buy into a medicare-style public insurance option. more progressive candidates like vermont sen. bernie sanders and massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren say they favor scrapping private insurance altogether for a government-run single-payer medicare for all system.\n\nread more

source: cnn pence takes flattery to new heights\n\naides to the vice president said that when trump and pence are at the white house, they spend hours together having regular lunches and attending presidential events.\n\nthey've become very close, one source close to the vice president said. the vice president's office isn't inclined to share details of the private conversations between #1 and #2, but one person familiar with their conversations said the vice president's goal is to bring the best information, the best people, every day to trump.\n\nthe president wants information. he's a huge consumer of information and he wants information from all sides, the source added.\n\nanother senior white house official called the relationship between the two men very strong and said pence played an influential role in the south asia strategy. pence made his own trip to the region before the president and relayed his conversations with foreign leaders and his impressions to trump.\n\nbut there was at least one point of tension in their first year – in august, after the new york times published a story stating that pence was running a shadow campaign for 2020.\n\npence used white house letterhead to rebut the claims to reporters, stating in part that the article was disgraceful and offensive to me, my family and our entire team.\n\nthe allegations in this article are categorically false and represent just the latest attempt by the media to divide this administration, he added.\n\nand yet there were multiple phone conversations between trump and pence about the story, according to a source familiar with the talks. trump expressed his displeasure with the new york times story and pence wanted to make it clear that the story was not accurate. the source added that there was also an ongoing conversation in the west wing about the formation of the pro-pence super pac great america committee.\n\nhow he spent his time\n\n02:01 - source: cnn could pence be questioned in russia probe?\n\nthe vice president traveled domestically and abroad almost every week, something his office says informed his first year. one senior white house official said a spurt of travel in the spring, listening sessions and speeches on health care reform across america were enormously helpful on the legislative front.\n\npence, a former congressman, was often deployed to capitol hill to serve as a trump administration liaison with lawmakers on issues ranging from health care to tax reform. but with the exception of tax reform, trump's legislative agenda has largely been stagnant, despite republican control of both the house and senate.\n\npence felt proud of the obamacare individual mandate repeal in the tax cut package that the administration pushed through congress at the end of last year, a senior white house official said, as well as the confirmation of supreme court justice neil gorsuch, the booming economy and the planned move of the us embassy in israel from tel aviv to jerusalem.\n\nthe vice president keeps disappointments closer to the vest. asked about his reaction to the multiple failed attempts to repeal and replace obamacare, a person close to pence said: he knows that more work is going to be done.\n\ntrump had also named pence the chairman of the now-defunct voter fraud commission, though one person close to the vice president said he distanced himself from it as the commission fell apart.

declared martial law in six areas after chinese-funded factories were set on fire.\n\n(cnn) —\n\npresident donald trump hasn't fulfilled his campaign promise to repeal obamacare outright, but he's fundamentally reshaped the debate over health care in america in myriad ways during his two years in office.\n\nalong with chipping away at the landmark affordable care act, the trump administration has made a historic and controversial change to medicaid, allowing states to require many participants who gained coverage through obamacare to work or lose their benefits.\n\nanother major focus of the president: the cost of drugs. like democrats, trump has repeatedly decried the rising price of drugs, and his administration has unveiled multiple proposals to try to contain costs.\n\nwhen it comes to medicare, the administration has continued to make private medicare plans more attractive. and in keeping with conservative positions, officials have rolled back access to contraceptives as well as abortion.\n\nhere's what's changed so far:\n\nobamacare\n\ntrump made his first move to weaken the affordable care act only hours after his inauguration, signing an executive order directing agencies to interpret regulations as loosely as possible and to minimize the financial burden of the law through waivers, exemptions or delays.\n\nbut after the republican-controlled congress failed to repeal obamacare, trump unleashed a series of executive changes to further undermine the law.\n\nthe president also signed another executive order making it easier for americans to access alternative policies that have lower premiums than affordable care act plans – but in exchange for fewer protections and benefits. his administration cut the obamacare open enrollment period in half and slashed funding for advertising and outreach, while at the same time increasing the visibility of insurance agents who also sell non-obamacare plans.\n\nand trump signed into law the gop tax cut bill that effectively eliminated the individual mandate by reducing the penalty to $0 – the basis for a federal court ruling invalidating the entire affordable care act. that ruling is currently being appealed.\n\ntrump also eliminated federal payments that help reduce deductibles and out-of-pocket costs for low-income participants, prompting insurers to raise premiums to cover the loss of these cost-sharing subsidies.\n\nmore recently, the trump administration told states that they could apply for waivers to make more substantial changes to their obamacare marketplaces, including altering the rules for who is eligible for federal help paying monthly premiums. these premium subsidies are essential to keeping obamacare functioning, experts say.\n\ntrump officials say their moves are aimed at providing greater access to more affordable health insurance options. they are particularly concerned about younger americans and those who earn too much to qualify for federal subsidies. but obamacare supporters say these actions will fray the strong protections for older consumers and those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nthe obamacare exchanges, however, have proven surprisingly resilient. some 8.4 million people signed up on the federal exchange for 2019. still, that's down from roughly 9.2 million who picked plans for 2017. much of the drop stems from fewer new consumers selecting policies.\n\nthe trump administration plans to make even more changes to the affordable care act for the coming year. it recently released a proposal that would increase the maximum amount enrollees have to pay out of pocket – a change that would affect those in large-employer plans too. at the same time, it would make the federal premium subsidies a bit less generous, which it estimates would decrease enrollment by 100,000 people.\n\nbut even more consequentially, it is formally exploring eliminating that annual automatic renewal of obamacare plans. this would have a devastating impact since 1.8 million people in the 39 states using the federal exchange were rolled over this year.\n\nofficials are also seeking input on silver loading, in which carriers increased their rates for silver plans to offset the loss of the cost-sharing subsidy payments. they did this to minimize rate increases on enrollees because federal premium subsidies are based on the second lowest-cost silver plan.\n\nmedicaid\n\na year ago, the trump administration made history and fulfilled a longtime republican goal by allowing states to impose work requirements on certain medicaid recipients. so far, eight states have received permission to do so, and more applications are under review.\n\nthe controversial move has already sparked lawsuits in two states, temporarily delaying the start of work requirements in kentucky until later this year.\n\nso far, only arkansas has actually implemented the new rules, which require beneficiaries to work, go to school, volunteer or search for jobs for at least 80 hours a month. the impact has been pronounced: more than 18,000 residents have lost coverage.\n\ndrug prices\n\non the campaign trail, trump repeatedly promised to reduce the cost of drugs. while he has issued many tweets lambasting the industry for raising prices and his administration has unveiled many proposals, he hasn't moved the needle too much.\n\nthe administration also laid out his vision for reducing drug prices in a 44-page blueprint unveiled last may. it contains a bevy of proposals for increasing competition, reducing regulations and changing the incentives for all players in the pharmaceutical industry.\n\none of the boldest and most controversial efforts involves setting medicare's reimbursement level for certain pricey drugs administered in doctors' offices and hospital outpatient centers based on their cost in other countries, which is typically far lower. this idea prompted howls of price fixing from the industry and conservative lawmakers.\n\npatient advocacy groups are concerned about another administration effort that would give medicare advantage plans the ability to restrict what medications they'll cover. the american cancer society cancer action network, backed by nearly 60 organizations, just launched a print and digital ad campaign to oppose the policy changes.\n\npharmaceutical companies aren't heeding the president's call. sixty drug makers kicked off 2019 by raising list prices on nearly 300 medications, according to an analysis by rx savings solutions. and more drug manufacturers are expected to quietly follow suit in coming weeks.\n\ncompanies do appear to be tempering their hikes in 2019, however. the average increase was 6.3%, down from nearly 9% a year ago, taking into account different dosages of the same drug.\n\nan official with the department of health & human services pointed to the lower rate of increases this january.\n\none thing that the trump administration has accomplished is approving a record number of generic drugs, which typically have lower prices. the white house council of economic advisers estimates this has saved consumers $26 billion over the first 18 months of trump's administration.\n\nmedicare\n\nunlike other republican leaders, trump does not want to make wholesale changes to the medicare program. instead, officials are continuing efforts to reform how medicare pays providers and to enhance the standing of private medicare advantage plans.\n\nmore than 21 million senior citizens are already enrolled in medicare advantage plans, and the trump administration has made them more attractive by expanding the definition of supplemental benefits they can provide. now, insurers can cover grab bars in bathrooms, transportation to doctor's offices and even home health aides. trump officials also gave the insurers a hefty rate increase.\n\ntrump officials are also trying to rein in costs. for instance, the centers for medicare & medicaid services is overhauling how it compensates doctors for office visits, reducing the tiers of payments from five to three, starting in 2021. but it also expanding reimbursements for telehealth services.\n\nanother target: the medicare accountable care organization program, which has more than 10.4 million participants. established by the affordable care act, these organizations are groups of doctors, hospitals and other providers who voluntarily work together to better coordinate patients' care and reduce health care costs by avoiding duplication of services and medical errors. known as acos, they share in the savings they achieve for medicare, but only a few are on the hook for any losses they generate.\n\ncurrently, acos in the medicare shared savings program have up to six years before they must take on costs if their spending per patient exceeds their targets. officials want to reduce that to as little as one year.\n\nhis administration has not proposed directly reducing medicare benefits or increasing beneficiary payments, said mark mcclellan, a former administrator of the centers for medicare & medicaid services under former president george w. bush and director of the duke-margolis center for health policy. instead, their proposals seek to continue to grow the medicare advantage program and continue to push for more payments based on value, not volume.\n\naccess to birth control\n\nthe administration is rolling back regulations that conflict with some americans' religious beliefs. it issued two rules last year that would free more employers from obamacare's contraceptive mandate.\n\nthe first one would allow non-profit and for-profit employers, including publicly traded companies, to receive an exemption based on their religious beliefs. the second would let all but public companies obtain an exemption based on moral objections. government employers cannot request exemptions.\n\nthe rules were set to take effect january 14. however, they were blocked by federal district judges in pennsylvania and california.\n\nthe administration also proposed regulations that would no longer permit federally funded family planning services at the same place where abortions are provided. and it has also proposed requiring obamacare insurers to bill separately for abortion coverage and to offer plans that do not cover abortions in states that don't mandate it.

(ap photo/evan vucci)\n\n(cnn) —\n\npresident donald trump's choice for health and human services secretary sought to convince lawmakers tuesday that he would work to lower prescription drug prices even though he used to lead a major us pharmaceutical company.\n\nsenate democrats and consumer advocates have raised concerns that trump selected former eli lilly executive alex azar to replace tom price, who resigned last year over his use of private planes. the president has promised to crack down on the pharmaceutical industry and lower drug prices, though he has done little in this arena so far.\n\nseveral democratic lawmakers pressed azar during his nomination hearing before the senate finance committee on potential conflicts of interest, noting that eli lilly raised drug prices during azar's time there.\n\nmr. azar told committee staff that while he chaired the company's pricing committee he never – not even once – signed off on a decrease in the price of a drug, said oregon sen. ron wyden, the top democrat on the committee. the system is broken. mr. azar was a part of that system. given ample opportunity to provide concrete examples as a nominee of how he'd fix it, mr. azar has come up empty.\n\nazar, however, argued that his experience in the pharmaceutical industry, which he joined after serving in the department of health and human services during the george w. bush administration, makes him better qualified to tackle high drug costs. he said the department has to ensure robust competition in the drug market, as well as stop drug companies from abusing the patent system to prevent generic competitors. also, azar would like to create incentives to lower the list prices of medications so that, when the patient walks in … needing to pay out of pocket at the pharmacy – that they're not hit with that kind of cost.\n\nto just know how that system works … i think, bring a great advantage to being able to hit the ground running, he said. there's no silver bullet, here, though. i want to be very clear. there's not one action that all of a sudden fixes this.\n\nsenators also touched on a wide range of topics, including combating the opioid epidemic, preserving the children's health insurance program, known as chip, and reining in the high cost of medical care generally.\n\nduring his testimony, azar showed he is in lockstep with the trump administration when it comes to overhauling the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, and medicaid. he said he supports letting states make changes to their programs through waivers, which trump officials have aggressively promoted.\n\non aca, azar said he wants to increase choice and competition.\n\nwhat we have now is not working for people, he said. i want to work with states on these 1332 waivers and work with our authorities to just try to make that health insurance more affordable, make it real insurance and make it tailored to what they feel they need.\n\nas for medicaid, azar said turning the safety net program into a block grant program – which limits federal support, but provides states with more flexibility – can be appealing, though there needs to be sufficient funding. and he said he does not support reducing funding, but does want to curtail its growth – which many democrats and consumer advocates say equates to a cut.\n\ni don't believe any of the proposals that the president or i would support involve cutting medicaid, or cutting the expansion, but rather slowing the rate of growth over the next 10 years in the interest of sustainability.\n\nboth trump's budget and the republican bills to repeal and replace obamacare would have reduced federal support for medicaid over a decade, compared to current law.
investors famously hate uncertainty. and it's hard to imagine something that would cause more uncertainty to the capitalist system than electing a self-proclaimed democratic socialist who is calling for a political revolution. sanders wants to ban oil and gas fracking , break up big banks and institute a wealth tax.\n\nthat's why wall street could feel the bern -- and not in a good way -- if sanders wins big in the iowa caucuses on monday and continues that momentum through super tuesday. investors would be forced to confront the reality that sanders, once seen as a long-shot candidate, could win the 2020 election.\n\nbernie could get off to a very fast start. he has passionate supporters. markets have dismissed him prematurely, said greg valliere, chief us policy strategist at agf investments.\n\njeff gundlach, the billionaire investor who correctly predicted donald trump's 2016 victory , similarly warned wall street last month of a looming sanders scare for markets.\n\nsanders has surged in the polls throughout january and is now viewed as the odds-on favorite to win the nomination by users on prediction market predictit. sanders now has a 46% chance of winning the nomination, up from 18% in early december. the next closest democrat is joe biden, with 27%, according to predictit.\n\nrewriting the american economy\n\nlove him or hate him, there's no debate that sanders is embracing policies that would rewrite broad swaths of the american economy. the us senator from vermont wants to break up facebook, curb stock buybacks and provide medicare for all. whatever the wisdom of those moves, each would bring about enormous uncertainty for investors.\n\nbernie's prescriptions would be disastrous for the markets. he would be viewed with tremendous anxiety by the markets, said valliere.\n\nby contrast, sanders's chief rival biden has advocated less dramatic policies. for instance, biden supports a carbon tax, but does not want to ban fracking or fossil fuel exports. he wants to expand obamacare but opposes medicare for all. biden is calling for higher corporate taxes but has not rolled out a wealth tax like sanders.\n\ni believe the market can live with joe biden because he's accepted as more of a centrist, said david kotok, chairman and chief investment officer of cumberland advisors.\n\nwall street could also live with other moderates still in the running, including billionaire michael bloomberg, former indiana mayor pete buttigieg and senator amy klobuchar.\n\nbernie vows to be wall street's 'worst nightmare'\n\nfor his part, sanders has embraced his casting as wall street's boogeyman.\n\nthe billionaire class is scared and they should be scared, sanders wrote on his instagram page last month.\n\nsanders vowed to end the greed of various industries, including wall street, insurance and fossil fuels.\n\nwe're prepared to be their worst nightmare and stand up for the working families of this country, he wrote.\n\nof course, it's important to remember that a president sanders could not wield a magic wand to enact his extreme policy proposals. congress must approve any sweeping changes. republicans (as well as perhaps some moderate democrats) would surely seek to block the sanders agenda. and the gop may still control the us senate.\n\neven if a progressive wins the white house and the senate turns blue, there will be enough moderates to bottle up the most aggressive policy changes, cowen analyst jaret seiberg wrote in a note to clients monday.\n\nthe senate would be the firewall, said valliere.\n\nbernie's surge could help trump\n\nsome argue that it's far too early to freak out about sanders, even if he performs well during the early nominating contests.\n\nhe has just about zero chance of winning a presidential election, peter boockvar, chief investment officer at bleakley advisory group, wrote in a note to clients monday. the markets instead should assume that trump gets reelected the better sanders does, whether you like that or not.\n\nif sanders is the nightmare outcome, four more years of trump is widely seen as the best outcome for the stock market and wall street.\n\na second term of trump is more low taxation, more deregulation and an indifference about trillion-dollar deficits, said kotok. markets like that. whether the country likes it, once it's fully digested, is another matter.\n\nbut a trump reelection also brings risks.\n\nunbound by the political and electoral constraints...a second-term president trump could prove even more aggressive and unpredictable in using tariffs, evan brown, head of asset allocation strategy at ubs asset management, wrote in a january report\n\nstocks perform much better under democrats\n\ndavid kelly, chief global strategist at jpmorgan funds, said that while a corporate tax hike would be negative for stocks, the volatility and uncertainty caused by standoffs with china and iran have likewise been negatives.\n\ni don't think we should automatically draw the conclusion that a republican must be better for the market and a democrat must be worse, kelly said. history doesn't show that.\n\nin fact, since 1944 the s&p 500 has averaged a gain of 11.1% per year under democratic administrations, compared with 6.9% under republicans, according to cfra research. that trend is even more pronounced immediately after an election. the s&p 500 has averaged a gain of 17% during the first year of a democratic presidential cycle, compared with just 0.4% under republicans.\n\nit's also wise to take market predictions related to politics with a grain of salt. no one knows exactly how the market will react to a new sheriff in town. and at the end of the day, the underlying health of the economy and corporate profits, not politics, is the real driver of stock prices.\n\nfor example, many on wall street warned that a trump upset victory in 2016 would spell doom for stocks. and they were right -- for about five hours as stock futures plummeted in the immediate aftermath of trump's win. stocks then took off on an historic rally and today trump is viewed as the best-case scenario for wall street in 2020.
house republicans have finally passed a bill to repeal and replace obamacare.\n\nafter some last-minute changes to the legislation, enough conservatives and moderates were convinced to support the bill thursday.\n\nthe bill's passage isn't guaranteed, however. now it heads to the senate, which is likely to make substantial revisions.\n\nstill, the american health care act goes a long way to fulfilling the republicans' seven-year pledge to repeal former president obama's landmark health reform law. and it would erase the coverage gains of the last few years and leave 24 million more people uninsured by 2026 than under obamacare, according to a congressional budget office analysis of an earlier version of the bill.\n\nrelated: what's inside the republican health care bill?\n\nreplace obamacare subsidies with refundable tax credits based mainly on age\n\nthe gop's plan would eliminate the obamacare subsidies, which are refundable tax credits based on a person's income and cost of coverage in their area. more than eight in 10 enrollees on the obamacare exchanges receive this assistance, but individuals making more than $47,500 and families of four earning more than $97,200 do not qualify.\n\ninstead, the republicans want to issue refundable tax credits to help people afford coverage on the individual market, but these credits will be based mainly on a person's age.\n\nthe credits will range from $2,000 for 20-somethings to $4,000 for those in their early 60s. the credits will also have an income cap. those making more than $75,000 would see their tax credits start to phase out, and an enrollee making more than $215,000 would not be eligible. families with incomes above $150,000 would see their credits dwindle, while those earning more than $290,000 would not qualify.\n\nthe bill would also kill the additional help that individuals earning less than roughly $30,000 a year receive to cover their out-of-pocket costs. more than half of the enrollees on the obamacare exchanges receive these cost-sharing subsidies.\n\ntrade the individual and employer mandates for continuous coverage requirements\n\nthe gop's bill would get rid of the obamacare requirement that people have health coverage or face a tax penalty. it would also eliminate the mandate that employers with at least 50 employees provide health insurance to their workers.\n\nunder obamacare, these companies had to provide affordable insurance to staffers who work more than 30 hours a week. they would face a penalty if they did not meet this criteria and their employee sought subsidies on the exchanges.\n\ninstead, the republican plan seeks to allow insurers to impose a 30% surcharge on the premiums of those who let their coverage lapse for at least 63 days. the plan would enable insurers to levy this surcharge for one year, but it would only apply to policies bought in the individual or small group markets.\n\nunder a recent amendment, states that seek waivers could replace this provision with one that allows insurers to charge consumers who've had a gap in coverage based on their health status.\n\nrelated: high-risk pools won't match obamacare's protections for pre-existing conditions\n\nweaken obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions\n\nstates could get waivers that would allow carriers to set premiums based on enrollees' medical backgrounds under several circumstances. those enrollees would have to have let their coverage lapse, and the state would have to set up a risk program -- such as a high-risk pool -- that, in some cases, could provide help to those being charged higher premiums.\n\nstates could also seek waivers that would allow insurers to sell plans that don't include all the essential health benefits mandated by the affordable care act. under obamacare, carriers must provide outpatient care, emergency services, hospitalization, maternity, mental health and substance abuse, prescription drugs, rehabilitation services, lab work, preventative care and pediatric services.\n\neliminating these two provisions could lower premiums somewhat and give consumers a wider choice of plans. but it would also make it harder for people to buy comprehensive coverage and weaken the protections for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nthe bill would provide $138 billion through 2026 to help states and insurers lower premiums and set up high-risk pools to cover those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nrevamp medicaid funding\n\nthe gop bill would significantly overhaul medicaid.\n\nit would send the states a fixed amount of money per medicaid enrollee, known as a per-capita cap. states could also opt to receive federal medicaid funding as a block grant for the adults and children in their program. under a block grant, states would get a fixed amount of federal funding each year, regardless of how many participants are in the program.\n\neither option would limit federal responsibility, shifting that burden to the states. however, since states don't have the money to make up the difference, they would likely either reduce eligibility, curtail benefits or cut provider payments. the block grant would be more restrictive since the funding level would not adjust for increases in enrollment, which often happens in bad economic times.\n\nthe legislation would also end the enhanced match rate for medicaid expansion for new enrollees starting in 2020. those already in the program could stay as long as they remain continuously insured. states that have not already expanded would not be allowed to do so, starting immediately.\n\nstates could also require able-bodied medicaid recipients to work, participate in job training programs or do community service.\n\nthe congressional budget office projects that bill would cut the federal government's spending on medicaid by 25% by 2026 as compared to current law.\n\nrelated: first 100 days: what trump has done to obamacare\n\nloosen the age-band so insurers can charge older folks more\n\nunder obamacare, insurers could only charge older enrollees three times more than younger policy holders. the gop bill would widen that band to five-to-one, which would hike premiums for those in their 50s and early 60s, but reduce them for younger folks.\n\nstates would also be allowed to seek waivers to allow insurers to charge older consumers even more than five times younger ones.\n\neliminate obamacare taxes\n\nthe republican legislation would eliminate the taxes the law levied on wealthy americans, insurers, prescription drug makers, device manufacturers and others.
americans now have two additional ways to get out of paying obamacare's individual mandate penalty.\n\nthe trump administration announced monday that those who live in counties with no insurer or with only one choice will be able to apply for a hardship exemption from the mandate, which requires nearly all americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty.\n\nevery county currently has at least one insurer on its exchange, but about 26% of obamacare enrollees -- living in slightly more than half of counties -- have only one option, according to the kaiser family foundation.\n\nalso, pro-life americans who can only buy plans that cover abortion can receive an exemption.\n\nthe broadening of the exemptions won't matter after this year since congress eliminated the individual mandate penalty starting in 2019. until now, hardship exemptions were typically granted to those who were homeless, facing eviction, had filed for bankruptcy or were in other difficult situations. people could also apply for income-related exemptions if the only plans in their areas were too costly or they earned too little to file a tax return.\n\nthe trump administration also took another step monday to put its stamp on the affordable care act by releasing new rules for 2019.\n\nsince congress failed to repeal and replace the health reform law, administration officials can only adjust obamacare's regulations. like its prior moves, the administration says the 2019 guidance focuses on lowering costs and increasing choices for consumers, states and insurers.\n\nwe're giving states tools and flexibility to promote more stable markets and help them attract & retain issuers. this will provide americans with more #healthcare choices at an affordable price.https://t.co/o9rkkjsnbq — administrator seema verma (@seemacms) april 9, 2018\n\nobamacare supporters, however, argue that the changes will only further undermine the law and hurt the millions who depend on it.\n\nthis rule reduces protections for people with pre-existing conditions, increases the cost of health coverage, and makes it harder for consumers to sign up for coverage, said sam berger, senior adviser at the center for american progress, a left-leaning group.\n\none of the more significant changes provides states with more flexibility in determining the essential health benefits that insurers must offer, starting in 2020. while carriers must still provide the 10 broad categories of essential health benefits mandated by obamacare, states could give them more leeway in selecting which specific services to cover.\n\nconsumer advocates, however, worry that this will allow insurers to trim services that sicker enrollees need, leaving them with fewer benefits and higher out-of-pocket costs. for instance, states could allow insurers to limit the number of physical therapy visits or tighten the variety of drugs covered under the plan.\n\nultimately, it could lead to less generous coverage, said elizabeth carpenter, a senior vice president at avalere health, a consulting firm.\n\nalso, consumers next year will face out-of-pocket spending caps of $7,900 for individuals and $15,800 for families, an increase of 7%. that's the biggest jump since 2014, according to avalere.\n\nrelated: what trump doesn't get about obamacare and health insurers' profits\n\nthe rule also eliminates the standardized simple choice plans that the obama administration had introduced in 2017 to make it easier for consumers to shop. these plans got preferential display on healthcare.gov. trump officials said that insurers complained the better billing on the federal exchange limited enrollment in other plans and removed the incentive to offer a greater variety of coverage options.\n\nsome enrollees who receive premium subsidies may also have to provide more documentation to prove their eligibility. exchanges will have to implement stronger checks to verify consumers' earnings if other data sources, such as the internal revenue service, show the enrollees' income is actually below the poverty line, rendering them ineligible. also, those who fail to file taxes and reconcile any past overpayment of subsidies will lose their assistance, even if their exchange doesn't send them a notice first.\n\nthe rule also allows states to make it easier for insurers to spend less of the premiums they collect on policyholders and put more toward profits and administrative costs. and the administration raised the default threshold that trigger state reviews of insurers' proposed rate hikes to 15%, up from 10%.\n\nrelated: people with pre-existing conditions could face tough times ahead\n\nthe administration is also making more changes to the navigator program, which helps enrollees sign up for coverage on the exchanges and for medicaid. the rule removes the requirement that each exchange must have at least two navigators and that one must be a community nonprofit group. also, navigators will no longer have to maintain a physical presence in the area.\n\nthe administration cut funding for the navigator program by 41% during the 2018 open enrollment season.\n\nthe new rule is the latest effort by the administration to undermine the affordable care act. earlier this year, it proposed rules that would allow insurers to sell short-term insurance plans, which last just under a year but don't have to comply with obamacare's regulations, and to make it easier for small businesses to band together to offer coverage that doesn't adhere to all of the health reform law's mandates. both of these options could have lower premiums, but also cover fewer benefits.
todd graham is the director of debate at southern illinois university. his debate teams have won five national championships and he has been recognized three times as the national debate coach of the year. follow him on facebook and twitter . the views expressed in this commentary belong solely to the author. view more opinion at cnn.\n\nthey began by attacking bloomberg and that paved the way for the feistiest debate yet. the candidates spent so much time throwing verbal punches at each other that none sufficiently explained why he or she would make the best president. consequently, none received an a.\n\nb+\n\nbernie sanders\n\nthe vermont senator handled himself well when placed center stage. his answer to a question about fracking -- explaining that fighting for the planet  is a moral issue  -- was excellent. after bloomberg said that he'd worked hard for his vast wealth sanders played to his democratic socialist theme, retorting that maybe your workers played some role in that, as well. sanders later reframed the idea of socialism when he explained that the united states currently has socialism -- but it's socialism for the rich.\n\nbut there were times when sanders faltered. he needs a better answer when it's argued that his health care plan would rob of countless people of their private insurance plans. on stage, his tone on the issue could be interpreted as condescension, which was likely not appreciated by viewers who disagree with his plan (and whose votes he may need to court come november). and while i appreciated sanders' comparison of health care costs overall, he still needs depth in his explanation of how we can finance medicare for all. that said, he was right to point at other nations who have successful nationalized health care systems as evidence that it can work -- and work well.\n\nb\n\npete buttigieg\n\nrich guys and radicals can't beat trump. the former south bend mayor began with this theme, mentioning that the democrats need to wake up as a party after super tuesday and warning that both sanders or bloomberg would be risky choices. he noted that sanders' all the way attitude leaves most people out and warned against nominating anyone too polarizing. buttigieg stayed consistent in this message, closing with a reminder that there's a middle ground between revolution and the status quo.\n\nunfortunately, there were times when i felt like buttigieg was giving a generic, impersonal campaign speech and lost his focus. and there were too many times buttigieg left meat on the table by not answering the specific question until it was too late and he was out of time.\n\nb\n\nelizabeth warren\n\nthis was the harshest i've seen the massachusetts senator in a debate. she took a stab at bloomberg, saying that if he is elected, we'd only be replacing one arrogant billionaire for another. and warren wasn't done with bloomberg. she later tore apart his defense that he treats women well, pointing at all the women he'd hired who were fairly compensated. this wasn't a defense of his treatment of women, warren argued. it was as meaningless as saying i've been nice to some women.\n\nwarren had an attack for just about everyone on stage, which is why i slightly lowered her grade. warren's attacks wore off their steam because they were deployed too often. debating is a balancing act, and warren needed to spend more time building up her own case for the presidency. to her credit, she did come to minnesota sen. amy klobuchar's defense, arguing that it was unfair for the senator to be picked on for forgetting the mexican president's name. we need to see more of that from warren on stage.\n\nc+\n\njoe biden\n\nthe former vice president's strength is that he comes across as sincerely believing that his work in government has been for the public good. the problem is that biden simply doesn't know how to translate his convictions into persuasiveness. his messaging is overcrowded, often lacking a clear purpose.\n\nbiden also needs to learn that anger isn't the only emotion at his disposal. on the debate stage, it seemed like a binary choice for biden: anger on or anger off. from issues of obamacare to stop and frisk and transparency, biden got worked up a lot. he needs to find middle ground where he's not totally angry nor is he totally disengaged. at the height of biden's sole emotion, he pointed at the camera, with a pen in his hand, as he animatedly talked about china. it's not a great look on a debate stage.\n\nc+\n\namy klobuchar\n\nklobuchar is trying to stake out the middle ground in these debates, and health care is a perfect example. klobuchar briefly mentioned, when criticizing sanders' plan, that even many democrats in congress don't support medicare for all. frankly, this is her strongest argument on health care and klobuchar would be wise to highlight it more in the next debate.\n\nwhere klobuchar had trouble was with tougher questions. she was asked about her time as a prosecutor, which put her on the defensive. and then klobuchar appeared to lose her cool when being grilled about a recent interview in which she couldn't identify policies dealing with mexico or remember its president's name. when buttigieg piled on, klobuchar became angrily sarcastic, uttering i wish everyone was as perfect as you, pete. it came across as defensive and petty.\n\nf\n\nmichael bloomberg\n\nhe had a brutal night. the former mayor of new york city was attacked by every other candidate on stage, and that was well before the first commercial break. indeed, the criticisms were coming so often and so fast that bloomberg seemed to barely have enough time to register one attack before he got hit with two or three more, preventing him from ever developing a cohesive message.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter. join us on twitter and facebook\n\nhe took heat on sexual harassment in the workplace, redlining, stop and frisk, excessive wealth and his former support for republican politicians. bloomberg's responses simply weren't sufficient.\n\nthe worst for bloomberg was when he was asked about settling lawsuits from women. he seemed to spend more time defending the non-disclosure-agreements he has in place than discussing any other single position throughout the entire debate. and his language choices were awful. when asked about the suits, bloomberg replied, maybe they didn't like a joke i told. bloomberg said that the ndas were entered into consensually. that answer is wrong on so many levels and he was rightfully called out by his opponents for it.
washington (cnn) after signing a massive but temporary expansion of the social safety net into law this week, president joe biden will set about convincing americans that its benefits -- which amount to a dramatic reshaping of the country's economy -- must be made permanent.\n\nhis first venue will be a primetime address thursday night, a direct-to-camera reckoning on a year of pandemic that aides say will still lean heavily into positive signs the country is slowly emerging from crisis -- fueled along, he'll say, by the contents of his new law.\n\nthe legislative lifeline, while extraordinary in scope, is only a temporary solution to pull america from its crisis. a legacy-making program along the lines of a modern-day new deal for biden would require an even more difficult measure of political capital.\n\nmindful of the nation's collective weariness at pandemic forced restrictions -- illustrated in part by polling conducted for democrats and viewed inside the white house -- the president's speech will be his most forward-looking toward reopening, an aide said.\n\nbiden will spend the ensuing weeks firing up air force one to fly around the country highlighting where the bill's effects will be most felt , an effort designed to sell people outside washington that it is in part because of his plan that vaccinations are speeding up, schools are reopening and life is starting to look like normal, according to people familiar with the plans.\n\nafter avoiding one, biden will likely convene his first formal news conference in the coming days to help advance his ideas. he's waited longer than any president in the past 100 years to do so.\n\nand likely next month, he will speak to a joint session of congress to lay out his next steps, which the white house says are still being developed but will likely include a push on infrastructure, climate and making permanent the provisions that ease burdens on families. that is likely to require tax increases, making its passage a tougher sell but solidifying its larger effect on american society.\n\nthe president has taken the 2009 stimulus as a cautionary tale, telling white house officials and fellow democrats that he doesn't want to repeat what he believes was a mistake the obama administration made in not selling that plan to americans.\n\nwe didn't adequately explain what we had done. barack was so modest, biden told house democrats last week. i kept saying, 'tell people what we did.' he said, 'we don't have time. i'm not going to take a victory lap.' and we paid a price for it, ironically, for that humility.\n\nthe sales job isn't merely self-promotion. because of the narrow scope required to pass the bill through a budget process, many of its benefits expire -- like increased subsidies for health insurance and an expansion of the child tax credit -- after a year. making them permanent will require another act of congress that would likely need some republicans on board.\n\nbiden and his advisers have wagered americans will welcome the expanded benefits and punish republicans who work to block them from becoming permanent next year, just as the 2022 midterm elections loom.\n\nwe're still thinking through the contours of what's going to be in that next package, bharat ramamurti, the deputy director of the national economic council, told reporters tuesday.\n\ndesire to highlight government help\n\nbiden's recovery plan, which the house is poised to pass wednesday without a single republican vote, is aimed squarely at helping poor and working class americans emerge from the dire economic and health crises caused by the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nafter a year of government mismanagement and chaos, the american relief plan is a signal that washington is ready to help with $1,400 direct payments to americans, increased funding for vaccine distribution and funding for state and local governments.\n\nthe white house has pushed to distribute the payments before the end of the month, hoping to increase the number of electronic deposits to get money to americans quicker. biden won't take a step his predecessor insisted upon: putting his name or signature on the physical checks.\n\nthis is not about him. this is about the american people getting relief, press secretary jen psaki said tuesday. he didn't think that was a priority or a necessary step.\n\nalready, biden has sought to underscore the help his administration is bringing to small businesses. standing next to a rotating display of doorknobs at a washington hardware store on tuesday, a double-masked biden said he wanted his relief funds better targeted than efforts under the previous administration to shore up the economy.\n\na lot of money went to people who shouldn't have gotten help, he said.\n\nit was a preview, aides said, of increased engagement with americans outside the white house, where biden has spent most of his term so far engaging lawmakers on the relief package. he has traveled outside of washington on only a few occasions, to visit vaccine facilities and tour storm aftermath in texas. but he has been itching to travel more, one official said, believing the case for his bill is best made out in the country, where polls show it widely popular.\n\nan optimistic approach meant to spur more action\n\nin his thursday evening address, delivered from the white house and timed to reach the broadest swath of americans, officials said biden would both reflect on one of the darkest years in recent memory while leaning heavily into a message that, through collective effort, the end is in sight.\n\nan official said biden was still working with his speechwriters on the final draft.\n\nstill wary of overpromising a return to normalcy when unknown factors like vaccine hiccups and variants may complicate the timeline, biden will nonetheless seek to project optimism that the country will begin reopening soon. he'll underscore sped-up vaccination efforts, which are well exceeding his initial goal of 1 million shots per day.\n\nand he will use the freshly passed stimulus plan -- which the white house has said is necessary to jump-start the country out of crisis -- as reason for optimism.\n\nyet the plan is also meant to go further than just the effects of the pandemic, by reducing child poverty, combating income inequality and hunger and expanding health coverage, in ways democrats have pushed for years.\n\nalready, wide majorities of americans say in polls they support biden's plan, which the white house began selling as a necessity to return the country to normal through funding for reopening schools and expanding vaccine distribution. republicans struggled to unify behind a message of opposition, focusing instead on culture war issues and internal divides in the post-donald trump era.\n\nrepublicans have complained the president, who made nods toward working across the aisle on the measure, ultimately pushed through a plan without any gop support. and some have warned it could trigger inflation.\n\nit's a real tragedy, house republican conference chair liz cheney told reporters on tuesday. we know for sure that it includes provisions that are not targeted, they're not temporary, they're not related to covid. and it didn't have to be this way. we could have had a bill that was, you know, a fraction of the cost of this one, that could have gotten bipartisan approval and support.\n\nit's only been more recently that the administration began promoting the plan as a major win for progressive ideas, including the notion that it could cut childhood poverty in half and provide a major expansion of obamacare.\n\nthe bill does not contain everything democrats wanted, namely an increase in the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour. last-minute bargaining also led to a reduction in unemployment benefits.\n\nbut even the most progressive members of congress have come to support it.\n\nthis is the most significant legislation for working people that has been passed in decades, senate budget committee chairman bernie sanders of vermont told cnn's anderson cooper on monday, arguing that although the measure was about alleviating the economic and educational consequences of the pandemic it also went deeper.\n\ni think what shocks many in the establishment, and certainly my republican colleagues is that we wrote a bill to address the crisis facing working families and the middle class and low-income people, and not the wealthy and large corporations and their lobbyists, sanders added.

and they sort of go like i can't believe it either. they can't believe it. you know why? because they have presidents and other people within the administration in the past to allow them to get away. some of them will say no one ever asked us to pay. we have negotiations going on with a lot of countries to pay a lot of money to the united states. i wouldn't say they're thrilled. if that makes me unpopular in those countries, that's ok, but we're doing tremendous service to those countries and they should at least respect us. they didn't respect us.\n\n\n\ngo ahead. you treat me so nicely.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: i appreciate it, mr. president. maybe the military has an angle here or a possible --\n\n\n\ntrump: they have no angle. i know every angle. no, they have no angle. the military under past leadership, including for many years was taken advantage of by other countries. allies and not allies, they were taken advantage of. our country has to be respected. we're not respected when we do that. when horrible things are happening on trade where we have barriers put up, where we have tariffs put on and we open our country up, we just open it up, where cars are sent into our country with virtually no tax, no nothing and yet they won't accept our cars, when cars are sent in and they pay no tax but we're expected to pay 25, 40, 50 percent and we pay nothing, i'll be honest with you, it's just not in my dna.\n\n\n\n[14:05:00] i don't know how people allowed that in my position, allowed these things to happen. and we're not allowing it to happen anymore. i could be the most popular person in europe. i could run for any office if i wanted to but i don't want to. i want people to treat us fairly and they're not. and it's not -- there's no angles. there's no angles. there's nothing -- you know, when a country sends us 200 soldiers to iraq or sends us a hundred soldiers from a big country to syria or to afghanistan and then they tell me a hundred times, oh, we sent you soldiers, we sent you soldiers. and that's 1/100th of the money they take advantage of, they're just doing it to make me happy. i've heard past presidents say they've involved in the afghanistan war because they sent us a hundred soldiers. yet it's costing us billions of billions of dollars. i get along with india and the prime minister and he's constantly telling me he built a library in afghanistan. you know what that is? that's like five hours of what we spend. and he tells it is and he's very smart and we're supposed to say oh, thank you for the library. i don't know who's using it in afghanistan but one of those things. well, i don't like --\n\n\n\nunidentified male: to show up, to negotiate with -- pamela brown: all right, we were just listening to president trump\n\n\n\nspeaking to members of his cabinet here at the white house in this new year. a lot to dissect. of course, there is more. let's take a listen.\n\n\n\ntrump: it's the end of the world and we're subsidizing their military by billions and billions and billions of dollars many, many, many times what those soldiers cost their country.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: did you hear about the mitt romney op-ed?\n\n\n\ntrump: i wish mitt could be more of a team player. i'm surprised he did it this quickly. i was expecting something but i'm surprised he did it this weekly. look, i endorsed him, he thanked me profusely. he said it. i read his op-ed. he agrees and i don't think he would be -- i don't think anybody would have been able to do the tax cuts like i did. weep go we got the greatest tax cut ever. we got rid of the individual mandate, which is repeal and replace of obama. it only was kept, obamacare, it was only kept because of the individual mandate. now that that's gone, i don't know how you can possibly keep it. so that's repeal and replace. john mccain voted against it, after campaigning for many years, john mccain voted against it. he went thumbs down and that was the end of that. for many years it was repeal and replace and then at 2:00 in the morning he went thumbs down. so, i'm a very flexible guy. we were part of that lawsuit as you know. a great judge, highly respected from texas said the individual mandate's out. that means we should win at the supreme court where this case will go. now, when we do, we will sit down with the democrats and we will come up with great health care, far better, far better. we'll have everything included. we'll have everything included. far better because obamacare is too expensive. the premiums are way too high and the deductibles, you can't even use it. the deductible is so high, unless up get hit by a tractor, you can't even use it. nobody's ever seen anything like it. obamacare is a tremendous failure. but now that we won the individual mandate, which was by far the most unpopular thing in blake.\n\n\n\n[14:10:00] so, with mitt romney, i'd love him to be a team player. possibly he won't be. i'm surprised he acted so quickly. i gave him an endorsement, i was happy that he won in utah. i have great popularity in utah. i love the people of utah. i did something for them that nobody else would have done, that had to do with their parks opinion woo we did that for a very special person who is now going to be retiring after 42 years, a great friend, a great senator, who is really a spectacular plan and also for mike lee, who really pressed it very hard. so, orrin hatch and mike lee. and the people of utah, we did that for a very special person who is now going to be retiring after 42 years, a great friend, a great senator, who is really a spectacular plan and also for mike lee, who really pressed it very hard. so, orrin hatch and mike lee. and the people of utah really appreciate what i did for him. hundreds and hundreds of miles of park that they'll be able to now use as opposed to not. and so, i was surprised at mitt romney. but i just hope he's going to be a team player. if he's a team player, that will be great. i will say this, if he fought really hard against president obama like he does against me, he would have won the election. does that make sense to you? if he fought the way he fights me, i'm telling you, he would have won the election. but i think he's going to end up being a team player. i think he agrees with many of the things that we've done and many of the things that we have in mind and we'll see what happens.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: mr. president --\n\n\n\ntrump: go ahead, afghanistan.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: in afghanistan, you have one isis and the is gaining ground. and india --\n\n\n\ntrump: i think india should be involved in afghanistan. i gave our generals all the money they wanted. they didn't do such a great job in afghanistan. they've been fighting in afghanistan for 19 years. general mattis thanked me profusely for getting him several hundred billion and thanked me more the following year when i got him $716 billion. he couldn't believe it because our military was depleted. now we're rebuilding our military. pat was very responsible for a lot of the orders for the new f-35 fighter jets and f-18s including ships and missiles and everything. but general mattis was so thrilled. but what's he done for me? how has he done in afghanistan? not too good. not too good. i'm not happy with what he's done in afghanistan and i shouldn't be happy. but he was very thankful when i got him $700 billion and the following year $716 billion. so, i wish him well. i hope he does well. but as you know, president obama fired him and essentially so did i. i want results.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: [inaudible]\n\n\n\ntrump: we're going to do something that's right. we are talking to the tall ban, we're talking to a lot of different people but here's the thing because you mentioned india. andria as there. russia is there. russia used to be the soviet union. afghanistan made it russia because they went bankrupt fighting in afghanistan. russia. so, you take a look at other countries. pakistan is there. they should be fighting. but russia should be fighting. the reason russia was in afghanistan was because terrorists were going into russia. they were right to be there. the problem is it was a tough fight. and literally they went bankrupt. they went into being called russia again as opposed to the soviet union. a lot of these places you're reading about now are no longer a part of russia because of afghanistan. but why isn't russia there? why isn't india there in we there and we're 6,000 miles away? but i don't mind. we want to help our people, help other nations. you do have terrorists, mostly taliban but is. i'll give you an example. so tall isis is an enemy. we have an area where taliban is here, isis is here and they're fighting each other. i said why don't you let them fight? why are we getting in the middle of it? i said let them fight. they're both our enemies, let them fight. sir, we want to do it. they go in and end up fighting both of them. it the craziest thing i've ever seen. i think i would have been a good general but who knows. these are two enemies fighting again but what are we doing? he's done a fantastic job. he's brought the country together. india, russia, you look at some of the satellite countries that are extremely wealthy with oil, surrounding. [14:15:00] i spoke to some of them. they -- i said to a certain\n\n\n\ncountry, very rich country, what would you do if the united states pulled out? oh, we'd be taken over by the taliban and terrorists. i said, ah. they b then why are you charging us when we have to use your country to send product through? why are you charging us when we send airplanes over your country? we're doing the job for you, why are you charging us? he said to me, very great gentleman, smart. he said to me, well, nobody ever asked me not to. i said i'm asking you not to. he said we will not charge you. and i'm talking about millions and millions of dollars. flights over his country. but i say to him, what would happen if we weren't here? and he looks at me and he goes we would be overrun. we could not defend ourselves. and yet he charges us. but he doesn't charge us anymore, ok. jeff.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: you use the word slowly when you're describing the withdrawal --\n\n\n\ntrump: i didn't say --\n\n\n\nunidentified male: what is your timetable?\n\n\n\ntrump: somebody said four months. obama gave up syria when he didn't violate the red line. i did when i shot 59 missiles in but that was a long time later. and when president obama decided not to violate his statement that never cross the red line and then they did and he didn't do anything about it, you know, make a threat is ok but you always have to follow through with the threat. you can't make a threat and then do nothing. so, syria was lost long ago. it was lost long ago. and besides that, i don't want -- we're talking about sand and death. that's what we're talking about. we're not talking about vast wealth. we're talking about sand and debt. now, the kurds, it's very interesting, turkey doesn't like them, other people do. i didn't like the fact that there selling the small oil they have to iran. but kurds are selling oil to iran. i'm not happy about it at all. at the same time, they fight better when we fight with them. when we send 30 f-18s in front of them, they fight much better than they do when we don't. and you've we want to protect the kurds. but i don't want to be in serious forever. it sad and the death. if we fight isis-- you know where else they're going? to iran, who hates isis more than we do. they're going to russia, who hates is more than we do. then i read when we pull out, russia is thrilled. you know why they're not happy? because this be and we're killing isis also for iran. and just while we're on iran because people don't like to write the facts. iran is a much different country than it was when i became president. iran when i became president, i had a meeting at the pentagon with lots of generals, they were like for a pry, better looking than tom cruz and stronger. i've had more i said this is the greatest room i've ever seen. i saw more computer boards than i think that they make today.\n\n\n\nand every part of the middle east and other places that was under attack was under attack because of iran. and i said to myself, wow, i mean, you look at yemen, you look at syria, you look at every place, saudi arabia was under siege, they were all -- i mean, they wanted yemen because of a long border with saudi arabia. that's why they're there, frankly. but every place was under siege. i actually asked a question. they had plenty of money. president obama had just given them $150 billion. he gave them $1.8 billion in cash. i'm still trying to figure that one out, mick opinion plane loads of cash, i cash from my different countries.\n\n\n\n[14:20:00] you know why from five different countries, jeff? because we didn't have enough cash in, they had to use the current at this with all of that being said, i did something called terminate the horrible iran nuclear deal, which by the way, in eight years gives iran the legal right to have nuclear weapons. i did it. iran is no longer the same country. iran is pulling people out of syria. they can do what they want there, frankly, but they're pulling people out, they're pulling people out of yemen. iran wants to survive now. iran was they were going to take they can do what they want there, frankly, but they're pulling people out, they're pulling people out of yemen. iran wants to survive now. iran was they were going to take over everything and destroy israel while they're at it.\n\n\n\niran is a much different country right now. they're having riots every week in every country, bigger than they've when we do all of the things that we gone pan iran is in trouble. i'd love to negotiate with iran. there but iran is a much different country right now, jeff, than it was when i took office. what i took over two years ago, iran was going to tack over the most and they were going to have all the weapons they wanted in a short period of time because of that stupid deal. when i terminated that deal and then did what i had to do, iran is a much different country today than it was 19 months ago, that i can tell you.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: on the timetable for withdrawing troops --\n\n\n\ntrump: it just over a period of time. oh, we're withdrawing. we're hitting them very hard. when i met with the generals in iraq, i said to a couple of the generals, why didn't you do this before? he said, sir, our commanders were telling us what to do. i said don't you tell them? no, sir, we take orders. and they're great soldiers. they listen. i do it differently. i sat around and after a few minutes they listened up and said this is what we're should do. but we were supposed to be out and that was five years ago and we never left. i see soldiers that are so badly injured and hurt, i don't want that. why want it. and our military is getting really strong. i can tell you story when i got here about our military that i don't even want to talk about. i don't even want to talk about. one of the ngs, we do these reports on our military. some i.g. goes over there, and he goes over there and they do a report on every single thing we're fighting wars and they're doing report and releasing it to the public. the public means the enemy. those reports should be private reports. let them do a report but they should be private reports and be locked up and but for these reports, criticizing referring for these reports -- essentially given out to the enemy is insane. and i don't want it to happen anymore, mr. secretary. you understand that. look at the reports. nobody more critical of, hey, it's not my fault, we're getting out smart. and we're.\n\n\n\nsaid but we're getting out very carefully. yes, ma'am.\n\n\n\nunidentified female: could you accept anything less than $2.5 billion?\n\n\n\ntrump: no, we're asking for 5.6. somebody said 2.5. no, look, this is national security we're talking about. just like we talk about the military, just like we're talking about syria or afghanistan or all these different places. i mean, we spend in afghanistan more in one month than what we're talking about for the wall.\n\n\n\n[14:25:00] think of that, ok. that's another way. we spend in afghanistan more money than most countries spend, except a few. they stepped up. i'm not holding nancy to this but she said you'll never get the republicans to vote for it. i never saw anything so beautiful in my life. that spired this many we don't need another democrat. and i want the democrats to join in, too. the 5.6 billion is such a small number. literally it's one month in afghanistan we're talking about national security. this isn't just a border. this is national security. this is health and wellness. this is everything.\n\n\n\nunidentified female: does that mean -- of\n\n\n\ntrump: we're going to see. let see. maybe they have an idea. i talk also daca but i just think we are better off waiting for the supreme court. if the supreme court rules that president obama was wrong, which they should, because by the way if he was right, then i have been given tremendous power. wouldn't that be scary, right? if president obama is allowed to do what he did on daca then i am allowed to do whatever i want to do on things that you know probably the president as he said probably a president doesn't have the right to do.\n\n\n\nunidentified female: how long do you think the government is going to stay partially shut down?\n\n\n\ntrump: could be a long time and it could be quickly. it is too important a subject to walk away from. i was here christmas evening, i was all about except for all the guys out on the lawn with machine guns. i never saw so many guys with machine guns in my life, secret service and military. these are great people but i was all alone with the machine gunners and i felt very safe they're great people and there but they didn't do that and that's ok. look, look, this is really something that should be bipartisan. and we'll see if it is. i hope it is. i hope it is, ok?\n\n\n\nunidentified male: mr. president, are you willing to keep the government shut down until the supreme court rules on daca?\n\n\n\ntrump: no, i think this should be settled. by the way, if the supreme court would do a great favor to this country and say the president should not have done that, we will settle this whole thing, including really a big immigration policy, not just border security, which is very important. because we would do something with daca. a lot of the republicans, most republicans are fine with some deal on daca. daca's ok. these are people that have been in the country a long time. in many cases they don't even speak the language of the country from which their parents came.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: how are you viewing this meeting later this afternoon? is this an education campaign? are you issuing demands --\n\n\n\ntrump: all this is to tell chuck and nancy and some others from i.c.e. and border patrol and also from local law enforcement how bad it is, how dangerous it is and why we need a wall but they know that. look, when they say the wall's immoral, then you got to do something about the vatican because the vatican has the biggest wall of them all. the wall is immoral. look at all of the countries that have walls. and they work 100 percent. it's never going to change. a wall is a wall. the others just -- i mean, we can have all the drones flying over the people last night as they tried to rush the border. the only thing that stopped them was the wall. if we have drones up there, it's wonderful, we'll get nice pictures.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: 5.6 is a small amount compared to a problem.\n\n\n\ntrump: it was never 25. a lot of people thought it was 25 billion. that was for overall homeland security. that was for much more than the wall. the wall was a piece of that. so, a lot of people said he should have taken the 25 billion. well, that covered a lot more territory than the wall.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: how long are you willing to keep the government shut down? as long as it takes?\n\n\n\ntrump: look, i'm prepared -- i think the people of the country think i'm right. again, i could have done nothing. could i have a lot easier presidency by doing nothing. but i'm here, i want to do it right. and i'm not only talking here, i'm talking about middle east problems and other problems and north korea problems.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: why do you think mr. romney will eventually become a team player?\n\n\n\ntrump: i don't know if he does. i hope he does. i think i have the highest rating -- i don't know why but they like me. they say i'm the most popular president in the history of the republican party. you see the same news i do.

her city of stamford on lockdown. so all of this behavior that actually wound up getting her into a mental evaluation back in december, and papers were found relating to that evaluation, anderson.\n\n\n\ncooper: and i talked to her sisters about that. they actually dispute some of what the boyfriend has reportedly said. you have also been talking to your sources about medications that she might have been on. what have you heard?\n\n\n\nfeyerick: yes, this is an interesting thing is that authorities went into the apartment and did an entire search. what they found is they found a discharge paper from the mental health evaluation that she underwent back in december. that's about ten months ago. and in those papers, there were prescriptions for medications to treat both symptoms for bipolar disorder. there also schizophrenia and then antidepressant.\n\n\n\nso, there was a lot going on. it's unclear. initially, we have been told that there was medication but there were prescriptions at the very least. and i think when you spoke to the family, they acknowledged that indeed she was on medication.\n\n\n\ncooper: right, they said she had been on medication but that she had been tapering off that medication under doctor supervision and the recommendation of a doctor. that's what miriam told, her sister amy, and you are going to hear from amy in just a moment.\n\n\n\nbut it is interesting because amy categorically says and so those does the other sister says that her sister, miriam, was not schizophrenic, did not have bipolar disorder but instead, had postpartum depression and psychosis.\n\n\n\nwhat do you know about this envelope? you were reporting on this last night that she reportedly left behind, i guess, for her boyfriend.\n\n\n\nfeyerick: she did. there was an envelope that was taped to the ground by her door and written his name. initially they thought there was a letter inside. it was a sugary substance mixed with a corn substance. it was very bizarre and that's what stalled the speed of the investigation because they had to send a hazmat team into the apartment to make sure there was nothing that could potentially contaminate or make anyone ill inside that apartment. but there was that envelope addressed to him with a substance. they don't know why.\n\n\n\ncooper: all right, deborah feyerick. appreciate the reporting.\n\n\n\nso, this obviously, i mean, goes without saying a horrible moment for miriam carey's two sisters, amy carey jones and valerie carey. they spent part of the day today with authorities identifying their sister's body. it's hard to imagine what that has been like and what the coming days and weeks they are going to be like for this family. it takes a lot to endure that.\n\n\n\nand still more to talk about it. but they want people to know about the sister and new mother that they loved. i talked to them earlier.\n\n\n\n(begin videotape)\n\n\n\ncooper: valarie and amy, i can't imagine how tough this is and what you're going through. i'm sorry for your loss. amy, what do you want people to know?\n\n\n\namy carey-jones, miriam carey's sister: i want people to just understand that miriam, she was a young 34-year-old vibrant woman. and she had a lot of dreams and aspirations. she was fun. she was loving. she was very nurturing to her daughter. she was a new mom and she was excited about that.\n\n\n\nshe always talked about teaching. her field was dental hygienist. and she wanted to go further and give back in the field. she -- health was everything that she lived for. and she just was a wonderful person.\n\n\n\npeople need to see she was more than the suspect that was driving the car.\n\n\n\ncooper: does any of this make sense to you, amy?\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: no, it -- we're still trying to put the pieces together. it's very sudden. it still doesn't seem real. we're just waiting for the real story as to exactly what happened to come out.\n\n\n\nthe investigation is still going forth and we're very interested to know what happened. we don't know what happened.\n\n\n\ncooper: amy, did you know she was in d.c.?\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: i didn't know she was in d.c. i was on my way to work and the call was very sudden. i was told and i think i found out just the same as everyone else on the news.\n\n\n\ncooper: so, what was your initial reaction? i mean, obviously the horror of it all, but what went through your mind?\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: that that could not have been my sister. i immediately went to turn on the television to see what was being reported, and i just saw the same clip over and over, the car. i did recognize her car and it just didn't seem real.\n\n\n\ni'm still in shock. i'm still trying to deal with this, very emotional for me.\n\n\n\ncooper: it probably still doesn't seam real.\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: no. i don't know when it ever will seem real.\n\n\n\ncooper: valarie, do you have any idea why she may have driven down to d.c.? i mean, there are all sorts of, you know, reports that she had been having emotional problems, that authorities, according to some authorities, there were drugs for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and for depression found in her house. does this make any sense to you?\n\n\n\nvalarie carey, miriam carey's sister: what i can say and will say is that my sister was not a bipolar, schizophrenic individual. and i can't say as to why she was in d.c., but regardless of the reason that she was there, her life shouldn't have ended there.\n\n\n\ncooper: do you have questions about the reaction by law enforcement?\n\n\n\ncarey: well, that's something that has to be looked into further. this is the reason why the family is here. we're here for answers in d.c.\n\n\n\ncooper: amy, there are sources saying last year police had been called by your sister's boyfriend who reported that she was acting irrationally or delusionally. is that something you knew about? is that something that were concerned about?\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: i'm not going to feed into things that he reported to the press. i just know that my sister did experience postpartum depression with psychosis they labeled it, which came along with treatment of medication and counseling, which she did. and she had her challenges with that. and that's what she was being treated for.\n\n\n\ncooper: so as far as you know, she wasn't bipolar, she wasn't schizophrenic, you believe it was postpartum depression.\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: it was postpartum depression with psychosis. that's what her diagnosis was. and she worked very closely with her doctor to taper off the medication and just get the counseling she needed to deal with that diagnosis.\n\n\n\ncooper: how was that manifested in her life? was that something you saw in her life?\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: no, we -- it wasn't something that was displayed. it was a momentary breakdown where she had to go and have emergency care. once she understood what the diagnosis was, she knew how to move forward. she had her challenges as a new parent, and i always spoke closely with her.\n\n\n\ni am a parent. i have two children. so, you know, just like anyone else she had questions and we dealt with that as a family, but there was nothing out of the ordinary.\n\n\n\ncooper: did she seem in recent days to be off medication or to be unstable?\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: no, she didn't appear to be unstable.\n\n\n\ncooper: again, the reports that she told her boyfriend that she believed president obama was in some way electronically monitoring her home, did she ever talk to you about that?\n\n\n\ncarey: what i can say is she has never disclosed anything of that nature. and since my sister is not here to speak for herself, that statement in itself is very questionable.\n\n\n\ncooper: in the last time you talked with her, the last couple of times you talked with her, did you notice anything out of the ordinary?\n\n\n\ncarey: no. she was concerned about me.\n\n\n\ncooper: just as any sister would be?\n\n\n\ncarey: absolutely.\n\n\n\ncooper: amy, how about you? when was the last time you talked to your sister?\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: our last conversation -- more through text message, my last time conversing with her was on monday. and before that, it was a few days before that. we spoke often. she would -- she lived in connecticut, i lived in brooklyn. so she frequently came down to brooklyn so that our mother can baby sit her daughter to accommodate her schedule. she did stop by often.\n\n\n\ncooper: and when you talked to her on monday, how did she seem to you?\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: normal, regular. it was just, you know, business as usual, you know.\n\n\n\ncooper: do you think you will ever get the answers you're looking for about what happened in your sister's mind, in her life?\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: we will never know what miriam was thinking in those last hours before she -- before she died. we can only speculate. our real concern is why, and were things done properly? like was there some other way that she could have been helped, so that it didn't end tragically.\n\n\n\n(end videotape)\n\n\n\ncooper: we got to take a quick break. again, amy and valarie said that miriam had recently tapered off the medication she had been taking under a doctor's supervision.\n\n\n\nin a moment, they're going to elaborate on that. and i'm going to talk to dr. drew pinsky for his perspective. let us know what you're thinking. you can follow he me on twitter @andersoncooper. i'm tweeting tonight.\n\n\n\nalso, later in the hour ahead, just who is playing games with the government shutdown while millions pay the price? we'll tell you. keep them honest ahead.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\ncooper: hey, welcome back to the program.\n\n\n\nbefore the break, you heard amy carey-jones and valarie carey talk about the sister that they knew and loved and still love. they want people to know she was a bright ambitious woman, a loving mother, 34-years-old. they also acknowledge she had been dealing with serious mental illness. we talked about that and the treatment she was receiving in part two of the exclusive 360 interview.\n\n\n\n(begin videotape)\n\n\n\ncooper: the care she got when she had the psychosis and the depression, how long ago was that? do you know?\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: the diagnosis came a little bit after her birth of her daughter, maybe a few months after.\n\n\n\ncooper: and her daughter is about a year old, is that correct?\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: her daughter is a year, she's one year old.\n\n\n\ni did recently ask her about the medication. i talked to her often about that. and she told me that the doctors told her that she didn't need the medication anymore, because the plan was for her to come off of the medication within a year and they were confident that she was better. they tapered her off her medication and she said she felt fine.\n\n\n\ncooper: do you know for a fact that the doctors recommended she get off the medication, or is that something she told you?\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: no, that's what the plan was. the plan of care for a patient that has depression with psychosis is medication and treatment, and not to have long-term medication like bipolar or schizophrenic. she didn't have history of any type of psych history, so that is why they told her one year. and they did go with the plan.\n\n\n\ncooper: i -- as you said, you -- i mean, i can't imagine the horror of seeing this on television and witnessing this as other people did. do you, amy, have questions about those final minutes and how police responded?\n\n\n\ni mean, you said you want to find out what happened. what aspect in particular do you want to look into?\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: we have a lot of questions. i'm sure, as a lot of viewers when you read the information you see what the media is reporting, it just doesn't add up. and personally, i feel that, you know, as professionals, there has to be another way instead of shooting and killing an individual. i do feel that there could have been something else that could have been done.\n\n\n\nso our goal is to figure out what happened.\n\n\n\ncooper: what kind of mom was she?\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: she was a great mom. she was very nurturing to her daughter. she's made sure that she got the care that she needed. she spent time with her. she was very happy to be a mother.\n\n\n\ncooper: do you know how your niece is doing now? do you know what's going to happen with her?\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: we don't. we're still trying to find out. we're not sure. we just were told that she's safe.\n\n\n\ncooper: valarie, is there anything else you want people to know about your sister?\n\n\n\ncarey: my sister just totally didn't deserve this, and there are going to be a lot of different stories being told from people who may claim that they know her who don't know her. my sister was a loving mother. she was a law-abiding citizen. she had no political agenda, and she did not deserve to have her life cut down at the age of 34.\n\n\n\ncooper: do you know if when she had episodes in the past, what they centered around or what she would talk about in those cases?\n\n\n\ncarey-jones: she seemed to be overwhelmed, a lot of stress. she had a lot of events occurring in her life. and she was diagnosed with depression with the psychosis. we found out about it. she dealt with that, and there was not moments of her walking around with delusions. that's not what was going on.\n\n\n\ncooper: well, amy and valarie, again, i'm so sorry for your loss and please give my condolences to your mother, as well.\n\n\n\nand i wish you peace and strength in the days ahead.\n\n\n\n(end videotape)\n\n\n\ncooper: before we go any further, it bears repeating, no one can know precisely what motivated miriam carey. that's -- there's a lot we can know about the illness she had and plenty to ask dr. drew pinsky about. he's an addiction medicine specialist and host of hln's dr. drew on call.\n\n\n\nso you hear postpartum depression with psychosis.\n\n\n\ndr. drew pinsky, host, hln's dr. drew on call: yes. yes.\n\n\n\ncooper: explain that.\n\n\n\npinsky: so postpartum depression is a very common condition. it's different than the baby blues. it's very common after people -- a woman's body is flooded with hormones, suddenly let down. they can feel depressed. sometimes it can become a major depression that actually bleeds into a psychotic episode where they hallucinations and delusions.\n\n\n\nthat's different from a postpartum psychosis which is much more uncommon, more associated with bipolar illness in the family history or in the individual history.\n\n\n\ncooper: so postpartum psychosis is different than postpartum depression with psychosis.\n\n\n\npinsky: correct. and in my experience with postpartum psychosis, it's wild. they're wildly psychotic. the last woman i saw with that was throwing water on people because she believed they were on fire.\n\n\n\ncooper: so listening to the sisters, you say -- they are very informed about what their sister was going through.\n\n\n\npinsky: they seem -- miriam's sisters seem extremely well informed about this condition and get exactly what she was dealing with. it has nothing to do with psychology of the individual, although sometimes a lot of stress in those people's lives, but it's not a psychological thing, it's not a personality thing. these are lovely people whose biology has just been thrown completely off by the pregnancy.\n\n\n\ncooper: so when the -- when amy says that her sister -- their treatment was that her sister was going to -- when she got medication that her sister was tapering off and had tapered off under doctor supervision over the course of a year, that makes sense?\n\n\n\npinsky: that makes sense because postpartum depression is usually within that first year window and they usually can come off these medications. and while people make a lot of the fact that she was on medication for schizophrenia and bipolar, yes, those meds are used for that. they're used for a lot of other --\n\n\n\ncooper: so when reporters are saying well, they found medication in her house for schizophrenia and bipolar, the sisters are saying she wasn't schizophrenic, she wasn't bipolar.\n\n\n\npinsky: i think they are absolutely correct. if i had been treating this woman, though, the one thing i would be concerned about, a, that i tapered her too fast to inappropriately early or that my anti-depressants have triggered a bipolar mania because the time, of course, this is a little weird that she became so psychotic over a year after a pregnancy is funny.\n\n\n\ncooper: it does seem clear to you based on what we know and again, there is stuff we don't know in the investigation going on that she likely had another psychotic episode.\n\n\n\npinsky: it's clear. i mean, all this focus on the government. it's very common to people to be psychotic symptoms focused on authority figures, people in the media speaking directly to them, controlling their thoughts or beaming thoughts into their head and take action too. and that makes sense to them in the moment.\n\n\n\ncooper: amy had contact with her sister via text message on monday and said nothing seemed unusual. hard to tell over text.\n\n\n\npinsky: hard to tell over text. people feel -- my experience with postpartum psychosis they feel bewildered. they don't tell people what they are thinking. they sort of they know something is wrong and they are just bewildered by it and they not connecting to reality normally and they can shut off --\n\n\n\ncooper: so someone having a psychotic episode can function, they can get from point a to point b and theoretically she could have driven from new york to d.c. even if she's having psychotic thoughts.\n\n\n\npinsky: no problem, no problem. it certainly isn't the way to manage mental health. how of the do we have to report stories of mental health being inappropriately dealt with and then inappropriate horrible outcome.\n\n\n\ncooper: and again, the stigma that so many place on mental health issues, i mean, the silence that surrounds this, it's something that we -- it is unfortunate we always end up talking about it in the wake of something --\n\n\n\npinsky: yes and the thing that concerns me the most is people will point at somebody's episodes and go there is something wrong with these people when in fact, this is a lovely woman whose brain -- why should we treat conditions above the neck different than below the neck. the brain was misfiring on that day. they have treatments for it. the treatments are good. but we have to enforce them. we have to make sure people follow through on them. and we have to make sure insurance companies allow doctors to use their judgments to do what they need to do.\n\n\n\ncooper: properly medicated and she could have lived -- absolutely.\n\n\n\npinsky: and never have any more trouble with any of this potentially. very sad.\n\n\n\ncooper: yes, very sad.\n\n\n\ndoctor drew, (inaudible). thank you very much. good to have a doctor in the house. for more on the story, go to cnn.com.\n\n\n\nahead, another 360 exclusive. this story will make you feel good about the power of an individual making a difference. the man who faced down some of those angry bikers armed with nothing but quiet courage. he didn't have a weapon. he stood between the bikers and suv driver unconscious on the ground.\n\n\n\nalso tonight, the shutdown acquisitions of game playing and possibly hints of the end game. we'll be right back.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\ncooper: hey, welcome back.\n\n\n\nlate word tonight, the pentagon may be close to announcing a plan to bring up to 400,000 furloughed civilian employees back to work. that's according to dod officials. the announcement could come tomorrow. big progress, if true, after another day of deadlock. president obama on a lunch break with vice president joe biden restating his refusing to negotiating on it or the debt ceiling. house speaker boehner, meantime, lashing out at published comments of an unnamed white house official. listen.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip) rep. john boehner (r-oh), speaker of the house: this morning i get the wall street journal out and it says well, we don't care how long this lasts because we're winning. this isn't some damn game. the american people don't want their government shutdown and neither do i.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: neither do the 5,000 defense contractors that could be out of work if the shutdown continues or the 800,000 federal workers that are furloughed or the kids and parents who won't have access to head start programs.\n\n\n\nthat said, keeping them honest, there is a lot of game playing going on and both sides talk about winning all the time. here is kentucky senators mitch mcconnell and rand paul in that open mic moment wednesday night.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nsen. rand paul (r), kentucky: i think if we keep saying we wanted to defund it, we fought for that, but now we're willing to compromise on this, i think they can't -- i think i know we don't want to be here but we're going to win this, i think.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: there it is. the win word. as for game playing, just exactly what would you call about griping for memorials being closed when you voted to close them.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nrep. randy neugebauer (r), texas: how do you look at them and how do you deny them access? i don't get that.\n\n\n\nunidentified female: it's difficult.\n\n\n\nneugebauer: well, it should be difficult.\n\n\n\nunidentified female: it is difficult, i'm sorry, sir.\n\n\n\nneugebauer: park services should be ashamed of themselves.\n\n\n\nunidentified female: i'm not ashamed.\n\n\n\nneugebauer: you should be.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: people who aren't passing a budget.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: it doesn't cost people money to come here.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: this woman is doing her job just like me. i'm a 30-year federal veteran and i'm out of work.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: the reason you are -- is mr. reid -- unidentified male: no, because the government won't do its job and pass a budget.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: it is congressman neugebauer, by the way, chewing out a park employee telling a person they ought to be ashamed. when we saw that, of course, we wanted to know more. for the past two days we invited that congressman from texas to come on the program and explain why he's lashing out at some low-paid park worker when he is still earning a paycheck and making their money. they have health insurance. we got nowhere on that, by the way. it doesn't seem to want to talk. neither does the cnn producer that caught up with him. watch.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nunidentified male reporter: can you talk to us, please? this is your chance to explain your interaction with the ranger.\n\n\n\nunidentified male reporter: tell us about the park ranger.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: funny how they love being on camera when they are chewing out a park employee but when you actually surprise them with a camera and ask them to explain their activities, he is doing the old i'm talking on the phone thing. i just can't stop and talk.\n\n\n\nno luck there. our invitation, of course, the congressman stands. we will be here all next week. we are not shutdown. we welcome you on the program any time. i will come on early and talk to you.\n\n\n\nagain, publicly, no end to the standoff in sight. the question is, what about behind the scenes?\n\n\n\nchief congressional correspondent dana bash working her sources joins us with the latest.\n\n\n\nso dana, are any negotiations going on anywhere? i mean, is there any movement at all?\n\n\n\ndana bash, cnn senior congressional correspondent: no, that's the short and honest answer. there is nothing going on. the only discussions that are going on are within each party's leadership walls, trying to figure out what their next move is, mostly rhetorically but in some cases, especially looking ahead to the debt ceiling inside republican house speaker john boehner's office trying to figure out how they are going to craft something that maybe could make democrats move off the in negotiation pledge.\n\n\n\ncooper: it is deathly quiet behind you, i got to say. does it look like all of this will end up getting wrapped up together with the fight over the debt ceiling? bash: it does look that way. now what i'm told is that the house speaker has been having those conversations that i mentioned with some of his closest confidence and advisors in the republican caucus and they are trying to come up with a package not about obamacare, they moved off of that in these discussions, but about the economy specifically about the debt, something that can take home to constituents, republicans and not just the tea party right, but also even moderates tell me they feel they need to take something home to say, you know, we addressed the problem with the debt in this country and in exchange for that, did agree to raise the debt ceiling.\n\n\n\nthe speaker is making very clear in private and public, he's not going to do anything that is clean on the debt ceiling. he is not going to do a pass, anything that doesn't extract something with regard to the debt from the president and from democrats.\n\n\n\ncooper: also today the federal government announced a critical part of the obamacare web portal is going to be taken down for a portion of the weekend to try to fix the glitches that were plaguing it. it is pretty stunning that you know, the signature piece that was on the agenda for the obama administration has been plagued by so many problems with their web site.\n\n\n\nthis is, i mean, first of all, this administration when they were running for office, you know, they had a much vaunted online effort, the fact that they couldn't get it together for this signature piece of legislation. what is the reaction on capitol hill?\n\n\n\nbash: as you can imagine, it was sort of a nanosecond before republicans jumped on this. the house speaker, his office put out a statement saying it's an unmitigated disaster, saying it's a system- wide failure much more than glitches and asking how can the administration require people to pay taxes, meaning penalties for not purchasing something on a web site that doesn't work?\n\n\n\nagain, obviously, making the point that they were right, that this should be delayed until things get worked out, kinks get worked out. there is no question that they feel vindicated inside the republican party and you know what? you said it, the fact they are taking this entire system down gives them material.\n\n\n\ncooper: yes, the flip side, of course, is people do have months and months in order to actually sign up.\n\n\n\nbash: that's true.\n\n\n\ncooper: it's not like they are being tact next week or anything, but still, it is -- i mean, i don't know. i assume somebody is getting yelled at from -- who set this whole thing up. dana, appreciate it, thanks.\n\n\n\ndigging deeper, i want to bring, chief political correspondent, candy crowley, and on the phone senior political analyst, david gergen. candy, let me start off with you. so we saw speaker boehner there getting mad and saying this unnamed white house official talked about naming and we saw rand paul talking to mitch o'connell off mic talking about they think they are going to win this and the messaging is right on. i mean, is this game playing? is that what is going on here?\n\n\n\ncandy crowley, cnn chief political correspondent: well, it's messaging. i mean, call it what you want. the amount of work being done in washington to get something settled is inversely proportion to the number of news conferences and times people appeared on camera. so we had nothing but that this week, which means, as dana told you, nothing is happening behind the scenes.\n\n\n\nthis is about jockeying for position while they try sort of internally to figure out in the democratic and republican side what it is they will or won't do. publicly they have been stuck on the same position for a couple of weeks at this point, and i think it's pretty clear it will kind of, this whole conversation, is going to flow into the debt ceiling.\n\n\n\nand i don't think they will have some big old package that comes as a compromise and, you know, a super deal because they've tried that before and it hasn't happen, but again i think dana is perfectly right at some point republicans feel the need if you're going to raise that debt ceiling, which is already at $17 trillion, republicans feel they need to have some cuts, something to take home with them.\n\n\n\ncooper: david, how do you see it? are you surprised the lack of negotiations, the lack of movement?\n\n\n\ndavid gergen, cnn senior political analyst (via telephone): i am. the news is americans are starting to demand negotiations on both sides. the new poll out tonight has 60 percent of democrats -- and 60 percent of republicans saying the house republicans ought to compromise. that's the good news. the bad news is in washington. they are game playing. there is a childish game of pin the tail on the donkey. everybody knows that everybody in washington is getting hurt, who gets hurt the worst.\n\n\n\ncooper: so what does -- i mean, did candy, david talk about compromise. what does a compromise look like exactly?\n\n\n\ncrowley: i don't know because i don't think they know. it's really hard as a reporter to figure this out because the principles are still trying to figure this out. in the meantime, sticking with their positions and they -- the president has said for i don't know how long, i'm not going to negotiate on a debt ceiling. this is money we've already spent.\n\n\n\nyou have an obligation to do this. i'm not going to do it. on the other hand, i think it's going to be difficult as david points out, with public pressure but also administration's responsibility, the debt ceiling is to say here are the following 13 things that will happen that are horrific if we do not raise the debt ceiling.\n\n\n\nand it's going to be difficult going down the line to argue the horrific things will happen if the debt ceiling is raised, but we refuse to negotiate. so i think the pressure is going to be on all of them and everybody sticks to their positions until they don't anymore. cooper: david, do you see where the perimeters of a negotiation would be? what is the give on each side?\n\n\n\ngergen: i think there could be a negotiation, anderson. i think we won't get there until next week. i think the public pressure and anger will rise and financial markets will get rattled and that will put pressure on. i think if the republicans would promise president obama we will not -- we will give you a clean debt resolution. we will not try to dismantle healthcare in exchange. in exchange, we want a short opening of the government, a short continuing resolution for a safe four weeks and then enter serious negotiations about entitlement and tax reform.\n\n\n\ni think that has some promise to it. i do think there is going to be some turn of negotiation before this is over, but it's got to be done within the context of the president not breaking his vow he would not negotiation over the debt ceiling but have a four-week period of six-week period before the shutdown again.\n\n\n\ncooper: david, candy, appreciate it, thanks.\n\n\n\nup next, breaking news, an off-duty undercover new york city police officer was one of the bikers present during the confrontation between bikers and an suv driver. also, the good samaritan, you're going to meet him tonight. he risked harm to himself stepping in to stop angry bikers from attacking the suv driver even more.\n\n\n\nalso, breaking news in nebraska, tornadoes touching down causing extensive damage, the latest on that.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\ncooper: welcome back. some breaking news, we just learned new information about that motorcycle mayhem here in new york. an undercover new york city police officer was one of the bikers on the ride. he allegedly witnessed the confrontation, a biker smashing in the driver's side window of an suv, caught by another biker's helmet cam. the officer was off duty at the time, a member of a bikers club. a source telling our susan candiotti tonight the officer did not intervene to stop the confrontation and did not tell his superiors that he was there until wednesday. it's unclear if he violated police department policy by waiting so long to report it. internal affairs is investigating.\n\n\n\nmeanwhile, police are questioning this man, seen opening the door of the suv before it then takes off on the highway running over someone. they say he is not under arrest, and police tell us they have now identified the biker who used his helmet to smash the window of the range rover and are preparing to arrest him. and they also said that after the window was shattered, the driver was pulled out of the suv, thrown to the ground, beaten and slashed in the face. that part of the attack was not caught on video, but as that violence was unfolding, a neighborhood man who was walking by saw it, knew he had to do something. so he stepped into the street to protect the driver until police arrived.\n\n\n\nhe joins us exclusively tonight.\n\n\n\nsergio, i understand you were on your way to church when you saw what was going down. what did you actually see at first?\n\n\n\nsergio consuegra, hero bystander in suv-biker attack: i saw a friend of mine. as we approach the corner, on 178th and (inaudible), right there, i saw the usv.\n\n\n\ncooper: the suv.\n\n\n\nconsuegra: the suv, i'm sorry, approaching, and i saw the tire (ph) that was in pretty bad shape.\n\n\n\ncooper: one of the tires was actually--\n\n\n\nconsuegra: gone.\n\n\n\ncooper: it was gone.\n\n\n\nconsuegra: it was gone, yes. and i explain to him, listen, maybe this family, maybe they are looking for a place to fix the tire, and suddenly there was (inaudible) of motorcycles coming from all over the place, and stopping the motorcycle and throwing it on the floor (ph) and then rushing in to break the windows of the suv.\n\n\n\ncooper: did you actually see -- because in the video, we see one motorcyclist take his helmet off and use to the break open the driver side window. did you actually see that?\n\n\n\nconsuegra: yes, when he stopped, he took his helmet and started hitting the window of the passenger car. also, there was another guy hitting the other window, and there was another one hitting the back of the usv. i didn't know what was going on, and when i started seeing this, then i saw another one approaching the other door. he opened the door -- i mean, he started breaking the glass. he finally opened the door, and he grabbed the lady in front of the usv -- suv, and he grabbed her by her arms, and he was pulling her out of the car.\n\n\n\ncooper: so there was a motorcyclist who actually was pulling the wife out of the vehicle.\n\n\n\nconsuegra: yes, she started screaming, and then we saw the baby. that's when we started seeing the baby inside the car with her, you know, and everybody started screaming no, no, not the lady, not with the baby, please don't do that. i scream, too.\n\n\n\nso in that moment, i saw a man getting knocked out in the floor, and they started hitting him with the helmet right on the floor.\n\n\n\ncooper: they were using their helmets to hit the driver.\n\n\n\nconsuegra: yes, yes, real hard.\n\n\n\ncooper: about how many people--\n\n\n\nconsuegra: there was a lot of blood all over the place. cooper: was it one person using a helmet or was it--\n\n\n\nconsuegra: no, no, a couple of them, yes. they were big, too. yes, real big, big guys. and that's when like i started thinking i got to do something because nobody is doing nothing, and they are going to kill this family. and basically, this doesn't -- it doesn't sound good to me, i mean, like, i got to do something.\n\n\n\nso i basically, i didn't think about it. i just went inside there, i scream not the lady, and he somehow heard us saying those things. he stopped. so when he stopped, i approached the man, because i saw him almost dead on the floor. so what i did was i confronted these people, and i stood between them and the man lying on the floor, and i say to them, that's it. let her go. let it go, man. that's it. it's done. you know, don't continue doing it. you're going to kill the man.\n\n\n\ncooper: so you were actually standing between one of the people who was hitting the guy with the -- with his helmet and the man on the floor, the driver.\n\n\n\nconsuegra: yes. yes.\n\n\n\ncooper: you stood between them.\n\n\n\nconsuegra: between them, yes, there was many.\n\n\n\ncooper: were the motorcyclists saying anything back to you?\n\n\n\nconsuegra: yes, one of them screaming, say with the helmet on top of him, and he say, no, because -- because i told him please stop, don't -- let it go. and then one of them, a short guy, he say no, because he ran one of us. so i didn't (ph) understood what he was saying. because i didn't know what happened before, you know? before anything else.\n\n\n\ncooper: he was saying that the driver ran over one of the motorcyclists.\n\n\n\nconsuegra: yes, that's what he said, that's what i heard him saying. but when i -- i kept -- you know, i didn't want to talk to him, engage in any -- whatever situation that happened before, so i kept saying the same thing, you know. i stood my ground, and i look at them in they eyes and they look at me. so basically, there was a little tense moment of maybe couple of seconds looking at each other, and they somehow got -- i don't know how they -- they stopped. somehow they stopped.\n\n\n\ncooper: was the driver of the suv who was on the floor, was he conscious, was he saying anything?\n\n\n\nconsuegra: no, no, he wasn't saying anything. he was just lying there bleeding. that's the moment when i turn around and went like this, protecting the family, and i said to myself, i'm not going to move from here until they go, you know? so that's -- that's how they somehow took a picture there. cooper: in new york, oftentimes you see something happening, you just walk away.\n\n\n\nconsuegra: yes.\n\n\n\ncooper: you actually -- you moved toward what a lot of people--\n\n\n\nconsuegra: well, my family -- i have ten kids. and when i saw the lady with that baby, that's when it hit me, and i say i have to do something. even if i take a chance here, even if they hit me or whatever they do, i'm going to have to do something.\n\n\n\nnow in my mind, i try not to confront them. you know, i have the idea of like letting them know that i'm not there to confront them, but to protect the family, to stop it, you know, to avoid somebody getting killed. so that's what i did. so i kept my (inaudible) and hands so they could know that i'm not--\n\n\n\ncooper: you're armed with a (inaudible).\n\n\n\nconsuegra: so that's what you can see in my photo there, so i kept it in my hand, so to let them know that i'm not ready to engage in any, you know, whatever situation there, any fight.\n\n\n\ncooper: you obviously, you know, you didn't see what happened earlier, but given what you saw in that moment of the motorcyclists, do you have any doubt that what they did was wrong in that moment?\n\n\n\nconsuegra: yes, definitely. i mean, like --\n\n\n\ncooper: you're sure it was the right -- what they did was wrong?\n\n\n\nconsuegra: yes, it was wrong. i mean, like, it was like hell in there.\n\n\n\ncooper: as a resident of the city, thank you for what you did, and i want to get your number because if i'm ever in trouble, i want you -- i want to know where you are in the city and i'm going to come to you.\n\n\n\nconsuegra: basically, i just want to say that this type of situation, we have to end.\n\n\n\ncooper: thank you for what you did.\n\n\n\nconsuegra: thank you.\n\n\n\ncooper: an honor to meet you.\n\n\n\nconsuegra: ok. very good.\n\n\n\ncooper: his name is sergio consuegra, and he's a well-known resident in washington heights, and everybody should thank him, because what he did is just something too few people do in a big city like this sometimes.\n\n\n\ncoming up, the woman accused of pushing her husband after a cliff eight days after her wedding enters a plea.\n\n\n\nmore breaking news tonight, tornadoes in nebraska and tropical storm heading for the gulf coast, we'll get the latest from chad myers.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\ncooper: breaking news tonight on a huge weather system impacting the quite. tornadoes are touching down in iowa after hitting nebraska and it's causing blizzard and winter storm warnings in wyoming, colorado. a lot to talk about with chad myers live in the weather center. what is the latest we know about the tornadoes first of all?\n\n\n\nchad myers, ams meteorologist: you know, still on the ground. iowa, still on the ground, cherokee, iowa, i need you to take cover right now. a large violent confirmed tornado on the ground headed to your town. this started in nebraska. here in wayne, nebraska a couple tornadoes and not too far from jefferson and iowa and then this storm fizzled out around hinton.\n\n\n\nanother big storm through sloan iowa, at least missed it by a mile of two and then up here toward cherokee and that's the storm we're worried about now with the confirmed tornado still on the ground. we think of severe weather season as spring because warm air pushes cold air. now, fall is cold air pushing away warm air.\n\n\n\nit's still the clash, the warm and cold. it's snowing in the black hills. it's snowing feet of snow in the black hills, wyoming 24, 46 inches of snow and wind blowing at 40 miles per hour with this storm. so yes, it's a big weather setup. there is warm weather here, severe weather here and tornadoes on the front. south dakota parts of nebraska. it even snowed in boulder, colorado that had the flooding a couple weeks ago.\n\n\n\nconsuegra: crazy. what about tropical storm karen. where is it now?\n\n\n\nmyers: it's stationary and i don't like it what storms get stationary. they can die but spend more time in the water. so it's stopped for now. it's going to turn to the north and eventually on toward the northeast probably toward florida. here is the rub. that's what happens if you see this get stopped and not really make progress.\n\n\n\nit can sit there, spend more time and get bigger. we're expecting this storm to get up toward new orleans and turn to the right like that. there it goes and probably run over pensacola. we have a lot to watch for you. the problem with this is not storm surge or wind for that matter, but if you get a 50 mile per hour wind, anderson, this entire area is soggy, completely soggy. it rained more here than ever before, 50 mile per hour wind and the trees will go whap, millions of trees down.\n\n\n\ncooper: chad, appreciate the update. thanks. we'll watch it all weekend.\n\n\n\npamela brown joins me now with the 360 bulletin -- pamela.\n\n\n\npamela brown, cnn correspondent: well, anderson, an eyewitness says a man set himself on fire at washington's national mall today. the witness says he saw a gas canister near the man and several people used shirts to put out the fire. the man was airlifted to a hospital.\n\n\n\nthe woman accused of pushing her newlywed a husband off a cliff pleaded not guilty today in a montana courtroom today. jordan lynn graham is charged with first and second-degree murder in making false statements. graham and cody johnson were married just over a week when he died on a hiking trail in glazier national park.\n\n\n\nnew york yankee alex rodriguez is suing major league baseball and commissioner bud selig for damages saying they were trying to destroy his reputation and career. they want to prove a-rod was using performance enhancing drugs. he's fighting to overturn his suspension -- anderson.\n\n\n\ncooper: pamela, thanks very much. we'll be right back.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\ncooper: we ran out of time for the ridiculist. that does it for us. piers morgan live starts now. have a great weekend.
(cnn) if you're a white person who thinks racism only hurts people of color, the story behind an empty, abandoned swimming pool in missouri might just change your mind.\n\nthe fairground park pool in st. louis was the largest public pool in the us when it was built in 1919. it featured sand from a beach, a fancy diving board and enough room for up to 10,000 swimmers. it was dug during a pool-building boom when cities and towns competed to provide their citizens with public amenities that promoted civic pride and symbolized a perk of the american dream.\n\nthese public pools, of course, were for whites only. but when civil rights leaders successfully pushed for them to be integrated, many cities either sold the pools to private entities or, in the case of fairground park, eventually drained them and closed them down for good.\n\nthese closures didn't just hurt black people, though -- they also denied the pleasures of the pool to white people.\n\nheather mcghee tells the story of the fairground park pool in her powerful new book, the sum of us: what racism costs everyone and how we can prosper together. mcghee employs the metaphor of a drained, cracked public pool to make a larger point: white refusal to share resources available to all us citizens doesn't just hurt people of color. it damages their families and their future, too.\n\nmcghee has a name for this pain. she calls it drained-pool politics. if you want to know why the us has one of the most inefficient health care systems among advanced nations, some of the worst infrastructure and a dysfunctional political system, blame drained-pool politics, she says.\n\nthose politics are built on a lie that many white americans have bought for centuries: when black or brown people gain something, white people lose.\n\nthe narrative that white people should see the well-being of people of color as a threat to their own is one of the most powerful subterranean stories in america, mcghee writes in her book. until we destroy the idea, opponents of progress can always unearth it, and use it to block any collective action that benefits us all.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nmcghee's book debuted last week at #3 on the new york times' nonfiction bestseller list and is already so popular that her publisher is scrambling to keep up with demand. it comes less than a year after the george floyd protests sparked a national racial reckoning.\n\nbut mcghee's book doesn't just make the familiar white people are voting against their economic interests argument that many of us have heard before. she fills it with personal stories from her life and the people she encountered during three years of visiting churches, union halls and small towns across america.\n\nmcghee's book may soon be regarded as a classic in race literature and the phrase drained-pool politics could join white fragility in the lexicon people invoke when talking about race.\n\nmcghee, a former president of demos, a progressive think tank, recently spoke to cnn about her new book and this moment in america's racial history. our conversation was edited for clarity and length.\n\nhow would you explain to, say, a white trump voter motivated by racial resentment that racism has harmed him?\n\nsupporters of president donald trump in bristol, pennsylvania, on october 24, 2020.\n\nwhen you think about make america great again, that time period was a time when a white guy could walk into a factory and walk out set for life, when college was paid for the government, when a great middle-class house was subsidized by the government, when the minimum wage was high and when taxes were high.\n\nthat formula is a formula that you reject now when given the political choice between a strong middle class and the party that markets to your race but delivers economic benefits only to the wealthy.\n\nyou cite the 2008 housing market crash as a fire that started in black and brown communities but eventually spread to white communities as well. can you cite another example of something that was seen as a problem largely confined to black people that ended up costing white people, too?\n\nthe pandemic itself is an example of a virus that hit the black and brown and indigenous communities first and worse. and then the illusion that it was only happening to blue cities and brown people allowed the trump administration to take its eye off the ball and downplay the risks and turn it into a culture war, an us vs. them where covid support shouldn't go to blue states, which was also signifying brown people.\n\nthat is an example of the fires raging in black, brown and indigenous communities that were disproportionately exposed because of systemic racism. and then nine months later the highest rates are in (heavily white) places like south and north dakota and west virginia and then you realize that our fates are linked.\n\nas you explain, white support for government programs that built up the white middle class actually fell as the civil rights movement blossomed because of a zero-sum approach to politics -- whatever helps black people must hurt whites. when president reagan said in his first inaugural address that government was the problem, was he invoking the zero-sum perspective that you talk about?\n\npresident ronald reagan famously said in 1981: government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem.\n\nhe was. what had government done wrong? when you think about the picture that ronald reagan was trying to paint of government mismanagement and government's poor judgment, you'd already had a decade of the war on poverty, which was an extension of public benefits across the color line -- from it being up until the 1960s largely for white people.\n\nand so there was an image in the white american mind of what business government had gotten into, that they shouldn't have been in it and that they didn't do well. there was a racialized story and the term public had already become degraded and associated with people of color: public housing, and public schools that had already become integrated.\n\nyou think about the ways in which government provided for the common good during the 1930s, '40s and '50s and in ways that built the white middle class. my book includes a section where it lists all the free stuff that the government gave to white families to help them have intergenerational wealth and economic security and how once we began to desegregate, government became stingier and that impacted everybody.\n\nyou said in the book that refilling the pool requires us to believe in government again. how important then is the pending covid relief bill and a new voting rights bill just passed by the house in getting people to believe in government again?\n\nthere are some success stories in the country's pandemic response and in places where the vaccine is being delivered well. here in new york, for example, i got my first vaccine shot and it was air force personnel who were delivering the shots and it was fema that had set up the site and it was on the grounds of a public community college. that is a beautiful thing, seeing our government do its job to help people who absolutely couldn't help themselves.\n\nand that's the kind of sight to we need to see more of so that we can restore our faith in the possibility of what we can do together. the exact counter to that is in texas, a state cut off from the federal government to avoid being regulated, to avoid the kinds of safeguards that would have stopped the power outages, a state government that was totally absent from prevention to mitigation and taking care of its people. that was a very clear example of drained pool politics, of anti-government sentiment being put into policies that hurt everyone. it cost lives.\n\nyou praise the fight for $15 campaign to raise the minimum wage. what did that campaign do right to avoid zero-sum politics, to avoid people using race to divide white and black and brown workers?\n\nprotesters attend a rally for a $15 hourly minimum wage on february 16, 2021, in orlando, florida.\n\nthey talked about it. they explicitly made the idea of racism as a divide-and-conquer tool a part of worker education, a part of the rhetoric, a part of the protest signs. the zero sum is so pervasive in our politics and is part of the right-wing messaging that in order to counter it you have to engage with it head on, you have to call it out. give people a way to recognize it and reject it.\n\ni've heard many political scientists say, though, that the way you sell a policy that helps black or brown people is to make it race-neutral. they say, for example, when obamacare was seen as something pushed for by a black president for people of color, it wasn't popular. but now that it's seen as a program that benefits white people, it's more popular.\n\nlet's be very clear. obama didn't talk about it in terms of race. this is the point. policies -- you can't avoid race. race is the central character in the drama about government and our economy. if you don't acknowledge that and give voters another way of thinking about race, then you're just missing a huge part of the story.\n\nyou write that diversity is the country's superpower. what do you mean?\n\ndemonstrators protest on may 31, 2020, in st. paul, minnesota, after the death of george floyd.\n\nthe research shows that diversity allows groups to think better about critical problems. it is the friction of coming from different backgrounds and looking at issues from different vantage points that creates a productive energy, and we are one of the most diverse nations. there is someone here with a tie to every community on the globe and we could use that to our competitive advantage and yet the us vs them, zero-sum quality that we have is holding back our potential.\n\ndid writing this book and traveling across the us to meet people make you more optimistic or pessimistic about the country's future?\n\ni left my travels much more optimistic because i saw these signs of the solitary dividends in nearly everywhere i visited, in pockets of america where people are crossing liens of race and unlocking that diversity superpower and rejecting the zero sum. that is really exciting to me.\n\nwe're at a moment of awakening in this country where more and more white folks are feeling that they have to relearn and unlearn some of what they've learned. and there's a sense of wanting to change our course, recognizing that we have gone off course as a country and that we have to face up to decisions in order to really have the country we all deserve.
washington (cnn) the republican congresswoman who triggered a surprise call for witnesses in the waning hours of former president donald trump's second impeachment trial has logged a decade in congress -- at times breaking from her party and standing up to trump.\n\nherrera beutler and other republicans briefed on the conversation had confirmed to cnn that trump commented the would-be insurrectionists cared more about the election results than mccarthy. the congresswoman was ready to testify had she been called to, according to her spokesman, but house managers and trump's legal team ultimately agreed to insert a statement from the congresswoman into the trial record, rather than pushing for a deposition.\n\ndespite causing a stir in saturday's proceedings, the moderate republican congresswoman has kept a relatively low profile during her time on capitol hill.\n\nherrera beutler has served washington's 3rd congressional district since 2011 and has held onto her seat for the past decade, being reelected to a sixth term in 2020. she worked as a staffer for washington gop rep. cathy mcmorris rodgers, and she also served in washington's state house for about three years before being elected to congress at the age of 31.

are developing and conflicts are erupting\n\n(cnn) —\n\nwith just a month to go before the first votes for president are cast in iowa and new hampshire, tv audiences are being treated to an onslaught of 30-second attack ads as candidates smear each other with the help of ominous narrators, grainy footage and foreboding music.\n\nyet donald trump, the party's undisputed front-runner for six months, remains the only candidate unscathed so far.\n\nhere's a look at some of the most recent spots.\n\ncruz vs. rubio\n\nted cruz and marco rubio have been tussling for months, first over each other's immigration stances and now over national security.\n\nrelated: as negative ads pile up in iowa, ted cruz plots a bigger footprint\n\non monday, the super pac backing cruz released a new spot to paint rubio, who has been dogged by questions about his senate attendance record, as unserious. using footage from a lighthearted video rubio made, in which he jokingly confuses fantasy football players with presidential candidates of the same name, the attack ad lists various threats against america before cutting to video of rubio discussing fantasy football. the ad is set to run in iowa for two weeks and is intended to blunt any potential last-minute surge by rubio ahead of the caucuses.\n\nrubio, for his part, has been less aggressive going after cruz on the airwaves in iowa, instead devoting his focus to new hampshire. but in stump speeches and interviews, rubio frequently criticizes cruz for his vote to reform the nsa surveillance program, which rubio argues removed a valuable tool from counterterrorism efforts, and has used the vote to characterize cruz as soft on security.\n\nrelated: 2016ers hit the airwaves\n\nand a super pac backing rubio, conservative solutions, released an ad tuesday touting rubio's electability that calls him the one hillary clinton doesn't want to run against, an attempt to tweak cruz over concerns about his general election viability due to his hardline conservatism.\n\nrubio vs. christie\n\ncruz isn't the only candidate with whom rubio is locking horns.\n\nthis week, the florida senator's team released a flurry of attack ads against new jersey gov. chris christie, just as the brash governor is threatening rubio's status as the gop establishment's preferred candidate.\n\nrubio's super pac, conservative solutions, put up two ads in new hampshire, blasting christie over his record in new jersey. the first calls christie obama's favorite republican governor and criticizes his support for an internet sales tax, the common core education initiative and 'liberal energy policies.\n\nthe second ad slams christie for his unpopularity in his home state, and describes his term as governor in five words: high taxes. weak economy. scandals.\n\nchristie's team is hitting back. in a speech monday, he pitched his experience as a prosecutor and governor to new hampshire voters, and argued that challenging times call for someone who has been held responsible and accountable for their decisions, not someone who just changes the next vote if the last one didn't work out. the address was a not-so-subtle dig at congressional rivals such as rubio who, as cruz is all too eager to remind people, changed his position on immigration reform.\n\ncruz vs. long shots\n\nmike huckabee and rick santorum are hoping that strong showings in iowa – where they won the 2008 and 2012 caucuses, respectively – will help sustain their campaigns.\n\nand as they woo social conservatives and evangelicals in the hawkeye state, they're taking aim at cruz.\n\nan ad from santorum's campaign this week seeks to do this by contrasting the former pennsylvania senator's tenure with cruz's. a narrator recounts santorum's achievements before cutting to video of cruz reading green eggs and ham during his 2013 filibuster over obamacare.\n\nhuckabee's supporters, meanwhile, have adopted a sharper tone, with his super pac, pursuing america's greatness, releasing an ad titled two teds. the attack attempts to paint cruz as two-faced about his conservative values, using audio of cruz at a new york city fundraiser saying that fighting gay marriage would not be a top priority of his administration.\n\nthe two republicans' attempts to damage cruz reflect their campaigns' understanding that their best bet at a long-shot run depends on a strong finish in iowa – and that cruz's strength in iowa makes that unlikely. whether or not the attacks help santorum or huckabee, though, they could hurt cruz enough to widen the lane for middle-tier candidates such as rubio and christie.\n\ntrump remains on top\n\nmeanwhile, trump, who overwhelmingly leads the rest of the gop field according to a cnn/orc poll released late last month, has received his share of flak from other candidates and the groups supporting them, even if they've failed to dent his seemingly impenetrable poll numbers.\n\nthe kasich campaign and his super pac, new day for america, stepped up their attacks against trump, releasing a tv spot last month mocking trump's days peddling a name-brand steak line. in november, the group released a spot effectively comparing trump to hitler and the nazis, and the pac is spending $2.5 million in attack ads against the real estate mogul in new hampshire.\n\nmeanwhile, the super pac backing jeb bush, who has tried to position himself as an experienced alternative to trump, called the real-estate mogul reckless and impulsive in a 30-second spot last month. but bush's efforts have had little effect, leading trump to taunt him last week by saying he wasted $40 million.\n\ntrump himself has not issued any attack ads on tv, though he's gone after candidates in short video clips on instagram. but the brash billionaire has vowed to return fire with a flurry of negative ads if he comes under attack.
(cnn) —\n\nthe trump administration took another whack at the affordable care act on wednesday.\n\nofficials unveiled a final rule that will make it easier to obtain coverage through short-term health insurance plans, which don't have to adhere to the law's consumer protections.\n\nthe move would reverse an obama administration decision to limit the duration of short-term plans to no more than 90 days in order to make them less attractive. insurers will soon be allowed to sell these policies for just under a year. they can be renewed for up to 36 months, though that renewal isn't guaranteed.\n\nadministration officials say the short-term plans will provide a cheaper health insurance alternative for those who can't afford to buy coverage on the obamacare exchanges.\n\nwe fully recognize that these products are not necessarily for everyone, but we do think they will provide an affordable option to many, many people who've been priced out of the current market under the obamacare regulations, said randy pate, a deputy administrator at the centers for medicare & medicaid services.\n\nbut patient advocates and health policy experts argue that these policies provide only skimpy coverage and will undermine the affordable care act. other actions the administration has taken this year include making it easier for small businesses to band together to buy coverage and slashing support for a program that helps people sign up for obamacare.\n\nshort-term plans could roil the obamacare market by drawing healthier consumers away from the exchanges and pushing up the premiums for those who remain.\n\nthe plans, which have been available for years and were originally designed to fill a temporary gap in coverage, will likely be cheaper than obamacare policies. but that's because they are allowed to exclude those with pre-existing conditions and base rates on an applicant's medical history, unlike obamacare plans.\n\nhave you ever had a short-term insurance policy? what was your experience? tell us about it here.\n\nalso, short-term plans don't have to offer comprehensive coverage. typically, they don't provide free preventative care or maternity, prescription drugs and mental health benefits.\n\nthey can also impose annual or lifetime limits, meaning they may only pay out a set amount – often $1 million or less – leaving the policyholder on the hook for the rest. and, unlike obamacare policies, they don't have to cap consumers' cost-sharing burden at $7,350 for 2018.\n\nyoung and healthy folks may like these plans because they come with lower monthly premiums. the cheapest short-term policy can cost only 20% of the least expensive obamacare bronze plan in an area, according to the kaiser family foundation.\n\nbut those who actually need care could find themselves having to pay more out of pocket for treatment and medications. in fact, some consumers with these plans have complained that they've been hit with unexpected expenses.\n\nloosening obamacare's rules protecting those with pre-existing conditions also risks a backlash from the public since these protections are among the health reform law's most popular provisions. three-quarters of respondents to a recent kaiser family foundation poll said it is very important that obamacare's rule prohibiting insurers from denying coverage due to a person's medical history remains law, while nearly that many feel the same way about banning insurers from charging sick people higher rates.\n\nthe administration's short-term plan proposal was widely criticized by patient advocacy and hospital industry groups, saying it could leave people without coverage when they get sick. the two major insurance industry associations also expressed concerns about expanding the availability of these plans. in april comments to the centers for medicare & medicaid services, the insurer groups said that doing so could destabilize the individual market and cause premiums to rise for those who want comprehensive coverage.\n\ncongress, the administration, and the states should work to stabilize the individual market – not simply create a parallel market that works only for healthy people, wrote the blue cross blue shield association, a national federation of 36 independent blue cross and blue shield plans.\n\nadministration officials said that the plans will contain notices urging consumers to read their policies carefully so they are aware of any exclusions or limitations regarding coverage of pre-existing conditions or health benefits, such as hospitalization, preventative care or prescription drugs. the notices will say that these plans are not required to comply with affordable care act requirements for health insurance and do not meet obamacare's minimum essential coverage requirements, meaning policyholders may not be able to switch to a plan on the exchange outside of obamacare's open enrollment period.\n\nthese policies are different from those offered on the exchange, said james parker, senior advisor to health secretary alex azar. we make no representation that it's equivalent coverage. these policies will not necessarily cover the same benefits or extend coverage to the same degree.\n\nshort-term plans are also very profitable for insurers – more than one-third of the premiums people pay goes toward overhead and profit instead of paying for policyholders' health care, according to data from the national association of insurance commissioners. insurers in the individual market aren't allowed to spend more than 20% on these expenses.\n\nthe trump administration estimates that 200,000 obamacare enrollees will move to short-term plans next year. also, 300,000 people who now buy individual market polices outside of the obamacare exchanges will switch to short-term plans and another 100,000 uninsured folks will purchase them next year. by 2021, enrollment in the individual market will decrease by 1.4 million.\n\nbut other projections run far higher – the urban institute predicts 2.2 million fewer people will enroll in affordable care act-compliant plans when short-term plans become more widely available.\n\nthe administration expects premiums for obamacare plans to increase by 1% next year and by 5% in 2021 because of the shifts.\n\nthe new rule stems from an executive order president donald trump signed in october aimed at boosting competition, giving consumers more choices and lowering premiums.\n\nthat order also spurred the administration to issue a final rule last month aimed at making health insurance cheaper for some small employers. the move allows small businesses and the self-employed to join together based on their industry or location and purchase health insurance through association health plans.\n\nhowever, these plans also don't have to adhere to all of obamacare's rules, particularly the one requiring insurers to offer comprehensive coverage. these plans would likely have lower premiums, but they would also provide fewer benefits – which could leave sicker and older workers out in the cold. also, the offerings could be less attractive to young women if they don't cover maternity benefits.
return to transcripts main page\n\nwolf\n\nhouse prepares to vote on gop tax overhaul bill. aired 1:30-2p et\n\naired december 19, 2017 - 13:30 et\n\nthis is a rush transcript. this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\n\n\n[13:30:00] david drucker, cnn political analyst: one of the challenges that the republicans face is to convince the right voters in the right places and the 2018 battle grounds that this is good for them. specifically, suburban voters in upscale communities that like tax cuts and worry that the provisions are going to hit them in the wallet. that's the work republicans have cut out for them. when i talk to them privately, they understand what they are facing. publicly. they are buoyant because it's a big win for the president and for them considering where they started with a failed effort to repeal and replace obamacare.\n\n\n\nwolf blitzer, cnn anchor: our new poll, you know this well, mark, has the president's job approval number is around 35 percent right now. that's a historic low in modern times at this stage, first year of a new president. it's surprising only because the economy seems to be doing so well. look at the stock market and the unemployment and the growth. things are moving well in the economy, but his numbers have sunk.\n\n\n\nmark preston, cnn senior political analyst: gangbusters in the economy. you can look at his approval rating at 35 percent and lay the blame squarely at the doorstep of the white house. he decided to be a divider and not a uniter. he is more focused on his supporters and trying to make them happy. look at the tax cut. this is a republican bill. this was crafted by republicans on capitol hill and if you go deep into the numbers. 77 percent of them support this bill. he is not concerned about what the democrats or independents are thinking. he is more concerned about thinking i want to please those who got me to the white house.\n\n\n\nto your point, how can he go into the new year with a 35 percent approval rating. pew's rating was 32 percent. he needs to change a little bit. i don't think he is going to do that. he is so combative, and he has a good chance of losing one or both chambers.\n\n\n\nblitzer: a.b., why are the numbers so low when the economy is moving along very nicely?\n\n\n\na.b. stoddard, associate editor & columnist, realclearpolitics: people are pleased with the economy, but they are upset with president trump about other things. mark is right. he plays to a 35 percent portion of the country. he spends a lot of energy on culture wars and trying to get nfl players fire and tries to distract away from the subjects that everyone has bipartisan support in the '80s and '90s on infrastructure. he rarely talks about policy and how republicans are going to save the day and democrats are obstructionists. he had a chance to be more popular than on election day. he could have moved to the middle, but he didn't do it and continues to enjoy this game of everything being a base play.\n\n\n\ndrucker: plus, the low expectations everyone had for him and his policies are more popular than he is conceptually. that's a total reverse from obama. people liked obama, but not so much his policies. he never moved away from a campaign. whether it be a twitter or periodic campaign rallies. he goes after the democrats like we are in the middle of a campaign. he is planning to engage in more of that if republicans will have him. it will be difficult for the president to ever be in a different political situation than now. republicans will need heavy turnout and enthusiasm. we will have seen all that was with the democrats.\n\n\n\nblitzer: are you surprised, david, with the conservative leader, mark meadows, the freedom caucus member, how uncomfortable they are in voting for a bill that is going to significantly raise the national debt?\n\n\n\nhold that thought for a moment. nancy pelosi, the democrat minority leader, is speaking. i want to listen in briefly.\n\n\n\nrep. nancy pelosi, (d-ca), house minority leader: -- on 86 million middle class families and they have tried to present the delusion that it's a middle-class tax cut. is there justice in the bill that has a breathtaking 83 percent of its benefits to the wealthiest 1 percent of americans? eight-three percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent. is there justice in a bill that explodes the national debt to give the wealthy and well connected a break and sticks the debt with our children? is that justice? i didn't think you thought so. i wish our republican colleagues would join us. this gop tax scam is simply theft. monumental brazen theft from the american middle class and from every person who aspires to reach it. the gop tax scam is not a vote for jobs. it is to install a nation. it does violence to our founders and disrespects our men and women in uniform who are a big part of our middle class. it betrays the future and betrays the aspirations of our children. it demands, it morally demands a no vote from every member of this house of the people.\n\n\n\nwith that, i yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n\n(applause)\n\n\n\n[13:35:28] unidentified congressman: gentleman from texas.\n\n\n\nblitzer: that's nancy pelosi giving the democratic view. and you heard her say this is monumental theft what the republicans are about to do. monumental theft.\n\n\n\nlet's get back to what i raised with you, david. the uncomfortable nature of these conservative republicans, deficit hawks and voting now for legislation that will dramatically increase the nation's debt.\n\n\n\ndrucker: my general rule of thumb, wolf, is the party that cares about the debt and deficit doesn't have the power to spend any money. when you have the power, you have to make choices. what is notable here, we heard nothing for eight years, but the republicans speak against president obama and all the debt he was racking up. republicans were faced with a choice and they give the compromise and they govern and show faith in the philosophy that we needed tax reform and it will generate economic growth that will take care of that deficit. or they can fold and have nothing to show with the complete control of government and not show they believe their own rhetoric and they made a choice.\n\n\n\nblitzer: it was a disruption in the gallery in the house of representatives. they were about to evict folks who are protesting. that slowed things down.\n\n\n\npaul ryan, the speaker of the house, he will be the final speaker before the actual rollcall begins. we will watch that closely.\n\n\n\nnot a surprise, mark, that there has been disruptions.\n\n\n\ndavid, finish your thought before i interrupted you.\n\n\n\ndrucker: republicans had to make a choice. were they going to take tough votes and govern and pass something imperfect that is the only legislation that passes on anything or will they make the perfect the enemy of the good? it's a cliche, but if you need to pass something being you need to make a choice. the house freedom caucus which disrupted the republican house majority's ability to do anything when president obama was in power after the health care failure understood he was going to be either a session of failure with nothing to show for it or have to ban and compromise with their own principals and do something and hope it worked out.\n\n\n\nblitzer: i understand that you have a compromise to get things done.\n\n\n\nfor years, mark, the conservative republicans are saying you have to pay for these cuts and there is not going to be an increase in the nation's debt. we are not going to force our children and grandchildren to pay for what we are doing right now.\n\n\n\npreston: short-term memory. they are in power and feel like they can get something done. in many ways the logic behind allowing this bill to go through in ballooning the deficit is very similar to the idea of let's just support donald trump even though we don't necessarily agree with him or like him, but we will get behind him. the reason being is they see him in the vehicle to get something done. they are now at the water's edge on this tax cut. they are going to get it through. politically, heading into next year, the tax cut doesn't necessarily generate enthusiasm. it is going to generate enthusiasm with liberals, who will try to lose it going into november.\n\n\n\nblitzer: the mid-term elections are coming up soon.\n\n\n\nwhat do you make of the notion that you hear from the democrats. once this passes, it is going to pass and the president will sign it into law. the next step will be what the president adamantly opposed doing during the campaign, cutting entitlement spending, social security and medicare and medicaid. stoddard: wolf, i find it hilarious. in a mid-term election when the\n\n\n\nparty is divided, and they face head winds and wave numbers, they are going to after passing a deficit fund and tax cut make it up to the freedom caucus bypassing the entitlement reform. these mean republicans cut your entitlement programs that you paid into and i'm never going to do that. they have enough trouble getting through the week without fighting with president trump or each other. the idea that they will get grannies pushed off and when they wonder how they will find the support to turn enough voters out i think is the craziest thing i have heard this entire year.\n\n\n\n[13:39:50] blitzer: especially going into an election.\n\n\n\n[you heard mark meadows, the congressman, head of the freedom caucus, just tell us that what they would like to do, the president is adamantly opposed, and they cut the rate of growth on social security, medicare and medicaid.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nblitzer: not necessarily cut the bottom line. is that something --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ndrucker: i'm going to laugh because the house freedom caucus used to call that a fake cut that didn't do anything about the problem. i will say this. at end of speaker ryan's press conference, he went on to talk about the opportunity he sees in the first part of next year. politically it will be way too difficult, and president trump won't want to go there. they might want to make an attempt to do this around welfare reform and republicans don't haven't gotten behind before.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\npreston: we use words like entitlement reform, but for everybody out there in tv land, they are saying we will cut back on your social security and that's what they are talking about. they are talking about taking something away. that's why we haven't seen it.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nblitzer: if you listen to the conservatives, that's where the money is. so much of the federal budget --\n\n\n\ndrucker: absolutely where the money is. they will never address the debt and deficit problem if they don't do it. these seniors would be impacted or believe they would. they tend to vote republicans. why they are going to take a chance and scare them off i have no idea. i don't think for that reason that anything major will happen.\n\n\n\nblitzer: a.b., how did they do it in the senate. two or three or four or five senators who had serious concerns, but all of a sudden, once the house passes it, there will be a debate. it will pass. mike pence is there and if there is a tie, and i suspect there won't be, he is the president of the senate and he can break the tie. the president may get this bill even though there were a handful of republican who seriously thought of killing it.\n\n\n\nstoddard: the tax reform is different. it's a signature policy prerogative going back decades and they waited to get a republican president to do this. on health care the debate shifted. the trump voter who helped him get into office and medicate expansion and they have shown this as popular. they couldn't repeal it. the moment this is signed, they will start fighting about cost cutting and daca and they will fight against. not one of the senators wanted to be the one to invoke the vote. it was too much of a republican goal.\n\n\n\nblitzer: they did it on repealing and replacing obamacare, but they are refusing to do it on this.\n\n\n\nstoddard: tax reform is the goal. they never meant to cut taxes for the middle class. they've wanted tax cuts for the wealthy for a long time. this is a goal.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ndrucker: -- told a bunch of us today, republicans were put on this earth to support tax cut bills. that's why this was a little easier.\n\n\n\nblitzer: we are waiting to hear from paul ryan, the speaker, and the rollcall will begin.\n\n\n\nwe will continue our extensive coverage after this.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[13:46:49] blitzer: the speaker of the house, paul ryan, now addressing the house floor in advance of the rollcall on the tax plan.\n\n\n\nrep. paul ryan, (r-wi), speaker of the house: all of the members and the staff of the ways and means committee for all their hard work in putting this bill together. i want to thank them for this.\n\n\n\n(applause)\n\n\n\nryan: i want to personally thank one of my predecessors, dave camp, who did a lot to help get us where we are.\n\n\n\n(applause)\n\n\n\ni want to, most of all, commend and express my profound admiration to the architect of this measure, chairman kevin brady.\n\n\n\n(cheering)\n\n\n\n(applause)\n\n\n\nryan: his endless patience and his persistence and his great demeanor have seen this through and gotten us to where we are today.\n\n\n\nmy colleagues, this is a day i have been looking forward to for a long time. we are about to achieve really big things. things that the cynics have scoffed at for years, decades even. ideas that have been worked on so long to help hardworking americans who have been left behind for too long. today, today, we are giving the people of this country their money back.\n\n\n\n(applause)\n\n\n\nryan: this is their money after all.\n\n\n\nmr. chairman, the speaker of the house is not out of order.\n\n\n\n(shouting)\n\n\n\n(gavel)\n\n\n\nunidentified congressman: the chair knows this contravention of law and against the rules of the house, the sergeant at arms will identify the person or persons responsible and have them escorted from the house chamber before proceedings will resume.\n\n\n\n(no audio)\n\n\n\nblitzer: you notice since there is a disruption in the gallery, they cut the audio but, apparently, they just restored it.\n\n\n\nunidentified congressman: -- guests of the house and any manifestation of approval or disapproval of the proceedings in the house are in violation of the rules of the house.\n\n\n\nthe chair recognizes the gentleman from wisconsin, the speaker of the house.\n\n\n\nryan: i have to remind my colleagues and the speaker that my minute can last for as long as i want it to last.\n\n\n\n(laughter)\n\n\n\ni'm just saying.\n\n\n\nas i was saying, mr. speaker, today, we are giving the people their money back. the bottom line is the typical family making the median income in america will get a $2,059 tax cut next year alone.\n\n\n\n(applause)\n\n\n\nryan: what this is, is real relief for families who are living out their paycheck to paycheck, struggling to make ends meet. you know they hear about the economy getting better. they turn on the tv and they see the stock market going up, but now we need to make sure these people in our communities and our country who are struggling see their own personnel economy getting better. that's what this is all about.\n\n\n\n[11:49:18] we have to understand times are tough for a lot of people in our country. today, this is about how much better things can be. this is about more jobs, fairer taxes. it is about bigger paychecks. it's about faster growth and upward mobility. it's about a strong economy that makes all of us stronger and healthier. those are the effects. those are the benefits of tax reform. here is the heart of it. and here is why this is so vital that we do\n\n\n\nthis. here is what it speaks to in what i truly believe is a generational defining moment for this nation. our tax code is so broken, that it undermines the very thing that makes our nation exceptional in the first place. it punishes hard work and discouraging our entrepreneurial spirit, limits our own people. when americans see good jobs go away, when americans wake up and see companies going away, they wonder if we have lost something bigger.\n\n\n\nthe mission that drives us here today is to restore this beautiful american idea. what is that idea? that the condition of your birth does not determine the outcome of your life. you can work hard, play by the rules, get ahead and make a better life for yourself and even better one for your kids. it's that sense of possibility.\n\n\n\nwe want people to be free to strive, to make the most of their lives. we want a country with the resilience to endure and tackle all of its challenges.\n\n\n\nmr. speaker, economic growth and job creation will not solve all of our problems, but it will help make all of our problems much easier to solve. this is the direction that we are choosing here today. because we know exactly where the status quo leads us. for years, the powers that be have blocked and stone walled reform under the umbrella of an arrogant, condescending and ideology. an ideology that makes us accept less in our lives. view in the world that sees life in the economy as zero gain. your gain comes at a loss, therefore, we can't do it.\n\n\n\nlook at where this got us. the worst recovery since world war ii. flat wages, and an economy limping along. stagnation is a breeding ground for a class based society where elites predetermine the outcome of our lives. they will tell you this. just hand over more freedom to the bureaucrats and they will figure it out. they know more. we'll be ok. hand over more of your hard-earned dollars to the irs and it will be ok. there is your scam right there.\n\n\n\nwe know, given the opportunity, there are no limits to what our people, our fellow citizens, our brothers and sisters can do. yet, for years now, this tax code has been skewed to the well connected, full of special loop holes. meanwhile, the hardworking family in america has to jump through all the hoops that the irs can muster. we clean out the loopholes so people can keep more of what they earned in the first place because it's their money in the first place.\n\n\n\n(applause)\n\n\n\nryan: no special favors, just basic fairness.\n\n\n\nreform means simplification, too. nearly nine out of 10 americans will still be able to do their taxes on the form the size of a postcard. that is amazing.\n\n\n\n(applause)\n\n\n\nryan: and given the opportunity, there are no limits to what our workers and our entrepreneurs can do. yet, while the world has changed, while the world has become more competitive, closer, smaller, our tax code has not. instead of leading, we have been falling behind to the point where we now are the worst in the industrialized world how we tax our businesses. we tax our businesses a whole lot more than our foreign competitors tax theirs. they win, we lose. that's not fair. it is basically open season for our competitors to come in and take our jobs overseas under the current tax code.\n\n\n\n[11:55:12] reform means we go from back of the pack to the front of the pack. so instead of the slow growth that we have been going through for years, we want to get back to real sustained economic growth. we want to build an economy where there is more demand for higher paying jobs. that's the whole purpose of all this. make sure people can grow up and reach their potential. make sure the jobs are there to give people the opportunity to reach their potential. this is why we are doing this. this is without question the single most thing we can do to, once again make america the best place to do business.\n\n\n\nyou know, there is more just than that in this bill. with this bill, we are finally doing by repealing the individual mandate at the heart of obamacare, we are giving back the freedom to buy the health care that's right for you and your family.\n\n\n\nand finally, we are doing something to put america in the lead. we are doing something historic to develop our own energy resources. some people have been working here since i've been in the second grade on this project.\n\n\n\n(laughter)\n\n\n\nafter decades and decades in this chamber, we are opening up a small, non-wilderness area of the alaska wildlife refuge for responsible development. it is the most-ambitious step in years to secure our own energy future.\n\n\n\nthis is one of the times to take a step back. let's take a minute, collect ourselves, and step away from the noise. we talk a lot in these jobs about turning points. there is no doubt that we are at one of those turning points right now. and this one will determine the kind of country we'll have this century. but too often, we have seen before how doubt creeps in, how the tyranny of short term thinking takes over and history fails to turn. there is, after all, a reason this has not been done in 31 years. this really is a generational- defining moment. and let's let this generational defining moment be defined by optimism, not fear. not the doom and gloom we have become so familiar with.\n\n\n\nthis is our chance. this is our moment. let's turn at this turning point. let's reclaim the principles that have guided us, so this beautiful story of the american ideology is passed onto the next nation, a nation more united, more confident, more prosperous.\n\n\n\nand, mr. speaker, more free.\n\n\n\npass this bill! i yield.\n\n\n\n(cheering)\n\n\n\n(applause)\n\n\n\nblitzer: speaker of the house, paul ryan urging his colleagues to pass the tax cut legislation. the rollcall will now begin\n\n\n\nlet's get a quick thought.\n\n\n\na.b., what do you think?\n\n\n\nstoddard: paul ryan has worked on this his entire career, so it's personally a huge day for him, particular, they are reporting that he is considering stepping down at the end of this cycle as speaker. and it was a really, a moment of leadership for him, not only this policy goal, but that speech was very aspirational and positive. a different tone.\n\n\n\ndrucker: since the republicans won back the house in 2010, they have not had a moment of accomplishment like this. so it's a very big deal for them. the challenge now is to sell this politically to the voters. and they do have a bit of an uphill

generational defining moment. i would argue that happened back when president trump was sworn into office. he talked about optimistic and we shouldn't live in fear. i would argue the country is living in fear right now. not necessarily because of paul ryan but because of the leadership in the white house. and republicans have a lot to do, as do democrats, in the new year to try to restore trust.\n\n\n\nblitzer: i can only imagine how president trump will respond once the house and senate pass, he has the legislation, 570 pages, on his desk and he signs it.\n\n\n\nstoddard: it will be triumphant. they've been very frustrated all year to repeal and replace obamacare. they needed to win. it's a big one. and the president is a salesman. he's going to call it a middle-class and go on and on. this is a big accomplishment and a big rescue for them.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nblitzer: and it is a big accomplish. they were desperate to get a major legislative win. they are about to get

(cnn) president donald trump complained that he is treated unfairly. he touted his tax cuts. he told his usual lie about how he is the one who got the obama-era veterans choice program passed into law. he told a story about how he had never been booed before 2015. he said, three times, that his wife is very popular.\n\nthe coronavirus crisis has prevented trump from holding his signature campaign rallies. so he has turned his daily white house coronavirus briefings, like the one on sunday , into a kind of special spinoff of the familiar trump show -- replete with all the usual misinformation, self-promotion and potshots.\n\ntrump's marathon monday briefing ran for more than 100 minutes.\n\nlike his arena addresses, his appearances in the briefing room tend to follow a rough formula. here's what they usually involve.\n\ninaccurate progress reports\n\ntrump has tried to announce some good news at the beginning of every briefing. but many of his claims of progress have been incorrect.\n\nfalse, dubious or questionable medical claims\n\ndr. anthony fauci, director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, has repeatedly had to correct or dispute trump's claims about medical matters -- though fauci says he is fundamentally on the same page with trump.\n\ntrump has touted chloroquine, a medication used to treat malaria and other illnesses, as likely effective against the coronavirus -- claiming that there is very strong evidence. fauci has noted that the evidence is anecdotal. trump has claimed we already know that if things don't go as planned with the use of chloroquine, it's not going to kill anybody. fauci has said , there are no proven safe and effective therapies for the coronavirus.\n\nfauci, who was not present for sunday's briefing, told the journal science that he knows trump makes incorrect statements at the podium, but i can't jump in front of the microphone and push him down. instead, fauci said, he works behind the scenes to try to get trump not to repeat the inaccuracies.\n\ntrump did amend one of his claims. after declaring at saturday's briefing that people should use very good liquids to sanitize masks and re-use them -- though n95 masks are approved for a single use only -- he acknowledged sunday that some aren't really set up for re-use; you throw them out.\n\nfalse pronouncements that this was all unforeseen\n\ntrump's pre-coronavirus speeches included claims that the united states is in unprecedentedly good shape. now, trying to defend his coronavirus response, trump has used the briefings to insist that nobody expected a situation as bad this -- even though people did.\n\nit's something that nobody expected, trump said of the crisis, though experts and us intelligence agencies had warned for years about the risk of a pandemic.\n\nnobody in their wildest dreams would have ever thought that we'd need tens of thousands of ventilators, trump said, though a 2015 study by government disease experts estimated that the us would need as many as 60,000 additional ventilators to deal with a severe flu pandemic.\n\nmedia-bashing\n\ntrump said at the march 14 and march 16 briefings that much of the media had been very fair in its coronavirus coverage. but he has used other briefings as a vehicle for his long-running effort to undermine the credibility of prominent news outlets.\n\ntrump has denounced fake news and corrupt news. he has called a reporter's question nasty. he has called another reporter a terrible reporter. he has criticized the washington post and the wall street journal.\n\ntrump has singled out one outlet for praise: one america news network, a television outlet even more fawning than fox news.\n\nvague economic cheerleading\n\ntrump's rally scripts included a list of positive economic statistics. now that those numbers have been rendered obsolete by the virus, trump has turned to reminding americans that the economy used to be thriving -- and making vague pledges that things will be just as prosperous, or even more so, once the virus is gone.\n\ntrump has chosen not to warn americans about economists' dire forecasts for the coming months. instead, he has assured people that the economy can recover very, very quickly.\n\nit's too bad because we never had an economy as good as the economy we had just a few weeks ago. but we'll be back, and i actually think we'll be back stronger than ever before, because we learned a lot during this period of time, he said on thursday.\n\nafter declaring sunday that i think it's going to skyrocket, he conceded that he isn't certain: and i guess you really have to say, 'who knows?'\n\nan empathy shortage\n\ntrump's emphasis on good news, or supposed good news, has been coupled with a refusal to spend much time addressing the bad news. trump has left it to others to discuss the coronavirus death toll and the number of positive tests.\n\nasked what advice he has for people who have lost their jobs or are afraid they would the next day, trump said, well, what they do right now is keep receiving their paycheck, and hopefully their companies are going to be in a very strong position. if people do lose their jobs, he added, we have unemployment, we have checks, we have a lot of things happening, a lot of very positive things.\n\nasked whether the well-connected, such as nba players, should be able to jump to the front of the line for coronavirus tests, trump said no, but perhaps that's been the story of life.\n\nself-promotion, complaints of victimhood\n\nas he does at his rallies, trump has mixed boasts about his own performance with cries that he has been mistreated.\n\ntold that doctors were saying they were unable to obtain critical supplies, trump said , many doctors -- and i've read many, many doctors -- they can't believe the great job that we've done. he said governors are loving what we're doing. after complimenting the head of the food and drug administration for working as hard or harder than anyone on the team, he added , other than maybe mike pence, or me.\n\ntrump, who said he does not take any responsibility at all for the slow pace of coronavirus testing, has used the briefings to cast fault on multiple people and entities.\n\nhe has blamed the media and an inherited  very obsolete system  over the testing problems. he has blamed china for not warning the world sooner about the virus. (fauci has acknowledged that trump has exaggerated how long ago china could have possibly issued a warning). he has criticized people who are suing him over various matters, since it's unfair, and noted that he donates his presidential salary even though nobody said thank you.\n\ntrump being trump\n\ntrump has used the guaranteed television time afforded by the briefings to sneak in some of his favored campaign messages -- about how he supports strong borders, about how veterans have given high marks to their health care under his leadership, about how republicans are fully backing pre-existing conditions (even though, in reality, they have repeatedly tried to weaken those protections in obamacare, and are asking the courts to overturn obama entirely).\n\nas he does at his rallies, though, trump has also rambled about things mostly of interest to him.\n\nwhen asked what should be done about the olympics, he has raved about japan's beautiful new olympic stadium. he has complimented the stainless steel in the operating rooms of the hospital ships. asked if he would commit to refrain from taking government bailout money for his own properties, he gave a non-answer in which he managed to boast about his wealth.
president donald j. trump talks on the phone in the oval office receiving the latest updates from capitol hill on negotiations to end the democrats government shutdown, saturday, january 20, 2018, at the white house in washington, d.c.\n\nus president donald trump speaks before signing trade sanctions against china on march 22, 2018, in the diplomatic reception room of the white house in washington, dc, on march 22, 2018. / afp photo / mandel ngan (photo credit should read mandel ngan/afp/getty images)\n\nfile- this jan. 3, 2018, file photo shows the capitol in washington. the government is financed through friday, jan. 19, and another temporary spending bill is needed to prevent a partial government shutdown after that. (ap photo/j. scott applewhite, file)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nfederal government shutdowns in the us are not just about money. they often happen when one political party feels that threatening to shut the federal-funding spigot is the best leverage to use in a political battle.\n\nand in recent years, the parties have battled over a lot of things. this latest one was no. 19 since 1976.\n\nthe causes of some them may surprise you.\n\njanuary 19-22, 2018\n\nimmigration\n\nthe most recent impasse hinged on the ongoing debate over immigration. democrats voted against a bill to fund the government because they want a fix for daca, the program allowing some young illegal immigrants to remain in the us, before it expires in march. republicans want border security enhancements, including funding for president trump's border wall, before they'll agree to help fix daca. after a shutdown of three days, senate democrats reached a compromise with senate republicans to reopen the government and keep it funded through february 8 in exchange for a promise to deal with daca before then.\n\nobamacare and the debt ceiling\n\noctober 1-16, 2013\n\nphoto: getty images\n\nrepublicans wanted to a way to get rid of obamacare (some things never change) so they refused to back any spending bill that didn't defund the affordable care act. democrats balked at that, of course, and a 16-day shutdown was on. this shutdown got tied up with the debt ceiling, which needed to be raised at about the same time, so the gop used that as leverage, too. this one ended after the dems stayed united, while the republicans essentially gave in and accepted a small obamacare concession to save face.\n\nfederal spending\n\ndecember 16, 1995-january 5, 1996\n\nthe longest shutdown in us history was, surprise, actually about money. the gop-led congress clashed with democratic president bill clinton over the level of federal spending. the republicans refused to ok a spending bill because they wanted the democrats and the white house to, among other things, agree to deep cuts in medicare and medicaid. plus the gop wanted the white house to rely on congressional budget office figures for their budget calculations, which weren't as optimistic as projections from the administration's office of management and budget. the shutdown ended after 21 days, with clinton bowing to a key republican demand: submitting a seven-year balanced budget plan scored by the congressional budget office.\n\nnovember 14-18, 1995\n\nphoto: afp/getty images/file newt gingrich\n\nthe first of the two shutdowns that occurred during bill clinton's presidency started after clinton vetoed spending bills from the gop-led congress. clinton was unwilling to accept a republican plan that would balance the federal budget in seven years by cutting taxes; slashing medicare, medicaid and welfare benefits; and trimming hundreds of other federal programs. but there was another, more bizarre beginning to this one. house speaker newt gingrich said he sent clinton a tougher spending budget because he was forced to exit from the back of air force one while traveling with clinton during an international trip. a short-term budget deal and a promise for more negotiations ended this impasse after just a week.\n\noctober 6-8, 1990\n\nthe first president bush was so serious about taming the national deficit that he vetoed a spending bill that didn't curb spending and raise revenue. the shutdown began after the house failed to override his veto. the shutdown ended after three days when a short-term spending bill was approved along with a promise by lawmakers to find more areas for deficit reduction.\n\ncontra aid\n\ndecember 19, 1987\n\nphoto: afp/getty images president reagan\n\npresident reagan wanted to continue aiding the contra rebels in nicaragua, but congress, run by democrats, opposed the plan. reagan had threatened to veto a spending bill unless the aid was included. the democrats also waged a fight to save the fairness doctrine, which required broadcasters to offer opposing viewpoints on the air (although by the mid-'80s, federal agencies had stopped enforcing it). there was a brief, one-day shutdown before reagan got his wish: the democrats gave up on the fairness doctrine and agreed to send millions in nonlethal aid to the contras.\n\naircraft carrier\n\noctober 1-11, 1979\n\nphoto: mpi/getty images president carter\n\na shutdown lasting about a week and a half occurred after president carter vetoed a defense authorization bill because it contained funds for a $2 billion nuclear-powered aircraft carrier that he said was a waste. carter wanted congress to rework the bill to cut money for the carrier and provide more funds for research and development and combat readiness. carter later signed the bill, with the nuclear aircraft carrier deleted from the legislation.\n\nabortion\n\noctober 1-12, 1977; november 1-8, 1977; december 1-8, 1977\n\nlegislative battles over abortion led to several government shutdowns in the fall and winter of 1977. the senate wanted to loosen the restrictions on medicaid funds being used for abortion – which were only in cases where the mother's life was at stake – to also include cases of rape or incest. the house was opposed to this. the two sides couldn't come up with a compromise by the end of the fiscal year that september, so there was a funding gap. a temporary spending bill was passed to give the house and senate time to work out their differences, and this cycle would repeat itself until a deal was struck in december 1977 allowing medicaid funds to be used in abortions, including in cases of rape, incest and when the mother's health was at risk.
affordable care act supporters hold up signs outside the supreme court as they wait for the court's decision on obamacare on thursday, june 25, 2015. (photo by bill clark/cq roll call via ap images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nin their first hours in control of the house of representatives, democrats filed a motion to intervene in an ongoing lawsuit that threatens to bring down the affordable care act.\n\nthe petition is signed by new house counsel douglas letter who wrote, the house seeks to offer a defense addressing the same questions of law that the present parties are litigating.\n\nnotably, donald verrilli, who defended the law as former president barack obama's solicitor general and is now in private practice, is also on the brief representing the house.\n\na federal judge in texas last month ruled that the aca is unconstitutional because congress eliminated the individual mandate penalty by reducing it to $0, starting this year. this rendered the mandate itself unconstitutional and the rest of the law therefore cannot stand.\n\nthe trump administration is not defending obamacare, so a coalition of democratic states is appealing the judge's ruling.\n\nthe filing was expected as party's leaders have repeatedly said they would swiftly work to uphold the health care law.\n\nas part of its rules package for the 116th congress, the democrats granted themselves authorization to intervene in the lawsuit that threatens to bring down the landmark health care law. it directed the house's office of general counsel to represent lawmakers in any litigation involving the act and authorizes hiring of outside counsel.\n\nthe house late thursday voted in the rules package, which the majority party – now the democrats – adopts at the start of a new congress.\n\nthe newly empowered democratic leadership also scheduled a vote for next wednesday on a standalone resolution affirming the house's authorization to intervene in the lawsuit. this would put republicans on the record voting specifically for or against defending obamacare and its protections for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nsupporting the affordable care act, including its popular provisions that protect those with less-than-perfect health histories, helped democrats retake the house in the midterm elections in november. since then, the party's leaders have repeatedly said they will swiftly work to uphold the law.\n\nthe move to intervene, however, is largely symbolic. some affordable care act supporters say that democratic lawmakers would be better off passing legislation to address the lawsuit.
anthem vowed thursday to appeal a federal judge's move to halt its planned takeover of cigna.\n\na federal judge in d.c. made the decision wednesday, saying it would violate antitrust law for the second- and third-largest health insurers in the u.s. to combine.\n\nthe deal, valued at $54 billion when it was announced in 2015, would make the combined company the largest health care provider in the nation.\n\nbut if the merger plans fall through, anthem (antx) will owe cigna (ci) a $1.85 billion breakup fee, according to the terms of their agreement.\n\nanthem is determined to ensure wednesday's decision isn't the final word on the issue. the company said in a statement thursday that it promptly intends to file a notice of appeal and request an expedited hearing.\n\nrelated: anthem's cigna takeover bid blocked by federal judge\n\nanthem added that the deal was approved by over 99% of the votes cast by the shareholders of both companies.\n\ncigna said in a statement posted early thursday that it intends to carefully review the opinion and evaluate its options.\n\nanthem has argued that the deal would save health insurance customers over $2 billion in medical costs because cigna customers will be able to access discounts that anthem is able to offer its customers.\n\nin the order issued wednesday, washington d.c. district court judge amy berman jackson wrote that cigna may not be able to offer steeper discounts, but it seeks to keep its customers healthier.\n\nrelated: aetna ceo: we will not expand obamacare in 2018\n\ncigna has sought to differentiate itself with its approach towards reducing costs by increasing health, the judge wrote. for this reason, some customers prefer cigna notwithstanding its discount disadvantage, and there was some testimony from medical personnel that the approach is working.\n\nthe court proceedings also revealed that cigna and anthem aren't exactly on the same page regarding the proposed merger. the insurers have accused each other of violating their agreement terms. testimony from cigna revealed the company is worried about anthem's plans for the company after the merger is executed.\n\nanthem's bid to take over cigna was first announced in 2015. the deal was immediately criticized by regulators and some in the industry concerned it would hike health care prices for americans.\n\nwednesday's decision to halt the merger is the second roadblock a federal judge has put up for an attempted health care merger since the beginning of the year. aetna's plans to takeover humana for $37 billion was frozen by a federal judge last month.
orlando, florida (cnn) republican politicians, media personalities and activists are gathering this weekend in florida for the annual conservative political action conference, an event that could offer an early window into the party's 2024 presidential contest while also amplifying false claims that the 2020 election was stolen.\n\nformer president donald trump will be the star of the show in orlando, delivering a sunday afternoon speech -- one in which he is expected to continue to falsely claim that the presidential election was stolen -- that will mark his first public comments since leaving the white house.\n\nbut starting friday, a medley of potential 2024 presidential candidates are also looking for breakout moments that will launch them toward stardom. their speeches will serve as a gauge of the conservative base's feelings about them as they begin to position themselves for possible runs.\n\nthe race for 2024 will start at cpac, said american conservative union chairman matt schlapp, a chief organizer for cpac.\n\nthe lineup includes some of trump's staunchest allies on capitol hill, including florida sen. rick scott, florida rep. matt gaetz, utah sen. mike lee, texas sen. ted cruz, missouri sen. josh hawley, colorado rep. lauren boebert, arkansas sen. tom cotton and house minority leader kevin mccarthy. and it includes several of his strongest supporters from the states: florida gov. ron desantis and south dakota gov. kristi noem.\n\nit also features several veterans of trump's administration, including former secretary of state mike pompeo, former housing and urban development secretary ben carson and former white house press secretary sarah huckabee sanders, who is running for governor of arkansas with trump's endorsement. trump's son donald trump jr. and his girlfriend and trump campaign aide kimberly guilfoyle are also speaking.\n\nnot on the list of speakers: trump's intra-party critics such as utah sen. mitt romney, nebraska sen. ben sasse and maryland gov. larry hogan. also not appearing are former vice president mike pence, who turned down an invite, and nikki haley, trump's former united nations ambassador who now finds herself isolated after tempered criticism of trump.\n\nschlapp said haley had initially signaled she would address the conference but later backed out of an appearance. haley did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nthis year's cpac is certain to demonstrate trump's firm hold of the gop -- and the conservative base's eagerness to turn trump's falsehoods about election fraud into policy action, as several state legislatures move to impose new voting restrictions. seven panels or speeches at the conference are taking place under the title of protecting elections.\n\nthe events appear to be little more than forums to advance unfounded trump-world allegations that the election was stolen by president joe biden. those accusations were rejected by trump's own attorney general, william barr, as well as dozens of court decisions, in some cases involving trump-appointed judges.\n\nschlapp acknowledged that much of the conference will be devoted to trump's claims about the election. he said it would be better if conference participants also focused on biden's agenda, though.\n\nmy thinking is it's fine to go through the atrocities of the past election, schlapp said. but better to rally folks to stop biden policies.\n\nthe event's theme is america uncanceled, a title that underscores another focus: cancel culture, or conservatives' belief -- amplified since twitter and other social media platforms banned trump in the wake of the deadly january 6 insurrection -- that expressing their views has placed them at risk of backlash.\n\nwhat trump will say\n\ntrump's cpac speech sunday afternoon will serve as his resurgence into the political world , and according to a source familiar with his plans, it is not finished, with advisers still weighing in on how to make the most lasting impact.\n\nsome within trump's circle are advising the former president to focus on 2022 and winning majorities of the house and senate, which are both now controlled by democrats. however, trump and those who have pushed his anti-establishment agenda are instead considering a message without undertones of republican party unity that takes aim at trump's intra-party critics, the source said.\n\nwe are going to war ... but not physically, this source said in describing the sentiment. it's primary season, and it's open season.\n\nbut ultimately, those around him know that the speech that trump gives sunday will depend on what he decides he wants to say when he arrives at cpac, despite what might be on paper in front of him.\n\ntrump is also likely to continue his lies about election fraud.\n\nin the context of needed election reforms, yes, trump senior adviser jason miller said about the former president's plans for sunday's address.\n\ntrump has spent the last several days in meetings at mar-a-lago with republicans who are clamoring to assure him of their allegiance.\n\nrepublican national committee chairwoman ronna mcdaniel, former trump campaign manager brad parscale, former trump housing and urban development secretary ben carson and miller have all been spotted at the former president's florida residence over the past week.\n\nmany of trump's meetings have focused on his political future -- including his strategy going into the 2022 midterms and planning around if he runs for president again, the source said. while trump continues to flirt with a 2024 bid, his focus now is on payback against those he believes crossed him. his advisers are in the process of identifying pro-trump candidates to challenge republican state officials in georgia, wyoming rep. liz cheney, who voted to impeach the former president, and others.\n\nwhile trump continues to take meetings, the source said his inner circle is smaller than in the past -- noting that trump still feels betrayed by those who did not support his lies about election fraud and did not back him after the january 6 riot at the capitol that trump instigated with a speech encouraging angry supporters to march there.\n\none of the ex-president's former advisers questioned cpac's decision to welcome trump back into the spotlight. it may be helpful for trump to return to the stage as he attempts to solidify the republican party and eyes a comeback run for the white house in 2024. still, the adviser argued, trump's return is a setback for the gop.\n\nfor him, yes. bad for the party, the adviser said, adding that it's in trump's nature to continue to peddle his baseless election claims.\n\nhe always faces zero consequences for his actions, the adviser said. why change now?\n\nwhy cpac matters\n\nsince 1974, cpac has grown from a small gathering of a few hundred conservative activists to one of the largest annual political events in the country, regularly drawing thousands of attendees and speeches from top republican politicians.\n\nfor the first time in its nearly 50-year history, cpac will be held outside of the washington, dc, area in orlando. florida has emerged not just as a reliable red state but is the home to trump and two other important conservative figures: desantis and scott, both of whom will have high-profile speaking roles on the conference's main stage.\n\ninterspersed with policy panels and breakout sessions for activists, the main-stage speeches at cpac offer ambitious republicans the opportunity to speak directly to the conservative faithful. ronald reagan spoke at 13 total cpacs, including the very first meeting six years before he became the republican nominee for president.\n\nsince reagan, every gop nominee has spoken at least once to cpac -- including those with strained relationships to the conservative movement, like george h.w. bush and john mccain. the confab can give republican hopefuls a chance to make a first impression or change their perception with the activist base of the party.\n\nin 2000, george w. bush made his first appearance at cpac, winning over the crowd with a speech criticizing outgoing president bill clinton while on his way to winning the gop nomination and then the presidency later that year. twelve years later, during his own successful bid to be the republican nominee, mitt romney touted to the cpac crowd his severely conservative record as massachusetts governor.\n\none key feature of most cpacs is the presidential straw poll, an informal and nonscientific survey of attendees that can be a bellwether for the party -- or, more often, a show of organizing strength. while romney won four cpac straw polls between 2007 and 2012, trump won none of the four pre-2016 straw polls before his own nomination.\n\ntrump's own political career within the republican party began in part at cpac. he made his first appearance there in 2011, introduced by the event's director lisa de pasquale as someone who was thinking about tossing his hat into the ring for the 2012 gop nomination.\n\nthese are my people, trump said as the crowd cheered. this is beautiful.\n\ntrump would not actually run until the next cycle, but his speech in 2011 had all the hallmarks of his 2016 campaign and term in office. he criticized the united states for being the laughingstock of the world and claimed that the leaders of other countries were taking advantage of america. trump stated he was pro-life and against gun control, obamacare and raising taxes. jumping among the day's news items -- high gas prices, the sale of the new york stock exchange to a german company, the somali pirate attacks -- trump boasted he would be able to handle it much better than the current leaders.\n\nhow about the somali pirates? trump said. how simple would that be? give me one good admiral and a couple of good ships, we'd blast them out of the water so fast.\n\nhe even antagonized some of the crowd, telling a vocal group of ron paul supporters in the audience that the libertarian texas congressman cannot get elected.\n\ntrump would return to cpac in 2013, 2014 and 2015 -- always drawing large audiences thanks to his celebrity and his ability to speak the populist language of the activist crowd. he became a big donor to the american conservative union, the organization behind cpac. trump also spoke at the conference every year of his presidency.\n\nironically 2016, the year he won the republican nomination, was the last time trump did not appear at cpac. in the midst of the gop primary season, trump backed out of his cpac slot that year after some activists accused the cpac organizers of being too close with him. instead, he stuck to the campaign trail, including attending a massive rally in orlando.\n\nfive years later, cpac is coming to orlando, practically in trump's backyard. while a number of would-be presidential candidates for 2024 will use the opportunity to make a splash, their speeches will all be the warm-up act for trump's big address on sunday.

if i leave my job now, i think i'll have enough money to live comfortably the rest of my life. so is there any reason i shouldn't stop working and retire? --j.z.\n\nif you think you've got the means and the inclination to call it a career, i say go for it. my only caveat is that, before you do, make absolutely sure that you're not only financially prepared to retire, but that you're also ready to make the social transition from the work-a-day world to retirement.\n\nthe last thing you want to do is hand in your notice at work only to later find that you don't actually have the money you'll need for a comfortable retirement or that you're unable to enjoy your newfound freedom because you haven't given enough thought to how you'll actually live once you no longer have the routine of a job to provide structure to your life.\n\nso before you cut your ties to the workforce, i recommend that you answer the five questions below that make up my are you really ready to retire? checklist.\n\n1. do you have the financial resources you'll need to support you the rest of your life?\n\nthe question is straightforward, but coming up with an accurate answer can be more difficult than you think. for example, a recent study by the boston college center for retirement research found that more than 40% of working-age americans had an unrealistic sense of whether they were on track to maintain their standard of living in retirement, with close to half of that group being overconfident about their prospects.\n\nso how can you determine whether you've got the financial wherewithal to live a comfortable life once the paychecks stop? start by getting an accurate sense of how much income you'll need to cover your living expenses after you retire. the best way to do that is by going to an online budgeting tool like blackrock's retirement expense worksheet. be as accurate as possible, but remember that you can, and should, refine your estimates as you get a better handle on your expenses and spending.\n\nonce you have a figure you're reasonably confident about, you can plug that number, as well as such information as your age, your retirement account balances, the amount you'll receive from social security, pension income, if any, and how long you expect to live in retirement (i'd say into your mid-90s is a decent estimate given today's longer lifespans) into a tool like t. rowe price's retirement income calculator. the tool will estimate your chances of being able to get the income you need for as long as you'll need it.\n\nif you're not comfortable going through this sort of exercise on your own or you'd just prefer having an assessment from a pro, you can always hire a financial adviser to do this analysis for you.\n\n2. have you considered how you'll generate income for retirement?\n\nit's not enough just to be sure that your resources can support you. you also want to have a comprehensive retirement income plan that spells out how you'll actually get the income you'll be relying on to support you throughout retirement.\n\namong the issues you'll need to consider as you create an income plan: how much you'll receive from social security and whether you should you consider delaying claiming your social security to boost the size of your check; how much of your nest egg's value can you withdraw each year without incurring too big a risk of running out of money before you run out of time; and whether you should devote a portion of your savings to an immediate annuity or a longevity annuity, so you'll have a another source of guaranteed lifetime income in addition to social security.\n\n3. do you have health insurance squared away?\n\nalong with housing, food and transportation, health care is one of the largest retirement expenses, accounting for up to 15% of spending on average depending on the retiree's age, according to the bureau of labor statistics' consumer expenditure survey.\n\nif you're retiring at 65 or older, you'll most likely be relying largely on medicare to deal with the medical expenses you'll incur during retirement. if you're leaving your job before that age and don't receive health insurance through your, or your spouse's, former employer, then you'll have to get it on your own. either way, you want to know ahead of time the terms and conditions of coverage and have a good sense of what you'll pay not just in annual premiums, deductibles and co-pays but other out-of-pocket costs as well.\n\nyou can get good overview of medicare -- the types of coverage available under the program; the various costs; what medicare covers (and, just as important, what it doesn't); when you should sign up to avoid penalties -- by going to medicare.gov, the official medicare site.\n\nas you're no doubt aware, things are, shall we say, kind of up in the air when it comes to private insurance these days, what with the (so far, at least, unsuccessful) attempts to repeal and replace obamacare. but you can get an idea of what you might have to pay for coverage, at least for now, by going to sites such as healthcare.gov, healthpocket.com and ehealthinsurance.com. that said, you'll want to stay abreast of the ongoing health-care debate to see whether new developments affect the terms of your coverage as well as what you'll pay.\n\n4. is your retirement portfolio in shape?\n\nin 2007, just prior to the stocks losing more than half of their value during the financial crisis, more than four in ten 401(k) participants age 56 to 65 had in excess of 70% of their 401(k) account invested in stocks, according to an employee benefit research institute report. as a result, many older 401(k) participants saw substantial declines in the value of their nest egg.\n\nthere's no single correct stocks-bonds mix that's right for all retirees (although many tend to keep between 30% and 60% of their assets in stocks). but the idea is that you want to invest enough of your savings in stocks to provide the returns you'll need to maintain your purchasing power over the course of a long retirement, but also enough in bonds to provide some ballast during the market's inevitable periodic setbacks.\n\n5. do you have a plan for how you'll actually spend your time after you retire?\n\nchances are you'll be spending upwards of 30 years in retirement. to make this phase of your life satisfying and meaningful rather than a period of just marking time, you'll need to some lifestyle planning.\n\nthat means giving serious thought how you'll actually live after you do. will you remain in your current home or downsize to something smaller? stay in the same neighborhood or relocate to an area with lower living costs? do you have a circle of friends and family that will keep you socially engaged? have you lined up activities (part-time work, a workout regimen, a hobby or avocation, charitable work) that can help keep you physically fit and mentally alert?\n\nideally, you'll want to think about all these lifestyle issues before you actually retire. the same goes for answering the other questions on the checklist. after all, if you've been saving, investing and planning for a secure and rewarding retirement diligently throughout your career, it would be a shame to drop the ball just when your goal is within reach.
is now the time to buy new shares? one of europe's biggest companies certainly hopes so.\n\ngerman conglomerate siemens (siegy) said monday that it plans to sell shares in its health care division -- siemens healthineers -- in the first half of the year. it will retain a majority stake.\n\nthe unusually named company -- which merges health and engineers -- specializes in imaging and diagnostic equipment used in hospitals. the ipo on the frankfurt stock exchange is expected to value the company between $40 billion to $50 billion. it has over 47,000 employees and annual revenue close to €14 billion ($17.4 billion).\n\nmartin steinbach, a partner and head of ipo services at ey said that general ipo sentiment is quite good as global stock markets recover from a bout of volatility.\n\nthese type of mega transactions are also a signal for other ipo candidates, he said. we call them icebreakers.\n\ndaniel cunliffe, an equity analyst at liberum, said that going public would give healthineers more independence and scope for potential acquisitions.\n\nthat's really why they're doing it. not to exit health care at all, he said. there's a lot of consolidation in the sector.\n\nrelated: idaho thinks it has a better idea than obamacare\n\ncunliffe said the ipo would raise around €10 billion ($12.4 billion) if siemens sells a stake in the neighborhood of 25%. that would make it the biggest initial public offering in germany since deutsche telekom (dtegy) in 1996, according to dealogic.\n\nthe last time that europe saw a deal of its size was rosneft's 2006 listing in london and moscow, and glencore's (glcnf) 2011 debut in london and hong kong.\n\nrelated: the new hotspot for nurse recruitment\n\nthe continent's biggest ipo of 2017 was italian tire maker pirelli, which raised $2.8 billion on the italian stock exchange.\n\nhealthineers says it's positioned for solid growth in the years ahead as it benefits from an aging population, more business in emerging markets and an increase in chronic disease.

(cnn) —\n\nthe house of representatives will vote wednesday for a second time in two days to pass the final version of the gop's tax plan, but not all house members have read it in its entirety.\n\nwhen asked by cnn's alisyn camerota on new day if he had read the full bill, wisconsin republican rep. sean duffy said he had read wide swaths on some and summaries on others.\n\ni've read – i can't say every word, duffy said about whether he had read all of the bill.\n\nthe house initially voted and passed the legislation on tuesday, but because of a specific senate procedure known as the byrd rule, it went through a review before being voted on by the senate. after it was reviewed in the senate, the senate parliamentarian ruled changes would have to be made in order to abide by the procedure.\n\nthe senate approved the final plan overnight on wednesday, and the house's revote is expected to pass around noon wednesday. the passage of the legislation that would overhaul the current tax system is considered as a major republican victory for president donald trump's first year in office, following the failure to repeal and replace obamacare earlier in the year.\n\nduffy explained that because of the complex nature of the subject matter in the bill, he read the summaries to ensure his understanding.\n\nthere's parts of the bill that i can read and understand, duffy said. tax code is very, very complicated. as we are dealing with international companies. on some of those more complicated parts i read summaries so i make sure i understand it. unless you're a tax expert, some of it gets to be very deep. that's why i've chosen to deal with the legislation as i have.

state of the union address on tuesday wherever you are: on tv, desktop, mobile devices, apps, cnngo and more. coverage begins at 5 p.m. et\n\n(cnn) —\n\nsenate republicans are looking for president donald trump to focus on his accomplishments in his first state of the union address on tuesday, but many also said they'd like to hear specifics about issues ranging from north korea to infrastructure.\n\nthe state of the union is: we're safer, we're stronger, and we've gotten a turnaround in the most lethargic economic time in us history, said sen. david perdue of georgia. perdue added that the president is rightly upbeat about a very successful first year in office and will talk a good bit about the accomplishments.\n\ni hope the president lays out that record of achievement that we all work together so hard to produce, sen. ted cruz of texas said, citing tax reform, regulation overhauls and republican judicial confirmations. cruz said priorities for 2018 should be finishing the job on obamacare, and investing in border security.\n\ni believe we should not pass an amnesty bill that creates a path to citizenship for millions of people here illegally, cruz added, a possible reference to comments trump made last week signaling an openness to such a plan for recipients of the expiring deferred action for childhood arrivals programming, which hardline conservatives consider amnesty.\n\nsen. cory gardner of colorado said he expects trump to speak about the success of the tax cuts, and how americans are succeeding, how they're growing their wages, how they're growing their investment opportunities and really, how america's back.\n\nsen. lindsey graham of south carolina called the speech a dramatic moment for trump. but graham also cited trump's remarks last week on immigration, when he seemed open to compromise on the issue on tuesday, then took a harder line at a different point in the week. i would just ask that tuesday trump to come to the state of the union, graham said, referring to that softer approach. if tuesday trump comes to the state of the union and lays out a vision like he has in the past, we're in good shape.\n\nsen. john kennedy of louisiana said he was most interested in getting an update on the international front, especially north korea. he also said he wants to hear about the progress being made on nafta negotiations, and wants to know if trump's thoughts on trade have changed now that he has become president.\n\nsen. pat roberts of kansas was also focused on trade, and said he hopes to hear trump give a reaffirmation of a positive and robust trade policy. he said he thinks foreign countries are a little nervous about nafta, and we're going through a rough patch for the third year in a row.\n\nhe could just say a couple lines to reassure farm country that he recognizes we have to export things we grow as well as things that we make, roberts said, adding it will be interesting to see what the president says in the wake of his trip to the world economic forum in davos, switzerland.\n\nsen. james lankford of oklahoma said he wants to hear trump talk about the deficit and budget issues, and hopes trump will lay out the details of his immigration proposal. the white house is set to unveil an immigration plan on monday, after trump proposed giving 1.8 million young undocumented immigrants a pathway to citizenship in exchange for $25 billion for a wall along the mexican border and several other strict immigration reforms.\n\ni talked to the president about talking about prison reform, sen. john cornyn of texas said, which is something i've been working on, something i know that he and others are interested in.\n\nsen. richard shelby of alabama said he would like trump to talk about funding for national security, and would also like him to crystallize a little more on the infrastructure package.\n\ni hope he talks about the opioid crisis, said sen. susan collins of maine. this is really devastating to so many communities across america. of more than 20 senators in both parties interviewed recently about the state of the union, collins was the only one to raise the opioid crisis.\n\ni think it'll be one of the more interesting state of the unions, sen. orrin hatch of utah said, underscoring trump's unpredictable style. hatch said trump has two choices: to be big and bold, or to just make it as boring as he can.\n\nif i was him i'd do boring, hatch said.\n\ncnn's tal kopan contributed to this report.\n\n\n\nwatch the state of the union

washington (cnn) the trump administration and republican-led states told the supreme court on monday that it should not step in at this time to consider the fate of the affordable care act.\n\ninstead, they are asking the high court to allow the case to return to a district judge for further proceedings.\n\nin december, a federal appeals court held that the law's individual mandate is unconstitutional but did not invalidate the entire law, also known as obamacare, which remains in effect.\n\nin monday's filings, the government and the states led by texas said it would be premature for the supreme court to weigh in on the law especially because it will remain in place while the appeals process plays out.\n\nread more

talking about the issues we are fighting for, not about personalities or past grievances. i want to be clear that i condemn bullying and harassment of any kind and in any space.\n\nbeneath the friendly chatter, though, fault lines that will ultimately separate the democratic candidates are beginning to show. both harris and warren have been adamant in interviews that they will not be tagged as socialists, despite sharing some of sanders' most ambitious policy priorities. in her cnn town hall last week, minnesota sen. amy klobuchar, who is resisting the primary field's push left, made it clear she didn't believe programs like free four-year college were feasible.\n\nif i was a magic genie and could give that to everyone and we could afford it, i would, klobuchar said. she also dismissed – for now at least – the prospects of passing medicare for all, instead pointing to her support for more moderate measures, like creating a public option for health insurance.\n\nthe broad strokes of sanders' message to voters in these early stages is nearly identical to what he pitched before, during and in the years since his surprising 2016 bid. but his campaign's early moves suggest that, while his politics are unflinching, there is an understanding that his candidacy must look different in 2020.\n\nhis itinerary, which will take him to brooklyn, new york, on saturday, before sunday stops in selma, alabama, to mark the anniversary of 1965's bloody sunday march, and chicago, where he graduated from college and was active in the civil rights movement, will play up his biography in a way that the 77-year-old rarely did the first time around.\n\nsanders is the son of a jewish immigrant from poland and grew up in a small, rent controlled apartment in flatbush, his campaign said in a press release mapping out the trip. he is a public school graduate of james madison high school and attended brooklyn college before graduating from the university of chicago.\n\nin an interview, california rep. ro khanna, a sanders campaign co-chair and the first house member to endorse an out-of-state primary candidate, welcomed the higher expectations and mounting stakes.\n\nin 2016, bernie sanders ran to make a point. in 2020, he's running to win, khanna said. he understands that, for the sake of those (progressive) ideas, he's got to win. it's no longer just about getting them out there. he already got them out there. now he's gotta show that they're winning ideas.\n\nthe leadership team tasked with guiding sanders to victory will also look different from four years ago.\n\nfaiz shakir, a progressive operative who has worked with top democrats like former senate majority leader harry reid and nancy pelosi when she was the house minority leader, will be his new campaign manager, replacing jeff weaver.\n\nwe are playing to win, shakir told cnn last week, another early indication of the evolving mindset of sanders' team. along with shakir, former reid aides ari rabin-havt and josh orton, who came on earlier, are also expected to play key roles in the campaign.\n\nall these people working for bernie, i'm glad, reid, who has also spoken positively of warren, told the nevada independent last week. bernie is one of my friends. he helped me get obamacare passed. his vote was crucial. so i think the world of him.\n\nthe campaign on friday also introduced a slate of national co-chairs that included khanna and carmen yulín cruz, the mayor of san juan, puerto rico.\n\nnina turner, the president of our revolution, is taking leave from her job running the sanders-inspired group to join the others in advising the campaign, along with longtime sanders supporter ben cohen, the ben & jerry's co-founder and activist.\n\nthe hiring of shakir, who most recently served as the national political director for the american civil liberties union — a job that put him in near constant, pitched conflict with the trump administration — was a headline-grabbing first step in the recalibration of a political operation that weaver, who will stay on as a senior adviser, has conceded was too male and too white in 2016.\n\ni think (sanders) acknowledged that that he needed far greater diversity of perspective, both on racial and gender lines in his inner circle, khanna said. and in this campaign, he's surrounded with it.\n\ncnn's ryan nobles contributed to this report

washington (cnn) attorney general william barr made a last-minute push monday to persuade the administration to modify its position in the obamacare dispute that will be heard at the supreme court this fall, arguing that the administration should pull back from its insistence that the entire law be struck down.\n\nwith a wednesday deadline to make any alterations to its argument looming, barr made his case in a room with vice president mike pence, white house counsel pat cipollone, members of the domestic policy council, press secretary kayleigh mcenany and several other officials. the meeting ended without a decision and it was not immediately not clear if any shift in the trump administration's position will emerge.\n\nbarr and other top advisers have argued against the hard-line position for some time, warning it could have major political implications if the comprehensive health care law appears in jeopardy as voters head to the polls in november.\n\naccording to four sources familiar with the meeting, barr argued for modifying the administration's current stance to preserve parts of the law, rather than fully back the lawsuit filed by a group of republican states. as it stands now, the trump administration's position seeks to invalidate the entire affordable care act, signed by president barack obama in 2010 and commonly known as obamacare.\n\nbarr and health and human services secretary alex azar have argued against supporting invalidating the law in full, engaging in a heated debate on this point with then-acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney and policy officials allied with him, cnn reported last year. but barr and others have recently brought an additional dimension to their efforts, highlighting the coronavirus pandemic that has swept the nation. if the justices were to accept the trump administration position, its decision could cause substantial disruptions to the health care of millions of americans and cause the uninsured rate to spike.\n\nread more

(alex wong/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthere is no more durable feature of democratic politics than the ritual agonizing over the party's inability to organize itself around a coherent message.\n\nin 2018, the most prevalent argument among liberal pundits turns on whether it's a better electoral strategy to target president donald trump and his administration or bear down on core economic issues.\n\nbut the reality, as we've seen throughout the campaign, is that both are happening. the challenge for party leadership and individual candidates now is more delicate, as they try to tie the two together – and get voters to pay attention.\n\neven within that tricky new paradigm, there is a clear consensus around at least one matter: health care. in speeches, debates and ads, democrats from across the party's ideological spectrum are describing efforts to defend and expand coverage and care as a moral imperative.\n\nfrom the rumored 2020 presidential challengers in the senate to midterm candidates up and down the ballot, in both red and blue states and districts, the future of health care in america is shaping up as perhaps the central policy concern of 2018. the contours of the candidates' messages might vary and, for many, the particulars of the path forward – how far, how fast – remain an open question. but there is little question, for democrats in this cycle, which way is up.\n\ncapitol hill, despite being home to a pair of republican majorities, has become a stage for democrats who, in less than two years, have rolled out at least five significant proposals for big ticket expansions of government-backed health care. that the legislation is dead on arrival in trump's washington is beside the point. these are statements of intent and appeals to current and future voters.\n\non the trail this year, candidates have swung at the issue from all angles. a scan of ads from congressional hopefuls reveals a diverse suite of tactics buttressed by a clear strategic decision to hammer republicans over their efforts to gut obamacare and either cut or complicate funding for programs like medicaid.\n\nin california's 48th district, harley rouda, a businessman who registered as a democrat only after the 2016 election, now has the support of the democratic congressional campaign committee; indivisible, the grass-roots liberal group; and the union activists from the california nurses association/national nurses united. it's an unusual combination – one that wouldn't have been possible, in all likelihood, without his early support for single-payer health care.\n\nwhen i talk about 'medicare for all,' i can provide the economic rationale and logic, the foundation as to why it makes good business sense, rouda said last month, explaining how his pitch will play in wealthy orange county, and be credible in that since i've had the privilege of managing companies of almost 10,000 people.\n\nrouda's assessment of the national political scene is similar to the one informing radical progressives, while jibing with polls that show health care at or near the top of voters' minds.\n\nthe country is certainly coming around to how important the aca has been, he said, citing the backlash to the gop's failed attempts to repeal the affordable care act in 2017 and subsequent efforts to undermine it. when people realized what the impact would be if it was terminated, they actually stopped and paused and said, 'wait a minute, maybe this is better than we thought?' and the fact is, it hasn't gone far enough.\n\nthat push – further! – is a recurring theme in democratic campaign communications around the country, even among candidates fighting to flip their desired seats in red or swing states and districts. angie craig, in minnesota's 2nd congressional district, wants immediate fixes to the affordable care act, and work toward universal health coverage. arizona's democratic rep. kyrsten sinema, who's running to replace the retiring gop sen. jeff flake, said in a recent ad that she wanted to fix what's broken in the system, rather than blow it up.\n\nothers are even more direct – and ambitious.\n\nin nevada's 4th district, currently held by democrats, amy vilela called her daughter shalynne, who died in 2015 after her medical treatment was compromised – as vilela alleges – by insurance issues, a victim of our for-profit health care system.\n\ni know what it's like to have to pay the ultimate price because we have politicians that are not interested in putting the needs of the people first, vilela says in an ad. her primary opponent, steven horsford, asks on his website, do you have a health care story? share it with steven here. he then spells out a three-step plan to take on greedy pharmaceutical companies and drive down prescription drug prices.\n\nmeanwhile, the democratic congressional campaign committee hit gop rep. will hurd, whose seat in texas'$2 23rd district could be the state's most hotly contested, with an ominous, 60-second radio spot that asks at one point what hurd might do next to your health care? (hurd, noting the danger, was one of the few republicans who voted against the house obamacare replacement bill.)\n\nyour congressman, will hurd, hasn't stopped trying to repeal your health care, the narrator says, as if to remind voters of the anger they felt toward the gop majority in the midst of the obamacare fight and, later on, when republicans voted to repeal the individual mandate as part of their tax cut package.\n\nin kentucky's 6th district, amy mcgrath began an ad by explaining that her decision to retire from the marines and enter the race was due, in part, to incumbent republican andy barr, mitch mcconnell's handpicked congressman, saying he would vote 'enthusiastically' to take health care away from over a quarter million kentuckians.\n\nmcgrath won her primary last week and is slated for a face-off with barr in november.\n\nin pennsylvania, conor lamb talked about union rights and taking action to strengthen obamacare and its insurance markets on his way to victory in a march special election for the state's 18th congressional district.\n\npaul ryan will use the term 'entitlement reform' to talk about social security and medicare as if it's undeserved or it's some form of welfare, he said in an ad. but it's not any of those things. people paid for it. they worked hard for it and they expect us to keep our promises to them.\n\nit's not the way a liberal candidate in the northeast or on the west coast might have put it, but for a party that has, for decades, bent over backward to reject the idea it's anything less than fiscally upright, that kind of language from a red district democrat can be bracing. lamb, who was tapped by the state party ahead of the special election and ultimately ran unopposed in his new district's 2018 primary, wasn't pushed left by an insurgent candidate or activist uproar. he got there on his own – and he's still hammering away.\n\nrepublicans in congress spent the past year trying to take health insurance away from people with no plan to replace it, it says on his website, which ties coming rate hikes to a failure of leadership by the gop.\n\nfor fellow democrats plotting a similar route, from the deepest of blue districts to once-solid republican redoubts like lamb's, the power of that message could make or break their drive to wrest back power in washington and beyond.
some 12.7 million americans signed up for obamacare for 2016, according to new figures released thursday.\n\nsign ups exceeded the obama administration's initial projection that 10 million people would be enrolled by year's end, though that figure was widely seen as too modest. a large chunk of those who signed up during open enrollment will drop out over the course of the year, either because they'll find insurance elsewhere or they will stop paying their premiums.\n\nthe marketplace is growing and getting stronger and the aca [affordable care act] has become a crucial part of healthcare in america, said health secretary sylvia burwell, noting that more than 90% of americans are insured, a record number.\n\nopen enrollment ended jan. 31, and the administration has cracked down on who can sign up for coverage the rest of this year after insurers complained that consumers were enrolling only after they got sick. traditionally, only those with a major life event -- such as job loss, marriage, divorce or the birth of a child --- can obtain insurance after open enrollment ends.\n\nthe administration faced more of an uphill battle to reach those who have remained uninsured at the start of the third year of the obamacare exchanges. also, several large insurers reported higher-than-expected costs in their exchange businesses, prompting at least one major player, unitedhealth (unh), to consider exiting the program next year.\n\nthe number of americans projected to sign up for coverage continues to be revised downward. the congressional budget office lowered its estimate to 13 million enrollees for 2016, down from earlier projections of 21 million, according to its latest economic outlook.\n\nadministration officials, however, played down concerns, pointing to a healthy number of new consumers who signed up. also, the average consumer had more than 10 insurers and more than 100 plans to choose from, said andy slavitt, acting administrator, centers for medicare and medicaid services.\n\nmuch like consumers are learning about how to sign up for coverage and how their coverage works ... it's importance to acknowledge the health plans are also learning. they are learning what the right strategy is, what products to offer, what markets to be in, slavitt said. we would certainly expect there to be growing pains along the way.\n\nfor 2016, more than 9.6 million people signed up via the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, which covers enrollment in 38 states. more than 4 million were new consumers, many of whom were on the younger side. insurers covet younger enrollees because they tend to be healthier and less costly. overall, the number of consumers age 18 to 34 remained the same as last year.\n\nanother 3.1 million selected plans through the exchanges in states that run their own programs.\n\none thing that likely prompted more americans to sign up for coverage was a hike in the tax penalty for staying uninsured. those without health insurance in 2016 will have to pay as much as $695 per person, up from $325 last year.\n\nit remains to be seen how many people complete the enrollment process by paying their premiums. the administration's figures only included those who selected plans.\n\nenrollment fell about 20% between the end of the open enrollment period and the end of the calendar year in 2014 and 2015, according to avalere health. the advisory firm estimates there will be 10.2 million people with obamacare coverage at year's end.\n\nwhile exchange enrollment will meet the administration's modest 10 million-person goal, it does appear that growth in this market has slowed, said caroline pearson, senior vice president at avalere. efforts to expand participation in the long-term will be important to sustain robust plan participation and support continued improvement in the risk pool.\n\nthe administration, though, pointed out that unlike previous years, the total released thursday already include consumers who canceled their plans during open enrollment. so officials expect there to be a smaller difference in enrollment between now and year's end.\n\noverall, administration officials said they were very pleased with obamacare enrollment for 2016.\n\nwe knocked the lights out this year. we did a great job, said kevin counihan, chief executive of healthcare.gov. do we have more to do? you bet. but it's been a great year.

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\npresident donald trump spent the weekend venting venom at a bewildering list of targets – even as much of the rest of the world was still trying to come to terms with a true outrage – the carnage wrought against muslims in new zealand.\n\nin a stunning display of personal grievances aired on twitter, trump demanded the return of a supportive fox news host who was missing from her usual spot on saturday after verbally attacking an american muslim lawmaker. he escalated his beyond-the-grave feud with late sen. john mccain. he complained at being lampooned by nbc's saturday night live. trump also fulminated against the russia investigation, radical left democrats and took shots at an ohio union boss before demanding a now-closed gm plant in ohio be reopened or sold\n\nit isn't that it is unusual for this most unconventional of presidents to hit out at his foes on twitter. but this weekend's tirade came across as even more jarring given his tepid tone on friday when he said that he didn't think white supremacy was a growing global problem after the attack on two mosques in christchurch, new zealand, that killed 50.\n\nand trump did little to follow through on a request by jacinda ardern, new zealand's prime minister, that he show love and sympathy to all muslims.\n\nthe president's refusal to be pushed into a more vehement condemnation of white supremacists, after a history of racially charged and anti-muslim rhetoric put the administration on the defensive.\n\ni don't think anybody can say the president is anti-muslim, acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney said when confronted with evidence like trump's demand to ban all muslim immigration during the 2016 campaign and a remark that islam hates us.\n\nmulvaney, speaking on cbs face the nation on sunday pushed back on the idea that every time something bad happens … folks who don't like donald trump, blame it on donald trump.\n\non fox news sunday mulvaney said: the president is not a white supremacist. i'm not sure how many times we have to say that.\n\nmulvaney's comments did not explain why the president has often had a chance to vigorously condemn white supremacists — for instance after the far right marches in charlottesville, virginia — and has not done so.\n\nhis implication that people who criticize trump for such behavior are effectively accusing him of inciting horrific violence himself, blurs the argument in order to shield the president.\n\nmost critiques of trump's rhetoric do not specifically say he caused outrages like the one in new zealand but question whether he has a responsibility, given that a president has often been seen as a moral leader, to do more to condemn such hateful ideologies.\n\nextremists, like the one who allegedly carried out the new zealand attacks and the american accused of sending explosive devices to trump's political critics and media organizations last year, do appear to have found some level of validation in the some of the president's rhetoric.\n\nmulvaney also dodged when asked on sunday whether the president would give a speech condemning white supremacy, given that statistics suggest it is becoming an increasing problem.\n\nmuslim brothers and sisters\n\nnothing that the president has said in the wake of the attacks has sounded anything like the unifying language of his ambassador to new zealand, scott brown, who repeatedly referred to our muslim brothers and sisters, during an interview with jake tapper on cnn's state of the union.\n\nwe have to make sure they're safe and secure …, said brown a former republican senator from massachusetts.\n\nthe biggest priority is to … make sure that love (triumphs) over hate, reach out to your local communities and do the things important to make this country heal, said brown, speaking from new zealand.\n\ntrump's weekend tweet storm and obsession with personal slights seemed stunning given that the conversation on news shows the world over was focused on the attack in new zealand.\n\nthe president's tweets are often designed to spark overreactions from the media, stir anger in his activist base and to distract from his own political problems. sometimes, he has given the impression that adopting a politically incorrect position is more important to him than voicing the kind of unifying rhetoric that has often been expected of presidents in the past.\n\nthe latest examination of trump's attitude towards far-right-wing political rhetoric — which has some resonance among a minority in his political base — was set off by his initial reactions to the terror attack on friday.\n\nhe bemoaned a horrible massacre in the mosques and condemned how sacred places of worship were turned into scenes of evil killing.\n\nbut asked whether there was a rising problem with radical white supremacist influences in global politics he undermined his previous comments by saying: i don't really think so. i think it's a small group of people that have very, very serious problems.\n\nthe president also did not offer public empathy to american muslims or condemn the specific act of targeting believers in such attacks.\n\nan opening for trump's opponents\n\nhis failure to be more adamant in condemning white supremacy offered an opening towards his political opponents, including democratic 2020 candidates.\n\nat the very least, he is dividing people. they are using him as an excuse. and he, at the very least, should be giving strong statements, public speeches defending muslims in this world, said minnesota democratic sen. amy klobuchar, who is running for president, on state of the union.\n\none of our jobs, as a leader, is to stand up, whether people are jewish, whether they're muslim, no matter how they worship, no matter what they look like. we have to remember that they are all part of a country of shared dreams. and that's the united states of america.\n\na new debate on the issue though might also play into the president's efforts to stir his own base and to advance the narrative that he is being unfairly targeted for not being politically correct.\n\ntrump's weekend tweets covered everything from the russia investigation to his support for fox news.\n\nhe attacked mccain, who died of brain cancer last year, for passing on to the fbi a copy of the steele dossier, written by a former british intelligence agent that claimed he was compromised by russia, and for voting against a bill to replace obamacare.\n\nthe president's attacks sparked a response from mccain's friend, sen. lindsey graham of south carolina, who is usually a strong trump supporter.\n\nas to @senjohnmccain and his devotion to his country: he stepped forward to risk his life for his country, served honorably under difficult circumstances, and was one of the most consequential senators in the history of the body … nothing about his service will ever be changed or diminished, graham wrote on twitter.\n\nthe president also took to twitter to demand gm reopen or sell a plant in lordstown, ohio, it recently closed because of shifting customer demand. gm responded saying in a statement that the future of the unallocated plants will be resolved between gm and the uaw, referring to the united automobile workers union.\n\ntrump also defended one of his most vociferous cheerleaders on fox, jeanine pirro, who did not appear in her usual spot on saturday night after questioning whether the religious beliefs of muslim rep. ilhan omar were compatible with the us constitution.\n\nbring back @judgejeanine pirro. the radical left democrats, working closely with their beloved partner, the fake news media, is using every trick in the book to silence a majority of our country, trump wrote on twitter.
(cnn) —\n\nthe tough new zero tolerance immigration policy enacted by president donald trump has led to a general outcry about how the us treats undocumented children, separating them from their parents at the border.\n\ndemocrats in particular have been raising alarms about the policy, which trump cabinet officials say is just enforcing the law and should serve as a deterrent to illegal immigration.\n\nbut trump doesn't want you to blame him for enacting the policy that literally divides families and places children in the custody of the government, potentially for extended period of time while their parents are prosecuted.\n\ncnn documented the case of maria villatoro, a guatemalan mother who said she fled deadly violence in guatemala only to land in detention in texas and has four children in detention, ranging in age from 2-20 and spread between california and new york. read this story.\n\nbut it's not trump's fault, he tweeted tuesday, even though he enacted the policy. blame the democrats, who are saying it's inhumane, according to the president's logic: separating families at the border is the fault of bad legislation passed by the democrats, he wrote on twitter. border security laws should be changed but the dems can't get their act together! started the wall.\n\nrep. adam schiff of california was having none of trump's argument, tweeting in response, separating children from their parents as a 'deterrent' is a deliberate cruelty. pretending the law requires it is cowardly nonsense. you own this horrific policy.\n\nit's worth noting that this isn't the first time trump has enacted a policy that caused a national (or international) outcry, and then tried to foist blame elsewhere.\n\ndaca\n\nthe president unilaterally decided to end the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program put in place by former president barack obama to give children of undocumented immigrants long in the us a temporary protected status. trump had routinely criticized the program in the past and started the process of ending it before republican governors could sue to end it in courts. republicans who control congress could not fix the program within an arbitrary six-month deadline he set, although courts have since intervened and said he couldn't just end it the way he did.\n\nbut don't blame trump! at least not according to trump.\n\nback in feburary, as his self-imposed deadline approached, trump said to blame democrats if there wasn't a deal in place to protect daca recipients.\n\nthe democrats just aren't calling about daca. nancy pelosi and chuck schumer have to get moving fast, or they'll disappoint you again. we have a great chance to make a deal or, blame the dems! march 5th is coming up.\n\nmarch 5 came and went. it was actually trump who scuttled a few bipartisan attempts to find accord. remember the sh**hole countries episode?\n\nlater, in april, he tried to blame democrats again for not saving the program he canceled: daca is dead because the democrats didn't care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the daca bandwagon… no longer works. must build wall and secure our borders with proper border legislation. democrats want no borders, hence drugs and crime!\n\nthe program is not entirely dead, by the way. whether trump can just end it like he did is still playing out in the courts even as a bipartisan effort to force a vote in the house on protected status, over the objections of conservatives and republican leaders, is just a few signatures shy of what it needs.\n\nobamacare\n\nrepublicans promised for years that they'd repeal obamacare. trump said he'd replace it with something better. but they couldn't peel off any democrats and they didn't have enough republicans. it was a major failure for trump and he has lashed out in turns at senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, sen. john mccain and democrats after several attempts failed.\n\nhe blamed mccain for the failure in september 2017.\n\nyou can call it what you want, but that's the only reason we don't have it, because of john mccain, he said on the rick & bubba radio show.\n\ntrump also took the step of cutting off key payments to insurance companies, something expected to drive up costs and hurt stability in the market. who is to blame for this action by trump? democrats, he said both after republicans failed to repeal the law and then after he made the decision to cut off the insurance payments.\n\nany increase in obamacare premiums is the fault of the democrats for giving us a 'product' that never had a chance of working, he tweeted.\n\na few weeks later, trump blamed congress and mcconnell for not getting the job done on obamacare, and said he could understand why people like his former strategist steve bannon were trying to oust republicans in primaries.\n\nbut we're not getting the job done. and i'm not going to blame myself. i'll be honest, they are not getting the job done, he said during a cabinet meeting.\n\ntrump seems to have come around a bit on mcconnell after the passage of his tax reform bill and after bannon's efforts to target mcconnell-preferred candidates cost republicans a senate seat in alabama.\n\ntravel ban\n\nwhen a judge put a nationwide hold on his plan to halt immigration from certain majority-muslim countries, trump cast blame for anything bad that might happen in that period personally on the judge who made the order.\n\njust cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril. if something happens blame him and court system. people pouring in. bad! he tweeted.\n\ntrade agreements and trade deficits\n\nblame features prominently in a lot of trump's foreign policy, too. he's repeatedly blamed past presidents – from reagan to obama – for negotiating what he says are bad trade deals and for failing to stand up for the us. this was before he started announcing a raft of new tariffs on goods coming into the us from canada, mexico, europe and china.\n\nspeaking in china, for instance, trump said he didn't blame china for taking advantage of the us.\n\ni don't blame china, trump said during remarks to business leaders inside the great hall of the people in beijing. after all, who can blame a country for being able to take advantage of another country for benefit of their citizens? i give china great credit.\n\ninstead he blamed past us administrations for allowing this trade deficit to take place and to grow.\n\nhe levied blame on his predecessors regarding the trade deficit with china again in april of this year at a cabinet meeting.\n\nand he blamed previous administrations for not doing a better job controlling iran's nuclear ambitions as he pulled out of the international agreement the obama administration put in place with the international community to control iran's nuclear ambitions.\n\nhe had to pull out of it, see?

he basically almost has to run an inside straight and almost has to have them all fall into his hands.\n\ntrump and his aides insist he has a path and momentum, citing huge crowds, long lines for early voting and the few polls in his favor. a fox news poll wednesday put the national gap to clinton at only three points and a bloomberg politics survey in florida said he was two points up.\n\ni think we're going to have a tremendous victory, trump told cnn's dana bash wednesday. if i didn't think it, i wouldn't say it.\n\nclinton won't mess with texas\n\ntrump's schedule shows that he knows the stakes.\n\nhe spent several days in florida earlier this week, was in north carolina on wednesday and spent thursday in ohio. without that trio, trump has no platform to mount what even then would be a long shot bid for the white house.\n\nclinton is of the same mind. she was in florida wednesday and plans to go back saturday. she campaigned in north carolina with first lady michelle obama on thursday. clinton could effectively stop trump in his tracks if she can win either state – barring a huge and unpredictable upset elsewhere.\n\nif trump does win north carolina, ohio and florida, he can trace the narrowest of routes to 270 electoral votes by winning new hampshire, a congressional district in maine, iowa and nevada. but clinton is leading or in a tight race in those states. trump also cannot afford to drop any red state, and is already fighting rearguard actions in arizona and utah, and some democrats believe that georgia could be competitive.\n\nagain, trump's travel is instructive – he is campaigning in maine, new hampshire and iowa on friday.\n\nnew dc routine: wake up, search wikileaks, wince\n\nsome democrats worry clinton's biggest risk is that her voters think she has the presidency in the bag and will fail to show up to vote.\n\n'no complacency'\n\nno complacency here, clinton said wednesday at a rally in tampa, florida. donald trump says he can still win and he is right. that is why it is so important everyone gets out and votes.\n\nclinton's advisers also warn that the race will probably narrow in the days to come.\n\nquite likely we are in store for one final round of tightening, clinton spokesman brian fallon tweeted wednesday.\n\nin essence, trump's hopes rely on a huge turnout of his base voters, who are largely white and working class. he also needs significantly depressed enthusiasm among clinton voters and a poll-defying shock on the scale of brexit, the surprise british vote this year to quit the european union.\n\ntrump has repeatedly said the polls are wrong. and it's true that some pre-election polls underplayed the size of obama's re-election victory in 2012 and the democratic mid-term election debacle two years later.\n\nbut if he goes into election day with his current deficit, trump would require a massive polling miss outside the margin of error in multiple states.\n\nthe republican nominee's own strategy makes his task even more difficult.\n\nsince he has likely alienated minority and educated women with his rhetoric and behavior, trump must pull in vast numbers of new white voters — some who may have voted for democrats in the past – to make up for the shortfall.\n\nbut the fox news poll, like some other recent surveys, suggested trump is underperforming 2012 nominee mitt romney among this core constituency. romney won white voters by 20 points over obama according to exit polls, but trump is only 14 points ahead of clinton in the poll with the same voting group.\n\ntrump's problems with educated white female voters have been well documented.\n\nif those numbers hold, it means that the gop nominee must reverse trends in which white voters have become a smaller share of the electorate in recent elections.\n\nthere are just not enough white men in these battleground states for him to win this election, said tharon johnson, who ran obama's southern states strategy in his 2012 re-election bid.\n\nstill, bloomberg's poll of florida does suggest trump has some traction in the state he regards as a second home — even though most other recent surveys have given clinton a lead of a few points. some close observers of sunshine state politics do believe his intense campaigning is having an impact.\n\ni think it has moved some polls. he has been very strategic about going into some of the media markets where there are a lot of suburban voters, said professor susan macmanus of the university of south florida, who does not rule out a late trump surge. never say never in our state. on paper, it should be hillary's to lose. but it's not an on paper election. she has soft spots in her base, so does trump.

(photo by anna moneymaker / pool / afp) (photo by anna moneymaker/pool/afp via getty images)\n\n'those at the top are not doing their part:' wh looks to raise taxes on wealthy\n\ngovernor greg abbott today held a press conference in houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session. the governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his state of the state address in february. governor abbott was joined for the press conference by senator paul bettencourt and representative briscoe cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in texas\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthe two most powerful people in washington – donald trump and nancy pelosi – met for the first time as president and speaker friday morning at the white house in a futile attempt to end a government shutdown as it hit the two-week mark.\n\nthe meeting occurred in wider talks involving congressional leaders on the second day of divided government in the trump administration. things didn't go so well.\n\nthat's because pelosi is now the face of the congressional oversight and investigation from which trump was spared by two years of gop rule on capitol hill and that now threatens his presidency itself.\n\nit's not just that pelosi and trump are political and temperamental opposites. hanging over their most critical relationship is the possibility that she has the power to open impeachment proceedings should special counsel robert mueller deliver a damning verdict on trump.\n\nas she was sworn in thursday, the california democrat preached action on boosting the middle class, combating climate change, shielding children brought to the us by undocumented parents, gender equality and opening up government.\n\nbut she also fired several warnings at the president, notably by passing legislation to reopen the government that ignored his demands for border wall funding as the first bill of the new democratic majority.\n\nwe're not doing a wall. does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall? so that's that, she said at a news conference on thursday evening.\n\nand playing on trump's legal vulnerabilities, pelosi had declined to rule out impeachment in an interview with nbc's today show and said it was an open question whether a president can be indicted.\n\ntrump laid the groundwork for his face-to-face encounter with his new top political foe by cementing his demands for wall funding in a hastily orchestrated appearance in the white house briefing room that signaled he was a long way from backing down on the shutdown.\n\ni have never had so much support as i have in the last week over my stance for border security, for border control and for, frankly, the wall or the barrier, the president said, flanked by a group of border patrol council members.\n\npoor omens\n\nwhen trump and then-house minority leader pelosi last met, earlier this week at the white house, things headed south when the president ordered his homeland security secretary, kirstjen nielsen, to brief lawmakers on border security. at one point, trump's frustration boiled over at senate minority leader chuck schumer and the president lobbed a glowing personal letter from north korean tyrant kim jong un in the direction of the new york democrat.\n\nthat massive political disconnect is one reason why expectations were so low for friday's meeting, along with the fact that at this point neither side seems to have an overwhelming incentive to make a deal. after the two-hour session in the white house situation room ended, pelosi described it as a lengthy and sometimes contentious conversation but indicated some progress was made.\n\nhow do you define progress in a meeting? she asked. when you have a better understanding of each other's position? when you eliminate some possibilities? if that's the judgment, we made some progress.\n\nthe speaker has no desire to celebrate her new majority by giving trump a win on the wall – the symbol of his 2016 election victory, which broke democratic hearts. her position is supported by schumer, whose minority party votes are needed to pass senate funding legislation.\n\ntrump triggered the shutdown while facing a revolt from the conservative commentators who help keep his vital political base engaged – a constituency at which thursday's briefing appeared to be aimed. climbing down now would expose him to even more of a backlash.\n\nthat's why it's tough to see a way out of the showdown that could allow trump and pelosi to both claim victory and build goodwill that might be used in pursuit of bipartisan initiatives – for instance, an infrastructure package, or in future must-do items like budget bills or raising the debt ceiling.\n\nlittle in common\n\n02:08 - source: cnn trump congratulates house speaker pelosi\n\ntrump and pelosi could hardly be more different, so it's hard to see how they can forge any kind of bond in the weeks ahead.\n\npelosi is a political lifer, steeped in the family business from an early age. trump owes his stunning electoral success to the fact that he is not a politician at all.\n\nthe speaker, by securing a second run at the job despite early rumblings of dissent among younger democrats, proved once again her mastery of washington process. her vote-counting prowess is especially remembered for pushing obamacare into law during her first turn at running the house.\n\ntrump is a legislative neophyte, and despite enjoying a republican monopoly on power for two years, his unpredictable nature was often more of a hindrance to his party in advancing its agenda than a help.\n\npelosi is no stranger to fighting republican presidents, even if memories are dimming of her bitter battles with president george w. bush over funding the iraq war.\n\ndespite their gaping differences, pelosi and bush had a cordial personal relationship. their mutual respect was crucial to navigating the 2008 financial crisis and was in evidence when they hugged at former president george h.w. bush's lying in state last month.\n\ntrump sought to build a personal rapport with pelosi by congratulating her on her election as speaker.\n\nit's a very, very great achievement, and hopefully we're going to work together, and we're going to get lots of things done, he said.\n\nyet trump is a far more volatile personality than bush and often sees political differences in deeply personal terms. his default mode of projecting power is to identify an enemy and applying withering political fire.\n\ndan meyer, who served bush as deputy assistant for legislative affairs and also experienced shutdowns while working for republican house speaker newt gingrich in the 1990s, said the political dynamics of new majorities were often shaped by the issues that brought them to power.\n\nthere is a different set of issues that brought this majority to power – the most significant being the democrats' resistance to president trump, meyer said.\n\nthis is going to be much more difficult to do and not have it be personal. they are going to go after him hard, he said.\n\nif that is how it goes, pelosi will be ready, said nadeam elshami, an ex-chief of staff to pelosi.\n\nshe has the power to back it up. she has gone toe-to-toe with this president in the past two years, elshami said on cnn's new day, citing his former boss's resolve, her ability to understand the issues and her ability to look at the president and say, 'mr president, you are wrong. these are not the facts.' \n\ndictating terms\n\n02:19 - source: cnn schumer: gop using shutdown as hostage\n\nthe differing approaches of pelosi and trump were on display thursday.\n\npelosi was legislating, passing the bill to reopen the government that put republicans – who had already passed a similar effort to keep the government open last month in the senate – in a difficult spot.\n\ntrump, meanwhile, was presiding over the propaganda stunt in the white house briefing room, designed to change the subject from pelosi's day of triumph and to provide footage for conservative news channels.\n\nthe pelosi approach is designed to show that democrats can govern and can provide stability after two years of chaos fostered by trump's disruption.\n\nthe president appears to be betting that the longer the shutdown drags on, the more pressure democrats will feel to end it as hundreds of thousands of federal workers go unpaid.\n\nor perhaps a prolonged shutdown could cause voters to sour on both parties and let the president off the hook.\n\ntrump's political team is trying to shape that outcome by portraying pelosi as of an extreme band of liberals who are soft on immigration and blinded by a ravenous desire to destroy his presidency.\n\ni think it's unfortunate that you've got an incoming speaker already talking about indictments and impeachment when this president is talking about border security and infrastructure, trump's counselor kellyanne conway said thursday.\n\nshe obviously came here yesterday not serious about border security, so it doesn't surprise me that she would be so partisan and political on day one. that's just too bad, conway said.
the trump administration unveiled a proposed rule thursday that would make it easier for small businesses -- and some self-employed folks -- to band together and buy health insurance.\n\nthe proposed regulation stems from an executive order president trump issued in october and is the administration's latest step in whittling away at obamacare. it would allow small firms to form small business health plans based on their location or industry. sole proprietors would also be eligible to join the plans, which would ideally be able to use their scale to secure less expensive coverage much like large-employer plans do.\n\nthe proposal would broaden access to what are known now as association health plans to more americans and their families. some 11 million people could be eligible, according to the department of labor, which issued the proposed rule.\n\nthe associations could provide an attractive alternative to obamacare for some people, especially younger and healthier consumers. this is particularly true because it would be easier for sole proprietors to join these plans.\n\nit could cover millions of people who are self-employed, said tim jost, an emeritus health law professor at washington and lee university school of law.\n\nthat, in turn, could leave the affordable care act exchanges -- as well as the broader individual and small business markets -- with older and sicker members, essentially turning them into high-risk pools, said mila kofman, an expert on association health plans who runs the washington d.c. exchange.\n\ninsurers would likely raise their rates, further hobbling that market.\n\nrelated: will obamacare survive the tax bill?\n\nthe proposal would allow association plans to be regulated the same way large employer plans are. that would free them from having to adhere to all of obamacare's rules, particularly the one requiring insurers to offer comprehensive coverage. so these plans would likely have lower premiums, but also provide fewer benefits -- which could leave sicker and older workers out in the cold. also, the offerings could be less attractive to young women if they don't cover maternity benefits.\n\nplus, the proposed regulation would allow associations to base rates on gender, age and industry, which could leave younger men paying less, but older workers and women saddled with higher rates. currently, the affordable care act bans basing premiums on gender or industry and limits the amount that can be based on age.\n\nhowever, plans would not be allowed to set premiums based on workers' health status, which critics of the executive order had feared.\n\nhave you belonged to an association health plan or do you wish to join one? is a short-term health insurance policy right for you? email healthcarestories@cnn.com and you could be included in an upcoming article.\n\nthe proposal does leave in place -- for now -- some state oversight of the health plans. just how this would work isn't immediately clear. however, some experts worry that the new rule could weaken -- or at least leave ambiguous -- states' power to regulate coverage.\n\nthis could erode consumer protections, said sabrina corlette, research professor at georgetown university's health policy institute. for instance, states can ensure that the plans have enough funding to operate and can mandate that certain benefits be covered.\n\nrelated: what happened to trump's big plans for health insurance?\n\nassociation health plans, which have existed for decades and have a history of fraud and insolvency, have long been a favorite tool of republicans. trump and republican senator rand paul of kentucky had been pushing to change their regulation so the plans could be sold across state lines with little, if any, local oversight. the goal would be to give consumers more options.\n\nthe proposed rule makes it clear that plans would be able to offer coverage in multiple states. for instance, it said that an association could be formed in a metropolitan area that encompasses multiple states -- such as the new york or washington d.c. regions. also, an association can sponsor coverage outside of the state where it is based.\n\njust how much impact this regulation has on obamacare depends on whether it really spurs more businesses to create or join association health plans. last year, 6% of firms with fewer than 250 workers that offered health benefits did so through a trade or professional association health plan, according to a kaiser family foundation/hret survey.\n\nalready, the national retail federation and international franchise association have praised the proposed rule.\n\nfor years, we've called for ahps to ensure that heath care coverage is within reach for small retailers and their employees, and today's action by [the department of labor] brings us one step closer to making this commonsense reform a reality, said david french, the federation's senior vice president for government relations.\n\nthe department of labor is soliciting comments -- including on whether it should preempt state regulation of these plans -- for 60 days.\n\ntrump's executive order, which he said was aimed at increasing choice and competition, also called for federal agencies to look at changing the rules governing short-term insurance policies and health reimbursement arrangements. those regulations have yet to be issued.\n\nthe obama administration limited the duration of short-term health plans to no more than 90 days in order to make them less attractive. the executive order is expected to lift that cap, enabling consumers to buy policies that would last just under a year.\n\nshort-term plans don't have to adhere to obamacare's regulations so consumers would have a wider array of options with lower monthly rates. but these policies can exclude those with pre-existing conditions or base rates on a person's medical history. they can also offer skimpier benefits so policyholders may have to pay more out of pocket if they actually need care.\n\nhealth reimbursement arrangements allow employers to give workers cash to buy coverage elsewhere.\n\nboth would further erode the potential pool of obamacare enrollees.
(cnn) welcome to cnn's fact check coverage of the tenth democratic presidential debate from charleston, south carolina, ahead of the state's primary on saturday.\n\nvermont sen. bernie sanders , the current front-runner after winning the nevada caucus, faced attacks over his recent defense of some of the actions of fidel castro following the 1959 cuban revolution. sanders also had to defend his recently released plan to pay for his legislative proposals such as medicare for all, free college, and various debt forgiveness ideas.\n\nthe debate was also a chance for former new york mayor mike bloomberg to bounce back from a rough performance in last week's debate, when he faced criticism over sexist comments he allegedly made in the early 1990s.\n\nbloomberg hits sanders over russian meddling\n\nin an early exchange during tuesday night's democratic presidential debate, bloomberg told sanders that (russian president) vladimir putin thinks that donald trump should be president of the united states, and that's why russia is helping you get elected.\n\nsanders tried to fend off the attacks by condemning russian meddling in the 2016 election and warning putin that he wouldn't be a russia-friendly president.\n\nfacts first: bloomberg accurately pointed to a us intelligence community belief that russia is trying to help sanders' campaign. russia also backed sanders in the 2016 primary, but sanders has publicly denounced russian interference in us politics.\n\nsanders acknowledged last week that us intelligence officials had informed his team that russia was trying to help his campaign. it's not clear what russians are doing to help sanders, and there haven't yet been any sweeping hack-and-leak operations like the cyberattacks that hit the democratic national committee during the 2016 presidential campaign.\n\nus intelligence leaders have said that russia routinely tries to sow discord among the american public and amplify voices on the extremes of the political spectrum, to inflame divisions and undermine the stability of american democracy. their past support for sanders and trump, who have both antagonized their own parties, fits into this big-picture strategy.\n\nseparately, a senior us intelligence official, shelby pierson, told lawmakers earlier this month in a classified briefing that russia was taking steps to help trump win reelection. cnn later reported that pierson appears to have overstated the formal assessments from the us intelligence community, and senior white house officials rebutted her comments.\n\nthe russian government, at putin's direction, undertook an extensive campaign in 2016 to boost sanders' primary campaign against former secretary of state hillary clinton, and to help trump defeat clinton in the general election. the kremlin operation included well-funded troll farms, propaganda on social media, cyberattacks and leaks of private emails.\n\n-- marshall cohen\n\nbloomberg on stop and frisk\n\naddressing his history with the controversial stop and frisk policy, mike bloomberg claimed the number of incidents decreased by 95% while he was mayor of new york.\n\nbloomberg said, we let it get out of control and when i realized that, i cut it back by 95%. and i've apologized and asked for forgiveness. i've met with black leaders to try to get an understanding of how i can better position myself and what i should have done and what i should do next time.\n\nfacts first: bloomberg was misleading by omission, as he has been bloomberg was misleading by omission, as he has been before , when he cited a 95% decline in stop and frisk. while there was such a reduction , it happened only during the last two years of his 12-year mayoralty, from the first quarter of 2012 to the last quarter of 2013, following a 605% increase in his first 10 years. looking at his entire mayoralty, from 2002 through 2013, there was a 97% increase , not a decrease.\n\nbloomberg also claimed the 95% was prompted by his realization that the situation was out of control. he does not mention that the decline began right around the time a federal judge signaled she would rule against stop and frisk, nor that he continued to be a vocal defender of stop and frisk for years after his professed realization about the harms of the policy.\n\nyou can read more about bloomberg's history with stop and frisk here\n\n-- tara subramaniam and daniel dale\n\nbloomberg's previous support of republicans\n\nmassachusetts sen. elizabeth warren said former new york city mayor michael bloomberg previously supported republican candidates.\n\nwe're here in charleston, and you know who is going to be in charleston later this week? it's donald trump, warren said. he's going to be here to raise money for his buddy, senator lindsey graham. who funded lindsey graham's campaign for reelection last time? it was mayor bloomberg. and that's not the only right-wing senator that mayor bloomberg has funded.\n\nin 2016, he dumped $12 million into the pennsylvania senate race to help reelect an anti-choice, right-wing republican senator, warren added. and i just want to say, the woman challenger was terrific. she lost by a single point. in 2012, he scooped in to try to defend another republican senator against a woman challenger. that was me. it didn't work, but he tried hard.\n\nfacts first: this is true. bloomberg supported republican pennsylvania sen. pat toomey's re-election in 2016. he supported scott brown in his losing effort against warren in 2012. in 2014, bloomberg gave money to a super-pac supporting lindsey graham.\n\nbloomberg spent nearly $12 million in 2016 to support the reelection of republican sen. pat toomey of pennsylvania, an ally of his on the issue of background checks on gun purchases. the new york times also reported in november he supported republican sen. lindsey graham of south carolina in 2014.\n\nin 2012, bloomberg supported brown over warren, saying on his radio program as mayor he supported brown because of brown's stance against requiring states to recognize concealed carry laws from other states.\n\ntonight, bloomberg called such attacks a side show and not relevant to his record as mayor.\n\n--andrew kaczynski\n\nsanders encouraged a primary challenge to obama\n\nformer vice president joe biden said vermont sen. bernie sanders encouraged a primary challenge to president barack obama in 2012.\n\nhe said we should primary barack obama, biden said. someone should.\n\nfacts first: this is true. sanders said on a radio show in july 2011 that a primary challenge to obama would do a good deal of service to the country.\n\nso my suggestion is, i think one of the reasons the president has been able to move so far to the right is that there is no primary opposition to him, and i think it would do this country a good deal of service if people started thinking about candidates out there to begin contrasting what is a progressive agenda as opposed to what obama is doing, sanders said on the thom hartmann show in july 2011.\n\ni think one of the reasons that president obama has moved as far to the right as he has is he thinks he can go all the way and no one will stand up to him, sanders added.\n\non wnyc in march 2011, sanders said a primary challenge to obama would enliven the debate.\n\ni'm not a democrat, he said. i'm the longest-serving independent. i think if a progressive democrat wants to run, i think it would enliven the debate, raise some issues and people have a right to do that.\n\nsanders went on to endorse obama in 2012.\n\n--andrew kaczynski\n\nklobuchar criticizes sanders' 'medicare for all' plan\n\nklobuchar claimed on tuesday that sanders'  'medicare for all' plan alone, on page 8, clearly says that it will kick 149 million americans off their current health insurance in four years.\n\nfacts first: while page 8 of sanders' while page 8 of sanders' bill does not specifically mention the figure cited by klobuchar, it states that it shall be unlawful for ... a private health insurer to sell health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits provided under this act. and the klobuchar's figure is close to the latest number provided by one study. some 153 million people are covered by private plans sponsored by their employers, according to the latest report from the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation.\n\nthere are also tens of millions more who are covered by private plans through medicare advantage, medicaid managed care plans and on the obamacare individual market.\n\nall these people would have to change their health care under sanders' medicare for all plan — but they would be covered by the federal plan instead.\n\n-- tami luhby and caroline kelly\n\nsanders on medicare for all health spending\n\nsanders defended his sweeping plan to overhaul america's health insurance system, saying medicare for all will reduce the nation's health care price tag.\n\nwhat every study out there, conservative or progressive says, medicare for all will save money, said sanders, who came under fire for the cost of his proposal, which has been pegged at more than $30 trillion over a decade.\n\nfacts first: although sanders is correct that several studies have found medicare for all would reduce health care spending, at least one study published last year found the opposite.\n\nreport from the left-leaning urban institute health policy center showed that the nation's overall health care spending would rise by roughly $7 trillion to $59 trillion over a decade if medicare for all goes into effect. the increase would be $720 billion for 2020 alone if the policy were enacted.\n\nthat's because more people would be insured, more benefits would be covered and more medical services would be used since there'd be no cost for care.\n\nyou will in total spend more as a nation on health care from adding all the bells and whistles that are associated with these kinds of proposals, linda blumberg, institute fellow, said when the study was published last october.\n\n-- tami luhby\n\nklobuchar on the ineffectiveness of warren and sanders\n\nklobuchar claimed during tuesday's democratic debate that a vanderbilt university study ranked her as the most effective democrat in the senate and that two of her competitors for the democratic nomination, sens. warren and sanders, ranked among the bottom half of the list.\n\nfacts first: klobuchar is right about herself. she did rank among the most effective members of the senate and first among democrats, according to that study. she's also right that warren ranked among the bottom half of democrats. her characterization of sanders' ineffectiveness within the democratic party, though, requires clarification.\n\nklobuchar said during the debate in south carolina that according to vanderbilt university in tennessee, last congress, i was the most effective democrat in the us senate on 15 metrics. bernie and elizabeth were in the bottom half. it matters -- it matters if you can actually get things done.\n\nthe center for effective lawmaking at vanderbilt evaluates the effectiveness of members of congress and according to their evaluation of the 115th congress (2017-2019), klobuchar ranked as the most effective democrat in the senate.\n\nwhat vanderbilt calls the legislative effectiveness score is based on 15 metrics that take into account the number of bills a legislator sponsors, how far each of those bills advances through the legislative process from introduction to (possibly) becoming law and its relative substantive significance. the average legislative effectiveness score is 1.0.\n\nklobuchar has a score of 2.815, ranking first among the 48 democrats in the senate during that time. and warren has a score of .548 and ranks 32nd out of 48 democrats in the senate.\n\nsanders caucuses with democrats, but since he is elected as an independent in congress, he was not ranked among those within the party as klobuchar suggested. sanders has a score of .159.\n\nsanders' and warren's rankings are below 1.0, the average among all members of congress.\n\n-- maegan vazquez\n\nsanders on the wealth of billionaires\n\nearly in the debate, sanders used an inaccurate figure that had been provided to his campaign by a progressive think tank that, among other things, keeps track of the fortunes of billionaires.\n\nin the last three years, last three years, billionaires in this country saw an $850 billion increase in their wealth, sanders said.\n\nfacts first: the think tank that provided the figure says it is wrong, and says it takes responsibility for the error.\n\nsanders was relying on a figure from the institute for policy studies, according to the think tank senior scholar chuck collins but the number was inflated. we informed senator sanders that us billionaires increased their wealth since trump's election by $850 billion. our updated number is $710 billion, an increase of 30 percent, collins told cnn during the debate.\n\nsenator sanders was accurately using information that we provided, so we at institute for policy studies are responsible for the error, collins added.\n\nhe said that in 2016, there were 541 us billionaires with wealth totaling about $2.4 trillion. in 2019, he said, there were 607 us billionaires with wealth totaling about $3.1 trillion.\n\ncollins said he informed the sanders campaign on tuesday morning that there had been an error, after cnn contacted the campaign to ask for the source for the $850 billion number. it is not clear, though, whether sanders himself was informed of the error prior to the debate.\n\nthere is no doubt that the wealthiest americans have gotten wealthier under trump, though others have also gained.\n\naccording to the federal reserve , the combined wealth of the top 1% of american households increased 18% from the fourth quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2019 -- from $29.18 to $34.53 trillion. the combined wealth of the bottom 50% of households increased 55%, but from a much smaller starting point -- from $1.08 trillion to $1.67 trillion -- and spread out across many more households.\n\n-- daniel dale\n\nbloomberg takes on trump's coronavirus response\n\nbloomberg on tuesday took a swing at president donald trump when the debate turned to the deadly coronavirus, which is spreading around the world and sparked a massive selloff this week in the stock market.\n\nthe president fired the pandemic specialist in this country two years ago, bloomberg said. so, there's nobody here to figure out what the hell we should be doing. and he's defunded (the) centers for disease control (and prevention), cdc, so we don't have the organization we need.\n\nfacts first: bloomberg's statement is mostly accurate. the trump administration eliminated key white house positions that handled global health issues, and, while it didn't fully defund the cdc, the administration did cut funding to the federal agency.\n\ncnn reported last month that the trump administration's response to coronavirus was being coordinated by the white house's national security council. but the nsc does not currently have a person dedicated to overseeing global health issues. that position was restructured in 2018, and a current official with a similar purview has less authority than the former official.\n\na foreign policy report late last month stated that the united states has never been less prepared for a pandemic, primarily because the trump white house fired the entire chain-of-command that handled responses to pandemics.\n\nthe trump administration did make cuts to the cdc, which specifically hit epidemic prevention activities when they were imposed in 2018. because of those reductions, the cdc dramatically reduced the number of countries where its staff works to prevent, detect and respond to infectious disease threats.\n\nduring the debate, trump tweeted that the cdc and my administration are doing a great job of handling coronavirus, and attacked democrats for criticizing his response to the virus.\n\n-- marshall cohen\n\nbiden's attacks sanders over gun control votes\n\nbiden said that sanders voted against the so-called brady bill, a key piece of gun control legislation which ultimately passed in 1993 after a long debate that included whether to extend waiting periods for gun purchases.\n\naccording to biden, longer waiting periods would have prevented mass shooter dylann roof from obtaining the weapon he used to murder nine people at charleston's historically black mother emanuel ame church in 2015.\n\nbernie voted five times against the brady bill, biden said.\n\ni'm not saying he's responsible for the nine deaths, but that man would not have been able to get that weapon, biden said.\n\nfacts first: it's true that sanders it's true that sanders voted against the brady bill five times , but it's unclear how a longer waiting period would have prevented roof from purchasing the firearm.\n\nsanders voted against versions of the brady bill that included seven - and five -day waiting periods for purchasing firearms.\n\nroof, who was not legally allowed to purchase a firearm due to a pending illegal drug possession case, was able to buy a handgun because the database that was supposed to flag roof's pending case, the national instant criminal background check system managed by the fbi, didn't include the pending case details. due to a clerical error, the information was never submitted to that database.\n\nroof's background check took longer than three days to complete and so the gun shop owner was allowed to sell him the gun after the three days passed. because this error wasn't discovered until after the shooting, when the fbi began investigating roof, it's unclear how a longer waiting period would have prevented roof from passing the background check.\n\n-- holmes lybrand\n\nbiden and klobuchar on who wrote the bill\n\nduring the debate, biden and klobuchar argued over who authored gun control legislation aimed at protecting women.\n\ni am the author of the bill to close the boyfriend loophole that says that domestic abusers can't go out and get an ak-47, klobuchar said.\n\ni wrote that law, biden replied.\n\nyou didn't write that bill, klobuchar said.\n\ni did, biden reiterated.\n\nfacts first: klobuchar and biden are talking about two different pieces of legislation.\n\nklobuchar has introduced legislation that would make it legally clear that dating or more casual partners who were convicted of a misdemeanor for domestic violence (as well as convicted stalkers) would not be allowed to own a firearm.\n\nas a senator, biden sponsored the violence against women act, legislation that aimed, in part, at improving how prosecutors and police worked to combat domestic violence. as a white house memo in 2014 describes, the bill established new federal crimes of interstate domestic violence and stalking, doubled penalties for repeat sex offenders, and sparked the passage of laws at the state level to protect victims.\n\n-- holmes lybrand\n\nbiden on gun deaths claim\n\nin a back-and-forth with vermont sen. bernie sanders about gun control, biden said, 150 million people have been killed since 2007 when bernie voted to exempt the gun manufacturers from liability.\n\nhe added, more than all the wars, including vietnam, from that point on. carnage on our streets.\n\nfacts first: biden's number is incorrect. when cnn asked about it, his campaign said he misspoke. he's also wrong about when the vote occurred. it was 2005, not 2007. fewer than half a million people in the us have died by gun violence since 2005 -- but he's correct that it's more than the number of military casualties since the vietnam conflict.\n\ndata from the centers for disease control and prevention shows that 474,993 people died because of a firearm injury between 2005 and 2018, the latest data available. that it includes intentional and unintentional deaths.\n\na spokesperson for the campaign said that biden meant to say 150,000 -- and was referring to the number of homicides. that number checks out, if you're counting from 2007 . but the centers for disease control and prevention says there were 173,325 homicides committed with firearms between 2005 and 2018.\n\nwhether you count homicides only, or all deaths, more people have died from gun violence since 2007 than military deaths in us wars since the vietnam conflict began

sanders had to defend his numerous comments praising elements of the cuban communist regime, which have recently gained attention following a 60 minutes interview and a cnn townhall. sanders said that while he has admired aspects of the cuban revolution, he has also condemned authoritarianism in the country.\n\ni have opposed authoritarianism all over the world, sanders said, likening his comments on cuba to comments made by then-president barack obama.\n\nof course you have a dictatorship in cuba, he added. what i said is what barack obama said in terms of cuba, that cuba made progress on education. what barack obama said was they made great progress on education and healthcare. that was barack obama.\n\nbiden shot back at sanders, saying that obama did not praise the cuban government. biden then accused sanders of not condemning the cuban government.\n\nthis man said that, in fact, he thought it was -- he did not condemn what they did, biden said.\n\nthat is untrue, categorically untrue, sanders responded.\n\nfacts first: sanders is correct that he has condemned authoritarianism in cuba, but over nearly four decades, he has also repeatedly praised aspects of cuban society. president obama did as well as part of his effort to open relations between the us and the communist island.\n\nfirst, here's what president obama said about cuba in march 2016.\n\nand i said this to president (raul) castro in cuba. i said, look, you've made great progress in educating young people. every child in cuba gets a basic education-- that's a huge improvement from where it was. medical care -- the life expectancy of cubans is equivalent to the united states, despite it being a very poor country, because they have access to health care. that's a huge achievement. they should be congratulated.\n\nin an interview from the 1980s, sanders argued that the longevity of the castro regime was not solely due to its repressive tactics, but a genuine base of support in cuba.\n\nyou may recall way back in, when was it,1961 they invaded cuba and the, everybody was totally convinced the castro was the worst guy in the world. all the cuban people were going to rise up in rebellion against fidel castro, sanders said, discussing the logic behind the kennedy administration's failed bay of pigs coup. they had forgotten that he educated the kids, gave them health care, totally transformed the society.\n\nin 1989, according to the burlington free press, sanders criticized the one-party regime and censorship of the press in the country, but also praised other aspects of the country.\n\nunder (cuban leader fidel) castro, enormous progress has been made in improving the lives of the poor people (and) of the working people, sanders said. on the other hand, in terms of democratic rights, there are enormous deficiencies.\n\nas a third-party candidate for vermont governor in 1976, sanders scoffed at the idea the type of socialism he supported was similar to authoritarianism in china, cuba, and russia.\n\nwe live in vermont, not in cuba, china or russia, sanders said . we have to do what we can to meet the needs of the people here. anyone who says i'm following mao's method, or cuba's or russia's is a lunatic.\n\n-- andrew kaczynski
(cnn) —\n\nfor his entire adult life, and with special vigor during the 2016 campaign, president donald trump has insisted on his skills as a master negotiator.\n\ndeals are my art form, he tweeted in december 2014. other people paint beautifully or write poetry. i like making deals, preferably big deals. that's how i get my kicks.\n\nbut with the federal government again on the precipice of a shutdown, trump's already dubious status as dealmaker-in-chief is facing yet another existential exam – one he appears to be on the verge of failing, amid a series of conflicting, confounding and offending remarks in public and in private conversations with lawmakers.\n\nas a candidate, trump routinely diminished (or, in some cases, accurately assessed the shortcomings) of his opponents' negotiating prowess. during a primary debate, he mocked ted cruz's penchant for senate floor showmanship, dismissing it as mere sound and fury.\n\ni watched ted – and i respected it, but he gets nowhere – stand on the senate floor for a day or two days, and talk and talk and talk, trump said. i watched the other senators laughing and smiling. and when ted was totally exhausted, he left the senate floor, and they went back to work. we have to have somebody that's going to make deals.\n\nthat someone, trump promised, would be him.\n\na couple of years earlier, during the 2013 government shutdown, trump sized up then-president barack obama\n\ni don't think he's a natural dealmaker, trump told cnn that october. it's like sports – you have natural hitters in baseball and natural shotmakers in basketball and natural putters in golf. he's not a natural dealmaker, it doesn't come naturally to him.\n\nlater in the interview, he offered this telling nugget – one you might hear, in a different key, from democrats in 2018 – on the prospect of a short-term deal to end that impasse.\n\nnow, maybe as we're speaking, they're going to make a deal where they do some kind of an extension, but an extension is not what you need, he said. you need the overall deal. we have to make a big deal and it has to be the proper deal for the country.\n\nmore than four years later, one of the core stated rationales underlying trump's pitch to voters is looking flimsy. at best. we know he enjoys the process – the banter, the debate, the fighting – of trying to hammer out an agreement. but his ability to close those deals, as president, has been sorely lacking. even his most significant legislative achievement, the gop's tax bill, was sealed by majority leader mitch mcconnell without even a note of bipartisan support. republican efforts to gut obamacare collapsed under the weight of internal dissent – and confusion stoked by trump's shifting positions on the legislation at hand.\n\ntrump's most notable work on the deal front has focused on busting or damaging them, as he did with the trans-pacific partnership (a massive bipartisan trade deal that other asian countries are now renegotiating without the us), the paris climate accord (by withdrawing the us) and the iran nuclear deal (by threatening to reimpose sanctions on tehran).\n\nnafta, one of the world's largest-ever trade deals, is also under the gun as another round of negotiations near.\n\nwe'll see what happens, trump told reuters this week. i may terminate nafta.\n\nwe'll see, indeed.\n\nnow, with with less than two days to go before the government runs out money, fellow republicans are once again being frustrated by a combination of democratic solidarity and trump's conflicting statements. it's tough to negotiate – or align yourself – with someone whose baseline priorities shift daily, as trump's have on issues as varied as the wall, the children's health insurance program and the futures of hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who have been protected by the expiring deferred action for childhood arrivals program. on all three subjects, trump has publicly vacillated.\n\non wednesday, with the clock ticking down, a clearly frustrated mcconnell called out trump for complicating an already tenuous negotiation.\n\ni'm looking for something that president trump supports, he said. and he's not yet indicated what measure he's willing to sign. as soon as we figure out what he is for, then i would be convinced that we were not just spinning our wheels going to this issue on the floor, but actually dealing with a bill that has a chance to become law and therefore solve the problem.\n\nif the statement seemed rough, it was only because mcconnell has been around long enough to know just how badly stung his gop colleagues would be by their failure to reach an agreement by the end of the week. it's been nearly 40 years since a shutdown struck a washington under one-party control. and back then, pre-1981, the meaning of shutdown was much different. federal workers would usually work through a so-called spending gap, limiting the stakes and mostly shielding the public from any widespread pain.\n\nhere's a look at party breakdowns during past shutdowns:\n\neven as trump tweets out conflicting views on what an acceptable deal might look like – this, after previously saying he'd sign whatever came to his desk – a small group of senators remain hard at work trying to hammer out some kind of agreement to break the deadlock.\n\ntheir incentives, though, are quickly moving in favor of democrats' demands, as democratic members' backs are being stiffened by favorable winds – and a belief that republicans would be the ones to suffer politically if nothing is agreed.\n\nin the last 24 hours we've sensed a real shift from republicans not believing democrats are going to be resolute, to, 'oh my god, democrats are resolute and republicans are joining in and we won't be able to pass the cr without negotiation,' frank sharry, an immigration advocate and founder of america's voice education fund, told cnn's tal kopan on thursday.\n\nthere is a vast and diverse set of circumstances, many pre-dating trump's arrival in washington, that led congress to this latest cliff. but the president has only pushed them closer to the precipice. his reported shithole countries comment and subsequent back-and-forth with himself over what precisely he said, was a drain on republican time and credibility. it also handcuffed democrats, making it more difficult for them to accept anything other than total victory in their showdown with a white house many of their supporters now openly regard as a racist.\n\nspeaking to cnn's manu raju on thursday afternoon, a democrat described the mood among the party's senate caucus as resolute, determined and united. on the other side, republicans like lindsey graham, mike rounds and rand paul have indicated they will not support a month-long continuing resolution, potentially lumping them in with those democrats, all but guaranteeing a shutdown in the absence of a long-term deal.\n\nas the clock ticks down, trump visited pennsylvania to promote the new tax law and stump, unofficially, for a republican congressional candidate at risk of losing a gop-held seat in an upcoming special election.\n\nthen, on friday, it's off again to mar-a-lago – at least, that's the plan. the art of this deal is getting more complicated by the hour.
(cnn) —\n\nthere's a new entry into the rising democratic debate over wide-ranging overhauls of the us health care system, this one from a house democratic freshman who flipped a republican district in 2018.\n\nnew york democratic rep. antonio delgado plans to introduce legislation monday that would allow all americans to buy into a version of medicare – an approach designed to avoid the substantial system-wide overhaul that would come with any effort to create a government-run health care system.\n\nthere's a need here to figure out where we all can come together and rally around achieving – achieving – a real change to our health care system, delgado said in an interview with cnn.\n\nthe move opens up a new front in the democratic debate over the future of health care, which has created divisions that have been laid bare in recent months as progressives in congress make a strong push under the banner of medicare-for-all – that is, ditching the private insurance system and the obamacare exchanges in favor of universal coverage paid for through taxes.\n\nmore than 100 of delgado's colleagues have already signed on as co-sponsors to a medicare for all proposal introduced in february by reps. pramila jayapal and debbie dingell. it has the support house democratic freshmen like reps. alexandria ocasio-cortez and rashida tlaib.\n\nit has also emerged as a purity test for democratic 2020 candidates as they look to navigate an energized party base, with sen. amy klobuchar urging caution as sen. bernie sanders and others embrace the idea.\n\nrepublicans, including president donald trump, have lined up to dismiss medicare for all as socialism and have already laid out a series of attacks they plan to deploy throughout the 2020 election cycle.\n\ndelgado says his goal is a smaller bore overhaul in the marketplace – one that explicitly wouldn't displace people currently using private insurance and would have a mechanism to cover its cost, but still would open the door to universal coverage.\n\nif you introduce a public competitor within the private insurance market place, there is no doubt that will have a real effect on the premiums, on deductibles and it will drive down the cost of health care, delgado said of the bill, which is a companion measure to a proposal already introduced in the senate by democratic sens. tim kaine of virginia and michael bennet of colorado and is similar to a proposal introduced previously by reps. brian higgins and john larson last congress.\n\nboth higgins and larson are original co-sponsors of delgado's bill this time around.\n\nit also sets delgado, who deliberately didn't back medicare for all during the campaign and instead advocated for a medicare buy-in proposal, apart from his more aggressive colleagues who may hail from districts considered more politically safe than his.\n\ndelgado unseated incumbent republican rep. john faso in 2018 by five points – in a district trump won by nearly seven points just two years earlier.\n\nasked whether now having a proposal of his own to tout back home would shield him from criticism on the right, delgado said probably not – but that's fine by him.\n\nthat's not why i do these things. i'm not here to inoculate myself, he said.\n\nthe proposal marks a substantial addition to the current affordable care act, which democrats have rallied around in recent days to protect after the trump administration sided with a texas judge who ruled in december that the entire law should be found unconstitutional.\n\ndemocrats are divided on the future of health care, according to a march poll by the nonprofit health care think tank kaiser family foundation, which showed 44% of those surveyed said congress should focus on improving and protecting obamacare, while 46% said congress should move forward on medicare for all.\n\nthe delgado bill would create a public insurance option on the affordable care act exchanges, alongside the private insurance plans. the goal would be to give americans more choices when buying obamacare coverage, particularly in areas where few carriers participate. the proposal would set premiums for public plan enrollees to cover all the benefit costs, including administrative expenses.\n\nin other words, it would slot into the current system, as opposed to radically overhaul it altogether.\n\ndelgado acknowledged the path forward would be difficult given the stakes – and competing proposals in the debate – but that his goal was to actually find a sweet spot here that allows us to actually navigate these waters and get to a place where we don't just tinker around the system but we actually meaningfully change the system.\n\nthe proposal would be phased in over a period of five years, with the plan's implementation kicking into gear first in rural counties with only one or zero health plan on the current obamacare marketplace, then expanding to the entire country and eventually, opening the door for small businesses to also enroll.\n\ndelgado and his staff have had early stage discussions about the next steps for the bill with the committees that oversee health care policy, as well as democratic leadership, according to an aide, and will seek to use the heft of a freshman class that swept house democrats into power largely running on health care, to bolster the outlook for his effort. a more aggressive effort to line up supporters will be launched in the coming days, delgado said, as he seeks to overcome what he says he's found to be an immediate roadblock in his early months in office: dysfunction.\n\npeople talk to each other in headlines, delgado said. they engage in a fashion that allows for clickbait to ensue. there seems to be very little room for substantive debate on issues that we know are of critical importance. i want figure out how to own that space and be one of hopefully a growing group of individuals in dc who are committed to really doing the business of solutions oriented work.
(cnn) —\n\nearlier this week, the utah legislature passed a measure that would restrict the state's ability to accept medicaid expansion money from the federal government under the affordable care act – a move that essentially undid a ballot initiative – proposition 3 – approved by voters last november.\n\nwhich is a very weird thing for politicians, who depend on channeling the public will, to do. in search of some explanation for this bizarre behavior, i reached out the the salt lake tribune's benjamin wood, who has been all over this medicaid expansion fight.\n\nour conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below.\n\ncillizza: start from the start: who rejected the medicaid expansion under obamacare and why?\n\nwood: the state's republican lawmakers have been critical of the affordable care act since day 1 and made it clear early on they weren't going to bite on the federal incentives to fully expand medicaid. after the scotus ruling making expansion optional, the legislature passed a law prohibiting the governor from adopting expansion without their approval, and subsequently rejected the governor's own expansion plan, colloquially known as healthy utah.\n\na second attempt at healthy utah made it through the state senate at the time, but hit a brick wall in the house. after that there were a series of incremental expansions, which kept the topic alive at the legislature every year, but the debate really flared up again when the ballot initiative started gaining momentum.\n\ncillizza: how did we get from that initial decision to a ballot measure all the way in 2018 that allowed utah voters to have their own say on medicaid expansion?\n\nwood: despite the legislature's opposition, medicaid expansion remained fairly popular among the broader electorate. and groups in the health care and advocacy communities kept banging the drum about hundreds of millions of dollars in federal tax dollars that could be helping sick utahns but for legislative roadblocks.\n\nlawmakers responded by taking some small steps over the years – one mini-expansion came to be known as frail utah because it covered only the most vulnerable residents – and last year passed a partial-expansion plan up to 100% of poverty, largely in reaction to the initiative.\n\nthat plan was on the books at the time of the november vote, but never got the federal waiver it needed to take effect.\n\ncillizza: voters approved expansion with 53% of the vote. and yet, lawmakers took up – and passed – a measure that restricts that expansion. what was the stated reason for this?\n\nwood: cost. and to be clear, cost has been the stated objection all along. the initiative included a tax increase to fund the state's medicaid expenses, but the governor's budget office dropped new estimates after the election that suggested the initiative would run a deficit after a couple years.\n\nthe debate over the replacement bill has included other objections – partisanship, obamacare skepticism, big government opposition, etc. – but the talking point has always been that other states have been harmed by expansion and utah just can't afford to follow suit.\n\ncillizza: how much political danger are gov. herbert and republicans in the legislature courting with this move? seems like a very dumb move, politically speaking?\n\nwood: in short: they're safe. utah is solidly republican and this issue alone won't change that. the blue wave in 2018 may have helped flip a congressional seat, but inside utah it left the gop with a slightly smaller supermajority than they had before. gov. gary herbert has stated he won't seek re-election in 2020, but his successor is all but guaranteed to be a republican, and control of the legislature will remain in republican hands.\n\nbut where this could cause some heartache is for individual gop representatives in the salt lake city suburbs, which have been trending more and more purple. we saw four republicans break rank and vote against the replacement bill, and among the yes votes are a representative who won election by less than 1 percentage point, and another who won re-election with a plurality of votes against a democrat and a third-party challenger. so while there's little danger for the party at large, this issue could play into some swing district results.\n\ncillizza: finish this sentence: in two years, the fallout from this move by republicans will be ____________. now, explain.\n\nwood: ambiguous?\n\nutah is dealing with shifts in its politics that add to this medicaid debate in odd and esoteric ways. there's an ongoing battle over how candidates qualify for party primaries that has exposed factions within the utah republican party, and fueled a larger conversation about whether or not the state's residents are adequately represented.\n\nutah isn't going to stop being a republican state any time in the foreseeable future, but the voter angst and division around medicaid – and other subjects – could play a role in the type of republicans who win elected office in the future.

(cnn) — how could a conscience and religious freedom division in a federal government agency be a bad thing? when it's not your conscience they're talking about. when it's not your religious freedom the division serves to protect. when other people's conscience and religious freedom supersede your constitutional freedoms. and when it's your health care at stake. president donald trump may have campaigned on a wall between the united states and mexico, but his appointees are busily dismantling the wall between our secular government institutions and a particular strain of activist christian evangelicalism. ford vox to bolster its semantic credibility, the new division (its creation was announced last week) is situated within health and human services' office for civil rights. we rely on that office to ensure fair and equal access to the care we need, from making sure that hospitals provide sign-language interpreters for deaf patients to demanding that nursing homes accept patients with hiv. the office is led by roger severino, a trump appointee who once worked for the heritage foundation, the conservative think tank, where he wrote a paper excoriating obamacare for trampling on the freedom of conscience of many in the medical community. the piece explains exactly who he's concerned about helping, and it's not the patient. severino expressed worry about institutions like hospitals that don't want to accommodate transgender people, or employers who don't want their insurance plans to cover gender reassignment surgeries when doing so conflicts with their sincere beliefs. an extremely personal and agonizing choice such as an abortion might violate your employer's beliefs, for example. even your birth control might make a corporation's holding family cringe in horror, as we saw in the hobby lobby case, in which the supreme court ruled that the owners of closely held corporations could opt out, on religious grounds, of covering contraceptives under obamacare. related article supreme court divided over health care mandate\n\nseverino pretended that the law could compel a surgeon to perform a gender reassignment surgery he or she felt unable to do. that's not a realistic concern. it's fundamental to the medical profession that doctors only perform medicine where they are personally convinced they are doing no harm, meaning they have the adequate skills and expertise to deliver the relevant service. a surgeon who doesn't want to perform a technique doesn't get trained in that technique, and doesn't seek clearance to perform it. medical practice is rather different than decorating a cake.\n\nthe more realistic concern is if the physician staff of a hospital, able and willing to perform such procedures, found itself blocked by the religious beliefs of a board or administrative officers, or if individual ancillary staff at the hospital balked at providing postoperative support to such a patient.\n\nbut severino's priorities extend well beyond blocking medical procedures for people he apparently doesn't value. he's eager to see health care providers freely disrespect their gay and transgender patients.\n\nhe wrote: gender identity and sexual orientation, unlike race or sex, are changeable, self-reported, and entirely self-defined characteristics. government should not grant special privileges on such bases when legal recognition of a group as a 'protected class' is, with few exceptions, reserved for groups with objectively identifiable immutable characteristics. presumably mr. severino thinks any religious values health care providers hold are more immutable than their patients' beliefs.\n\nthis latest trump administration action is part of a slew of recent health care policies that our government is using to wage culture wars rather than treat health care as a vital service we all need.\n\nbesides ocr's new conscience division, we've seen the republican government allow medicaid work requirements, and implicate medicaid access in the opioid crisis. we've seen the president appoint unqualified people to key jobs in drug policy and health care agencies, and propose slashing the budget of the office of national drug control policy. the trump administration even appointed a contraception opponent to lead an hhs program involving contraception.\n\nthe unifying theme of it all is an anti-humanist mindset that equates any difficulty or need to a moral failing. if you're poor in america, or perhaps simply not rich enough to be entirely self-reliant (maybe you work for someone else rather than leading your own highly successful enterprise), everyone wants to be your judge and jury, chief among us a president who equates economic success with personal fulfillment and validation.\n\nas president trump celebrated himself in front of a crowd of global corporate leaders at the recent world economic forum in davos, switzerland, we're reminded who his government really cares about. whether you're from a shithole country, or are simply not a multimillionaire, the bottom line is that you're disposable.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nthere's nothing wrong with encouraging people to work. there's everything wrong with our government declaring that if you don't work, we'll let you die like the scum that you are. decent people, and a decent government, don't predicate basic health care on whether or not we are employed, gay, female or transgender. our president and his party make themselves out to be moral arbiters and are right now using our most essential government functions to play out this charade.\n\nhealth care is not a ministry, and it's not a golden opportunity for companies to rule their employees' lives. it is simply a precondition of life itself. doctors and nurses make no attempt to judge the people we serve. but our government, mistaking itself for a higher power, wants that role. in turn, it is our government we must judge.

focused on 2020. democrats are hitting the campaign trail across the country this\n\n\n\nweekend, traveling to early primary and caucus states, as two major contenders enter the race this weekend.\n\n\n\ndemocratic senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts officially launched her bid saturday, challenging the system she says is rigged for the rich and calling president trump a symptom of what's wrong in america.\n\n\n\nsenator amy klobuchar from minnesota is expected to announce she's running later this afternoon.\n\n\n\n2020 is also clearly on president trump's mind. saturday, he lashed out at senator warren on twitter, alluding to her past claims of native american status, for which she has apologized. the president appeared to make a joking reference to the tragic trail of tears relocation and genocide of native americans.\n\n\n\none unexpected issue the 2020 candidates have been forced to confront on the trail, the continued controversy surrounding the top three officials in virginia, all democrats.\n\n\n\nthere are now two women accusing lieutenant governor justin fairfax of sexual assault. and late saturday, both women announced they would be willing to testify in any impeachment hearings. fairfax maintains the encounters were consensual and says he should be given due process.\n\n\n\none 2020 candidate who has had to respond to all of this on the trail, the mayor of south bend, indiana, pete buttigieg. he's a rhodes scholar and navy veteran who served in afghanistan and who is running to make history as the youngest president ever elected and the first openly gay man to serve in that role.\n\n\n\nand he joins me now.\n\n\n\nmayor buttigieg, welcome to state of the union. thank you so much for being with us.\n\n\n\nbuttigieg: good morning. thanks for having me.\n\n\n\ntapper: so, i want to start with what's going on in virginia.\n\n\n\nyou said you don't see how lieutenant governor fairfax can continue to lead anymore after these two accusations, one of sexual assault, one of rape.\n\n\n\nfairfax is calling for an investigation, adding -- quote -- i'm asking that no one rush to judgment, and i'm asking for there to be space in this moment for due process.\n\n\n\nwhat is the standard for you to call for someone to step down? is the accused entitled to due process before he is forced to resign?\n\n\n\nbuttigieg: well, you are certainly entitled to due process in a criminal investigation. when it comes to the question of holding political office, i think\n\n\n\nit's really a matter of whether you can effectively lead. and when you have somebody, especially at this very sensitive time for the office of lieutenant governor, when you have somebody facing multiple credible accusations, i just don't see how he can continue to serve.\n\n\n\ntapper: meanwhile, governor ralph northam is fending off his own calls to resign, after he admitted to wearing blackface in 1984.\n\n\n\nhe told the washington post yesterday that he wants to focus on racial inequality in areas such as housing and health care over the rest of his term.\n\n\n\nis that good enough for you? is a gubernatorial tone of reconciliation good enough, or do you still think he should he resign?\n\n\n\nbuttigieg: well, it doesn't seem to me that he has the confidence that's required in him in order to continue to lead the state.\n\n\n\nunfortunately, the way he handled those allegations and revelations seems to have made things even worse. and i think that's why you see a pretty strong sense among leaders in virginia. and, by the way, this is, of course, something for virginians to figure out. but they seem to be pretty unified that they want a new governor and leadership that can carry that state forward.\n\n\n\ntapper: let's talk about some issues.\n\n\n\nseveral 2020 candidates are backing a new resolution which outlines what is called a green new deal. it was introduced by congresswoman alexandria ocasio-cortez in the house and senator ed markey in the senate.\n\n\n\nthis plans calls for -- quote -- removing pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and industry, as much as is technologically feasible with a 10-year outline.\n\n\n\n[09:05:02]\n\n\n\nobviously, something like that would completely overhaul industries across the midwest, including in indiana. do you have any concerns about how the green new deal might affect your constituents or your state?\n\n\n\nbuttigieg: well, like a lot of other things that have come along and have impacted us in the industrial midwest -- trade comes to mind -- we have got to make sure, this time around, that it's done in a way that benefits us, that benefits workers, more than it harms them.\n\n\n\nlook, there's always going to be change and disruption. as a town that grew up around the auto industry producing studebakers until the 1960s, we know firsthand what those disruptions can mean.\n\n\n\nbut there's also tremendous opportunity here. look, we're not only being disrupted by economic change. we're being disrupted by climate change. we have had multiple cases, two different cases of floods, historic floods here in south bend, of the kind we're told to expect every 1,000 years or so. and they happened within 18 months of each other.\n\n\n\nso, this is a national emergency. and the -- i think the elegance from a policy perspective of the concept of the green new deal is, it matches a sense of urgency about that problem of climate change with a sense of opportunity around what the solutions might represent.\n\n\n\neven right now, one of the biggest recent announcements in our county of added union jobs in the auto industry was at a facility making electric vehicles. i think a green new deal would promote that. and so that could be good news for us here in the industrial midwest.\n\n\n\ntapper: do you endorse the markey/ocasio-cortez green new deal?\n\n\n\nbuttigieg: yes, i think it's the right beginning.\n\n\n\nlook, it's a framework. obviously, the green new deal, as we have seen it so far, is more of a plan than it is a fully articulated set of policies. but the idea that we need to race toward that goal and that we should do it in a way that enhances the economic justice and the level of economic opportunity in our country, i believe that's exactly the right direction to be going in.\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nbuttigieg: everybody is going to have their...\n\n\n\ntapper: go ahead.\n\n\n\nbuttigieg: everybody is going to have their own twists or features they're going to add.\n\n\n\nas a mayor, i would like to see it funding more things that would help our cities become sustainable. and there are other developments that are going to have to come along to establish exactly how we can meet those goals.\n\n\n\nbut they're the right goals, especially if you come at this from a generational perspective. you know, for me, the question of what the world is going to look like in 2054, which is when i'm going to reach the current age of the current president, that's not a theoretical question. that's a personal question.\n\n\n\nand it's very clear that we can't go on like this. i mean, these weather extremes we're experiencing now are what we were warned about to expect in these years in the '70s and '80s by science.\n\n\n\ntapper: mm-hmm.\n\n\n\nbuttigieg: i shudder to think about the fact that, god willing, i will be alive to see the consequences in the 2050s of the predictions that are being made right now.\n\n\n\ntapper: you have said that young people don't see as much conflict between the concept of capitalism and the concept of socialism as past generations have seen.\n\n\n\npresident trump has been pretty clear that he's going to try to use the idea of socialism as a point of attack against democrats.\n\n\n\ntake a listen to what he said at the state of the union address.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\ntrump: here, in the united states, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country.\n\n\n\ntonight, we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country.\n\n\n\n(cheering and applause)\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ntapper: are you worried at all that that might be an effective attack against democrats?\n\n\n\nbuttigieg: i think he's clinging to a rhetorical strategy that was very powerful when he was coming of age 50 years ago, but it's just a little bit different right now.\n\n\n\ni know, if you grew up during that cold war period, then you saw a time in politics when the word socialism could be used to end an argument.\n\n\n\ntoday, i think a word like that is the beginning of a debate, not the end of the debate.\n\n\n\nlook, america is committed to democracy, and we're essentially a market-based economy. but you can't -- you can no longer simply kill off a line of discussion about a policy by saying that it's socialist.\n\n\n\nif someone my age or younger is weighing a policy idea, and somebody comes along and says, you can't do that, it's socialist, i think our answer is going to be, ok, is it a good idea or is it not?\n\n\n\nand that word has also lost its power, especially when you think about the way it was applied to characterize, for example, the aca, an idea that was invented at the conservative...\n\n\n\ntapper: the affordable care act, yes.\n\n\n\nbuttigieg: the affordable care act, obamacare, invented by a conservative think tank, relying on market principles, implemented first by a republican governor.\n\n\n\ntapper: mm-hmm.\n\n\n\nbuttigieg: and they said that was socialist. so, i think the word has mostly lost its meaning. and it's certainly lost its ability to be used as a kill switch on debate. tapper: earlier on the show, you said that you will be president\n\n\n\ntrump's age in 2054. you are 37 years old. you're the youngest candidate in the democratic field. if elected, you would be the youngest president ever. president trump is the oldest president ever elected president.\n\n\n\nyou have said it's time for a -- quote -- new generation in american leadership. does that inherently mean that it's time for the older generation, say, politicians over 70, their time has come and gone, they shouldn't run?\n\n\n\n[09:10:00]\n\n\n\nbuttigieg: well, i think there's an opportunity for different generations to come together.\n\n\n\nit's one of the things i saw firsthand when i was in iowa over the last couple of days talking to voters. the only group that was more interested in generational change than the youngest voters i met were the voters who were about my parents' age.\n\n\n\nand i think that shows, if you're from an older generation, you care about the world that you're leaving. if you're from my generation, you're thinking about the world that we're going to continue living into.\n\n\n\ni do think that those of us who are from a younger generation have a very personal, very direct stake. and i think it's not an accident that the whole country right now, in terms of our policy debate, is responding to proposals put forward by a member of congress who is even younger than i am.\n\n\n\ntapper: all right, mayor buttigieg, thanks so much for joining us today. we appreciate it.\n\n\n\nbuttigieg: thank you.\n\n\n\ntapper: democrats are hailing a sweeping new proposal to combat climate change, so why is president trump applauding their efforts on twitter?\n\n\n\nplus: lawmakers are working on a compromise to avoid another government shutdown, but will president trump sign on to the deal?\n\n\n\nwe will ask the number three house republican, conference chair liz cheney, next.\n\n\n\nstay with us.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\ntapper: welcome back to state of the union. i'm jake tapper.\n\n\n\npresident trump is heading to the border town of el paso tomorrow, trying to keep the focus on his border wall just days before the government is set to partially shut down again over wall funding. [09:15:03]\n\n\n\non capitol hill, lawmakers are trying to seem hopeful that they can come up with a deal that the president will agree to. the latest negotiations center around about $2 billion for border barriers. that is short of the $5.7 billion president trump said he wanted.\n\n\n\njoining me now to discuss this and much more, the third-ranking republican in the house, conference chair liz cheney. the congresswoman joins us from casper, wyoming.\n\n\n\ncongresswoman, good to see you. thanks for joining us.\n\n\n\nrep. liz cheney (r), wyoming: thanks for having me, jake. great to be with you.\n\n\n\ntapper: so, the federal government will partially shut down on friday if president trump and congress cannot find a compromise on the president's border wall.\n\n\n\ndo you think republicans in congress can convince president trump to sign off on about $2 billion for border barriers, or are you more skeptical? do you think we're headed for another shutdown?\n\n\n\ncheney: well, i certainly hope we're not headed for another shutdown.\n\n\n\ni think the president has been clear and the republicans in the house have certainly been clear that we absolutely have got to secure the border.\n\n\n\nyou know, i thought it was interesting, when you watched the negotiations that have been going on between the -- our bipartisan and bicameral committee, when the committee members had a chance to go visit the border, when the committee members had a chance to hear from border patrol agents themselves in testimony, it really made a difference, i think.\n\n\n\nand i think that there's -- there's bipartisan agreement we have got to secure the border. i think there are some members of leadership on the democratic side, in particular speaker pelosi, who is really out there on her own, saying things like walls are immoral and she will only allow $1 for a wall.\n\n\n\nthe american people want the border secure. so, i'm hopeful that this committee will be able to come up with a proposal that we can all support, that the president can sign. but it's going to have to include funding that will allow us to secure the border, and it will have to include funding for some sort of a barrier.\n\n\n\ntapper: so, but $2 billion, theoretically -- you're not agreeing right now to anything, but $2 billion for border barriers would be a compromise for you that you would be willing to accept, theoretically?\n\n\n\ncheney: well, you're not going to be surprised, jake. i'm not going to negotiate about it this morning on your show. i think it's going to have to be sufficient funds through an agreement, hopefully, that we can reach that will enable us to know that, moving forward, we will be able to have a wall, have a barrier on those parts of the border where it's really necessary.\n\n\n\nand, you know, i think there's been a lot of mistruth out there about this. you have seen the democrats try to suggest that we want to build a 2,000-mile-long wall. that's absolutely not the case.\n\n\n\nbut what we're talking about is something that's very practical. where it's necessary, where it's needed, where our border patrol agents say that it will help us control and stop the flood of illegal immigrants across the border, we need to have a border wall.\n\n\n\ntapper: i want to turn to foreign policy.\n\n\n\ntake a listen to president trump at the state of the union address.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\ntrump: as a candidate for president, i loudly pledged a new approach. great nations do not fight endless wars.\n\n\n\nit is time to give our brave warriors in syria a warm welcome home.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ntapper: so, president trump said he's probably going to make a formal announcement this week announcing that the u.s.-led coalition now controls 100 percent of isis territory in syria.\n\n\n\nyou're on the house armed services committee. why not bring the troops home?\n\n\n\ncheney: well, i think several things.\n\n\n\nnumber one, we have done tremendous work, both in syria, as well as in afghanistan. but, in syria, the issue is not the territorial control. in syria, the issue is whether or not we're able to ensure that isis doesn't reconstitute.\n\n\n\nand we have got about -- we have had about 2,200 special operations forces there. they have been doing crucially important work that you can only do from there, providing air support, providing some artillery support, helping to work with the local forces to really help ensure the defeat of isis.\n\n\n\nit's got to be an enduring defeat, though. and so, when you have a situation like we have now, where you're -- you have seen the caliphate -- as the president is saying, there will be this announcement that the caliphate has been 100 percent taken back. i hope that's right.\n\n\n\nbut you cannot be -- we can't be fooled into thinking, you know, if we just withdraw the troops now and we come home, isis won't reconstitute. we have got to ensure that we do everything necessary to prevent them from forming safe havens.\n\n\n\nwe know that there are significant numbers of isis fighters still in syria today. and we don't want to have to go back again. i think that would come at much greater cost of lives and treasure.\n\n\n\ntapper: so, this puts you and your philosophy at odds with president trump.\n\n\n\nyou have defined victory in the middle east as -- quote -- that we don't have another 9/11, adding -- quote -- that may require that we're there for a long time.\n\n\n\nhow do you respond to the president's criticism that your approach essentially means having u.s. service members in syria and afghanistan indefinitely?\n\n\n\ncheney: you know, i think, first of all, president trump has had tremendous success across the board on a whole range of national security issues.\n\n\n\nhe was absolutely right to withdraw from the iran nuclear agreement, absolutely right to withdraw -- to announce that we will withdraw from the inf. he's had tremendous success and has done exactly the right thing in terms of resources for the pentagon over the last two years.\n\n\n\n[09:20:06]\n\n\n\nand so i support very much what he's done there. but i think that, in the same way that we saw with president obama, you do not end a war by withdrawing from the battlefield.\n\n\n\nand, when president obama did that, and he withdrew our forces from iraq precipitously, you ended up with civil war in syria. you ended up with the rise of isis. you ended up with the caliphate.\n\n\n\ni don't want to see us go down that path again. so i think it's very important for us to remember, you know, the taliban -- al qaeda is embedded with the taliban in afghanistan. the taliban will not live up to any negotiated deal that we set with them.\n\n\n\nthe notion that we're somehow going to have a negotiated deal with the taliban, that we can take their word that they won't allow al qaeda to have safe havens again, is, in my view, irresponsible.\n\n\n\nand we have got to ensure that our forces are there based on the conditions on the ground, not based on, frankly, what has been rand paul's approach, which is, you know what, i have just decided it's too long, we're going to come home.\n\n\n\nyou don't win wars that way. you don't keep the nation safe that way.\n\n\n\ntapper: i want you to take a look at something the president tweeted last night.\n\n\n\nhe wrote -- quote -- today, elizabeth warren, sometimes referred to by me as pocahontas, joined the race for president. will she run as our first native american presidential candidate, or has she decided that, after 32 years, this is not playing so well anymore? see you on the campaign trail, liz.\n\n\n\nthe word trail in all-caps, an apparent reference to the tragedy the trail of tears. just a few weeks ago, the president also made a reference to wounded knee in a joking manner when talking about elizabeth warren.\n\n\n\nyou represent thousands of native americans in wyoming. do you concerns about the president joking about these horrific tragedies?\n\n\n\ncheney: you know, i have concerns about somebody like elizabeth warren -- warren pretending to be a native american.\n\n\n\nyou're absolutely right. i do represent thousands of native americans here in wyoming. and the notion that anybody of any political party would pretend that they were a member of a tribe or would pretend that they were native american and would do it, as she seemed to have done it, in order to get benefits, that is, in my view, the disgrace.\n\n\n\nand so i think she's made herself a laughingstock. you -- i -- i wonder whether or not anybody around her is saying, you know, it's -- it's time to say this just isn't going to work, because i think, at this point, each time she sort of tries to take one more step to show that she wasn't claiming membership in a tribe or claiming that she was a native american in order to get benefits, we see that it wasn't true.\n\n\n\ntapper: so, i -- i hear what you're saying about elizabeth warren, but what about the language that the president uses and the joking references to genocide against native americans?\n\n\n\ncheney: look, elizabeth warren has made herself a laughingstock. and i don't think anybody should be surprised that that's been the reaction to -- to her and to her continued claims.\n\n\n\nand we saw just last week that she -- she said she was a native american on her application for membership in at least one state bar association. you know, one wonders whether or not that's grounds for disbarment. if you misrepresent yourself on your application to the bar, i would say it probably is grounds for disbarment.\n\n\n\nso she -- she's made herself a laughingstock. i think the longer that she's out there, the more that people are going to be talking about this. and -- and it's just -- it's clear that, you know, she's somebody who can't be trusted.\n\n\n\ntapper: ok, so no comment on what the president had to say.\n\n\n\ncongresswoman liz cheney, thank you so much for joining us. hope to have you back again sometime soon. have fun in wyoming?\n\n\n\ncheney: thanks, jake. good to be with you.\n\n\n\ntapper: saudi arabia is denying any connection to the leak of amazon ceo jeff bezos' text messages to the national enquirer. so, what exactly did bezos mean when he referred to a saudi connection?\n\n\n\nwe're going to talk to a member of the senate foreign relations next. stay with us.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[09:27:54]\n\n\n\ntapper: welcome back to state of the union. i'm jake tapper.\n\n\n\nhouse democrats are launching hearings and investigations into the trump administration and working with their senate counterparts to unveil sweeping new policies on matters such as health care and climate change.\n\n\n\n(begin videotape)\n\n\n\ntapper: joining me now is democratic senator chris murphy of connecticut. he's also a member of the senate foreign relations committee.\n\n\n\nsenator, thanks so much for being here.\n\n\n\nsen. chris murphy (d), connecticut: yes, thanks for having me.\n\n\n\ntapper: so, i want to start with this crisis in virginia with the three top officials.\n\n\n\nand, specifically, i want to ask you about one that's very pressing this weekend. lieutenant governor fairfax has called for an investigation into the allegations against him from two women, citing the need for due process.\n\n\n\nhe added -- quote -- our american values don't just work when it's convenient. they must be applied at the most difficult of times.\n\n\n\nmany democrats have called for him to step down in light of these allegations of sexual assault of 2004, alleged, and a rape, alleged, in 2000.\n\n\n\nwhat's your standard for determining whether or not somebody should have to resign?\n\n\n\nmurphy: well, these are very serious allegations, when you're talking about sexual assault and rape.\n\n\n\nand the question is whether he can continue to perform his duties while he is trying to litigate these very serious claims. and, you know, i tend to defer to people like tim kaine and mark warner when it comes to virginia politics. they've called on him to step down. that certainly seems to be the right move for me.\n\n\n\nagain, these are very serious allegations. and it's just not clear to me how he can continue to do his job while he's trying to contest these claims.\n\n\n\ntapper: i guess the argument he's -- he's making here is, he deserves due process, like anyone else deserves due process.\n\n\n\nand i just wonder what the standard is, because, you know, i don't think we've really ever had a national conversation. obviously, it's great that society has evolved, and now we're taking accusation made by women seriously, and that didn't used to be the case.\n\n\n\nbut, by the same token, is it just one credible accusation? is it more than one credible accusation? where does due process fall into it? i just don't think that there's any one standard.\n\n\n\nmurphy: well, i think the nature of the allegations do matter. and these allegations are serious.\n\n\n\none of these allegations is an allegation of rape. that's a crime that you can go to jail for, for a very long time. and so i think that you have to look at the circumstances of every case. these are serious.\n\n\n\n[09:30:00]\n\n\n\ntapper: meanwhile, the government is just five days away from another potential government shutdown. democrats have previously vowed not to give the president any money for any wall but there's this group of bipartisan lawmakers working on a compromise that according to sources could include up to $2 billion if not more for border barriers. whatever you want to call them. a wall, border barriers.\n\n\n\nis it fair to assume that democrats will end up supporting at least some funding for some sort of barrier at the border at the end of the day?\n\n\n\nmurphy: well, you know, the budget bill that we passed in the senate through a committee last year provided for $1.6 billion in new border security money and, of course, members of the senate have voted in the past for border security money, including barrier funding. i think the problem now is we've only got about seven months left on the fiscal year. so i don't think the president can actually spend much more than $2 billion, but, of course, we're willing to compromise. of course we're willing to put more money into border security.\n\n\n\ni'll be interested to see what the compromise looks like before i commit to voting for it or against it. the real tragedy here, jake, is that we should be able to do a bigger comprehensive immigration reform bill and the president two years ago had the ability to take 25 billion dollars for border security in exchange for protection for the dreamers and didn't take it. i hope we can have that bigger conversation some time soon.\n\n\n\ntapper: well, i think you would argue that it was authorized but not appropriated but i don't want to get into the weeds of all of that.\n\n\n\nback in october, you and the rest of the senate foreign relations committee invoked a law that requires president trump to determine whether or not the saudi crown prince, mbs, was responsible, directly or indirectly for the death of journalist jamal khashoggi. that deadline came and went on friday with no response from the white house. the white house saying that the president -- quote -- maintains his discretion to decline to act on congressional committee's request when appropriate.\n\n\n\nyour response?\n\n\n\nmurphy: this isn't an informal committee request. the law requires that when the chairman and the ranking member of the foreign relations committee ask the president to make a finding as to a human rights violation overseas, he has to respond. he has to respond. that's what the law says. he doesn't have an option here.\n\n\n\nnow i understand why he doesn't want to make this determination. his intelligence services are telling him that mohammed bin salman was responsible and because either of a personal relationship he has or a business relationship he has with saudi arabia, he is declining to make that finding to congress. but this isn't his general executive discretion. he has to, under the law --\n\n\n\ntapper: he didn't.\n\n\n\nmurphy: -- make a determination and he didn't.\n\n\n\ntapper: so what now?\n\n\n\nmurphy: listen, i assume we can go to court to try to make the president comply with this law. we can raise political pressure as we will this year. or we can move forward with sanctions. and i think that's probably the most appropriate step.\n\n\n\ncongress doesn't have to wait for the president to fulfill his duty. we can just make a determination that mohammed bin salman ordered these murders and there should be some kind of penalty and repercussion for that.\n\n\n\nmurphy: speaking of murky situations with the saudis. amazon founder jeff bezos wrote an extraordinary essay on medium this week accusing the national enquirer parent company of trying to extort him over explicit photographs sent to his extra marital girlfriend. in that essay bezos refers to -- quote -- the saudi angle.\n\n\n\nhe seems to be suggesting he and his team seems to be suggesting the saudis had something to do with the national enquirer obtaining these explicit photographs. what do you make of it?\n\n\n\nmurphy: i really don't know what to make of it. so i'm hoping that the saudis have nothing to do with it. it's a very oblique reference so it's hard for policymakers to understand.\n\n\n\nbut what we do know is that foreign governments are constantly trying to infiltrate the american political process. and one of the reasons why we worry about president trump not taking a stronger stand on what the russians did in 2016 is that it seems to be an invitation for others to try to manipulate our political process in other ways. so i don't know anything about jeff bezos' sort of oblique claims, but i know that this is a constant problem that we have to be vigilant about.\n\n\n\ntapper: you co-sponsored a resolution outlining a green new deal in the senate this week that calls for a sweeping overhaul of the entire u.s. economy in 10 years by -- quote -- meeting 100 percent of the power demand in the united states through clean, renewable and zero emission energy sources.\n\n\n\na fellow senator who caucuses with the democrats, independent senator angus king of maine as well as obama's former energy secretary ernest moniz say they don't think that this plan is realistic.\n\n\n\nmurphy: i think it's absolutely realistic and i frankly think we need to set our sights high. i think there are a lot of people who said that it wasn't realistic for the united states to get a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s when president kennedy initially outlined that goal. but we did it. and i think we have to set our sights high.\n\n\n\ni have a 10-year-old and 7-year-old. global warming is an existential threat to the planet. and so if we don't command this country to think big about saving our nation and our world from destruction, then i don't think we're going to get close to meeting the mark.\n\n\n\n[09:35:01]\n\n\n\ntapper: all right. i have a lot more questions about the green new deal. hopefully you can come back --\n\n\n\nmurphy: will do.\n\n\n\ntapper: -- talk to me during the week or another sunday. senator murphy, thanks so much for being here.\n\n\n\nmurphy: thanks, jake.\n\n\n\npresident trump wasted no time attacking elizabeth warren over her campaign kickoff. does that mean the president thinks warren is the one to beat? we'll discuss, next. stay with us.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nsen. cory booker (d), new jersey: it takes a lot of courage to come forward. these are folks with a lot of contemporaneous details. this is a time that i just believe it's time for him to step down.\n\n\n\nsen. kirsten gillibrand (d), new york: the second allegation has been corroborated. that added to the first allegation, which i personally found credible, leads me to call for his resignation.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ntapper: senators booker and gillibrand, two 2020 democrats in early voting states this weekend. both of them responding to the scandals plaguing democrats in virginia. many of them calling for lieutenant governor justin fairfax to resign.\n\n\n\n[09:40:02]\n\n\n\nfairfax says he isn't going anywhere, at least not yet. let's discuss with our experts here.\n\n\n\nken, you were the former attorney general for the commonwealth of virginia. what's going on in your state, top three officials, all democrats, under fire?\n\n\n\nken cuccinelli, cnn legal commentator: and all within a week all of these things exploding and literally almost in two-day increments starting with the governor, of course, with his blackface pictures was what took this national. it isn't what started it in virginia and then justin fairfax with the first sexual assault allegation.\n\n\n\nand you saw two 2020 democrat contenders there reference the second allegation, but when the first one came out, he immediately came out and was shooting at the accuser, rhetorically speaking, of course --\n\n\n\ntapper: yes.\n\n\n\ncuccinelli: -- and using the washington post as a shield. and they immediately called him out on that. so he is really violated rule number one when you're in a hole. stop digging. and now he's saying i'm not going anywhere. but tomorrow i expect democrats to submit a resolution of impeachment in virginia. and that will begin a process that has not been used in virginia in our lifetimes.\n\n\n\ntapper: are you worried at all, congresswoman, about the effect this is having on the 2020 candidates, on the democratic party, on anything having to do with the agenda that you want to put forward?\n\n\n\nrep. nanette diaz barragan (d-ca), homeland security committee: we need virginians to have somebody that can lead in that position. and that's my concern.\n\n\n\ntapper: which position? there are three people under fire. governor, lieutenant governor or attorney general?\n\n\n\ndiaz barragan: i thought you were referencing the lieutenant governor. and we do need people in virginia who can lead. we don't want to be distracted.\n\n\n\nlook, democrats want to talk about our agenda. we want to talk about lowering prescription drug prices. we want to talk about health care, having access to care. we want to talk about climate change. so we would like to talk about those issues and certainly make sure we avert a government shutdown.\n\n\n\ntapper: are you at all concerns, senator turner, about the image of impeachment proceedings against an african-american lieutenant governor while the attorney general and the governor who have both admitted dressing up in blackface escape any consequences? nina turner, cnn political commentator: very concerned, jake. i was going to say, i hope that the legislature starts impeachment for all three of these folks. you know, what a hell of a way to start off black history month. totally (inaudible).\n\n\n\nyou know, i'm black 365 but let's just say black history month is in february. we started off with this. we're 400 years from 1619 to 2019.\n\n\n\nthe first 20 africans brought from angola they didn't sign up and jump on the boat or the ship themselves. brought over to this country to jamestown, virginia, as slaves. my message to nonblack people, don't wear a blackface. look at the rainbow mosaic of the black faces in this country. those are the only black faces you should be talking about.\n\n\n\n(inaudible) the hypocrisy in terms of this governor thinking he even weighed in on whether or not lieutenant governor fairfax should go. all three of them need to go. and it is not a distraction to talk about racism in this country because it is in the dna of this country.\n\n\n\nit's the first thing that this country was founded on. racism and bigotry and we've just got to understand that.\n\n\n\ntapper: so, congresswoman love -- yes?\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ncuccinelli: the attorney general himself called for the governor to resign when the governor's blackface pictures came out.\n\n\n\ntapper: yes. knowing that he had his own.\n\n\n\ncuccinelli: which tells you he thought he was going to get away with it.\n\n\n\nturner: arrogance. arrogance.\n\n\n\ncuccinelli: it is arrogance. i agree. and four days later he's admitting it himself and he's still there.\n\n\n\nmia love (r), former utah congresswoman: (inaudible) and arrogance. look, there is no daylight on this issue with anyone that we've actually seen. that has said these people have to go.\n\n\n\ni've always presumed and i will continuously say this. you are innocent until you're proven guilty but can you govern? can you actually lead the state and start talking about policy issues?\n\n\n\nnow remember the first time that we were talking about this governor was on the policy of the abortion issue. the third trimester abortion issue. we've gotten away from even talking about that, and we're going into his contempt for -- like (ph) his contempt people of color and then now we're going into the lieutenant governor. this is just it, which is actually a criminal accusation. so they really have got to just wipe everything clean, start all over so that we can govern and --\n\n\n\nturner: jake, can i add --- i just want to add to what the congresswoman is saying. this is not just about people of color. i want folks to understand this.\n\n\n\nthis is anti blackness. so let's make this clear. this is anti blackness. blackface in the mid to late 19th century, 1800s was about mocking black people, our humanity. our beauty, our culture, what we mean to this country.\n\n\n\nso this ain't a conversation about people of color. this is a conversation about anti black racism, white supremacy in the united states of america.\n\n\n\ntapper: so, governor ralph northam came out of hiding and gave an interview to the washington post saying that he wants to focus on racial inequality during the rest of the time as governor.\n\n\n\n[09:45:03]\n\n\n\nhere's what he said -- quote -- there are ongoing inequities to access to things like education, health care, mortgages, capital, entrepreneurship. i want to heal that pain, and i want to make sure all virginias have equal opportunity. and i think i'm the person that can do that for virginia.\n\n\n\nturner: too little too late.\n\n\n\nlove: no credibility. actually i'm offended by that. i'm offended.\n\n\n\nit's almost like let me -- let me fix what's going on here so i -- let me go and focus on something else so that people can stop focusing on the things i did when i was 25.\n\n\n\ncuccinelli: and he wants to have his repentance as the governor of virginia. look. you resign --\n\n\n\nturner: yes.\n\n\n\ncuccinelli: -- and you go get your own repentance and you let us continue on in virginia with actual governance by people who legitimately ought to be in the office.\n\n\n\ntapper: let me ask you a question, congresswoman, as the elected democrat at the table, if all three of them resign, then i believe the republican speaker of the house of delegates becomes governor. you don't want that.\n\n\n\ndiaz barragan: no, but we need to think about doing what's right and what's right for virginians and what's right overall. i mean, the race issue in today's day and age with the president at the helm who has been one of the most divisive presidents and, frankly, racist himself, is a conversation we do need to have. but looking at just the line of order and saying we're not going to do that because of the consequence is not the right way to do this. and so for me, i would -- i do think we need to have this conversation and we should continue to have this conversation, but it has to be front and center. and we can't forget about the person who is dividing us and who himself is injecting this into the country to live up again and coming out again. we haven't seen it be this bad in recent time until the president has really made this a race issue whether it's about african-americans, certainly he's doing it all over the board with immigrants, but we need to have this conversation.\n\n\n\nturner: jake, i cannot. i just can't. 1984, 1980, gucci just a few days ago. this is not about president donald trump. this is about racism in the united states of america. congresswoman, i hear you, but on this, we're not blaming president trump.\n\n\n\ndiaz barragan: i'm saying he has divided this country --\n\n\n\nturner: no, let me just say this.\n\n\n\ndiaz barragan: he is using --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nturner: i am not going to continue to let politicians use this man as the excuse to deal with racism in this country. it's been going on for far too long in the united states of america. we need some real truth and reconciliation.\n\n\n\nyes, president trump is a racist. there is no doubt about it. but as we have seen, democrats delve in racism as well. we've got to stop making this about who is a republican, who is a democrat. i want to know who say humanitarian.\n\n\n\ndiaz barragan (ph): that's right.\n\n\n\nturner: i want to know who's going to stand up for people's lives, starting with black people's lives. because when you take care of black lives everybody's life is taken care of. everyone's life taken care of.\n\n\n\nso no more about this -- these three men. it had nothing to do with president trump. what lieutenant governor fairfax is going through don't have nothing to do with president trump. northam wearing blackface don't have nothing to do with donald trump.\n\n\n\nherring, wearing blackface has nothing to do with donald trump. this is about racism in the dna of this country. and i am over it.\n\n\n\nwe are traumatized, jake, and we are sick of it. politicians need to stop playing games.\n\n\n\nlove: what is being said is exactly right. it's about personal responsibility for your own actions and things you've done. when he was 25 years old, it wasn't -- he couldn't blame trump for his behavior at 25 years old. i mean, you can't --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk) turner: and in medical school.\n\n\n\nlove: -- take responsibility for the things you do. and i think that that's a problem with virginia governor is that first he said, oh, i'm sorry. yes, that was me i'm sorry about the picture. then it was like, well, i don't really remember.\n\n\n\nand his wife is keeping him from actually moonwalking. i mean, this is a person that does not know what were the appropriate levels are. i mean, he cannot -- he can't govern.\n\n\n\nso it's absolutely time for him to go and wipe the slate clean. and i appreciate by the way the representative saying that this has nothing to do with what -- you know who is next in line and the risk of republicans actually taking office. this has to do with right and wrong, and this -- these are clearly the wrong places for these people.\n\n\n\ncuccinelli: i appreciate those comments as well, but -- and i'm not speaking to you, but they're new on the democrat side. ralph northam got universal calls for resignation when this became the whole democrat power structure. it got really quiet.\n\n\n\ntapper: well, there haven't been --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\ntapper: -- for herring to resign.\n\n\n\ncuccinelli: until -- until the second sexual assault allegation. then it broke it loose again. but if you look at that timeline it got very quiet, and it was, we might be more accepting of racism or rape than we are of republicans. it started to look like that.\n\n\n\nturner: thank you for telling me truth on that, jake. i mean, i hate that, you know, fairfax has to go, too, but when northam was running in 2017, you recall because of a labor union, he wouldn't put fairfax's picture on his literature.\n\n\n\ncuccinelli: that's right.\n\n\n\ntapper: thanks one and all for being here.\n\n\n\ncoming up, ivanka trump vacuuming up bread crumbs.\n\n\n\n[09:50:00]\n\n\n\na new work for performance art getting a thumbs down from the first daughter. that's the subject of this week's state of the cartoonion next.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\ntapper: welcome back.\n\n\n\npablo picasso once said, art is a lie that makes us realize the truth. and that's the subject of this week's state of the cartoonion.\n\n\n\n(begin videotape)\n\n\n\ntapper (voice-over): the new performance art piece in washington d.c. ivanka vacuuming shows the first daughter cleaning up crumbs. the piece irked the real ivanka who tweeted, women can choose to knock each other down or build each other up. i choose the latter, but it got us wondering what other political figures might make high art.\n\n\n\nedvard munch the scream could help

been thinking about running for president.\n\n\n\ntapper: picasso's the old guitarist from his blue period could serve as a model for joe biden who if elected would be the oldest president ever.\n\n\n\njoe biden, former vice president of the united states: am i still in good shape? do i have all my faculties? am i energetic?\n\n\n\ntapper: and then there is that master work, the

in a normal senate where there were a few votes to spare, one member wouldn't have so much power. but, if you have watched closely, you've seen the wave that a single senator's comments can bring when they talk about what they can support in a bill or in a nominee. democratic sen. kyrsten sinema of arizona has done this on the minimum wage. sen. joe manchin, a west virginia democrat, has almost single handedly sunk a biden nominee with a statement. that's going to be the emerging story of the next two years.\n\nthe biden administration and majority leader chuck schumer have their work cut out for them when it comes to advancing their agenda and that's not because they are bad at whipping votes or laying out a policy vision. it's because the numbers aren't flexible here.\n\nbottom line: democratic unity is fragile here. it's just a symptom of the numbers and the reality of a 50-50 senate. it's not just republicans who have intra-party squabbles about the direction of their party. democrats are going to wrestle with that too. it's what we are seeing with the nomination of neera tanden to be director of the office of management and budget. it's what we are seeing with the minimum wage . it's going to continue to be a dynamic as we move toward infrastructure and immigration. the differences for democrats is their disagreements don't center around following one leader at all costs, but the party has an energetic base too and they have to balance it with the fact that if they want to keep controlling the senate, they have to win in states that are rural and filled with voters who might lean more conservative than those in new york or la.\n\nthe cabinet\n\ntanden is the one to watch wednesday, but the futures of a several other nominees are also worth watching. nominees can't just come to the senate for their confirmation hearings and count on advancing with just demcoratic votes. tanden's nomination reveals why that strategy is so untenable.\n\ntwo committee hearings that were scheduled to vote on tanden's nomination were unexpectedly postponed wednesday, and an official on one of the committees told cnn senators wanted more time to consider the nomination.\n\nthese are not national security nominations . these are domestic policy nominees that strike at the heart of the differences between the two parties. it's harder to win some republican votes on a nominee whose job it is to strengthen obamacare at hhs. it's harder to win gop support for an interior secretary whose job in the biden administration will likely be to cut back on fossil fuel extraction on federal lands. that means democrats have to stay united. manchin isn't the only member with power here. on tuesday, sen. bernie sanders, an independent from vermont, voted against biden's nominee for agriculture secretary tom vilsack . it didn't make a difference in terms of outcome because vilsak has broad bipartisan support, but it shows that manchin isn't the only democratic member willing to vote against biden's agenda or nominations in the democratic caucus.\n\nkeep a close eye on rep. deb haaland's nomination for interior secretary. she has another session for her confirmation hearing wednesday , and seemed to walk away with some compliments from energy chairman manchin on tuesday. but, she's not winning much republican support so far with sen. mitt romney, a republican from utah saying he had some concerns about her past positions. haaland was a vocal supporter of the green new deal and it's something that multiple senators focused their questions on tuesday.\n\non covid relief\n\nthe house is on track to pass their covid relief bill friday with few or any defections. house majority leader steny hoyer, a maryland democrat, told cnn's manu raju on tuesday he was confident he could hold his caucus together. in the senate, that is going to be a bit more challenging.\n\ntiming\n\nthe senate parliamentarian's ruling on the $15 minimum wage could come wednesday, but it could also take more time if the parliamentarian asks for follow-up material or needs additional resources.\n\nmultiple senate sources familiar with the matter told cnn the arguments on both sides were made wednesday morning on the minimum wage hike. the senate's parliamentarian, elizabeth macdonough, has not yet ruled on the matter, and it's not clear yet when she will.\n\nwhenever the decision comes, it's hard to remember another time that a parliamentarian's decision was being watched so closely. of course whatever macdonough decides could impact the political dynamics of biden's package going forward. with minimum wage, democrats could be staring down a potential intra-party schism over biden's first major legislative package. without it, they could be facing a barrage of criticism from their progressive base that won them back the white house to begin with.\n\nwhat will the parliamentarian decide?\n\nanyone who claims to know the answer to this question is guessing at best. cnn spoke to the former senate parliamentarian alan frumin on tuesday night to walk through how he would be looking at the $15 minimum wage, but even he contended it was a tough call on whether it was allowed through the budget reconciliation process. he told cnn he could honestly see this going either way.\n\nin order to get through, democrats are going to have to prove that a provision has more than just an incidental effect on the budget. that word has been interpreted a lot of ways by multiple parliamentarians, but here is how it applies to minimum wage. on the one hand, the minimum wage proposal has a $55 billion impact on the federal budget over the next decade- more money than some past provisions that have gotten through this scrutiny. but, those impacts on the budget are also coming from the congressional budget office estimating raising wages will raise prices of goods and services and that those higher prices will be passed onto the federal government as it buys materials. the cbo also estimates that if you raise the minimum wage it could have some effect on how much to government spends on some social programs like food stamps or unemployment insurance. is that direct enough? is that more than incidental? that's the question here.\n\nthis story has been updated with additional developments wednesday.
(cnn) —\n\nhouse democrats moved quickly to defend the affordable care act once they retook control of the chamber thursday.\n\nas part of its rules package for the 116th congress, the party is granting itself authorization to intervene in the lawsuit that threatens to bring down the landmark health care law. it directs the house's office of general counsel to represent lawmakers in any litigation involving the act and authorizes hiring of outside counsel.\n\nthe house late thursday voted in the rules package, which the majority party – now the democrats – adopts at the start of a new congress.\n\nthe newly empowered democratic leadership also scheduled a vote for next wednesday on a standalone resolution affirming the house's authorization to intervene in the lawsuit. this would put republicans on the record voting specifically for or against defending obamacare and its protections for those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nsupporting the affordable care act, including its popular provisions that protect those with less-than-perfect health histories, helped democrats retake the house in the midterm elections in november. since then, the party's leaders have repeatedly said they will swiftly work to uphold the law.\n\na federal judge in texas last month ruled that the affordable care act, more commonly known as obamacare, is unconstitutional because congress eliminated the individual mandate penalty by reducing it to $0, starting this year. this rendered the mandate itself unconstitutional and the rest of the law therefore cannot stand. earlier this week, district judge reed o'connor issued an order saying that the act can remain in effect pending appeal.\n\nthe trump administration is not defending obamacare, prompting a coalition of democratic states to step in. california attorney general xavier becerra, who is leading the coalition, plans to appeal o'connor's ruling.\n\nthe move to intervene, however, is largely symbolic. some affordable care act supporters say that democratic lawmakers would be better off passing legislation to address the lawsuit.\n\nintervening, for its part, is unnecessary (because california and other blue states have already intervened), unlawful (because one house of congress almost certainly lacks standing to sue), and wasteful (because lawyers). — nicholas bagley (@nicholas_bagley) january 2, 2019\n\nfor instance, congress could nullify the basis of the judge's decision by raising the penalty amount or declaring the individual mandate severable from the rest of the law, university of michigan law professor nicholas bagley and richard primus argued in the atlantic last month.\n\nthis story has been updated to include additional developments.\n\ncnn's ashley killough contributed to this report.\n\n\n\ncorrection: this story has been corrected to identify when lawmakers return to the us house of representatives. new members are sworn in on thursday.

i'm 48 years old and would like to retire by the time i'm 55. what do i need to do make that happen? -- v.m.\n\nmany people dream of making an early exit from the work-a-day routine. but making that dream a reality can be a challenge. the reason is simple. by retiring at 55 instead of, say, 65, you not only have 10 fewer years of saving and investing to build a nest egg, that nest egg also has to support you through an extra 10 years of retirement. that double-whammy of fewer working years to save and more retirement years to spend is what makes early retirement so tough to pull off.\n\nbut while calling it a career a good decade before you reach a more traditional retirement age may be daunting, it's not impossible. it will, however, take some serious, disciplined planning. here are the four most important things you should do to improve your chances of success.\n\n1. ramp up your savings rate.\n\nto maintain an acceptable lifestyle throughout a retirement that could last upwards of 40 years, you're going to need a sizable savings stash to support you. for example, let's say that in addition to the income you'll eventually receive from social security and any other sources, you'll need an inflation-adjusted $50,000 a year from savings in order to maintain your standard of living in retirement.\n\nto have a reasonable shot at being able to pull that amount from savings year after year without too high a risk of running out of money too soon, you'll likely need a savings stash somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 to 35 times the annual income you wish to withdraw, or in this example a nest egg of roughly $1.5 million to $1.8 million.\n\nyou can get by with a much smaller nest egg, of course, if you'll be depending on it for significantly less income. but the point is that to accumulate enough savings during your working years to support yourself over an extra long retirement, you're going to have to do some heavy-duty saving.\n\nrelated: how much can i expect to earn on my retirement savings?\n\nthe savings rate you should shoot for will depend on how much you've managed to tuck away already, how many years you have until you retire and how much income you'll need your nest egg to generate. but the standard recommendation of 15% or so a year isn't likely to do it. to have a realistic chance of throwing off the shackles of your 9-to-5 in your mid-50s, you may have to have to sock away upwards of 25% to 30% a year.\n\nyou can get a decent estimate of what sort of savings effort will be required by going to a good retirement income calculator and plugging in the age at which you hope to retire, the amount you already have saved and how income you think you'll need when you retire. by running several scenarios with different savings rates, you should be able to come away with a sense of how much you'll need to ratchet up your savings rate to have a reasonable shot at success.\n\n2. get a handle on your retirement expenses.\n\nmany people assume their expenses will drop once they retire, but that's not necessarily true. indeed, a 2015 study that examined changes in household spending in retirement found that nearly half of retirees actually spent more after leaving their jobs, at least in the initial years after retiring. so if want to accurately gauge whether you'll have enough income to cover your retirement living costs if you leave your job early, you need to have a realistic fix on what you're actually likely to spend.\n\nrelated: the best way to get guaranteed income in retirement\n\nthe best way to do that is to create a detailed retirement budget. there are a number of free online interactive budgeting tools out there, but i like blackrock's retirement expense worksheet because it easily allows you to enter some 50 different expenses in eight broad categories. the worksheet also separates essential living expenses (housing, food, etc.) from discretionary ones (travel, entertainment, hobbies) so you can easily see how much room you'll have to cut expenses if necessary in the future without eliminating necessary expenditures.\n\ndon't worry if you're not certain what your eventual retirement expenses will be. do the best you can for now, and then make sure to update and refine your estimates as you get closer to your planned departure date.\n\n3. nail down health insurance.\n\nfor many people aspiring to retire early, getting and maintaining health insurance can be a major stumbling block. the reason: you're not eligible for medicare until you hit 65. so if you retire before that date and don't have coverage through a former employer (or, if you're married, through a spouse's current or former employer), you'll have to buy health care coverage on your own. that can be a budget wrecker, which is why it's imperative you have a good idea of what the tab for health insurance will be before you actually leave your job.\n\nrelated: 3 things to know about health savings accounts\n\nunfortunately, estimating what you'll pay for health insurance in the years ahead is a bit of a guessing game at the moment, what with the effort to repeal and replace obamacare still a work in progress. but you can at least get a sense of what you might need to budget for coverage now by going to sites like ehealthinsurance.com and healthpocket.com. you can then re-visit these sites as more details about health insurance costs emerge.\n\nbut make no mistake. you shouldn't even think of pulling the trigger on early retirement unless you're confident you'll have the resources to cover the cost of medical insurance as well as your potential health care costs overall.\n\n4. do some lifestyle planning.\n\nlifestyle planning, or thinking seriously about how you actually want to spend your time once you leave your job behind, is an important part of any retirement plan. it's especially crucial, however, if you're contemplating early retirement. after all, by retiring early you could easily be looking at a post-career life that will last as long, if not longer, than your career. thus, if for no other reason than to avoid boredom or the feeling that you're just marking time, you'll want to do all you can to make this stage of your life rewarding and fulfilling.\n\nresearch shows that retirees who have a wide circle of friends tend to be happier in retirement. so in the years leading up your planned exit date, you'll want to consider a variety of ways to remain socially connected, such as reconnecting with old friends, making an effort to stay in touch with colleagues from work and even cultivating a new network of friends and acquaintances, say, by volunteering at a local charity or enrolling in adult-education classes. starting a new hobby or throwing yourself into a new project --writing a book, launching a blog, learning a new language or musical instrument, etc.-- can also help engender a sense of purpose during a lengthy retirement.\n\nrelated: how to retire if you're going to live to 100\n\nlifestyle planning can also help with the financial side of preparing for your early retirement, as the way you live in retirement can directly affect how much you'll spend and thus how large a nest egg you'll require. so as you're working on your retirement budget and gauging how much you need to save, you'll want to think about such issues as whether you plan to travel a lot or stick close to home and whether you intend to remain in your current house or downsize to smaller, less expensive digs in an effort to free up home equity and lower housing costs.\n\nit's also important to remember that some lifestyle decisions have both social and financial dimensions. for example, choosing to work part-time can not only be a good way to earn a few extra bucks and reduce withdrawals from your nest egg, but an effective strategy for remaining socially engaged.\n\nclearly, there are other topics you'll have to address as you prepare to make your early exit. you'll want to be sure you're following a consistent investing strategy that jibes with your tolerance for risk, balances growth and downside protection and keeps expenses to a minimum. if you won't have enough savings in taxable accounts to fund the initial years of your retirement, then you'll also want to look into ways of tapping tax-advantaged accounts like a 401(k) or ira while avoiding or minimizing early-withdrawal penalties. and you'll want to monitor your progress as you near your planned retirement date to gauge whether leaving your job at 55 is still realistic or whether you might be better off delaying a year or two.\n\nbut this much is certain: the sooner you create a plan and put it into action, the better the chance your early retirement dream will become a reality.
(cnn) — el primer borrador de presupuesto completo del presidente donald trump se entregó oficialmente este martes al congreso.\n\nhubo fotos y un empujón público del gobierno para difundir su plan como evidencia de que está haciendo lo que el multimillonario empresario convertido en estrella de un reality show dijo que haría durante la campaña del 2016: reducir los programas federales y equilibrar el presupuesto.\n\nlos republicanos han argumentado que un presidente de su partido les ayudaría a implementar las políticas que han impulsado durante años, pero el plan del presupuesto de trump será ignorado en gran parte por el congreso controlado por ellos mismos.\n\n«casi todas las propuestas presupuestarias de los presidentes que conozco están básicamente muertas a su llegada», dijo este lunes el senador john cornyn, republicano de texas, sin rodeos, unas horas antes de la publicación del presupuesto.\n\nhe aquí hay cinco razones para ello:\n\npublicidad\n\n1. los presupuestos no se convierten en ley\n\nlas solicitudes presupuestarias anuales son listas de deseos políticos que establecen las prioridades políticas de un líder o partido. no son proyectos de ley que se envían al presidente para que se conviertan en ley. tanto la cámara como el senado votan sobre propuestas presupuestarias, pero a menudo lo hacen sobre varias versiones: una elaborada por líderes, otras potencialmente redactadas por republicanos conservadores o una escrita por los demócratas. estos son votos de mensajes y son utilizados por ambas partes para poner en cero los contrastes clave, sobre la atención de la salud, la reforma tributaria, la financiación de la educación, el medio ambiente y los programas de investigación médica.\n\nlos presupuestos contienen cifras principales e instrucciones a otros comités para que redacten leyes de gastos anuales, o elaboren legislación que realmente lleve a cabo las directivas para su ejecución.\n\nel lanzamiento del presupuesto es una oportunidad fotográfica que permite que el presidente (o sus designados) señalen un libro que será empastado y que muestra cómo él está cumpliendo sus promesas de campaña.\n\n«basándonos en lo que sabemos acerca de este presupuesto, la buena noticia (la única buena noticia) es que es probable que sea rechazado rotundamente por los miembros de ambos partidos aquí en el senado, como pasó con el último», dijo el senador demócrata por nueva york chuck schumer, líder de la minoría.\n\nlee: el presupuesto de «poder duro» de trump plantea un recorte del 28% en el departamento de estado\n\nlos presupuestos enviados al capitolio por el presidente barack obama también fueron ignorados por los demócratas en la cámara y el senado, y a menudo obtuvieron menos votos cuando los republicanos los plantearon que las propuestas de los demócratas en los comités presupuestarios.\n\n2. los republicanos en el congreso están trabajando en su propio plan\n\nen su papel constitucional clave reside el gran poder del congreso. «no hemos prestado mucha atención al presupuesto de ningún presidente desde que estoy aquí», aseguró el líder de la mayoría del senado, mitch mcconnell, en una entrevista con bloomberg news la semana pasada.\n\nlos republicanos en el capitolio y en la casa blanca coordinarán las cifras principales, pero los presidentes de los comités presupuestarios están trabajando con los líderes en su propia propuesta presupuestaria, que se espera que se desarrolle a mediados de junio.\n\nel valor básico de cuánto obtendrá cada agencia para varios programas federales será decidido por los miembros de los comités de apropiación de la cámara y el senado. esos paneles comenzarán a escribir aproximadamente una docena de proyectos de ley de gastos, los cuales deben pasar por ambas cámaras y ser firmados como ley por el presidente antes de fines de septiembre para evitar el cierre del gobierno.\n\neste año, el partido republicano utilizará el proceso presupuestario para suavizar la aprobación de uno de sus principales objetivos políticos: la reestructuración del código tributario. los republicanos planean utilizar la herramienta de procedimiento como una reconciliación presupuestaria que les permita aprobar una legislación importante en el senado con una mayoría simple. utilizaron la misma herramienta en la resolución del presupuesto del año pasado para abordar su primera prioridad con el gobierno republicano unificado, para derogar y reemplazar el obamacare.\n\nmuchas de las propuestas de política presupuestal del gobierno de trump se basan en las más tempranas iniciativas hechas por los republicanos del capitolio, entre ellas los recortes al medicaid, que eran parte de la revisión del sistema de salud por parte de los republicanos de la cámara de representantes.\n\n3. algunos programas son difíciles de recortar\n\nel congreso podría no hacerle caso a los recortes propuestos por trump a algunos programas que se consideran críticos y populares, como el medicaid y los institutos nacionales de salud.\n\nel presidente de la cámara de representantes, paul ryan, instó a los miembros de su rama legislativa a guardarse un tanto sus críticas sobre elementos específicos del presupuesto del presidente en una reunión a puerta cerrada la mañana de este martes, señalando que deben revisar todos los detalles y enfocarse en el equilibrio (algo que todos quieren), según un republicano que asistió a la reunión.\n\npero no todos los republicanos de la cámara escucharon esa llamado. «si se toma tal como está el presupuesto del presidente, sería muy dañino», dijo este martes a periodista el representante republicano hal rogers. «he dicho antes de que estos recortes que se están proponiendo son draconianos. no son meros recortes, son realmente profundos y profundos».\n\nel presupuesto contiene cientos de miles de millones de dólares en recortes al programa de seguro de salud federal-estatal para los estadounidenses de bajos ingresos, algo que la cámara pidió en su ley de derogación y reemplazo del obamacare que recientemente aprobó.\n\npero esa propuesta es objeto de intensas negociaciones en el senado, donde algunos republicanos nerviosos no están dispuestos a aceptar que diez millones de personas puedan perder cobertura bajo ese presupuesto. el último esfuerzo de trump para recortar la financiación de los institutos nacionales de salud fue bloqueado tanto por los demócratas como por los republicanos que defendieron a los científicos que trabajan en avances médicos.\n\nlee: los próximos 100 días de donald trump\n\n«el presupuesto propuesto por el presidente nunca ha tenido apoyo en el senado o en la cámara, de modo que la idea de que esto impone recortes no es verdadera», aseguró cornyn sobre la propuesta presidencial de presupuesto a finales de marzo. «dependerá de nosotros trabajar en ello y me atrevo a decir justo después de votar para que se incrementen los fondos de los institutos nacionales de salud en el proyecto de ley de curas del siglo 21, que sería difícil obtener los votos para luego recortar el programa».\n\n4. los republicanos se oponen en gran medida a algunas de las cosas que trump quiere añadir\n\nivanka trump está impulsando un programa de asistencia familiar y de cuidado de niños por 25.000 millones de dólares que podría estar más en línea con la ortodoxia demócrata que con la republicana. no muchos legisladores republicanos llegaron a washington haciendo campaña para agregar derechos. pero el qué hacer con el proyecto favorito de la primera hija podría ser un tema delicado para los republicanos del congreso que quieren mantener buenas relaciones con el presidente.\n\n«me encantaría hablar con ella», aseguró cornyn este lunes. «estoy seguro que todos lo estaríamos, pero, obviamente, cuando se trata de gastar es una cuestión de prioridades. no puedo decirte ahora dónde caería ese tema en la lista de prioridades».\n\nhay que ver cómo destacan esta división los demócratas, presionando a los republicanos a apoyar o rechazar el plan general de presupuesto y para que voten por separado sobre la propuesta de ivanka. los republicanos hicieron lo mismo con los demócratas durante los años del gobierno de barack obama, obligando repetidamente a los demócratas (especialmente a los moderados) a aceptar partes del presupuesto de obama que los republicanos consideraban desfasadas para sus votantes.\n\nlee: el presupuesto de trump: aumento en defensa y recortes en el resto de agencias\n\nel presupuesto del presidente rebaja en gran medida los fondos de programas garantistas de derechos. los republicanos en el capitolio apoyan iniciativas para aumentar el gasto en el ejército, pero advierten que sin la voluntad de reformar o recortar grandes generadores de costos como el seguro social y el medicare, se obliga a recortes mayores en otros programas.\n\nrogers dijo sin referirse a esos programas que la oficina de gestión y presupuesto (omb, por sus siglas en inglés) «empaquetó muy bien lo que se debe cortar». señaló que «la parte obligatoria del presupuesto, del gasto, está creciendo rápidamente, mientras que las cuentas discrecionales apropiadas están disminuyendo. no queda mucho dinero por recortar».\n\n5. los republicanos del capitolio en campañas quieren mantener su distancia con todo lo que tenga el nombre de trump\n\nlos índices de aprobación del presidente en muchos distritos cambiantes clave en todo el país son bajos. la última serie de controversias que rodean al presidente y su gobierno con las múltiples investigaciones sobre rusia puede hacer que algunos en el partido republicano opten por alejarse de las propuestas impulsadas personalmente por trump. en lugar de eso, enfatizarán en áreas donde difieren del presidente, como la protección de programas que impulsan la investigación sobre el cáncer.

(ap photo/susan walsh)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nacting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney said sunday that the white house plans to release an obamacare replacement plan before the 2020 election, after hosting top administration officials at camp david over the weekend for a meeting on health care.\n\ni do think you'll see a plan here fairly shortly, mulvaney told fox news sunday.\n\nwhite house aides and administration officials – including health and human services secretary alex azar and seema verma, administrator of the centers for medicare and medicaid services – huddled at the historic maryland property on saturday to discuss the general path forward for president trump's health care policy, white house aides said.\n\nthe talks ranged from messaging strategies to lowering drug prices to individual health insurance marketplaces. and while trump this week ruled out taking a vote on an affordable care act alternative prior to the election amid republican resistance to the prospect, mulvaney said the forthcoming plan would provide gop candidates with campaign fodder.\n\nrepublicans have better ideas than democrats. we should not be afraid to talk about that, mulvaney said on fox news. we want to run on this.\n\ntrump stunned republicans late last month when he paired his administration's decision to back an obamacare court challenge with a call for the gop to develop a legislative replacement. white house allies, lawmakers and even members of trump's own staff were caught off guard when the justice department filed a brief in court supporting the complete invalidation of the affordable care act, without preparing anything to take its place should that ruling stand.\n\nunhappy with the president's decision to plunge the party back into a battle it lost less than two years ago, republicans said they would await guidance from the white house. trump, in turn, said he would ask gop senators to craft a plan – leaving the white house and congress pointing fingers at each other over who should take the lead in writing health care policy.\n\nwhite house aides have cited graham-cassidy, a health care proposal floated in 2017, as their starting point for the development of a plan. but even trump's legislative team was surprised by the news that the president wanted a renewed focus on health care, and the administration has scrambled to come up with a plan that did not exist before trump waded back into the issue.\n\ntop republicans, including senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, privately attempted to persuade trump that a health care push would not only fail, but backfire on republicans running up and down the ticket in 2020, multiple sources told cnn last week.\n\ntrump on wednesday claimed he never intended to request a vote before next year's election, noting he had very talented people working on a replacement plan for him.\n\nit will be on full display during the election as a much better & less expensive alternative to obamacare, trump tweeted. this will be a great campaign issue.\n\ndemocrats running in 2018 midterm races seized on voters' concerns about health care, and their heavy focus on the issue helped propel enough candidates to victory in republican-held districts that the gop lost control of the house in november. now, democratic presidential hopefuls are spending significant time on the campaign trail talking about health care – with many candidates promoting universal programs like medicare for all.\n\nmulvaney on sunday argued republicans, who tried unsuccessfully in 2017 to pass health care reform when they controlled both chambers of congress, need competing ideas to present to voters in 2020.\n\nyou can't beat something with nothing, he said.\n\ndemocrats have already admitted that obamacare doesn't work – that's why they're out there talking about this amorphous medicare for all, he said.
(cnn) we saw two ends of the republican party attacked this week. rep. liz cheney successfully fought off an intraparty challenge for her spot in the house gop leadership. and rep. marjorie taylor greene was stripped of committee memberships by the full house, after the republicans refused to do it themselves.\n\nthe battles of cheney and greene this week are proxy battles for a larger fight. you have cheney, representing the older guard institutionalist wing whose most prominent member is senate minority leader mitch mcconnell. then you have greene, who has claimed the backing of former president donald trump and has been bashed by mcconnell\n\nand while the institutionalists won this week and the trump wing suffered a rebuke, the battle among the republican electorate is going a very different way. the institutionalists of the republican party are losing out to those who have trump's blessing.\n\nwe don't have a lot of really good polling on how voters view cheney and greene. the numbers we do have suggest what you might expect. cheney's ratings are strongly negative among republicans nationally. greene's mostly unknown, but has better ratings among those republicans who are familiar with her.\n\nwhere we do have a lot of high quality polling is the leaders of congress, particularly mcconnell. he has arguably been the most mainstream republican (i.e. not inherently anti-trump) to try and move the party on from trump. his popularity among republicans has plummeted as a result.\n\nread more

the former new york mayor qualified for wednesday night's debate on the eve of the critical contest, injecting a combustible new element into an already volatile primary fight.\n\nthe other five candidates slated to be on stage with bloomberg just days before the nevada caucuses have shown an ability -- and even an eagerness -- to go after the new entrant.\n\nvermont sen. bernie sanders has argued bloomberg's money and record won't help motivate the democratic base. former south bend, indiana, mayor pete buttigieg has labeled bloomberg a billionaire who thinks that you can just ... buy your way on to television and win that way. and massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren , hours after bloomberg qualified, compared him to president donald trump and called him an egomaniac billionaire.\n\nbut bloomberg is not coming into the debate defenseless.\n\nthe former mayor has maintained a focus on sanders in the day leading up to the debate, hoping that an intense back-and-forth between the two will further cement them as the race's frontrunners. he has questioned sanders' commitment to a clean campaign, pointing to the hard attacks the senator's supporters online level against his opponents.\n\nfor candidates like buttigieg and minnesota sen. amy klobuchar , bloomberg's entry represents the greatest threat to any momentum they still have from iowa and new hampshire.\n\nthe democratic debate -- beyond bloomberg -- is at an inflection point for biden and warren, both of whom need to demonstrate the ability to do well after poor performances in new

exited amid weak polling numbers, but he's entering as a central figure in the democratic race.\n\nby jumping into the race late, skipping the first four states to vote in the democratic nominating

debate appearance comes amid a barrage of damaging headlines, largely focused on his previous comments about and support for policies widely seen as discriminatory -- including stop-and-frisk policing and redlining . he will also likely face questions over allegations that he made crude remarks and fostered a culture of discrimination against women at bloomberg l.p. during the late 1980s and 1990s.\n\nbloomberg, meanwhile, has signaled an eagerness to take on sanders, with his campaign increasingly criticizing the tactics of the vermont senator's sometimes rabid online following.\n\ncan sanders give as good as he gets?\n\nsanders speaks during the clark county democrats kick off to caucus gala at tropicana las vegas february 15, 2020 in las vegas, nevada.\n\nprevious frontrunners have had a torrid time on debate nights, getting hit from all angles, with their rivals often unfurling new or unexpected lines of attack.\n\nsanders should expect no less on wednesday, when the moderate contenders are expected to pick relentlessly at medicare for all in a bid to get in good with nevada's powerful culinary union, which opposes the plan. bloomberg looks likely to jump on that dogpile, but an even better bet to escalate accusations that sanders' surrogates are playing dirty -- and that the vermont senator either hasn't done enough to stop them or is in some way tacitly encouraging it.\n\nsanders has, in public, repeatedly said that there is no room in the political revolution for abuse and harassment online, but that is unlikely to quiet the issue. and at a cnn town hall tuesday night, sanders put a finer point on it : i do not believe in online bullying. end of discussion\n\nthe question for sanders, then, is whether he can deliver the message he wants and not get bogged down by the incoming fire. sanders is a mostly disciplined debater, hard to knock off script, but he will be under the microscope here and even the smallest blunder -- or misfired attack -- could open up a whopping can of new backlash.\n\nstill, bloomberg's presence could break to sanders' benefit.\n\nthe heavy-spending billionaire is new to the primary debate stage and represents a new foil for the populists, and perhaps some of the moderates who see him encroaching on their support, to feast on.\n\nbuttigieg, klobuchar have been preparing for this fight for months\n\nklobuchar and buttigieg participate in the democratic presidential primary debate at drake university on january 14, 2020 in des moines, iowa.\n\nthere isn't much love lost between buttigieg and klobuchar.\n\nthe two moderates have repeatedly used the debate stage to air their grievances with each other, with the minnesota senator targeting the former south bend, indiana, mayor for his youth and experience on the local level as a way to blunt his rise.\n\nklobuchar, unlike other candidates, has perplexed buttigieg on the debate stage. where he has effectively counter punted against attacks from warren, biden and sanders, buttigieg hasn't been able to hit klobuchar with the same fire -- and the minnesota senator is now surging after a strong debate performance and third place finish in new hampshire.\n\nthat's why klobuchar bungling an interview in nevada and awkwardly being unable to name the president of mexico could provide a flash point in wednesday's contest.\n\nbuttigieg, who was able to name mexican president andrés manuel lópez obrador, hit klobuchar for her inability to answer the question on sunday, telling a crowd of supporters in las vegas that the misstep shows that there is more to being prepared than how many years you spent in washington.\n\nklobuchar, for her part, has looked to cast buttigieg as a newcomer with no political record.\n\nthis fight will have a new resonance on wednesday given the role bloomberg is expected to play in the debate. the former new york mayor, by offering a similar set of moderate policy prescriptions as buttigieg and klobuchar, is looking to court some of the same voters and conversations with supporters of each campaign here in nevada highlight how bloomberg has made inroads with moderate democrats.\n\nand bloomberg has a $60 billion personal fortune to use to get that message out, something neither buttigieg nor klobuchar can come close to touching.\n\nbiden eager to attack bloomberg, too\n\nbiden poses for selfie with a guest prior to the clark county democrats kick off to caucus gala at tropicana las vegas february 15, 2020 in las vegas, nevada.\n\nthis is the turning point biden has been promising.\n\nwritten off by many (including bloomberg, whose campaign is arguing it's a two-man race between the former mayor and sanders) after a fourth-place finish in iowa and a fifth-place showing in new hampshire, biden is on more comfortable territory in a state with a much larger share of non-white voters.\n\nbut the former vice president appears to have lost some benefit of the doubt: the powerful culinary union praised him, but didn't endorse him. former sen. harry reid said he thinks biden could win, but didn't caucus for him. his fundraising, which has already lagged some of his rivals, faces the threat of donors frozen by bloomberg's billions or eyeing moderate alternatives like buttigieg or klobuchar — right at the moment biden needs to drastically scale up for super tuesday, when 14 states vote on march 3.\n\nnow, he'll try to build momentum on the debate stage -- where he looked feistier than he had before a week ago in new hampshire.\n\nthe question is, which of the many threats he faces will biden target? will it be sanders, whose support among latinos has become a major asset? or buttigieg or klobuchar, who are part of a crowded centrist lane?\n\nin recent days, biden has hinted he's most eager to take on bloomberg -- who is using former president barack obama's voice and praise in a national advertising campaign against obama's former vice president.\n\nin an interview on msnbc this week, he lambasted bloomberg over stop-and-frisk policing policies, his failure to endorse then-sen. obama in 2008 and his position on obamacare.\n\nthis is a guy that talked about obamacare being a disaster and about how he wouldn't support our administration in 2008, so there's a lot to discuss with michael, biden said.\n\nwarren is ready to make waves\n\nwarren aknowledges supporters at a primary election night rally, tuesday, feb. 11, 2020, in manchester, n.h.\n\nwarren's staunchest supporters are upset. after a pair of disappointing performances in iowa and new hampshire, they feel like the massachusetts senator has been written off and out of the narrative around a primary still in its earliest stages.\n\nbut warren has an opportunity, perhaps a final one, on wednesday night to change the conversation. and if there's any doubt it's still possible at this stage, she only needs to look over at klobuchar, who used her performance at the granite state debate as a launching pad for a surprisingly strong finish there a few days later.\n\nwarren has cast herself repeatedly as a unity candidate, which will make it a tougher task, but she has shown a willingness in recent days to hit out hard at some of her rivals.\n\non tuesday, she offered a preview of what might be coming.\n\nmike bloomberg approved and oversaw a program that surveilled and tracked muslim communities in mosques, restaurants, and even college campuses --leaving permanent damage. he refuses to apologize for it, she tweeted.\n\nwarren also had some harsh words for sanders the night before, saying he has a lot of questions to answer about the behavior of his supporters online.\n\ni am particularly worried about what happened in the attacks on members of the culinary union, particularly on the women in leadership, warren told nbc news. that is not how we build an inclusive democratic party. and it is not how we (beat) donald trump. we do not build on a foundation of hate.

(photo by kevin lim/the strait times/handout/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nnever shy about taking credit, president donald trump twice recently claimed to have solved a problem that turned out to still be a problem.\n\nhe wanted the problem of north korea's nuclear weapons to be solved after his historic meeting with kim jong un last month, and he wanted the problem of children separated by the us government from their parents to be solved with the swipe of his pen on an executive order.\n\nbut weeks later, the north korean nuclear threat still very much exists, and the problem of children separated from their parents has worsened as the us government clearly does not know exactly how many children it has or how to get them back to their parents.\n\nthese are unrelated stories, obviously, but they share what's become a truism of white house – which is that trump likes to take credit for things he hasn't quite accomplished. the details will come later.\n\n01:28 - source: cnn trump touts north korea denuclearization\n\nit's not unlike the famous old quote attributed to vermont sen. george aitken, a republican, who put forward a plan for the us in vietnam in 1966. the united states should declare victory and get out, he's been quoted as saying. whether aitken said it that way or not and what exactly he meant has been debated.\n\ntrump actually did sort of declare victory on north korea immediately upon touching down on us soil after the summit in june with kim.\n\njust landed - a long trip, but everybody can now feel much safer than the day i took office, trump said on twitter. there is no longer a nuclear threat from north korea.\n\ntrump was basking in success of his trip at the time and clearly wanted it to seem as historic as possible.\n\nbut his declaration was premature. the agreement he signed in north korea was more of an entree into figuring out the details. and his administration, since his tweet, has reaffirmed that there is still a nuclear threat from north korea. obviously. secretary of state mike pompeo shuttles back and forth to hammer out the hard details. meanwhile, north korea's nuclear program continues.\n\ntrump has not been chastened, however. most recently, he's sought credit for not being in the middle of a nuclear war.\n\nmany good conversations with north korea-it is going well! in the meantime, no rocket launches or nuclear testing in 8 months. all of asia is thrilled. only the opposition party, which includes the fake news, is complaining. if not for me, we would now be at war with north korea!\n\nok! (set aside that trump was the one tempting nuclear war with his previous taunting of kim. he's asking for credit for avoiding a war he was inching toward.)\n\non the subject of the immigrant children, the administration was slow to realize its moral mistake in separating the children from parents at the border. the resulting chaos is just becoming clear.\n\n01:52 - source: cnn trump signs executive order to end family separations\n\nwe're going to have strong, very strong borders, but we're going to keep the families together, he said. i didn't like the sight or the feeling of families being separated.\n\nso we're keeping families together and this will solve that problem, trump said. and then, just before he signed the executive order, he added, you're going to have a lot of happy people.\n\nhe hasn't said much at all about the issue since then.\n\nbut problems became apparent immediately. the executive order sought to detain undocumented families together and it ran afoul of a law that mandated children not be detained indefinitely. and while the stated purpose was to reunite families, it's not clear that's happened much at all. in fact, the government this week made clear it had separated even more children than previously thought.\n\nthese are only the most recent examples.\n\nthere's no such thing as obamacare anymore, he said after republicans passed their tax reform bill, even though republicans' tax bill only zeroed out the penalty for not obtaining health insurance coverage.\n\ncnn's greg krieg looked at a long list of things trump has tried to take credit for earlier this year.\n\nbut these new examples are something else. they're trump taking credit for the efforts of his own administration before his own policies can be enacted, which is why they feel so premature. he's trying to take credit for things where no credit is yet deserved.
\n\nmadam speaker, mr. vice president, members of congress, the first lady of the united states and my fellow citizens, three years ago we launched the great american comeback.\n\na key element to the trump narrative is that america was bad before he came along. and it's great now.\n\ntonight, i stand before you to share the incredible results. jobs are booming, incomes are soaring, poverty is plummeting, crime is falling, confidence is surging, and our country is thriving and highly respected again! america's enemies are on the run, america's fortunes are on the rise, and america's future is blazing bright.\n\nthe story trump can tell is about the economy. but as with everything, he uses hyperbole. incomes are up. but soaring'? poverty is still a major issue. in his telling, it is plummeting. he is the ultimate salesman.\n\nthe years of economic decay are over. the days of our country being used, taken advantage of, and even scorned by other nations are long behind us. gone too are the broken promises, jobless recoveries, tired platitudes, and constant excuses for the depletion of american wealth, power, and prestige.\n\nit's important to note that the economy has been expanding for a decade, starting under president barack obama. and the rate of growth is not any greater for trump. but in his telling, he is to thank for it all. more jobs were created in the end of obama's last term than in the beginning of trump's. but he doesn't provide that nuance.\n\nin just 3 short years, we have shattered the mentality of american decline, and we have rejected the downsizing of america's destiny. we are moving forward at a pace that was unimaginable just a short time ago, and we are never going back!\n\ni am thrilled to report to you tonight that our economy is the best it has ever been. our military is completely rebuilt, with its power being unmatched anywhere in the world – and it is not even close. our borders are secure. our families are flourishing. our values are renewed. our pride is restored. and for all these reasons, i say to the people of our great country, and to the members of congress before me: the state of our union is stronger than ever before!\n\nit is impossible to keep track of his overstatements. the economy is the best it's ever been? the us has had the largest military in the world for decades. the borders are secure? then why is there a national emergency to build a wall there?\n\nthe vision i will lay out this evening demonstrates how we are building the world's most prosperous and inclusive society – one where every citizen can join in america's unparalleled success, and where every community can take part in america's extraordinary rise.\n\ntrump argues that he is building the most inclusive society in the world. but he has repeatedly said nice things about white nationalists and he has made the guiding principle of his political career to keep immigrants out of the country.\n\nfrom the instant i took office, i moved rapidly to revive the united states economy – slashing a record number of job-killing regulations, enacting historic and record-setting tax cuts, and fighting for fair and reciprocal trade agreements. our agenda is relentlessly pro-worker, pro-family, pro-growth, and, most of all, pro-american. we are advancing with unbridled optimism and lifting high our citizens of every race, color, religion, and creed.\n\nagain, it's debatable that the economy needed reviving when he took office. it's been growing for more than a decade. he did move to cut many regulations — but there are serious environmental impacts for those moves. further, that tax cut bill, which permanently cut corporate rates and temporarily cut individual rates, has made the national deficit skyrocket to more than $1 trillion per year. the national debt goes unmentioned in this speech, which is an incredible thing for a republican president.\n\nsince my election, we have created 7 million new jobs – 5 million more than government experts projected during the previous administration.\n\nthe unemployment rate is the lowest in over half a century.\n\ntrump is correct. between november 2016, the month of his election, and december 2019, the last month for which we have data, the economy added 7.3 million jobs. read more\n\nincredibly, the average unemployment rate under my administration is lower than any administration in the history of our country. if we had not reversed the failed economic policies of the previous administration, the world would not now be witness to america's great economic success.\n\nthis is a difficult claim to make since the unemployment rate has been generally headed down for more than a decade, since the great recession.\n\nthe unemployment rates for african-americans, hispanic-americans, and asian-americans have reached the lowest levels in history. african-american youth unemployment has reached an all-time low.\n\ntrump is correct. the unemployment rate for each of these three groups is at a record low, at least since the government has been issuing data on them. read more\n\nafrican-american poverty has declined to the lowest rate ever recorded.\n\nthe unemployment rate for women reached the lowest level in almost 70 years – and last year, women filled 72 percent of all new jobs added.\n\nthe veterans' unemployment rate dropped to a record low.\n\nthe unemployment rate for disabled americans has reached an all-time low.\n\nthe unemployment rate for americans with disabilities is lower than at any point in the obama administration, but it did go up from 6.1 percent in september of last year to 7 percent in december. in addition, describing this as an all-time low obscures the fact that the government has only tracked this data since 2008. read more\n\nworkers without a high school diploma have achieved the lowest unemployment rate recorded in united states history.\n\na record number of young americans are now employed.\n\nunder the last administration, more than 10 million people were added to the food stamp rolls. under my administration, 7 million americans have come off of food stamps, and 10 million people have been lifted off of welfare.\n\nthe atmosphere is very tense. democrats aren't applauding. as trump boasted about welfare stats, democrats were heard objecting. republicans howled in support.\n\nin 8 years under the last administration, over 300,000 working-age people dropped out of the workforce. in just 3 years of my administration, 3.5 million working-age people have joined the workforce.\n\nsince my election, the net worth of the bottom half of wage-earners has increased by 47 percent – 3 times faster than the increase for the top 1 percent. after decades of flat and falling incomes, wages are rising fast – and, wonderfully, they are rising fastest for low-income workers, who have seen a 16 percent pay-increase since my election. this is a blue collar boom.\n\nit's interesting that he makes this argument since the problem of income inequality is a major issue that democratic presidential candidates are trying to address. income inequality is a fact of american life. look at the trends here.\n\nreal median household income is now at the highest level ever recorded!\n\nsince my election, united states stock markets have soared 70 percent, adding more than $12 trillion to our nation's wealth, transcending anything anyone believed was possible – this, as other countries are not doing well. consumer confidence has reached amazing new heights.\n\nall of those millions of people with 401(k)s and pensions are doing far better than they have ever done before with increases of 60, 70, 80, 90, and even 100 percent.\n\njobs and investment are pouring into 9,000 previously-neglected neighborhoods thanks to opportunity zones, a plan spearheaded by senator tim scott as part of our great republican tax cuts. in other words, wealthy people and companies are pouring money into poor neighborhoods or areas that have not seen investment in many decades, creating jobs, energy, and excitement. this is the first time that these deserving communities have seen anything like this. it is all working!\n\nopportunity zones also created a mind boggling tax break and, somehow, have been exploited to help gentrifying areas. a firm with ties to jared kushner specializes in soliciting investments in them. meet the ceo here.\n\nopportunity zones are helping americans like army veteran tony rankins from cincinnati, ohio. after struggling with drug addiction, tony lost his job, his house, and his family – he was homeless. but then tony found a construction company that invests in opportunity zones. he is now a top tradesman, drug-free, reunited with his family, and he is here tonight. tony: keep up the great work.\n\nour roaring economy has, for the first time ever, given many former prisoners the ability to get a great job and a fresh start. this second chance at life is made possible because we passed landmark criminal justice reform into law. everybody said that criminal justice reform could not be done, but i got it done, and the people in this room got it done.\n\nthanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the united states has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world, by far. with the tremendous progress we have made over the past 3 years, america is now energy independent, and energy jobs, like so many elements of our country, are at a record high. we are doing numbers that no one would have thought possible just 3 years ago.\n\nthe us did not become the world's top energy producer under trump: it took the top spot under the obama administration in 2012, according to the us government's energy information administration. read more\n\nlikewise, we are restoring our nation's manufacturing might, even though predictions were that this could never be done. after losing 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations, america has now gained 12,000 new factories under my administration with thousands upon thousands of plants and factories being planned or built. we have created over half a million new manufacturing jobs. companies are not leaving; they are coming back. everybody wants to be where the action is, and the united states of america is, indeed, where the action is.\n\nboth figures are correct, though it's worth noting that the numbers include both large traditional factories and tiny facilities that produce goods with fewer than five employees. read more\n\none of the single biggest promises i made to the american people was to replace the disastrous nafta trade deal. in fact, unfair trade is perhaps the single biggest reason that i decided to run for president. following nafta's adoption, our nation lost one in four manufacturing jobs. many politicians came and went, pledging to change or replace nafta – only to do absolutely nothing. but unlike so many who came before me, i keep my promises. six days ago, i replaced nafta and signed the brand new united states-mexico-canada agreement (usmca) into law.\n\ntrump overstates the problem created by the north american free trade agreement, and fails to mention that democrats in congress were crucial to passing his new deal. he doesn't say we here.\n\nthe usmca will create nearly 100,000 new high-paying american auto jobs, and massively boost exports for our farmers, ranchers, and factory workers. it will also bring trade with mexico and canada to a much higher degree, but also to a much greater level of fairness and reciprocity. this is the first major trade deal in many years to earn the strong backing of america's labor unions.\n\ntrump is inflating his administration's own estimate of job creation under the new trade deal – which is even higher than an estimate from an independent agency. read more\n\ni also promised our citizens that i would impose tariffs to confront china's massive theft of american jobs. our strategy worked. days ago, we signed the groundbreaking new agreement with china that will defend our workers, protect our intellectual property, bring billions of dollars into our treasury, and open vast new markets for products made and grown right here in the united states of america. for decades, china has taken advantage of the united states, now we have changed that but, at the same time, we have perhaps the best relationship we have ever had with china, including with president xi. they respect what we have done because, quite frankly, they could never believe what they were able to get away with year after year, decade after decade, without someone in our country stepping up and saying: enough. now, we want to rebuild our country, and that is what we are doing.\n\nthe trade deal trump mentions here is a half-measure of what he promised, not a solution to the problem. the us and china will try to finish the job after the next presidential election. he also fails to mention, in particular, the billions in taxpayer-funded bailouts that were required to get us farmers through after china retaliated with counter-tariffs — double the cost of the auto bailout after the financial crisis. he also does not mention the obama-led asia trade deal he removed the us from when he took office. that deal — with other pacific countries — has gone forward without the us.\n\nas we restore american leadership throughout the world, we are once again standing up for freedom in our hemisphere. that is why my administration reversed the failing policies of the previous administration on cuba. we are supporting the hopes of cubans, nicaraguans, and venezuelans to restore democracy. the united states is leading a 59-nation diplomatic coalition against the socialist dictator of venezuela, nicolás maduro. maduro is an illegitimate ruler, a tyrant who brutalizes his people. but maduro's grip of tyranny will be smashed and broken. here this evening is a man who carries with him the hopes, dreams, and aspirations of all venezuelans. joining us in the gallery is the true and legitimate president of venezuela, juan guaidó. mr. president, please take this message back to your homeland. all americans are united with the venezuelan people in their righteous struggle for freedom! socialism destroys nations. but always remember, freedom unifies the soul.\n\nvenezuelan opposition leader juan guaidó stands and waves upon recognition from president trump.\n\nto safeguard american liberty, we have invested a record-breaking $2.2 trillion in the united states military. we have purchased the finest planes, missiles, rockets, ships, and every other form of military equipment – all made in the united states of america. we are also finally getting our allies to help pay their fair share. i have raised contributions from the other nato members by more than $400 billion, and the number of allies meeting their minimum obligations has more than doubled.\n\nand just weeks ago, for the first time since president truman established the air force more than 70 years earlier, we created a new branch of the united states armed forces, the space force.\n\nspace force is trump's brainchild, and he got it done. here's the logo. it'll borrow 16,000 service members from the air force.\n\nin the gallery tonight, we have one of the space force's youngest potential recruits: 13-year-old iain lanphier, an eighth grader from arizona. iain has always dreamed of going to space. he was first in his class and among the youngest at an aviation academy. he aspires to go to the air force academy, and then, he has his eye on the space force. as iain says, most people look up at space, i want to look down on the world.\n\nsitting beside iain tonight is his great hero. charles mcgee was born in cleveland, ohio, one century ago. charles is one of the last surviving tuskegee airmen – the first black fighter pilots – and he also happens to be iain's great-grandfather. after more than 130 combat missions in world war ii, he came back to a country still struggling for civil rights and went on to serve america in korea and vietnam. on december 7th, charles celebrated his 100th birthday. a few weeks ago, i signed a bill promoting charles mcgee to brigadier general. and earlier today, i pinned the stars on his shoulders in the oval office. general mcgee: our nation salutes you.\n\nthis is a very cool story. it's also part of a strategy on trump's part to drive a wedge between black voters and the democratic party, by suggesting that he's done more for them and deserves their support.\n\nfrom the pilgrims to our founders, from the soldiers at valley forge to the marchers at selma, and from president lincoln to the reverend dr. martin luther king, jr., americans have always rejected limits on our children's future.\n\nmembers of congress, we must never forget that the only victories that matter in washington are victories that deliver for the american people. the people are the heart of our country, their dreams are the soul of our country, and their love is what powers and sustains our country. we must always remember that our job is to put america first!\n\ntrump is a proud nationalist. it's the constant refrain behind his retreat from multinational trade deals and much of his protectionist economic policy.\n\nthe next step forward in building an inclusive society is making sure that every young american gets a great education and the opportunity to achieve the american dream. yet, for too long, countless american children have been trapped in failing government schools. to rescue these students, 18 states have created school choice in the form of opportunity scholarships. the programs are so popular, that tens of thousands of students remain on waiting lists. one of those students is janiyah davis, a fourth grader from philadelphia. janiyah's mom stephanie is a single parent. she would do anything to give her daughter a better future. but last year, that future was put further out of reach when pennsylvania's governor vetoed legislation to expand school choice for 50,000 children.\n\nthe american education system is a puzzle that generations of politicians have not been able to solve. states actually control public schools — or government schools, as trump derisively calls them. it will be interesting to see how this issue of school choice — which used to mean vouchers for religious education or home schooling but today usually means charter schools — progresses in the democratic primary. someone like mike bloomberg might not be that far off from trump on choice. other candidates want to insure every kid is guaranteed a good education in every public school. there are no easy answers.\n\njaniyah and stephanie are in the gallery this evening. but there is more to their story. janiyah, i am pleased to inform you that your long wait is over. i can proudly announce tonight that an opportunity scholarship has become available, it is going to you, and you will soon be heading to the school of your choice!\n\nnow, i call on the congress to give 1 million american children the same opportunity janiyah has just received. pass the education freedom scholarships and opportunity act -- because no parent should be forced to send their child to a failing government school.\n\nthis is a proposal backed by republicans in the house and senate and grants federal tax credits to people who donate to scholarship funds. it's been widely criticized by democrats and the teachers' unions, who argue that it would pull money away from public schools.\n\nevery young person should have a safe and secure environment in which to learn and grow. for this reason, our magnificent first lady has launched the be best initiative – to advance a safe, healthy, supportive, and drug-free life for the next generation, online, in school, and in our communities. thank you, melania, for your extraordinary love and profound care for america's children.\n\nhere's a look at what the be best initiative did in its first year. trump, whose bullying on twitter is core to his political persona, left out the anti-cyberbullying piece of his wife's program.\n\nmy administration is determined to give our citizens the opportunities they need regardless of age or background. through our pledge to american workers, over 400 companies will also provide new jobs and education opportunities to almost 15 million americans.\n\nmy budget also contains an exciting vision for our nation's high schools. tonight, i ask the congress to support our students and back my plan to offer vocational and technical education in every single high school in america.\n\nto expand equal opportunity, i am also proud that we achieved record and permanent funding for our nation's historically black colleges and universities.\n\na good life for american families also requires the most affordable, innovative, and high-quality healthcare system on earth. before i took office, health insurance premiums had more than doubled in just 5 years. i moved quickly to provide affordable alternatives. our new plans are up to 60 percent less expensive. i have also made an ironclad pledge to american families: we will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions – that is a guarantee. and we will always protect your medicare and your social security.\n\ntrump's claim about protecting those with pre-existing conditions is false. though trump says he would do this, his administration has consistently taken steps to undermine the affordable care act — including joining a lawsuit aimed at striking down the law — without presenting alternative plans that would offer similar benefits. read more\n\nthe american patient should never be blindsided by medical bills. that is why i signed an executive order requiring price transparency. many experts believe that transparency, which will go into full effect at the beginning of next year, will be even bigger than healthcare reform. it will save families massive amounts of money for substantially better care.\n\nbut as we work to improve americans' healthcare, there are those who want to take away your healthcare, take away your doctor, and abolish private insurance entirely. one hundred thirty-two lawmakers in this room have endorsed legislation to impose a socialist takeover of our healthcare system, wiping out the private health insurance plans of 180 million americans. to those watching at home tonight, i want you to know: we will never let socialism destroy american healthcare!\n\nhe's talking here about medicare for all, which would completely replace the us health care system. read more about that here. he doesn't mention obamacare, which he failed to repeal, but has been trying to suffocate. republicans have not offered a workable health care plan of their own.\n\nover 130 legislators in this chamber have endorsed legislation that would bankrupt our nation by providing free taxpayer-funded healthcare to millions of illegal aliens, forcing taxpayers to subsidize free care for anyone in the world who unlawfully crosses our borders. these proposals would raid the medicare benefits our seniors depend on, while acting as a powerful lure for illegal immigration. this is what is happening in california and other states – their systems are totally out of control, costing taxpayers vast and unaffordable amounts of money. if forcing american taxpayers to provide unlimited free healthcare to illegal aliens sounds fair to you, then stand with the radical left. but if you believe that we should defend american patients and american seniors, then stand with me and pass legislation to prohibit free government healthcare for illegal aliens!\n\nthis will be a tremendous boon to our already very-strongly guarded southern border where, as we speak, a long, tall, and very powerful wall is being built. we have now completed over 100 miles and will have over 500 miles fully completed by early next year.\n\ntrump has not gotten congress to give him the funds necessary for his wall. here he says it's long, tall and powerful. a section of wall being improved blew over in a strong wind this week.\n\nmy administration is also taking on the big pharmaceutical companies. we have approved a record number of affordable generic drugs, and medicines are being approved by the fda at a faster clip than ever before. i was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down.\n\nand working together, the congress can reduce drug prices substantially from current levels. i have been speaking to senator chuck grassley of iowa and others in the congress in order to get something on drug pricing done, and done properly. i am calling for bipartisan legislation that achieves the goal of dramatically lowering prescription drug prices. get a bill to my desk, and i will sign it into law without delay.\n\npresident trump urged lawmakers to come up with legislation to lower prescription drug prices — a demand that prompted some democratic lawmakers to stand up with three fingers in the air. the three fingers were for hr 3. mandel ngan/afp/getty images\n\nwith unyielding commitment, we are curbing the opioid epidemic – drug overdose deaths declined for the first time in nearly 30 years. among the states hardest hit, ohio is down 22 percent, pennsylvania is down 18 percent, wisconsin is down 10 percent – and we will not quit until we have beaten the opioid epidemic once and for all.\n\ntrump's claim is correct, but it needs context. drug overdose deaths declined in 2018 for the first time since 1990, 28 years prior. the centers for disease control and prevention found that there were 67,367 drug overdose deaths in the united states in 2018, a 4.1% decline from 70,237 deaths in 2017. read more\n\nprotecting americans' health also means fighting infectious diseases. we are coordinating with the chinese government and working closely together on the coronavirus outbreak in china. my administration will take all necessary steps to safeguard our citizens from this threat.\n\nwe have launched ambitious new initiatives to substantially improve care for americans with kidney disease, alzheimer's, and those struggling with mental health challenges. and because the congress funded my request, we are pursuing new cures for childhood cancer, and we will eradicate the aids epidemic in america by the end of the decade.\n\ntrump made this pledge regarding aids last year too. here's an explanation of the plan, published then.\n\nalmost every american family knows the pain when a loved one is diagnosed with a serious illness. here tonight is a special man, someone beloved by millions of americans who just received a stage 4 advanced cancer diagnosis. this is not good news, but what is good news is that he is the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet. rush limbaugh: thank you for your decades of tireless devotion to our country. rush, in recognition of all that you have done for our nation, the millions of people a day that you speak to and inspire, and all of the incredible work that you have done for charity, i am proud to announce tonight that you will be receiving our country's highest civilian honor, the presidential medal of freedom. i will now ask the first lady of the united states to please stand and present you with the honor. rush, kathryn, congratulations!\n\nrush limbaugh is one of the most divisive americans in recent history. full stop. earlier recipients, according to the white house, included steven spielberg, muhammad ali, angela merkel, nancy reagan, mother teresa, billy graham, rosa parks and martin luther king, jr.\n\nfirst lady melania trump presents rush limbaugh with the presidential medal of freedom.\n\nas we pray for all who are sick, we know that america is constantly achieving new medical breakthroughs. in 2017, doctors at st. luke's hospital in kansas city delivered one of the earliest premature babies ever to survive. born at just 21 weeks and 6 days, and weighing less than a pound, ellie schneider was born a fighter. through the skill of her doctors – and the prayers of her parents – little ellie kept on winning the battle for life. today, ellie is a strong, healthy 2-year-old girl sitting with her amazing mother robin in the gallery. ellie and robin: we are so glad you are here.\n\nellie reminds us that every child is a miracle of life. thanks to modern medical wonders, 50 percent of very premature babies delivered at the hospital where ellie was born now survive. our goal should be to ensure that every baby has the best chance to thrive and grow just like ellie. that is why i am asking the congress to provide an additional $50 million to fund neo-natal research for america's youngest patients. that is also why i am calling upon the members of congress here tonight to pass legislation finally banning the late-term abortion of babies.\n\nwhether we are republican, democrat, or independent, surely we must all agree that every human life is a sacred gift from god!\n\nas we support america's moms and dads, i was recently proud to sign the law providing new parents in the federal workforce paid family leave, serving as a model for the rest of the country. now, i call on the congress to pass the bipartisan advancing support for working families act, extending family leave to mothers and fathers all across the nation.\n\nthis is an issue with bipartisan support and trump put his weight behind it at the behest of his daughter, ivanka, and brought republicans along with him.\n\nforty million american families have an average $2,200 extra thanks to our child tax credit. i have also overseen historic funding increases for high-quality child care, enabling 17 states to serve more children, many of which have reduced or eliminated their waitlists altogether. and i sent the congress a plan with a vision to further expand access to high-quality childcare and urge you to act immediately.\n\nto protect the environment, days ago, i announced that the united states will join the one trillion trees initiative, an ambitious effort to bring together government and the private sector to plant new trees in america and around the world.\n\nthis is a great thing. trump also pulled the us out of the near-worldwide paris climate agreement and has shown little interest in doing anything to restrict the emissions that create global warming. side note: it was hovering around 59 degrees in washington as he delivered the speech. in february. a couple of weeks ago, after it hit 70 — in january — the official white house account tweeted a somewhat misleading picture of snow falling earlier in the month.\n\nwe must also rebuild america's infrastructure. i ask you to pass senator barrasso's highway bill – to invest in new roads, bridges, and tunnels across our land.\n\na massive infrastructure plan is a so-far unrealized promise of trump's presidential campaign, aside from the endless debate about the border wall.\n\ni am also committed to ensuring that every citizen can have access to high-speed internet, including rural america.\n\na better tomorrow for all americans also requires us to keep america safe. that means supporting the men and women of law enforcement at every level, including our nation's heroic ice officers.\n\nlast year, our brave ice officers arrested more than 120,000 criminal aliens charged with nearly 10,000 burglaries, 5,000 sexual assaults, 45,000 violent assaults, and 2,000 murders.\n\ntragically, there are many cities in america where radical politicians have chosen to provide sanctuary for these criminal illegal aliens. in sanctuary cities, local officials order police to release dangerous criminal aliens to prey upon the public, instead of handing them over to ice to be safely removed.\n\ntrump likes to portray undocumented immigrants as dangerous. the reality is different. he will use this type of language throughout the election year. here's a fact check from last year, when trump said something similar in an oval office pitch for more border money.\n\njust 29 days ago, a criminal alien freed by the sanctuary city of new york was charged with the brutal rape and murder of a 92-year-old woman. the killer had been previously arrested for assault, but under new york's sanctuary policies, he was set free. if the city had honored ice's detainer request, his victim would be alive today.\n\nthe other story he's not telling is the one of creating fear in the immigrant community with deportations and other enforcement moves.\n\nthe state of california passed an outrageous law declaring their whole state to be a sanctuary for criminal illegal immigrants – with catastrophic results.\n\nhere is just one tragic example. in december 2018, california police detained an illegal alien with five prior arrests, including convictions for robbery and assault. but as required by california's sanctuary law, local authorities released him.\n\ndays later, the criminal alien went on a gruesome spree of deadly violence. he viciously shot one man going about his daily work; he approached a woman sitting in her car and shot her in the arm and the chest. he walked into a convenience store and wildly fired his weapon. he hijacked a truck and smashed into vehicles, critically injuring innocent victims. one of the victims of his bloody rampage was a 51-year-old american named rocky jones. rocky was at a gas station when this vile criminal fired eight bullets at him from close range, murdering him in cold blood. rocky left behind a devoted family, including his brothers who loved him more than anything. one of his grieving brothers is here with us tonight. jody, would you please stand? jody, our hearts weep for your loss – and we will not rest until you have justice.\n\nsenator thom tillis has introduced legislation to allow americans like jody to sue sanctuary cities and states when a loved one is hurt or killed as a result of these deadly policies. i ask the congress to pass the justice for victims of sanctuary cities act immediately. the united states of america should be a sanctuary for law-abiding americans – not criminal aliens!\n\nso-called sanctuary cities are a frequent target of trump's. his record against them in court has been mixed.\n\nin the last 3 years, ice has arrested over 5,000 wicked human traffickers – and i have signed 9 pieces of legislation to stamp out the menace of human trafficking, domestically and around the globe.\n\nmy administration has undertaken an unprecedented effort to secure the southern border of the united states.\n\nbefore i came into office, if you showed up illegally on our southern border and were arrested, you were simply released and allowed into our country, never to be seen again. my administration has ended catch-and-release. if you come illegally, you will now be promptly removed. we entered into historic cooperation agreements with the governments of mexico, honduras, el salvador, and guatemala. as a result of our unprecedented efforts, illegal crossings are down 75 percent since may – dropping 8 straight months in a row. and as the wall goes up, drug seizures rise, and border crossings go down.\n\nthis is not true. government data shows that, as of 2017, a majority of asylum seekers show up for their court hearings. read more\n\nlast year, i traveled to the border in texas and met chief patrol agent raul ortiz. over the last 24 months, agent ortiz and his team have seized more than 200,000 pounds of poisonous narcotics, arrested more than 3,000 human smugglers, and rescued more than 2,000 migrants. days ago, agent ortiz was promoted to deputy chief of border patrol – and he joins us tonight. chief ortiz: please stand – a grateful nation thanks you and all the heroes of border patrol.\n\nto build on these historic gains, we are working on legislation to replace our outdated and randomized immigration system with one based on merit, welcoming those who follow the rules, contribute to our economy, support themselves financially, and uphold our values.\n\npassing meaningful immigration reform will take bipartisanship since republican and democratic votes would be required. previous efforts to find middle ground have failed, long before trump.\n\nwith every action, my administration is restoring the rule of law and re-asserting the culture of american freedom. working with senate majority leader mcconnell and his colleagues in the senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our constitution as written. this includes two brilliant new supreme court justices, neil gorsuch, and brett kavanaugh.\n\ntrump can thank mitch mcconnell for his two supreme court nominees and his ability to pack the federal bench. kavanaugh and gorsuch both attended the address, along with elena kagan (an obama appointee) and john roberts (a george w. bush appointee). but most of the justices did not attend. roberts, by the way, has been overseeing trump's impeachment trial. he will preside over trump's presumed acquittal on wednesday.\n\nmy administration is also defending religious liberty, and that includes the constitutional right to pray in public schools. in america, we do not punish prayer. we do not tear down crosses. we do not ban symbols of faith. we do not muzzle preachers and pastors. in america, we celebrate faith. we cherish religion. we lift our voices in prayer, and we raise our sights to the glory of god!\n\njust as we believe in the first amendment, we also believe in another constitutional right that is under siege all across our country. so long as i am president i will always protect your second amendment right to keep and bear arms.\n\nanother interruption, this time from a protestor who began yelling while trump spoke about protecting the second amendment. he was ejected from the house chamber.\n\nin reaffirming our heritage as a free nation, we must remember that america has always been a frontier nation. now we must embrace the next frontier, america's manifest destiny in the stars. i am asking the congress to fully fund the artemis program to ensure that the next man and the first woman on the moon will be american astronauts – using this as a launching pad to ensure that america is the first nation to plant its flag on mars.\n\nmanifest destiny in the stars is a nice turn of phrase. (more on manifest destiny here.) the idea must be that the us is meant to expand and grow in space?\n\nmy administration is also strongly defending our national security and combating radical islamic terrorism. last week, i announced a groundbreaking plan for peace between israel and the palestinians. recognizing that all past attempts have failed, we must be determined and creative in order to stabilize the region and give millions of young people the change to realize a better future.\n\nthree years ago, the barbarians of isis held over 20,000 square miles of territory in iraq and syria. today, the isis territorial caliphate has been 100 percent destroyed, and the founder and leader of isis – the bloodthirsty killer al‑baghdadi – is dead!\n\ntrump can accurately boast about the elimination of 100% of isis' self-proclaimed caliphate in syria, but it's not true that 100% of isis itself has been eliminated; the terrorist group existed before it seized territory and continues to exist after it lost that territory. isis is still a threat in the wars in iraq, syria and afghanistan; isis affiliates continue to claim responsibility for attacks elsewhere; and the us government continues to warn about isis' ability to inspire homegrown terrorists around the world. read more\n\nwe are joined this evening by carl and marsha mueller. after graduating from college, their beautiful daughter kayla became a humanitarian aid worker. kayla once wrote, some people find god in church. some people find god in nature. some people find god in love; i find god in suffering. i've known for some time what my life's work is, using my hands as tools to relieve suffering. in 2013, while caring for suffering civilians in syria, kayla was kidnapped, tortured, and enslaved by isis, and kept as a prisoner of al-baghdadi himself. after more than 500 horrifying days of captivity, al-baghdadi murdered young kayla. she was just 26 years old.\n\non the night that united states special forces operators ended al‑baghdadi's miserable life, the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, general mark milley, received a call in the situation room. he was told that the brave men of the elite special forces team, that so perfectly carried out the operation, had given their mission a name – task force 8-14. it was a reference to a special day: august 14th – kayla's birthday. carl and marsha, america's warriors never forgot kayla – and neither will we.\n\nevery day, america's men and women in uniform demonstrate the infinite depths of love that dwells in the human heart.\n\none of these american heroes was army staff sergeant christopher hake. on his second deployment to iraq in 2008, sergeant hake wrote a letter to his 1-year-old son, gage: i will be with you again, he wrote to gage. i will teach you to ride your first bike, build your first sand box, watch you play sports and see you have kids also. i love you son, take care of your mother. i am always with you. dad. on easter sunday of 2008, chris was out on patrol in baghdad when his bradley fighting vehicle was hit by a roadside bomb. that night, he made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. sergeant hake now rests in eternal glory in arlington, and his wife kelli is in the gallery tonight, joined by their son, who is now 13 years old. to kelli and gage: chris will live in our hearts forever.\n\nthe terrorist responsible for killing sergeant hake was qasem soleimani, who provided the deadly roadside bomb that took chris's life. soleimani was the iranian regime's most ruthless butcher, a monster who murdered or wounded thousands of american service members in iraq. as the world's top terrorist, soleimani orchestrated the deaths of countless men, women, and children. he directed the december assault on united states forces in iraq, and was actively planning new attacks. that is why, last month, at my direction, the united states military executed a flawless precision strike that killed soleimani and terminated his evil reign of terror forever.\n\nhe doesn't mention here that this was an incredibly controversial move, nearly sparked a war with iran, drew condemnation from the international community and drew a rebuke from congress. it's not at all clear there was immediate intelligence trump acted on or whether killing iran's top general was more of a policy goal.\n\nour message to the terrorists is clear: you will never escape american justice. if you attack our citizens, you forfeit your life!\n\nin recent months, we have seen proud iranians raise their voices against their oppressive rulers. the iranian regime must abandon its pursuit of nuclear weapons, stop spreading terror, death, and destruction, and start working for the good of its own people. because of our powerful sanctions, the iranian economy is doing very poorly. we can help them make it very good in a short period of time, but perhaps they are too proud or too foolish to ask for that help. we are here. let's see which road they choose. it is totally up to them.\n\ntrump withdrew from a nuclear deal with iran in part because it was left over from the obama administration. he has not yet been able to secure a new deal. his record of achieving nuclear deals with despots is not good. two words that do not appear in this state of the union: north korea. remember when he promised peace and a nuclear deal with north korea? distant memory.\n\nas we defend american lives, we are working to end america's wars in the middle east.\n\nin afghanistan, the determination and valor of our warfighters has allowed us to make tremendous progress, and peace talks are underway. i am not looking to kill hundreds of thousands of people in afghanistan, many of them innocent. it is also not our function to serve other nations as a law enforcement agency. these are warfighters, the best in the world, and they either want to fight to win or not fight at all. we are working to finally end america's longest war and bring our troops back home!\n\nwar places a heavy burden on our nation's extraordinary military families, especially spouses like amy williams from fort bragg, north carolina, and her 2 children – 6-year-old elliana and 3-year-old rowan. amy works full time, and volunteers countless hours helping other military families. for the past 7 months, she has done it all while her husband, sergeant first class townsend williams, is in afghanistan on his fourth deployment to the middle east. amy's kids have not seen their father's face in many months. amy, your family's sacrifice makes it possible for all of our families to live in safety and peace – we thank you.\n\npresident trump reunited a military family during his address when sergeant first class townsend williams walked out, a surprise return from his fourth deployment to the middle east.\n\nthis was an incredible moment. paired with awarding the girl a scholarship and giving rush limbaugh a medal right there in the house chamber, it's clear that trump is bringing a reality tv flair to the state of the union address.\n\nas the world bears witness tonight, america is a land of heroes. this is the place where greatness is born, where destinies are forged, and where legends come to life. this is the home of thomas edison and teddy roosevelt, of many great generals, including washington, pershing, patton, and macarthur. this is the home of abraham lincoln, frederick douglass, amelia earhart, harriet tubman, the wright brothers, neil armstrong, and so many more. this is the country where children learn names like wyatt earp, davy crockett, and annie oakley. this is the place where the pilgrims landed at plymouth and where texas patriots made their last stand at the alamo.\n\nthis is a peculiarly dated list of childhood american heroes. (we won't get into the administration's failure to fast-track an obama-era plan to put harriet tubman on the $20.)\n\nthe american nation was carved out of the vast frontier by the toughest, strongest, fiercest, and most determined men and women ever to walk the face of the earth. our ancestors braved the unknown; tamed the wilderness; settled the wild west; lifted millions from poverty, disease, and hunger; vanquished tyranny and fascism; ushered the world to new heights of science and medicine; laid down the railroads, dug out canals, raised up the skyscrapers – and, ladies and gentlemen, our ancestors built the most exceptional republic ever to exist in all of human history. and we are making it greater than ever before!\n\namerican exceptionalism again!\n\nthis is our glorious and magnificent inheritance.\n\nwe are americans. we are the pioneers. we are the pathfinders. we settled the new world, we built the modern world, and we changed history forever by embracing the eternal truth that everyone is made equal by the hand of almighty god.\n\nnative american groups are not going to be happy with this part. plus, the us was late to equality and trump doesn't mention it here, but the stain of racism and the growth of white nationalism in the country is a frightening feature of the past few years.\n\namerica is the place where anything can happen! america is the place where anyone can rise. and here, on this land, on this soil, on this continent, the most incredible dreams come true!\n\nthis nation is our canvas, and this country is our masterpiece. we look at tomorrow and see unlimited frontiers just waiting to be explored. our brightest discoveries are not yet known. our most thrilling stories are not yet told. our grandest journeys are not yet made. the american age, the american epic, the american adventure, has only just begun!\n\nhe has repeatedly mentioned western expansion and frontiers. a new theme?\n\nour spirit is still young; the sun is still rising; god's grace is still shining; and my fellow americans, the best is yet to come!\n\nlast note — there is more mention of god in this speech than typical trump speeches.\n\nthank you. god bless you. god bless america.\n\n

(chip somodevilla/getty images)\n\nwhy is health care in the us so expensive?\n\nstory highlights on thursday, the republican senate released its plan to overhaul america's health care system the bill doesn't quite align with the promises trump made on the campaign trail\n\n(cnn) —\n\npresident donald trump has made some grand promises on health care.\n\nsenate majority leader mitch mcconnell this week revealed senate's long-awaited plan to reshape america's health care system – the fruit of many weeks of work entirely behind closed doors by a group of 13 republican senators that were selected by the majority leader.\n\ntrump has already thrown his weight behind the plan, tweeting: i am very supportive of the senate #healthcarebill. look forward to making it really special!\n\nas the senate is expected to vote on the latest iteration of the gop plan next week, we're tracking what trump has promised when it comes to health care, from the campaign trail to the oval office.\n\nwhat the bill does\n\nwhile the senate bill's passage could help fulfill trump's promise to repeal and replace obamacare and cut taxes, it would also break a host of promises he made to americans on health care.\n\nthe senate bill would make sweeping cuts to medicaid, get rid of the individual mandate, and eliminate obamacare's taxes on the wealthy and insurers. it would also prevent federal funds from reimbursing planned parenthood for any health services it provides.\n\nthe plan's effects will become more clear when the non-partisan congressional budget office (cbo) releases its analysis of the bill early next week.\n\npromise: health care for all\n\ntrump repeatedly promised that he would cover all americans when given the chance to repeal and replace obamacare. he stated that coverage for everyone was ​just human decency back in february of 2016.\n\nby then, he had already promised universal coverage. when he was a presidential candidate in 2015, trump told cbs's scott pelley on 60 minutes that everybody's got to be covered. he conceded that it may be an un-republican thing to say, but he wanted to ensure that everyone had quality health care.\n\n​i am going to take care of everybody. i don't care if it costs me votes or not, trump said. he added: ​the government's gonna pay for it.\n\nmore recently, as president-elect, trump reiterated his support for the idea in january.\n\nwe're going to have insurance for everybody, he said in an interview with the washington post. there was a philosophy in some circles that if you can't pay for it, you don't get it. that's not going to happen with us.\n\nwhile we don't yet have an analysis of the senate's plan, it is clear that if signed into law, the bill would fall well short of trump's broad promises to insure everyone. according to the cbo, under the house bill that passed in may – which is similar to the senate bill – 23 million americans who already have insurance would lose their coverage within a decade.\n\npromise: leave medicaid alone\n\ntrump isn't one for wonky policy details. he often makes vague pronouncements on issues like health care. in may, for example, he tweeted,​ despite what you hear in the press, health care is coming along great. we are talking to many groups and it will end in a beautiful picture!\n\none specific thing trump has been clear on, however, is medicaid. he has been consistent in voicing his opposition to any cuts to the program, which helps to provide coverage to low-income americans. on the campaign trail, he often touted his promise to not touch medicaid.\n\nin october 2015, he tweeted, i am going to save medicare and medicaid, (dr. ben) carson wants to abolish, and failing candidate gov. john kasich doesn't have a clue - weak!\n\nthe statement was just one of trump's handful of tweets on the subject.\n\nthe senate gop plan would certainly break trump's promise to lay off medicaid. it makes make deep cuts to the program, ending its expansion under obamacare and capping future payments.\n\npromise: lower costs\n\nanother key promise trump repeatedly has made is that his health plan will lower costs. in january, for example, president-elect trump told the post that his plan would include lower numbers, much lower deductibles.\n\nbut if the analysis of the senate bill is similar the house bill's, this promise might also be broken. the cbo found that while the house bill would decrease health care premiums for healthier, younger americans, it could drastically increases costs for sicker, older citizens.\n\npromise: repealing and replacing obamacare\n\nif the senate bill passes, it keeps alive the possibility of repealing obamacare.\n\nthe bill would repeal obamacare's individual mandate, drastically cut back federal support of medicaid, and eliminate obamacare's taxes on the wealthy, insurers and others – which would be one promise kept.
saul loeb/afp via getty images\n\npresident trump kicked off his wildwood, new jersey, rally tonight with an optimistic economic message, but quickly moved on to hit democrats.\n\nhe cited the new jersey unemployment rate, the phase one china trade deal, and the usmca deal, which he will sign tomorrow at the white house.\n\ntrump went on to tout the us military and the deaths of isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi and iranian general qasem soleimani, which prompted usa chants from the crowd. he then slammed democrats bernie sanders and nancy pelosi, whom, he claimed opposed our action to saved american lives.\n\nwhile we are creating jobs and killing terrorists, the congressional democrats are obsessed with the impeachment hoax, crazy witch hunts, and deranged partisan crusades. that's all they know how to do, the do-nothing democrats, he said.\n\ntrump cited new, high poll numbers and suggested independent-minded voters are leaving the democratic party in swarms.\n\nhe also repeated a favorite inaccurate claim about energy — saying he ended the war on american energy and that the us is now the world's number one producer.\n\nfacts first: the us has not just now become the world's top energy producer, and it's not true that we weren't number one: the us took the top spot in 2012, according to the us government's energy information administration — under the very obama administration trump is accusing of perpetrating a war on the industry.\n\nthe us became the top producer of crude oil in particular during trump's tenure. the united states has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when us natural gas production surpassed that of russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded saudi arabia's, the energy information administration says.\n\ntrump also brought up health care saying, we are protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and we will always will, the republican party, pre-existing conditions. we saved it.\n\ntrump, of course, did not save protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and nor did his party. the republicans, backed by trump, have repeatedly tried to pass bills that would have weakened these protections in obamacare. they are currently fighting in court to get the entirety of obamacare overturned.\n\ntrump then told his usual story about how he had come up with the concept of the veterans choice health care program himself in 2016, thinking he was so smart, but was told others had unsuccessfully tried to get such a program passed for 45 years. he claimed he managed to get it passed himself.\n\nin fact, it was signed into law by president barack obama in 2014. trump signed a law in 2018, the va mission act, that expanded and modified the program.
(cnn) for millions of americans, a job doesn't only mean a paycheck -- it also provides their health insurance.\n\nas unemployment surges amid the coronavirus pandemic , many laid-off workers will have to find new coverage -- a critical protection as more than 180,000 americans test positive and many are hospitalized.\n\na small piece of good news: there are more options for those who have to buy health insurance on their own these days, thanks to the affordable care act\n\nhere's where to look:\n\nobamacare exchanges\n\nthose who've recently lost their job-based coverage can check out the policies available on the affordable care act exchanges by going to www.healthcare.gov\n\njust know that there's only a 60-day window to take advantage of this special enrollment period once their employer coverage ends, said sabrina corlette, co-director of the center on health insurance reforms at georgetown university.\n\nwhile obamacare plans can be pricey, the federal government provides premium subsidies for lower- and moderate-income folks -- a category many newly unemployed may fall into. individuals with incomes up to roughly $50,000 a year or families of four making up to than $103,000 generally qualify for help.\n\nalso, those with more meager earnings are eligible for plans with lower deductibles and out-of-pocket costs. they are open to individuals with annual incomes up to roughly $31,250 or families of four making up to about $64,400.\n\nhowever, those with very low incomes don't qualify for obamacare subsidies, though they may be eligible for medicaid in many states.\n\nseparately, americans who were uninsured before the pandemic hit and are now seeking coverage can sign up for affordable care act plans in the 11 states and the district of columbia that all run their own exchanges. they have launched special enrollment periods that are available for a limited period of time.\n\nthe trump administration has decided not to reopen enrollment for the uninsured in the 38 states that use the federal exchange, a senior administration official said tuesday evening.\n\nand, now would also be a good time for current obamacare enrollees who've lost their jobs or are making less money to return to the exchange and see if they qualify for larger subsidies to lower their monthly premiums.\n\nmedicaid\n\nthe newly jobless who've suffered major drops in income may qualify for medicaid, particularly in the 36 states plus the district of columbia that have expanded eligibility to low-income adults under the affordable care act.\n\ntypically, in these states, individuals who make around $17,500 or less this year and families of four who earn up to about $31,150 are able to sign up.\n\nbut states look at one's income at the current point in time when determining eligibility, said allison orris, counsel at manatt health, a professional services firm. the monthly limits are roughly $1,470 for an individual and $3,000 for a family of four. participants, however, are required to report changes in earnings in the future.\n\npeople can generally apply online or over the phone through their state medicaid agencies at any time, and most states can determine eligibility within 24 hours, according to the kaiser family foundation. medicaid provides comprehensive coverage with no or very low premiums and out-of-pocket costs, though it typically has a more limited network of doctors who accept it.\n\nit's harder to qualify in states that didn't expand, particularly for those without dependent children. but kids could still be eligible for the children's health insurance program (chip), depending on the state and their family income.\n\nwhile unemployment benefits typically count as part of one's income for determining eligibility for medicaid or chip, the new $600 enhancement approved by congress last week does not.\n\ncobra\n\nthose who want to keep their job-based coverage usually can continue it for up to 18 months under the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act of 1985, known as cobra.\n\nbut this can be a very expensive option because one has to pick up the employer's share of the monthly premium too.\n\ntotal annual family premiums cost about $20,600 last year, on average, according to kaiser . employers paid about $14,600 of the tab.\n\nsingle coverage costs about $7,200 annually, on average, with companies covering nearly $6,000 of the premiums.

on thursday, after senate republicans finally unveiled a health care bill that had been shrouded in secrecy, the legislation became something it hadn't been in weeks: a focus of the evening news.\n\nabc and nbc both led their nightly newscasts with coverage of the bill (cbs led with the latest news regarding president trump's suggestion that he had tapes of his conversation with former fbi director james comey, but discussed health care later in the broadcast), ending a long period in which the issue was almost completely overshadowed.\n\nthe health care debate hadn't always been a peripheral story in donald trump's presidency.\n\nfrom february through may, the nightly broadcasts on abc, cbs and nbc devoted a total of 204 minutes to the effort in the house of representatives to repeal and replace obamacare, according to andrew tyndall, who monitors the network news coverage. that was less time than the networks spent covering the alleged russian election interference (238 minutes), but more time than given to the news of the investigation into and firing of former national security adviser michael flynn (135 minutes).\n\nduring those months when the networks were paying so much attention to republicans' health care plans, public support for the gop's proposals plummeted, support for obamacare went up, and house republicans suffered through a messy, embarrassing process conducted in full view of the public before finally passing their version of the legislation.\n\nsenate republicans, led by mitch mcconnell, appeared to learn a lesson from that, and took a different approach, crafting their version of the bill almost entirely behind closed doors. as they did so, network coverage of health care legislation dropped off precipitously. from may 8, four days after the house's bill passed, through june 16, there were just 10 minutes of coverage on the three nightly newscasts combined, according to tyndall.\n\none explanation for the lack of coverage might simply be the incredible amount of other important news. the weeks following the house's passage of the health care bill brought a flurry of major stories -- chief among them trump's firing of fbi director james comey and the subsequent fallout, as well as further revelations regarding the investigation into russia and the election.\n\nstill, coming as it did during a general government trend away from transparency and accountability -- trump's white house has cut back sharply on its on-camera press briefings, and even at times prohibited outlets from broadcasting audio of those briefings, for instance -- the drop-off in coverage has prompted a wave of media criticism and some questions within the press corps. if the government is keeping important business that once would have been public secret, how should the media respond? does it have a responsibility to ensure that such issues don't fade from view?\n\nrelated: why are these white house briefings heard but not seen?\n\ni do think the secrecy made it harder to cover, particularly for television, new york times executive editor dean baquet told cnn in an email. compare this to the coverage of the original health care legislation, where it seemed every detail, every nuance, every fact, was covered extensively and debated very openly. that's the way it is supposed to work, to my mind.\n\nbut there are ways to combat it, he added. the press can keep health care in the news by covering the debate in the states, talking to people who are lobbying on the hill, and pushing hard to cover substantial issues that are playing out away from congress.\n\na number of reporters from a wide variety of outlets, including the times, the washington post, axios, politico, cnn, and others did break news on the substance of senate republicans' bill and the process behind it. but margaret sullivan, the media columnist for the washington post, argues that the issue is as much about placement and focus, or the lack thereof, and believes that much of the news media is playing right into [mcconnell's] hands.\n\nsullivan wrote wednesday that tv news is particularly culpable for the fact that, according to one recent poll, 76% of americans say they haven't heard enough about the senate gop's health care plans. the first and largest share of blame goes to senate leadership, sullivan said. but too much of the mainstream news media comes in a regrettable second.\n\nbrian beutler, a writer for the liberal magazine new republic, had a similar lament, writing that mcconnell didn't lock down the bill-writing process in order to block liberals from going over the bill with a fine-tooth comb.\n\nhis chief insight was in recognizing a bias—not among liberals, but within the news industry—toward what you might call 'new news,' beutler wrote. things we didn't know before, but do know now.\n\nrelated: white house-media relations at breaking point as spicer searches for replacement\n\nbut christopher isham, vice president and washington bureau chief for cbs news, believes his network, for one, has covered the health care proceedings. in an interview with cnn, he noted that cbs news has run more than 40 pieces on health care this year on the evening and morning newscasts, and characterized the issue as an ongoing debate.\n\nit's been a high priority for us going back to the obama administration and continuing on to the current administration, isham said. that commitment remains robust.\n\nisham did acknowledge the difficulty of covering a bill being written in private, though.\n\nit obviously makes it harder for us, but we've continued to do reporting on it. we did a number of pieces on the process itself, raising questions about it. it's not the same as doing the reporting on the nuts and bolts of what's in the bill until it comes out. it's self-evident that it's more difficult to report on a bill if you don't know what's in it, he told cnn.\n\nlike its broadcast counterparts, cable news has at times seen the amount of time it devoted to health care drop off amid the secrecy of the drafting process and the demands of other news.\n\na study conducted by the liberal watchdog media matters for america found in the first two weeks of june, cnn's total coverage of the senate health care deliberations in that time period (22 minutes and eight seconds) lagged well behind both fox news (42 minutes and 15 seconds) and msnbc (47 minutes and 53 seconds).\n\nbaquet acknowledged that the murkiness of the bill-writing process has posed a problem to the times, as well.\n\ni do think we have covered it pretty extensively, baquet said. but even our coverage has been hampered by the secrecy. it means fewer stories capturing the actual live debate. so yes, i think we would have published more and placed more on the front page if this was a public discussion.\n\nthursday provided another reminder of just how cramped the news cycle can get in the age of trump. early in the afternoon, coverage of the senate health care bill gave way to a different development: trump's declaration that he did not, despite his previous suggestions, have recordings of his conversations with comey.
(cnn español) — astrid silva, beneficiada por la acción diferida o daca, fue la encargada de pronunciar la respuesta en español de los demócratas al discurso del presidente.\n\n«estoy aquí representando a los demócratas, a los latinos, y a los 11 millones de inmigrantes indocumentados que somos parte integral de este país, y que constituimos los valores y la promesa de los estados unidos. los mismos que el presidente trump está amenazando con su plan de deportación masiva», dijo.\n\nlee: trump busca una reforma inmigratoria que permita que muchos inmigrantes se queden en ee.uu.\n\nsegún silva, el discurso del trump «fue divisivo y tiene como fin causar miedo y terror en comunidades alrededor del país».\n\n«el presidente trump nos está regresando a las épocas más oscuras de nuestra historia: criminalizando a cualquiera que es diferente, poniéndonos en contra los unos de los otros, y mandando el mensaje equivocado al resto del mundo, así ayudando a fomentar el enojo y odio de grupos terroristas hacia nuestro país», dijo la 'dreamer'.\n\nsilva dijo que en lugar de deshacerse de la ley del cuidado de salud (conocida como obamacare) —»la cual le ha dado seguro médico a millones de latinos», aseguró— ,trump y los republicanos «deberían de hacer mejoras para que el programa cubra a más personas y tenga un costo más bajo».\n\npublicidad\n\n«alrededor del país, personas están asistiendo a reuniones comunitarias con sus senadores y congresistas republicanos, y demostrando su descontento por la posibilidad de que estos le quiten el acceso a seguro médico a millones de personas, muchos de ellos quienes no pueden pagarlo por sí solos. los republicanos deben escuchar a estas personas y asegurarse de que los casi 30 millones de estadounidenses no pierdan su cobertura».\n\nla beneficiaria de dac pidió que las mujeres, los miembros de la comunidad lgbt, los trabajadores, los inmigrantes, los jóvenes, y los refugiados «trabajemos juntos para proteger a nuestras comunidades de las deportaciones, de la violencia, y de la discriminación».\n\n«solo así podremos resguardar los valores que hacen de este un gran país», sentenció.\n\nsilva dijo que los inmigrantes y los refugiados somos el alma y la promesa de este país, y que son los demócratas quienes los apoyan.\n\n«el presidente trump y los republicanos pueden usar una retórica más calmada y aparentar moderación, pero sabemos que las palabras se las lleva el viento, son las acciones las que importan», concluyó.
(cnn) by the end of june, as the supreme court reaches its grand finale and issues the last flurry of opinions before fleeing for the summer, the justices will have changed the lives of those impacted by its decisions, such as undocumented immigrants, lgbtq individuals, supporters of gun rights and even president donald trump.\n\nbut so far, as the midway point of the term approaches, the public has been left with hardly any clues concerning the direction of the court. that's because the justices appear to be moving more slowly than in recent years, having issued only four opinions since october -- a 50% decrease from this time last year.\n\nit's a term for the ages, where the court's newly solidified conservative majority -- serving its first full term together -- may signal how fast and how far the court is going to move on controversial issues such as abortion.\n\nbut court watchers are left wondering what is taking so long.\n\nthe pace of the court's output so far this term is a reminder that, whatever today's political cycle might be, the court moves on its own schedule and its own pace, said lawyer joshua geltzer of georgetown law, who is waiting for justices to act on the future of deferred action for childhood arrivals, an obama-era immigration program, among other cases.\n\nindeed, roberts often points out that the architect of the supreme court placed bronze tortoises at the base of the court's exterior lampposts to symbolize the judiciary's commitment to constant-- but deliberate -- progress.\n\nthese days, however, the tortoise is at a standstill, and the justices have left for a winter recess and won't return until late february. (they can issue emergency rulings and orders remotely if needed.)\n\nso far, they have heard cases concerning lgbtq rights, the second amendment and daca. they are also untangling a messy case having to do with puerto rico's financial condition, as well as another related to the bridgegate political scandal that occurred when chris christie served as governor of new jersey.\n\nin march, the justices will take on a bitter dispute about a louisiana abortion access law and will deal with the president's attempts to shield his financial documents. they are also pondering whether to take up obamacare. again.\n\nto be sure, the justices have held arguments and cast preliminary votes behind closed doors, and opinion drafts are likely ricocheting between chambers. they've agreed to take up big issues concerning the contraceptive coverage mandate and so called faithless presidential electors.\n\nbut while they have considered other petitions, including a series of cases concerning religious liberty, they have yet to announce whether they will grant those cases or let lower court opinions stand.\n\nall the while, the public at large has seen more of roberts on camera during the senate impeachment trial than it has during his entire 15-year tenure on the court.\n\non his home turf, away from the cameras, the action is mostly behind the scenes.\n\nthe silence could mean the justices are struggling, searching for narrow areas of agreement. or the chief might be purposely working to keep the court out of the current political glare. he could simply be distracted by the hours and hours of work he's had to put in across the street, where his attention to detail and legendary preparation have been on full display.\n\nor it could be something else. normally, it's the unanimous, low-profile cases that are the first to emerge. this term, there aren't as many of those. instead, the docket is chock-full of high-profile cases that will touch the nerves of an ideologically divided court.\n\nby the end of june, with the presidential election in high gear, the court will reach a defining moment. the chief -- the man who sits at the middle -- will likely have cast the key swing vote in some cases. the public will learn more about the jurisprudence of trump's nominees. the liberals will have chosen a path forward -- maybe even attracting a conservative vote on one or two hot-button cases.\n\nand the country, by the end of the term, just as another election gears up, will have its first full glimpse of why elections matter.
(cnn) democratic rep. dan lipinski of illinois became the first house incumbent to lose their primary election in 2020, cnn projects, in a victory for progressives and abortion-rights advocates who have long seen the eight-term congressman as being out of touch with the democratic party.\n\nafter coming close to unseating him in the 2018 primary , marie newman defeated lipinski on tuesday amid a coronavirus pandemic that has caused several states to postpone their primaries. with 97% of precincts reporting in the district, newman had 47.6% of the vote to lipinski's 44.1%.\n\nfor many reasons, 2020 was not like 2018 -- not the least of which was the pandemic, which may have shaped turnout in ways that were detrimental to the congressman, whose supporters in this chicago-area district have tended to skew older.\n\nthe primary in illinois' 3rd congressional district was another test of whether a progressive female candidate could unseat a blue dog democrat, whose local loyalties have been fading as his district changes, and whether the house democratic conference would be even less of a big tent on abortion rights.\n\na big base of support for newman was among suburban and well-educated voters, and she may have benefited from a presidential race that's energizing base voters who side with her -- not lipinski -- on issues like abortion.\n\nlipinski is one of the few remaining democrats in the house who opposes abortion rights and voted against the affordable care act. earlier this month, rep. henry cuellar of texas — another conservative democrat who votes against abortion rights — survived a challenge from his former intern, immigration attorney jessica cisneros. like newman, she had the backing of the progressive group justice democrats, which was behind new york rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez's rise, and significant financial firepower from emily's list.\n\nlipinski won by just 2 points in 2018 by mobilizing the chicago political machine, which first helped his father, and then him, come to congress. but that machine isn't what it used to be. chicago mayor lori lightfoot, the city's first black female chief executive, backed newman.\n\nnewman had argued she was in a better position this year than when she was a first-time candidate two years ago.\n\nwe learned from the first race -- there are things that i didn't do well, and i'm now doing well, newman said on an emily's list call with reporters on friday.\n\nshe started fundraising earlier -- she'd raised $1.7 million by the end of the pre-primary reporting period, compared with about $1 million at that point two years ago. that's more than lipinski, who had raised $1.25 million by the end of this year's pre-primary reporting period.\n\nwe had a very small voter-outreach program, newman said of her 2018 campaign. but as of friday, she boasted that 3,000 volunteers had knocked on more than 100,000 doors. between saturday morning and election day, they made 192,000 phone calls -- something they did much more of as coronavirus halted in-person voter contact ahead of the st. patrick's day primary.\n\nthe team may even do a little irish dancing, newman joked on friday, so we keep our hands down.\n\nnewman won earlier support from major reproductive rights groups, some of which had been slow to coalesce around her in 2018. a coalition of groups including emily's list, naral and planned parenthood has spent $1.4 million backing her.\n\nwe need a real democrat with a real plan, newman said friday. she paints herself as the true ally of congressional democrats, thanking my friends in congress for their work on a coronavirus stimulus package . over the weekend, she knocked lipinski -- who was back in the district early saturday -- for not voting on the legislation.\n\nhe was prepared to fly back to dc to vote for the package but after conferring with house leadership they told him they had reached a bipartisan deal and his vote wasn't necessary, lipinski's office spokesman phil davidson told cnn in an email monday. he definitely would have been a yes vote.\n\nlipinski's campaign did not respond to cnn's request for comment.\n\nlipinski held a tele-town hall on the coronavirus saturday morning, which 24,000 constituents dialed in to, according to his office.\n\nneither newman nor lipinski endorsed a presidential candidate, but several of them had backed newman as they looked to solidify their progressive bona fides last year. the only progressive remaining in the race, sen. bernie sanders of vermont, trailed former vice president joe biden in the delegate count heading into tuesday and lost all three states that had primaries on tuesday to biden.\n\nserving on the transportation and infrastructure committee and chairing the subcommittee on railroads, lipinski touted his service to the district. although he voted against obamacare in 2010, he's opposed gop efforts to roll it back and argues that newman poses a greater threat to the law because she supports medicare for all. the chicago tribune editorial board took his side, writing that such massive government spending programs are unworkable and unaffordable.\n\nbut there wasn't much of a concerted effort to save someone who's so out of the mainstream of the national democratic party, especially since the district, which backed hillary clinton by 15 points in 2016, is likely to remain in democratic hands in november.\n\nthe democratic congressional campaign committee has promised to blacklist all consultants who work for primary candidates against incumbents. but rep. cheri bustos of illinois, the chair of the committee, was forced to cancel a fundraiser with lipinski last year because of pressure from the left.\n\nlipinski benefited from minimal outside spending by the super pac affiliate of susan b. anthony list, which typically backs republican women opposed to abortion rights, and a super pac called the center forward committee, which spent about $40,000 on direct mail for him as of mid-march.\n\nthis story has been updated with the results of tuesday's primary election.

(nicholas kamm/afp/getty images)\n\njared kushner at the royal court after us president donald trump received the order of abdulaziz al-saud medal in riyadh on may 20, 2017.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nwhen the trump team arrived at the white house last year, many liberals and moderates – though you'd be hard-pressed to get them to admit it now – took some comfort in knowing that jared kushner and ivanka trump would be close by the new president's side.\n\nit wasn't simply about politics, either. yes, ivanka was expected, for whatever reason, to act as some kind of check on her father's cruder instincts. and sure, kushner is the son of a once prominent democratic donor. but their underlying promise, like a boardroom pitch, was something harder to pin down. it was more of a look, that modicum of composure. it was something like … competence.\n\nwhether one considered the pair successful on the merits is beside the point. both had emerged from troubled but rich families to establish, it seemed, functioning businesses of their own. ivanka's lifestyle brand was a mainstay online and in some large department stores, while kushner had taken over his father's real estate business – the root of his most pressing current concerns – after the latter was jailed years ago. as president trump himself might have put it, they looked the part.\n\nthese were thin reeds to grasp, of course, but they were gripped all the same.\n\nsome 13 months later, as kushner's standing in the white house corkscrews and the notion of ivanka's moderating influence over the president is all but evaporated, those sunny hopes – and they belonged, in fairness, to anxious establishment republicans too – have given way to still more clouds over trump era washington.\n\nkushner's troubles began, though we didn't know it at the time, before trump took office, when he saw fit to attend the now infamous trump tower meeting with a russian lawyer who claimed to peddle dirt on hillary clinton. after arriving in washington, and being handed an almost comically large policy platter, his background check didn't check out and he's been working ever since with an interim clearance. when chief of staff john kelly launched a security clearance crackdown in the midst (or is it the aftermath, now?) of the scandal surrounding former staff secretary rob porter, kushner came into his crosshairs.\n\nlast week, kelly busted kushner down from a top secret/sensitive compartmented information interim clearance to a merely secret one. now a source tells cnn that kushner is feeling at sea, a marked man confused by his diminished role. his question for colleagues: why is john kelly doing this?\n\nperhaps it's a rhetorical point. who knows. his repeated failures to fully and accurately fill out a security clearance form couldn't have helped his cause. his lawyer says he's gone above and beyond at this point. nor did kushner's initial explanation – that a trigger-happy assistant accidentally submitted unfinished documents – inspire a ton of confidence in his management skills. nor has the administration's decision to move the us embassy in israel to jerusalem done much to advance his big middle east peace project.\n\nhis disappearance, along with ivanka trump and the family, at critical (or embarrassing) moments at the outset of trump's presidency also helped replace the ideal of the couple with a kind of slapstick. as an early obamacare repeal effort sputtered on capitol hill, they turned up in the mountains, quite literally, of aspen, colorado, on a ski trip. they were away too, in vermont, when trump imploded following the violence in charlottesville, virginia. the list goes on.\n\nadd that slow burn to the much more serious news, reported by the washington post on tuesday, that four foreign governments have been chatting, independently and idly so far as we know, about how they might take advantage of kushner's combination of complicated business interests, financial troubles and political naivete, and it's hard to imagine any imminent reversal of fortune. rather than a shrewd, well-manicured hand to guide trump's operation, kushner is now more widely viewed as a legal liability. those concerns were compounded on wednesday, when the new york times revealed that the family real estate firm had secured a couple of mega-loans after kushner took white house meeting with lenders. (a spokesman for his lawyer and another, for kushner companies, denied any connection between the talks and subsequent deals.)\n\nivanka trump's troubles have been less serious and less public, but perhaps more surprising. throughout the 2016 campaign, and for years before that, she presented as the conscience and class of the trump family brand. not everyone bought in. the new yorker's emily nussbaum was among those spotted out the cracks early on, during the republican national convention in cleveland that summer, when she wrote about the future first daughter's weaponized graciousness.\n\nas if to prove nussbaum's point, trump said at the time, look, if i have kids that like me that much, how bad could i be, right? and they love their daddy.\n\nbut the reality of ivanka trump's current position, nebulous though it may be, has been more complicated. she helped sen. marco rubio make the case for adding a modest child tax credit to the gop's 2017 tax plan. but when came time decide the future of the paris agreement, she was sidelined. alas, she has emerged as a walking, talking reminder of why nepotism is generally considered a bad thing. more to the point, her efforts to parry questions that get at the underlying problem have fallen consistently flat.\n\nasked in april 2017 about a saturday night live sketch that labeled her complicit in the white house's policy and operations, ivanka pleaded ignorance. not simply to the administration's troubled launch, but the word itself.\n\nif being complicit is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact, then i'm complicit, she told cbs news. i don't know that the critics who may say that of me, if they found themselves in this very unique and unprecedented situation that i am now in, would do any differently than i'm doing.\n\nin some other time, in some other job or position, the conversation might have ended there. but her proximity to power, and the promise of her moderating influence, made the line go viral. nearly a year on, ivanka trump is still trying (and failing) to wall herself off from her father's most controversial behavior – and alleged actions.\n\nin an interview this past week, she cried foul at a question from nbc news about the women who have accused donald trump of sexual misconduct.\n\ni think it's a pretty inappropriate question to ask a daughter, if she believes the accusers of her father, when he's affirmatively stated that there's no truth to it, she said, smilingly indignant. i don't think that's a question you would ask many other daughters.\n\nit was a plainly cynical dodge – one that might have worked back in 2016, but came across as especially ham-handed given the way, in an ironic turn, donald trump as a candidate and then in his political battles as president, so eagerly mocked that kind of pearl-clutching.\n\nfor both ivanka trump and kushner, what once made them appealing, at least to some, is only a few steps removed from what's turned so many potential allies against them now. the couple's inability, or refusal, to passably navigate the challenges implicit to their immense privilege has undermined any claim to some unique competency – even in a white house where the standards are so impossibly low.

medicare for all would increase jobs, employment and tax revenue through massive public investments that could increase worker productivity, economic mobility and ensure that families and children's health care would not be tied to a single job or eliminated amidst a pandemic.\n\nthis commission would work closely with governors and mayors at the state and local level to establish priorities, design implantation strategies, and innovate solutions that are based on the challenges, wants, and needs of grassroots communities across the nation.\n\nbut there's more.\n\nthe commission must explore targeted programs to repair the purposeful injury to black americans caused by racial slavery, jim crow bigotry, inequality in federal housing policies and the gi bill and predatory lending during the great recession.\n\nthird, racial healing requires more than anti-racist hashtags from corporations, sports teams, philanthropists and public officials. leaders in tech, philanthropy and higher education, along with elected officials, must pledge concrete action toward racial justice and equity, with measurable indicators of progress and accountability. the technology, finance capital and entrepreneurship sectors, in conjunction with local, state and federal government could invest in eco-systems that prioritize wealth creation, talent development and access to capital in black communities on an unprecedented scale.\n\n2020 will exist in american and world history as a watershed: the shared trauma of a global pandemic unfolded alongside black lives matter demonstrations and a political reckoning with racism's grip on american life. this year served as an inflection point that illuminates the challenges ahead for a new presidential administration in washington and the collective hopes and will of the nation.\n\njust watched black doctor dies of covid-19 after accusing hospital of racial bias replay more videos ... must watch black doctor dies of covid-19 after accusing hospital of racial bias 01:56\n\nthis new year offers americans a next step in this unprecedented generational opportunity to confront the simmering political rage rooted in structures of racism, economic inequality and violence that have poisoned our politics and created divisions that imperil our democratic institutions.\n\nthe covid-19 pandemic has cast a harsh spotlight on racial disparities in health care, employment, public-school education and the criminal justice system . the coronavirus has upended the very fabric of american life by amplifying the breadth and depth of inequality in our nation.\n\n2021 must be an opportunity to rectify our national failures. president-elect joe biden and vice president-elect kamala harris must do their part but so should ordinary citizens. every city, town and hamlet in the nation should look inward at their histories of racial inequality, acts of truth-telling that can form the basis for local, state, and regional policy solutions that can pave the way toward healing and reconciliation across the nation.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter. join us on twitter and facebook\n\nwe must look to the new year not as the end of the crises that befell us in 2020 but as the beginning of a new chapter that might finally address the roots of the divisions that threaten our collective future. the eloquent words spoken in 2020 against the backdrop of racial crisis must be matched by deeds in 2021 if we are to move forward together.

workers, get ready to pay more for health benefits next year.\n\ntotal costs for on-the-job health care benefits are expected to rise an average of 5% in 2018, surpassing $14,000 a year per employee, according to a national business group on health survey of large employers. specialty drugs continue to be the top driver of increasing costs.\n\ncompanies will pick up nearly 70% of the tab, but employees must still bear about 30%, or roughly $4,400, on average.\n\nthis year, the total annual cost of benefits was nearly $13,500. employers paid about $9,300 in premiums and contributions to employees' health savings accounts. workers shelled out about $2,750 in premiums and another $1,400 in out-of-pocket costs for care, the industry group found.\n\ncosts would have risen more, but companies will adjust their benefits packages to rein in expenses, as they do every year. this is the fifth year in a row that employers are keeping the increase to 5%.\n\nemployer benefits are often more generous and less costly than coverage purchased on the individual market. many insurers are asking for double-digit premium hikes on their obamacare policies for 2018.\n\nrelated: health care is one of the nation's biggest problems: polls\n\nto keep costs under control, nearly 40% of companies will offer only high-deductible plans next year, compared to 35% this year. some 90% of firms will offer a high-deductible plan as an option, but that figure is expected to rise to 97% by 2020.\n\ncompanies are also looking to make health care more accessible. some 54% will offer health centers on or near their locations, and that number could grow to nearly two-thirds by 2020. nearly all employers will offer telehealth services in states where it is allowed.\n\nemployers will also offer more health-related tools and services for their workers, such as providing care management to those with diabetes and other chronic diseases, said alisa ray, vice president at the industry group. and companies will seek to direct employees to particular hospitals and doctors based on their cost and quality.

he gave fact checkers only a brief respite. back to washington and back to doing interviews and campaign rallies, trump made 81 false claims last week. that is tied for the fifth-highest total in the 27 weeks we have counted at cnn.\n\nit was an eclectic batch of dishonesty. among other things, trump took unearned credit for both the ethiopia-eritrea peace agreement and for the drop in the us cancer death rate, absurdly claimed that nato had no money before his presidency, wrongly denied that his golf excursions cost taxpayers any money, and repeated his usual varied inaccuracies about impeachment, immigration and the nuclear agreement with iran.\n\ntrump made 27 of the false claims at his campaign rally in toledo, ohio. he made 16 more in a fox news interview with laura ingraham. he made six in his speech on national environmental policy act regulations, plus 10 in his exchange with reporters after the speech.\n\ntrump's total of 81 false claims last week was above his average of about 61 per week. trump is now up to 1,636 false claims since july 8, an average of about nine per day.\n\nthe most egregious false claim: smearing democrats\n\nprominent democrats had a consistent response to trump's decision to kill iranian military commander qasem soleimani: criticize trump's decision and say nothing nice about soleimani.\n\ntrump nonetheless claimed that they were saying nice things about the top iranian general.\n\nappearing on rush limbaugh's radio show on january 6, trump said, democrats are trying to make him sound like he was this wonderful human being. speaking to reporters after his january 9 speech on environmental regulation, he claimed house speaker nancy pelosi in particular was trying to defend this monster from iran.\n\nat a press conference the very same morning as trump's regulation event, pelosi had called soleimani a terrible person who did bad things.\n\nthe most revealing false claim: ethiopia and the nobel peace prize\n\nethiopian prime minister abiy ahmed won the 2019 nobel peace prize in large part for ahmed's successful effort to make a peace deal with neighboring eritrea.\n\ntrump is an incorrigible acclaim-seeker who has been open about his desire for a nobel. at his january 9 rally, he claimed that he was a more deserving recipient than ahmed -- not for some other initiative of his own but because, he suggested, he was the one who actually made ethiopia's big deal. i made a deal. i saved a country, and i just heard that the head of that country is now getting the nobel peace prize for saving the country, he complained.\n\nthis left ethiopians baffled . experts on ethiopia say there is no sign trump played an important role in the deal.\n\nthe most absurd false claim: trump and cancer\n\nthe american cancer society issued a report saying that the cancer death rate had fallen in 2017 for the 26th consecutive year. trump suggested his administration was somehow responsible for this 26th decline. u.s. cancer death rate lowest in recorded history! a lot of good news coming out of this administration, he tweeted\n\nthis seemed clearly dishonest, but it wasn't clear that the american cancer society would be willing to say so: big organizations tend to want to avoid contradicting the president on even his most obvious falsehoods.\n\nthe society's ceo, gary m. reedy, stepped up to the fact check plate -- diplomatically, but unequivocally. the mortality trends reflected in our current report, including the largest drop in overall cancer mortality ever recorded from 2016 to 2017, reflect prevention, early detection, and treatment advances that occurred in prior years, reedy said in a statement to cnn.\n\nhere is this week's full list of 81 false claims, starting with the ones we haven't previously included in one of the weekly roundups:\n\niran\n\nthe democrats and soleimani\n\nhe was a terrorist. you know, they don't want to call him a terrorist. now the democrats are trying to make him sound like he was this wonderful human being. -- january 6 interview with rush limbaugh\n\nwhat -- you know what i -- what bothers me? when i see a nancy pelosi trying to defend this monster from iran, who has killed so many people, who has so badly -- i mean, so many people are walking around now without legs and without arms. because he was the big roadside bomb guy. he was the one who would send them to afghanistan. he would send him to iraq. he was big. that was his favorite thing. he thought it was wonderful. he doesn't think it's wonderful anymore. when nancy pelosi and the democrats want to defend him, i think that's a very bad thing for this country. i think that's a big losing argument, politically, too. -- january 9 exchange with reporters after speech on national environmental policy act regulations\n\nwhere have the radical left, do nothing democrats gone when they have spent the last 3 days defending the life of qassem soleimani, one of the worst terrorists in history and the father of the roadside bomb? -- january 11 tweet\n\nfacts first: pelosi and other prominent democrats have not defended soleimani or tried to portray him as wonderful. they have criticized trump's decision to kill him, but they have offered no defense of his actions or personality.\n\npelosi called the killing provocative and disproportionate and argued that it put american soldiers, diplomats and other citizens at risk. but she called soleimani a terrible person who did bad things, explicitly emphasizing that her opposition to killing him was not based in any sympathy for him or for iran.\n\nyou can read a longer fact-check here\n\na 2016 incident with iran\n\ntalking about a january 2016 incident in which navy sailors were detained by iran after they strayed into iranian territorial waters, trump said, but you remember the 10 sailors that were 15 feet across that line, probably they weren't -- they don't even know if they were in iranian waters, but they said they were slightly in iranian waters, so they humiliated them. -- january 6 interview with rush limbaugh\n\nfacts first: it's not true that the sailors were a mere 15 feet into iranian territorial waters when they were confronted, and there is no dispute about whether the sailors were indeed in iranian waters. (trump did not specify who they were when he said they don't even know if the sailors were in iranian waters, but he is wrong regardless.)\n\na us navy investigation into the incident concluded that the sailors were 1.5 nautical miles from iran's farsi island, clearly within iranian waters. it was reasonable for iran to investigate the unusual appearance of armed u.s. naval vessels within territorial waters so close to its shores, the investigation concluded . (the investigation also faulted iran for its handling of the incident, but its criticism of iran was not at all about where the sailors were located.) an illustrated map released by the us navy also makes clear that the sailors were not mere feet from that line when they were stopped by iran. iranian and us officials told media outlets at the time that iran's territorial waters extend 12 nautical miles from the island, a standard distance\n\nukraine and impeachment\n\nthe articles of impeachment\n\nthey're making things up. this is the craziest thing anyone's ever seen, and the two articles that they put in, as you know, they're not crimes, they're not -- they're not even allowed to be put in. it's a disgrace. -- january 10 interview with fox news' laura ingraham\n\nfacts first: the two articles of impeachment against trump, : the two articles of impeachment against trump, abuse of power and obstruction of congress , are indeed allowed. while the constitution says presidents can be impeached for treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors, the high crimes and misdemeanors do not have to be criminal offenses. the constitution leaves it up to congress to determine what qualifies.\n\njohn bolton and ukraine\n\nquestion: will you be okay if john bolton testifies? he indicated yesterday that he would if he is subpoenaed. trump: well, that's going to be up to the lawyers. it will be up the senate. and we'll see how they feel. he would know nothing about what we're talking about, because if you know, the ukrainian government came out with a very strong statement -- no pressure, no anything. -- january 7 exchange with reporters at meeting with greek prime minister kyriakos mitsotakis\n\nfacts first: trump was vague, but it is obviously false that bolton would know nothing about the dealings with ukraine that led to trump's impeachment. according to witness testimony in the house impeachment inquiry, bolton, who served as trump's national security adviser until september, was present in relevant meetings -- with trump, with other administration officials and with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky -- and had additional relevant conversations with key players on trump's ukraine team.\n\nhere is a list of just some of the exchanges bolton could be able to testify about.\n\na quote from rep. devin nunes\n\nrepublican california rep. devin nunes, ranking member of the house intelligence committee, appeared on fox news and criticized the intelligence committee inspector general michael atkinson. trump claimed he was quoting nunes when he tweeted on january 12, the democrats know the icig is a major problem-didn't release his testimony. looks so much like everything else we've seen, from the russia hoax, to the ukraine hoax that became the impeachment scam. must get the icig answers by friday because this is the guy who lit the fuse.\n\nfacts first: trump's rendition of the quote had nunes using stronger language than nunes actually did. nunes did not say anything must happen by friday; he said, well, i think it's pertinent that the icig get these answers by friday.\n\ntrump's tweet also omitted multiple sentences that nunes also uttered, but the omissions don't significantly change the meaning.\n\nthe timing of military aid to ukraine\n\nspeaking of the military aid to ukraine, trump said, and, by the way, in terms of the money, it got there two or three weeks ahead of schedule -- long before it was supposed to be there. -- january 7 exchange with reporters at meeting with greek prime minister kyriakos mitsotakis\n\nfacts first: this was wrong. the aid did not arrive weeks ahead of schedule. while trump did lift his freeze on the aid on september 11, more than two weeks before a september 30 legal deadline, the delay caused by trump's freeze meant that : this was wrong. the aid did not arrive weeks ahead of schedule. while trump did lift his freeze on the aid on september 11, more than two weeks before a september 30 legal deadline, the delay caused by trump's freeze meant that $35 million of the aid could not make it out the door in time to meet the deadline, according to impeachment testimony from mark sandy, deputy associate director for national security in the office of management and budget. to deal with this problem, congress had to pass an extension of the deadline. had that provision not been included, then any unobligated funds as of september 30th would have expired, sandy testified\n\nthe government accountability office, a nonpartisan watchdog agency that works for congress, concluded that the aid freeze broke a law, the impoundment control act. (the office's report was released the week after trump made this comment. you can read a full story here .)\n\nforeign affairs and the military\n\nthe fight against isis\n\nthree months ago, after destroying 100% of isis and its territorial caliphate, we killed the savage leader of isis, al-baghdadi... -- january 8 speech on iran\n\nwe've gotten rid of isis. -- january 10 interview with fox news' laura ingraham\n\nfacts first: trump can accurately boast about the elimination of 100% of isis' self-proclaimed caliphate in syria, but it's not true that 100% of isis itself has been eliminated; the terrorist group existed before it seized territory and continues to exist after it lost that territory. isis is still a threat in the wars in : trump can accurately boast about the elimination of 100% of isis' self-proclaimed caliphate in syria, but it's not true that 100% of isis itself has been eliminated; the terrorist group existed before it seized territory and continues to exist after it lost that territory. isis is still a threat in the wars in iraq syria and afghanistan ; isis affiliates continue to claim responsibility for attacks elsewhere ; and the us government continues to warn about isis' ability to inspire homegrown terrorists around the world.\n\nthe nobel peace prize, ethiopia and eritrea\n\ni mean, i'm going to tell you about the nobel peace prize. i'll tell you about that. i made a deal. i saved a country, and i just heard that the head of that country is now getting the nobel peace prize for saving the country. i said, what -- did i have something to do with it? yeah, but you know, that's the way it is. as long as we know, that's all that matters, ok? i saved a big war, saved a couple of them... -- january 9 campaign rally in toledo, ohio\n\nfacts first: trump did not make the ethiopia-eritrea peace deal that led to ethiopian prime minister abiy ahmed : trump did not make the ethiopia-eritrea peace deal that led to ethiopian prime minister abiy ahmed winning the nobel peace prize in 2019, experts on the region say. while american diplomats did play a role in laying the groundwork for the negotiations -- it is not clear how important they were -- experts said trump was certainly not the central player.\n\nin my view, the initiative is purely ethiopian, said awol allo, an associate professor of law and horn of africa analyst at keele university in england, and even if we assume that the americans have played some role, it is not clear to me how that makes trump an obvious candidate. trump has never been to ethiopia and has never said a word about the conflict between these two countries, at least in public. if there is anyone who could claim some credit for the deal between the two countries, it should be middle eastern powers, particularly the united arab emirates, which had a key mediating role\n\ntrump might perhaps have been referring to his effort to broker a deal between ethiopia and egypt in a dispute over a dam ethiopia is building on the blue nile river, a tributary of the nile. but that dispute had not been resolved at the time of his complaint about the nobel, so trump could not have accurately claimed here to have made any successful deal.\n\nallo, who said he was one of the people who nominated ahmed for the prize, emphasized that even ahmed did not save any country, though ahmed did do some really amazing things. both eritrea and ethiopia would have continued to exist with or without the deal, allo said.\n\nnato's headquarters\n\nspeaking critically about nato's history, trump said, well, they build an office building for $3 billion. they do lots of things that they shouldn't be doing, before i got here. -- january 10 interview with fox news' laura ingraham\n\nfacts first: nato does have an expensive new headquarters building, but trump was exaggerating its cost. nato told cnn on tuesday that the building was constructed for a sum under the approved budget of 1.178 billion euro, or about $1.311 billion at tuesday exchange rates, less than half the amount trump claimed.\n\nnato before trump\n\nso when i came in, as you know, nato was virtually a dead organization. it had no money. nobody was paying except us. practically nobody was paying. -- january 10 interview with fox news' laura ingraham\n\nfacts first: nato was very much alive before trump took office in january 2017. and the us was not the only one paying, no matter how you measure.\n\nnato countries other than the us spent a total of $262 billion on defense in 2016, according to official nato figures (which use 2015 prices and exchange rates). the us spent $651 billion itself that year, more than two-thirds of the total, but it's not true that the us was the only one paying if this is what trump was referring to.\n\nnato also has its own direct budget to fund its operations. while the us was also the biggest contributor to this budget in 2016, covering about 22%, it was, clearly, not alone ; germany covered about 15%, france about 11%, the united kingdom about 10%, and so on. countries' contributions were set based on their national income.\n\neconomy\n\nfactory losses\n\nprobably it's the reason, number one reason i'm running: america lost 60,000 factories under the previous administration, 60,000. you wouldn't believe that's possible, but i know it's true, because i've said it 50 times and the fakers back there, they've never corrected me. no, it's true. no, it's true. if i were slightly off, if it were, if i was off by two factories, there'd be a headline: 'donald trump told a fib.' -- january 9 campaign rally in toledo, ohio\n\nfacts first: here, trump was wrong twice -- both with his claim about 60,000 factories being lost during president barack obama's administration and with his assertion that he had made the same claim 50 times before. in fact, he has repeatedly : here, trump was wrong twice -- both with his claim about 60,000 factories being lost during president barack obama's administration and with his assertion that he had made the same claim 50 times before. in fact, he has repeatedly said , correctly, that the us lost 60,000 factories under the previous two administrations.\n\nthere are different ways to measure the number of factories in the country. according to the census bureau's statistics of us businesses data series, the number of manufacturing establishments in the us fell by 61,076 between 2001, the beginning of the george w. bush administration -- when there were 352,619 establishments -- and 2016, the last full year of the obama administration, when there were 291,543 establishments . that's a reduction of about 17%.\n\nbut under obama alone, from 2009 through 2016, the decline was much smaller: 308,934 establishments to 291,543 establishments, a difference of 17,391 or about 6%.\n\nenvironmental approvals, part 1\n\nright now, it takes over seven years, and oftentimes much longer -- and seven years is like record time -- to complete approvals for a simple highway, the simplest of them. -- january 9 speech on national environmental policy act regulations\n\nfacts first: trump was exaggerating when he said seven years is like record time. mary neumayr, chairwoman of the trump administration's council on environmental quality, said at the same event that it takes over seven years on average for federal agencies to complete the environmental impact statement process for highway projects. she added that many projects have taken a decade or more -- but over seven years is, again, an average, not record time.\n\nenvironmental approvals, part 2\n\n...today, it can take more than 10 years just to get a permit to build a simple road -- just a very simple road. and usually, you're not even able to get the permit. it's unusual when you get it. -- january 9 speech on national environmental policy act regulations\n\nfacts first: trump did not specify what he meant by simple road, but he was inaccurate even if he was talking about highways. while it can indeed take more than 10 years for some highway projects to receive environmental approvals, it isn't true that usually, you're not even able to get the permit. brad karkkainen, a university of minnesota law professor and expert on environmental and land use law, said in an email: trump's statement that most of the time you can't get the permit is just flatly wrong, by a wide margin. just a complete fabrication.\n\nkarkkainen noted that the vast majority of proposed actions assessed by the federal government under the national environmental policy act (nepa) sail through without having to go through an environmental impact statement process, the most comprehensive form of environmental review. precise numbers for road and highway projects are not available, but in 2014, the obama administration's council on environmental quality estimated that about 95% of all analyses under nepa (not only for highway projects) were classified as categorical exclusions, meaning that the proposals did not require either the full environmental impact statement (eis) or even the quicker process known as an environmental assessment (ea).\n\nyou can't assume that every project that gets an ea is ultimately approved, but the vast majority are. and beyond that, most of the 250 or so (per year) that get full-scale eiss also go through, albeit sometimes with modifications to mitigate environmental harms and/or to quell political opposition, karkkainen said.\n\nkarkkainen said highway might well have a higher failure rate than other kinds of projects, given how complex and politically controversial they can be, but it's still not true that most are rejected.\n\ncanadian tariffs\n\ntouting his usmca trade agreement with canada and mexico, trump said that the tariffs canada had on american farmers were so terrible, but now all of that goes away. -- january 9 interview with wtvg 13abc toledo\n\nfacts first: trump was vague here, but it's not true that all canadian agricultural tariffs go away in the usmca. most notably, most of the dairy tariffs trump repeatedly denounced during the usmca negotiations were : trump was vague here, but it's not true that all canadian agricultural tariffs go away in the usmca. most notably, most of the dairy tariffs trump repeatedly denounced during the usmca negotiations were left in place by the agreement .

isn't it wonderful?' -- january 10 interview with fox news' laura ingraham\n\nfacts first: poor is vague, but still, there is no apparent basis for calling ocasio-cortez, the democratic congresswoman, a poor student. she graduated cum laude from boston university in 2011 with a bachelor of arts degree, with majors in international relations and economics. as a high school student in 2007, she placed second in the microbiology category at the international science and engineering fair, as fact check website snopes previously : poor is vague, but still, there is no apparent basis for calling ocasio-cortez, the democratic congresswoman, a poor student. she graduated cum laude from boston university in 2011 with a bachelor of arts degree, with majors in international relations and economics. as a high school student in 2007, she placed second in the microbiology category at the international science and engineering fair, as fact check website snopes previously reported\n\nthe top 5% of students in a boston university graduating class are honored as summa cum laude, the next 10% as magna cum laude, the 15% after that as cum laude -- so ocasio-cortez had higher grades than at least 70% of her peers.\n\nocasio-cortez declined to comment on trump's claim.\n\n2016 campaign spending\n\ni mean, crooked hillary spent three or four times more money than us, right?...crooked hillary spent three or four times more. -- january 9 campaign rally in toledo, ohio\n\nfacts first: it's true that hillary clinton outspent trump in the 2016 campaign, but not by three or four times. : it's true that hillary clinton outspent trump in the 2016 campaign, but not by three or four times. according to the center for responsive politics, a money-in-politics watchdog, clinton's campaign spent $563.4 million and trump's campaign $325.5 million, which means the clinton total is less than double what trump spent.\n\nclinton had far more spending support from outside groups promoting her candidacy -- $230.1 million for her versus $72.1 million for outside groups promoting trump, according to the center for responsive politics -- than trump did. but even if you add up the clinton campaign's own spending, spending by pro-clinton outside groups and spending by the democratic national committee, it is not even double the spending by trump's campaign, spending by pro-trump outside groups and spending by the republican national committee.\n\ncnn's camera\n\ntrump accused democratic california rep. adam schiff of leaking stories to cnn. egging on the crowd, trump called cnn crazy, then pointed to the back of the venue, and said, as if spotting cnn's camera, see, with a little red light on. -- january 9 campaign rally in toledo, ohio\n\nfacts first: cnn did not have a red light on as trump was speaking. cnn's photojournalists do not use red lights on their cameras at his rallies.\n\nwe know this is a small thing, but trump has made repeated false claims at rallies about cnn's cameras. (he usually claims that cnn's red light has vanished when he has attacked cnn, supposedly proving that cnn has stopped broadcasting live or stopped filming. in reality, cnn's cameras at his rallies are set so that no light goes on and off as they go live or stop going live, or as they record or stop recording.)\n\nrepeats\n\nhere are the repeat false claims we have previously fact checked in a weekly roundup:\n\niran\n\nthe size of the iran deal\n\ntrump claimed six times that president barack obama or his administration gave iran $150 billion as part of their agreement on iran's nuclear activities.\n\nfacts first: the sum in question was iranian money frozen in foreign financial institutions because of sanctions, not us government money -- and experts say the total was significantly lower than $150 billion. you can read a fuller fact check : the sum in question was iranian money frozen in foreign financial institutions because of sanctions, not us government money -- and experts say the total was significantly lower than $150 billion. you can read a fuller fact check here\n\nthe length of the iran deal\n\ntrump claimed on four occasions that the nuclear deal with iran expires shortly, so soon, very soon, or in a very short period of time.\n\nfacts first: some central provisions of the nuclear agreement with iran were written to expire in the next 10 years. but the deal as a whole -- including a blanket prohibition on iran developing nuclear weapons -- was written to continue in perpetuity, and some provisions run until 2035 and 2040. you can read a longer fact check :

nato secretary general jens stoltenberg just announced $530 billion in increased spending by non-us nato members. in one of these cases, he claimed this supposed $530 billion was all because of me.\n\nfacts first: trump's math was wrong. stoltenberg explained during a meeting with trump on december 3 that non-us nato members have added a total of $130 billion to their defense budgets since 2016. by 2024, stoltenberg said, this number will increase to $400 billion.\n\nthe $130 billion current increase cannot be added to the $400 billion increase expected by 2024; the $400 billion is a cumulative figure that includes the $130 billion.\n\nmilitary planes\n\nafter years and years of devastating defense cuts, we have fully rebuilt the united states military. some of it's still coming in. we have everything. we've got new planes, we've got new rockets, missiles, we've got new everything, and it's either here or coming in, $2.5 trillion in new investments. and: what we have now, we've never had anything like it. you know, we were looking at planes that were old and tired, 50-, 60-year old planes. you've heard this story. the grandfather flew them, the son flew them, the current wonderful person flew them, the whole family flew them. those are all gone now, folks. those are all gone. -- january 9 campaign rally in toledo, ohio\n\nfacts first: this was a major exaggeration. while trump's administration has invested in new military planes, it is not even close to true that the us military has new everything or that the old planes are all gone now.\n\nin december 2018, the congressional budget office reported that the average air force plane in 2017 was 28.3 years old: they range widely in age from the 75 new aircraft that entered service in 2017 to the 21 60-year-old kc-135 tankers that entered service in 1958. the largest share of the fleet is 26--30 years old. the average age for fighter and attack planes was 26.4 years, for bombers 42.0 years, for tankers 53.7 years.\n\nveterans choice\n\ntrump told an extended story about how he had supposedly come up with the idea for the veterans choice health care program only to be told that people had been unsuccessfully trying to get such a program approved for 48 years. trump added, but you know what i'm good at? getting things approved. and we got it approved. -- january 9 campaign rally in toledo, ohio\n\nfacts first: the veterans choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by sens. bernie sanders and the late john mccain, was signed into law by obama : the veterans choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by sens. bernie sanders and the late john mccain, was signed into law by obama in 2014 . in 2018, trump signed the va mission act, which expanded and changed the program.\n\nnato spending trends\n\ntrump claimed three times that military spending by non-us nato members was declining before he took office and reversed the trend.\n\nfacts first: military spending by nato members had increased for two years prior to trump's presidency. according to the latest nato : military spending by nato members had increased for two years prior to trump's presidency. according to the latest nato figures released in november, spending increased by 1.7% in 2015 and 3.0% in 2016.\n\nprevious presidents and nato\n\nand i went over, and i said folks, you got to pay your bills, you're delinquent, you know, you're delinquent. and then, they don't like me. they say, 'we like obama better.' they should like obama better. obama would go in and say, 'thank you very much for coming. i appreciate it. bye-bye.' -- january 9 campaign rally in toledo, ohio\n\nfacts first: it's not true that obama never pushed nato members to increase their military spending. obama and predecessor george w. bush both did so, though their public language was less confrontational than trump's has been.\n\nobama repeatedly urged nato allies to spend more. if we've got a collective defense, it means that everybody's got to chip in, and i've had some concerns about a diminished level of defense spending among some of our partners in nato, obama said in 2014. the situation in ukraine reminds us that our freedom isn't free and we've got to be willing to pay for the assets, the personnel, the training that's required to make sure that we have a credible nato force and an effective deterrent force.\n\nat bush's final nato summit, in 2008, bush called on nato allies to increase their defense investments to support both nato and eu operations.\n\nthe turkey-syria border\n\none thing, i moved my troops out of syria -- on the border between turkey and syria. that turned out to be such a successful move, laura. look what happened. now they protect their own -- they've been fighting over that border for 1,000 years. why should we do it? -- january 10 interview with fox news' laura ingraham\n\nfacts first: there is no basis for the claim that there has been fighting over the turkey-syria border for 1,000 years; modern-day turkey and syria were both part of the ottoman empire that was only dissolved after world war i, and the border between them is less than 100 years old.\n\nthe border he refers to -- the turkish-syria border -- was established in 1923 with the treaty of lausanne and the founding of the republic of turkey. the exception to this is the province of hatay, which passed from syrian to turkish control following a referendum, said lisel hintz, assistant professor of international relations and european studies at johns hopkins, who called a previous version of trump's claim -- in which trump said there had been fighting for 2,000 years -- patently and irresponsibly false.\n\nthe defense agreement with south korea\n\nsouth korea gave us $500 million. they've never gave us -- they gave us $500 million. i said you got to help us along...you've got to pay. and they gave us $500 million. i mean you saw that breaking news because nobody wants to report that stuff. i'm not sure anybody knows it. it might be sort of saying you have some -- i mean, that's good stuff. but they're a wealthy country. -- january 10 interview with fox news' laura ingraham\n\nfacts first: trump exaggerated the size of the increase in south korea's payments to the us for the american troops stationed in the country. as the new york times : trump exaggerated the size of the increase in south korea's payments to the us for the american troops stationed in the country. as the new york times reported in february when debunking an earlier version of trump's $500 million claim: under the one-year deal, this year south korea will pay 1.04 trillion won, or $925 million, an increase of $70 million from last year's $855 million.\n\ntrump is now trying to get south korea to agree to a much larger increase for 2020.\n\ntrump's position on the war in iraq\n\ni didn't want to be there in first place, to be honest, and everybody knows that. that was when i was a civilian, i said it. but we were there, and they made a decision, and i disagreed with that decision very strongly. but we're there now. -- january 7 exchange with reporters at meeting with greek prime minister kyriakos mitsotakis\n\nfacts first: trump did not publicly oppose the invasion of iraq before it began. trump was tentatively supportive of the war when radio host howard stern asked him in september 2002, are you for invading iraq? he responded: yeah, i guess so. i wish the first time it was done correctly. the day after the invasion in march 2003, he said, it looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint. trump did not offer a definitive position on the looming war in a fox news interview in january 2003, saying, either you attack or don't attack.\n\ntrump started publicly questioning the war later in 2003, and he was an explicit opponent in 2014. you can read a full fact check here\n\nukraine and impeachment\n\neuropean aid to ukraine\n\ntrump claimed that france, germany, and all of those countries in europe are not paying money to ukraine. he asked, why aren't they paying? why is it always the united states that has to pay? -- january 7 exchange with reporters at meeting with greek prime minister kyriakos mitsotakis\n\nfacts first: european countries, including france and germany, have provided hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of assistance to ukraine since russia's invasion in 2014.\n\nukrainian president volodymyr zelensky acknowledged european help during his meeting with trump at the united nations in september, though he said the world's efforts had been inadequate so far: and, i'm sorry, but we don't need help; we need support. real support. and we thank -- thank everybody, thank all of the european countries; they each help us. but we also want to have more -- more.\n\nyou can read a full fact check here\n\nthe whistleblowers\n\nand i'd love to bring in the informant who disappeared. i'd love to bring in the second whistleblower who disappeared. and: i want to know what happened to the second whistleblower, what happened to the informer? remember that, an informer. -- january 10 interview with fox news' laura ingraham\n\nand the second whistleblower -- jon, whatever happened to the second whistleblower? the second whistleblower disappeared. there probably was none or maybe we know who the second whistleblower was. maybe we do. but he never showed up. -- january 9 exchange with reporters after speech on national environmental policy act regulations\n\nfacts first: there is no evidence that either the first whistleblower (who filed the complaint about trump's dealings with ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyers said they had firsthand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) disappeared, nor that the first whistleblower's sources in the administration have disappeared. whistleblowers have no obligation to speak publicly.\n\nthe whistleblowers have not vanished, bradley moss, a colleague of mark zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on twitter in october, when trump made another version of this claim.\n\nthe first whistleblower's lawyers, zaid and andrew bakaj, wrote in the washington post in october: because our client has no additional information about the president's call, there is no justification for exposing their identity and all the risks that would follow.\n\nthe second whistleblower never planned to file a separate whistleblower complaint, merely to offer corroborating information in private.\n\nthe accuracy of the whistleblower\n\ni'd love to have the whistleblower who wrote a fake report. -- january 10 interview with fox news' laura ingraham\n\nfacts first: the whistleblower's account of trump's july call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky has been proven highly accurate. in fact, the : the whistleblower's account of trump's july call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky has been proven highly accurate. in fact, the rough transcript released by trump himself showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. you can read a full fact check here\n\nthe rough transcript\n\nwe released the exact transcript, and it turned out to be totally different. -- january 9 exchange with reporters after speech on national environmental policy act regulations\n\nfacts first: the document released by the white house explicitly says, on the first page, that it is not an exact transcript of trump's phone call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky.\n\nthe national security council's top ukraine expert, lt. col. alexander vindman, testified to congress that he tried to make edits to the document to include two things that were said on the call but not included in the document. vindman testified that the document was substantively correct, but he made clear that it was not a verbatim account.\n\nzelensky's comments\n\nthe president of ukraine said i did absolutely nothing wrong, he said i had no pressure whatsoever. he didn't even know what we were talking about. -- january 10 interview with fox news' laura ingraham\n\nfacts first: ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky : ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky did say there had been no pressure from trump and made other statements to that effect, but he has not gone so far as to say trump did nothing wrong.\n\nin an interview published by time magazine in early december, zelensky did say, look, i never talked to the president from the position of a quid pro quo. that's not my thing. but zelensky continued: i don't want us to look like beggars. but you have to understand. we're at war. if you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us. i think that's just about fairness. it's not about a quid pro quo. it just goes without saying.\n\na quote from rep. al green\n\nso they can't win an election that's going to take place in 10 months, they know that, and they only thing they can do -- it's like with their congressman green, when he said, 'we can't beat him, we have to impeach him.' -- january 10 interview with fox news' laura ingraham\n\nfacts first: trump was at least slightly exaggerating green's comments. in may, green said this: i'm concerned that if we don't impeach this president, he will get reelected. in september, when trump previously claimed green had said we can't beat trump without impeachment, green told cnn, i never said we can't beat the president.\n\nthe timing of rep. adam schiff's comments\n\ni'd like to hear from -- he's a corrupt politician, adam schiff. he's corrupt. he gave a sentence. you know, he never knew i was going to release the transcript. he gave a sentence that he made up. he made it up. and it was not the -- it was not what was said in the conversation. that's why i released the transcript; got approval from ukraine. we released the exact transcript, and it turned out to be totally different. -- january 9 exchange with reporters after speech on national environmental policy act regulations\n\nfacts first: trump can reasonably criticize schiff for schiff's comments at a house intelligence committee hearing in september; as we've : trump can reasonably criticize schiff for schiff's comments at a house intelligence committee hearing in september; as we've written before, schiff's mix of near-quotes from trump's phone call with zelensky, his own analysis, and supposed parody was at the very least confusing. but schiff spoke the day after trump released the rough transcript, not before trump released the transcript.\n\nimmigration\n\nthe diversity visa lottery\n\nhow about the lottery? it's called visa lottery. how about this? they put their hand -- 'these people are going to america'...but from honduras, guatemala, el salvador we have...so anyway, but in honduras and guatemala, they have like this lottery... -- january 9 campaign rally in toledo, ohio\n\nfacts first: foreign governments don't conduct the diversity immigrant visa program : foreign governments don't conduct the diversity immigrant visa program lottery for us green cards. the us state department conducts the lottery.\n\nthe people whose names are selected are subjected to an extensive vetting process that includes a criminal background check.\n\ndeportations to honduras and guatemala\n\ntrump claimed that, under previous administrations, honduras and guatemala refused to accept criminals the us wanted to deport back, even refusing to let the us land its planes on their soil.\n\nfacts first: trump was mixing up two separate issues. while the trump administration does have : trump was mixing up two separate issues. while the trump administration does have new agreements with all guatemala and honduras, those agreements are related to the handling of people who come to the us seeking asylum, not criminals the us is seeking to deport. in 2016, just prior to trump's presidency, neither country was on the list of countries that immigration and customs enforcement considered recalcitrant (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the us.\n\nyou can read a longer fact check in this article\n\ndemocrats and borders\n\ntrump said on three occasions that democrats support open borders.\n\nfacts first: even 2020 democratic presidential candidates who have advocated the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren and former housing and urban development secretary julián castro, who has dropped out of the race, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as trump suggests.\n\ndemocrats and the wall\n\nthey were always for the wall and then i wanted it and they went against it. -- january 6 interview with rush limbaugh\n\nfacts first: democrats were not always for the wall. in 2013, many democrats supported a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included 700 miles of border fencing. but that was fencing, not the giant wall trump has proposed -- and many democrats supported it only as part of a package that included provisions they wanted, most notably a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.\n\nfor example, mary landrieu, then a democratic senator for louisiana, voted for the final bill that included the fencing. but she said during the debate: i'm not going to waste taxpayers' money on a dumb fence...i've been in tunnels under the fence. i've watched people climb over the fence. i'm not going to send taxpayers' money down a rat hole.\n\nchina and trade\n\nchina's economic performance\n\nright now china's had the worst year they've had in 67 years. and: last year was the worst they had. in 67 -- was 57, now it's 67 years, and they wanted to make a deal and we made a deal, and it's a great deal. -- january 10 interview with fox news' laura ingraham\n\nfacts first: china's second-quarter gdp growth of 6.2% and third-quarter gdp growth of 6% were its worst since 1992, : china's second-quarter gdp growth of 6.2% and third-quarter gdp growth of 6% were its worst since 1992, 27 years ago . trump has repeatedly made clear that he knows that 27 years is the reported figure, but he has added additional years for no apparent reason.\n\nchina's agricultural spending\n\nbut phase one was -- is a phenomenal deal. could be up to $50 billion in farm product. so that's something that -- the most they ever did was $16 billion. so they go from $16 billion to up to $50 billion. so that's numerous times more than they were buying in the past. -- january 9 exchange with reporters after speech on national environmental policy act regulations\n\nfacts first: china spent $25.9 billion on american agricultural products in 2012, according to figures from the department of agriculture.\n\nwho is paying for trump's tariffs on china\n\nwe are taking billions -- remember what i said? we're not paying for it because china devalued their currency, and they put a lot of money into the pot. we're not paying for it. -- january 9 campaign rally in toledo, ohio\n\nfacts first: study after study , including a report in late november from the federal reserve bank of new york, has shown that americans are bearing the cost of the tariffs. and it is americans who make the actual tariff payments.\n\npopularity\n\napproval among republicans\n\ntrump claimed three times that he had a 95% approval rating among republicans. on two occasions, he said this was a record; on one of these two occasions, he said ronald reagan was in second place at 87%.\n\nfacts first: trump's approval rating among republicans is very high, regularly in the 80s and sometimes creeping into the 90s, but it has not been 95% in any recent major poll we could find.\n\ntrump was at 89% approval with republicans in a npr/pbs newshour/marist poll conducted january 7-12, 93% in a quinnipiac university poll conducted january 8-12, 88% in an ipsos/reuters poll conducted january 6-7, 89% in a gallup poll conducted december 2-15.\n\nthe quinnipiac poll at which he was at 93% had an overall margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points, and a larger margin of error for the smaller sub-sample of republican voters, so that poll found that it's possible trump's true number is indeed 95% -- but it's not accurate to make leaps from the numbers the polls actually found without explaining that this is what you are doing.\n\nregardless, trump's approval rating is not a record, reagan is not in second place, and reagan's peak was higher than 87%. gallup's website features data on approval rating by party for every president since harry truman; george w. bush hit 99% in gallup polling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001. his father, george h.w. bush, hit 97% at the end of the gulf war in 1991. reagan, richard nixon, and dwight eisenhower all went higher than 90%.\n\neconomy, energy, environment\n\nunemployment\n\ntrump said twice that unemployment rate is the lowest in in over 51 years. on another occasion, he said, we have the best unemployment numbers we've ever had. so that's very important.\n\nfacts first: the unemployment rates for some demographic groups are at their lowest levels ever, but the overall unemployment rate is not -- though it is indeed impressively low.\n\nthe overall rate was 3.5% in december -- the lowest since 1969, with the exception of the 3.5% rate in september, but well above the record 2.5% set in 1953.\n\nthe steel industry\n\ntrump said that american steel companies are now making billions in investments, while before, they weren't investing 10 cents. the industry was dead. now, it's vibrant. -- january 9 campaign rally in toledo, ohio\n\nfacts first: while some steel plants were closing, being idled or otherwise doing poorly before trump took office and before trump imposed his tariffs on steel imports, and while some companies were struggling, it's not true that the industry was dead or that not even 10 cents of investment was occurring.\n\na simple google search brings up numerous 2015 announcements about planned investments in steel plants. for example, steel dynamics announced a $100 million expansion at a mill in mississippi. commercial metals announced a $250 million investment to build a micro-mill in oklahoma. nucor and a partner announced a $75 million investment in improvements at a mill in arkansas. ferrous cal announced a $53 million investment in a michigan plant to make steel for automotive companies.\n\nbloomberg reported in an october 2018 fact check: in fact, u.s. steelmakers nucor corp. and steel dynamics inc. were two of the healthiest commodity companies in the world before trump took office. there is no doubt that the steel industry had declined from its heyday: the number of people working in iron and steel mills or in making steel products fell from more than 250,000 in 1990 to under 150,000 by 2016. still, dead is a major exaggeration. in 2016, the us produced about as much raw steel as it did at various points in the 1980s.\n\nthe construction of the empire state building\n\ntrump said it took less than one year -- can you believe that? -- to build the empire state building. --- january 9 speech on national environmental policy act regulations\n\nfacts first: the empire state building was built in : the empire state building was built in 13 months . (we'd have let it go if trump had said one year, but less than one year is wrong. he has made this claim repeatedly.)\n\nmedian household income and energy\n\ntrump claimed twice that the average household has gained $10,000 in income during his presidency.\n\nfacts first: it's not true that household income gains under trump have already hit $10,000 in less than three years. a firm called sentier research found pre-tax income gains of about $5,500 between january 2017 and october 2019.\n\nyou can read a longer fact check here\n\nclean coal\n\nwe ended the war on clean, beautiful coal. and: clean coal. what they do with coal today is incredible, clean coal. -- january 9 campaign rally in toledo, ohio\n\nfacts first: nothing about coal is clean.\n\nclean coal is an industry term for particular technologies that attempt to reduce the many environmental harms caused by coal, a particularly dirty source of power. the term is not meant to be used to broadly describe coal itself, though that is what trump generally does.\n\nenergy production\n\nwe ended the last administration's war on american energy...and with the help of energy workers right here in ohio, the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world by far, number one. we weren't number one. -- january 9 campaign rally in toledo, ohio\n\nfacts first: the us has not just now become the world's top energy producer, and it's not true that we weren't number one: the us took the top spot : the us has not just now become the world's top energy producer, and it's not true that we weren't number one: the us took the top spot in 2012 , according to the us government's energy information administration -- under the very obama administration trump is accusing of perpetrating a war on the industry.\n\nthe us became the top producer of crude oil in particular during trump's tenure. the united states has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when us natural gas production surpassed that of russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded saudi arabia's, the energy information administration says.\n\nair quality\n\nand our air and our water right now is cleaner than it's been in 40 years, and sadly, i can't say historic because, you know, a couple of hundred years ago there was nobody here, right? -- january 9 campaign rally in toledo, ohio\n\nwe have some of the cleanest air and cleanest water on earth. and for our country, the air is, right now, cleaner than it's been in 40 years...in the last 40 years, it's the cleanest right now. -- january 9 speech on national environmental policy act regulations\n\nfacts first: by several measures, us air was cleaner under obama than it has been : by several measures, us air was cleaner under obama than it has been under trump . three of the six types of pollutants identified by the clean air act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before trump took office, according to environmental protection agency data.\n\nadditionally, there were more unhealthy air days for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016 -- 799 days across the 35 american cities surveyed by the epa, up from 702. though there were significantly more unhealthy air days in obama's first term than there have been in trump's, the lowest amount of unhealthy air days -- 598 -- occurred in 2014 under obama.\n\nthe paris climate accord and china\n\nand took us out of that horrible paris accord. i always say, how are you doing with the paris accord? don't ask, saved trillions and trillions of dollars that was put in there to hurt us. in my opinion, it was put in there to hurt us. we were paying money to india, we were paying money to china, china's didn't kick in until 2030, we kicked in immediately. -- january 9 campaign rally in toledo, ohio\n\nfacts first: trump wrongly described how the paris accord works. the accord does give china more time than the us before it kicks in; it came into effect for all participating countries : trump wrongly described how the paris accord works. the accord does give china more time than the us before it kicks in; it came into effect for all participating countries in november 2016 . the accord simply allows each nation to set its own targets for reducing carbon emissions. china picked 2030 as the year by which it planned to meet its primary targets, while the us picked 2025.\n\none of china's targets was to hit peak emissions  around 2030 . another target was to get 20% of its energy from sources other than fossil fuels by 2030. that did not mean the accord somehow wouldn't kick in for china until 2030; 2030 was its (self-selected, non-binding) deadline, not a start date . since the accord came into effect, china has implemented significant new policies to curb its emissions. the obama administration set a target of reducing us emissions by 26% - 28% below 2005 levels by 2025 . that, similarly, did not mean that the accord would have only kicked in for the us in 2025. (trump has begun the process of formally withdrawing the us from the accord.)\n\nthe russia investigation\n\nthe cost of the mueller investigation\n\nwith one of the biggest investigations in history they found nothing, the mueller report, they found absolutely -- think of it. they spent $45 million. -- january 6 interview with rush limbaugh\n\nfacts first: the mueller investigation cost : the mueller investigation cost $32 million , according to figures released by the justice department, and the government is expected to recoup about $17 million as a result of the investigation, most from former trump campaign chairman paul manafort, according to a cnn analysis of the sentences handed out to people charged by mueller.\n\nthe russia investigation a coup?\n\nit's worse than a hoax. the first part of it was a coup. and this is just a continuation of it. -- january 6 interview with rush limbaugh\n\nfacts first: there is no evidence that the fbi's investigation into the trump campaign's relationship with russia was an attempted overthrow of trump.\n\nmichael horowitz, inspector general for the justice department, found basic and fundamental errors in the fbi's handling of applications for surveillance of former trump campaign foreign policy aide carter page under the foreign intelligence surveillance act. horowitz emphasized the seriousness of these mistakes in his december report and congressional testimony.\n\nbut horowitz did not find evidence that the department or the fbi in particular were attempting some sort of coup -- nor even that there had been intentional misconduct. horowitz found that the fbi had a legitimate basis to open the investigation into the trump campaign's relationship with russia and that the decisions to investigate the campaign and individual campaign aides were not driven by political bias.\n\nduring horowitz's congressional testimony, democratic connecticut sen. richard blumenthal asked him, is there any evidence that you found that the fbi tried to overthrow the president? horowitz responded , no, we found the issues we identified here. that's what we found. when blumenthal said, i didn't find any conclusion that the fbi meddled or interfered in the election to affect the outcome, horowitz replied, we did not reach that conclusion.\n\nright to try\n\nright to try. you know about right to try, right? they've been trying to get it for 44 years, right to try. -- january 9 campaign rally in toledo, ohio\n\nfacts first: there had not been a 44-year effort to get a federal right to try law, which aims to make it easier for terminally ill patients to access medications that have not been granted final approval. trump signed the bill : there had not been a 44-year effort to get a federal right to try law, which aims to make it easier for terminally ill patients to access medications that have not been granted final approval. trump signed the bill in 2018 ; similar laws have been passed at the state level only since 2014, after the goldwater institute, a libertarian think tank, began pushing for them.\n\ni have no idea what 'they've been trying to get' for 44 years, alison bateman-house, assistant professor of medical ethics at new york university's langone health, said in response to a previous version of trump's claim. the right to try law was a creation of the goldwater institute, and it first became state law in 2014 (in colorado), relatively soon after it was first conceived of.\n\npre-existing conditions\n\nrepublicans will defend middle-class taxpayers and the right to keep the doctor of your choice. we will protect patients with pre-existing conditions.... -- january 9 campaign rally in toledo, ohio\n\nfacts first: we usually don't fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. the trump administration and congressional republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would : we usually don't fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. the trump administration and congressional republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. trump is currently supporting a republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of obamacare void. he has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds.\n\njudicial vacancies\n\ntrump mocked obama for supposedly leaving him 142 judicial vacancies.\n\nfacts first: trump exaggerated. according to russell wheeler, a visiting fellow at the brookings institution who tracks judicial appointments, there were 103 vacancies on district and appeals courts on january 1, 2017, just before trump took office, plus a vacancy on the supreme court.\n\nthank you very much, president obama. we have a record. it's a record and we will appoint many more, but we -- first day i had 142 judges, 142. i said, 'how many do we have?' 'sir, you have 142.' i said, 'you got to be kidding.' i thought he'd say,maybe none, maybe one, but certainly, no more than one. they're like gold. they said, 'no, sir, you have 142.' i said, 'you've got to be kidding.' how did this happen? president obama, president obama did not get that done. and by the way, mitch (mcconnell) helped a lot too. -- january 9 campaign rally in toledo, ohio
americans are not too enamored with the house gop bill to repeal obamacare.\n\nonly 8% think the senate should pass the legislation as is, according to a new poll from the kaiser family foundation.\n\nabout half of respondents think the upper chamber should make either major or minor changes to it, while 29% say the senate should not pass the bill.\n\none main reason: nearly half of consumers say that their cost of health care will be worse under the house gop's american health care act, according to the poll.\n\nthat's compared to 16% who think the cost will be better and 36% who feel it will be about the same.\n\ntheresa treece is among those worried that she'd have to shell out more for health care under the gop bill. treece, who had rheumatoid arthritis, credits obamacare with making health insurance affordable for her.\n\nthe paragould, arkansas, resident had been uninsured for five years prior to obamacare because she couldn't afford the $3,000 in monthly premiums for an individual market policy. under the health reform law, she pays $300 a month.\n\ntreece, 64, who recently retired as the office manager of a small home improvement business that didn't offer coverage, ticked off the problems with the gop bill. it would allow insurers to charge older policyholders significantly more than younger ones. it would allow them to base premiums on a consumer's health status in some cases. it wouldn't cover annual checkups or preventative tests.\n\nthe gop has not come up with something better or cheaper. i don't care what they say, said treece, who voted for trump. i'm worried about the cost. i'm worried about the coverage. the republicans are not facing reality.\n\nrelated: just 8% of americans think the senate should pass the healthcare bill as is. wow\n\nother americans agree. just over one-third of respondents to the kaiser poll felt the bill would worsen the quality of their health care and their ability to get and keep health insurance, the kaiser survey found. only 15% thought quality would improve, and 16% felt their ability to get and keep a policy would be better. (about half felt the bill wouldn't make much difference to them.)\n\nkaiser surveyed 1,205 adults in mid-may. they included those who are covered through an employer, obamacare, medicare or medicaid, and those who are uninsured.\n\noverall, obamacare enjoys much more positive ratings than the american health care act. some 49% view obamacare favorably, compared to 31% for the gop bill. that's the highest rating for obamacare since shortly after it became law in march 2010.\n\nmeanwhile, 55% of respondents had an unfavorable view of the gop bill, compared to 42% who felt that way about obamacare.\n\nrelated: don't send me back to a high-risk pool, obamacare enrollees say\n\namong the more popular provisions in the american health care act are requiring non-disabled adults on medicaid to work and providing federal funding to cover those with pre-existing conditions in separate high-risk pools, kaiser found.\n\nthe least popular: allowing health insurers to cut benefits so they can sell cheaper plans, letting insurers levy surcharges or base premiums on health status for those who let their policies lapse and raising premiums for older consumers, while decreasing them for younger ones.\n\ntrump has said many times that he would repeal obamacare and replace it with something much better and more affordable. but most americans don't think the house bill lives up to those promises.\n\nsenate republicans are in the process of overhauling the house bill, but they are also struggling to bridge the many divides within the party.\n\nnot helping matters: the non-partisan congressional budget office last week released a report showing the house bill would leave 23 million more americans without coverage by 2026 and send premiums soaring for many older americans and for consumers with pre-existing conditions.\n\nrelated: gop health care bill: premiums may decline, but many will pay more for care\n\nthe ahca is starting at a much lower favorability rating so it's hard to see how the bill can be seen more favorably in the future, said ashley kirzinger, kaiser's senior survey analyst.
(cnn) president donald trump is in the midst of his best week of the year and one of the best weeks of his entire presidency.\n\nconsider just how much has gone right for him since monday:\n\n1) the iowa caucuses on monday were an absolute debacle, failing to report any results until tuesday afternoon and not getting to 100% of precincts reporting until late thursday. and amid that chaos, there was failing to report any results until tuesday afternoon and not getting to 100% of precincts reporting until late thursday. and amid that chaos, there was no clear winner , with former south bend, indiana, mayor pete buttigieg and vermont sen. bernie sanders in a virtual tie. the democrat caucus is an unmitigated disaster, tweeted trump on tuesday. nothing works, just like they ran the country. remember the 5 billion dollar obamacare website, that should have cost 2% of that. the only person that can claim a very big victory in iowa last night is 'trump.'\n\n2) in the wake of iowa, there was a rising sentiment within the democratic party -- and among odds-makers -- that sanders was the most likely nominee against trump. while most hypothetical general election polls show sanders leading trump nationally, the white house -- and many non-bernie-backing democrats, believe that the democratic socialist senator would be the party's weakest opponent against the incumbent.\n\n3) trump's state of the union speech was lauded by conservatives as both a laundry list of his economic accomplishments and a searing evisceration of the supposedly socialist policies of the democratic party. (democrats, uh, viewed things quite differently.) the house chamber rang out with chants of four more years! from trump's adoring supporters among republican members of congress. as both a laundry list of his economic accomplishments and a searing evisceration of the supposedly socialist policies of the democratic party.

jill filipovic is a journalist based in new york and author of the book  the h-spot: the feminist pursuit of happiness . follow her on twitter . the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. view more opinion articles on cnn\n\n(cnn) president donald trump has royally screwed up the federal government's coronavirus response, and he knows it. and he's doing what he always does: instead of fixing any of the many problems he's caused, he's trying to weasel his way out of blame and doing all he can to dodge oversight and responsibility .\n\non tuesday, trump demoted glenn fine, the man tapped last month to independently oversee spending on the $2 trillion federal coronavirus stimulus package. because fine, who was the acting inspector general from the defense department, was removed from that role , he also lost his chairmanship of the pandemic response accountability committee (only inspectors general are eligible to be on that committee). no explanation was offered.\n\nthis isn't just about the specter of the president potentially attempting to assert free rein over the outlay of taxpayer-funded relief. american lives are at stake. the health of our economy -- not just wall street winnings, but the livelihoods of tens of millions of americans, and our basic ability to put food on our tables and care for our families -- is at risk.\n\nfine's role -- the one that will now be assumed in an acting capacity by sean w. o'donnell, who will do this along with his other job as environmental protection agency inspector general -- was to make sure that an enormous stimulus package was being spent as allocated, with minimal waste and no abuse or corruption.\n\nit's disturbing that americans now may have to worry that our president and his cronies could turn a relief package into a vehicle for self-dealing and a sweetheart deal for the rich, but here we are.\n\nfine had been picked by a group of independent federal inspectors general who determined he would do the best job. according to the new york times , the former justice department inspector general earned a reputation for aggression and independence in scrutinizing the fbi's use of surveillance and other law enforcement powers in the years after the september 11, 2001, attacks.\n\nbut in trumpland, such competence and expertise aren't a requirement but a barrier, especially when it comes to oversight duties. the incompetent man at the top is desperate not to have his inadequacy revealed.\n\nfine's head is just the latest to roll as the president has been systematically guillotining watchdogs across the federal government. in a transparently vindictive move, he also removed michael atkinson last friday as the intelligence community inspector general. atkinson had done his job in informing congress about the whistleblower complaint that led to trump's impeachment. trump doesn't like being held responsible for his actions, so atkinson was out\n\non monday trump also attacked health and human services inspector general christi grimm for doing her job. grimm's office had reported what americans already know: that there are widespread delays in testing for coronavirus, and serious supply shortages at the nation's hospitals. none of this is news to anyone. but trump nonetheless tweeted that the report was another fake dossier!\n\ntrump seems to fancy himself more of a king than a president. the same man who once pledged to drain the swamp seems to love mucking around in it, and attacks anyone who tries to clean it up.\n\nno administration is perfect -- remember the obamacare rollout debacle ? nobody expects error-free governance, but good leaders are able to deal with mistakes, swiftly correct them, and accept independent oversight. anything else isn't democracy, it's dictatorship. americans in urgent need of relief during and after the pandemic need to see this stimulus plan wisely and efficiently dispatched.\n\nthere are about 400,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 12,800 dead -- and those numbers may be significant underestimates. without effective oversight -- and there is no reason to believe that glenn fine would not have provided it -- it will be impossible to tell if the stimulus package is being used efficiently to help as many people as possible. without immediate, unflinching feedback on how health and human services is managing this crisis, it will be harder to know the ways to improve the stimulus in real time and stem the tide of disease, death and financial ruin.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter. join us on twitter and facebook\n\ndonald trump could not care less about the health and well-being of the american people. he has no attachment to good governance, professional ethics, or public service. he doesn't like independent watchdogs because they're inconvenient for him ; he prefers lapdogs. and so he is exploiting the pandemic to sack anyone who might point out just how terribly he has mangled the response.\n\nthe result won't just be a swampier and more corrupt white house. we americans may pay with our lives.
president donald trump calls out sen. john mccain for voting no on the skinny repeal of obamacare.
the trump administration has agreed to pay insurers a key obamacare subsidy this month, the white house announced tuesday.\n\npresident trump has threatened to end the payments, which would throw insurers and the exchanges into chaos for the year. the uncertainty has prompted many carriers to request big premium hikes for 2018 and others to downsize or exit the market.\n\nthe congressional budget office said tuesday that ending the payments next year would cause rates for silver-level obamacare plans to soar 20% in 2018.\n\nthe cost-sharing reduction payments go directly to insurers to reimburse them for reducing deductibles and co-pays for lower income enrollees. they are the subject of a court battle between the house of representatives and the trump administration, which inherited the case from the obama administration. the subsidies are expected to cost $7 billion this year.\n\nrelated: obamacare premiums to soar 20% if trump ends key obamacare subsidies, cbo says\n\ntrump has tried to use subsidies as a bargaining chip, first to get democrats to the table and more recently to spur the senate to return to its effort to repeal and replace the health care law. he is paying them on a month-to-month basis, further unnerving insurers. the august payment is scheduled to be sent out next wednesday.\n\nif a new healthcare bill is not approved quickly, bailouts for insurance companies and bailouts for members of congress will end very soon! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) july 29, 2017\n\ninsurers, however, want more than just another month's payments. they would like assurances that the subsidies will continue through 2018. carriers have until sept. 5 to finalize their rate requests and until sept. 27 to commit to participating next year.\n\na broad coalition, including governors, hospitals, doctors and businesses, have urged trump to commit to paying the cost-sharing subsidies to bring some stability to obamacare for now.\n\ntennessee senator lamar alexander, who plans to hold hearings next month on shoring up obamacare for the short-term, praised the president's decision. he said congress should fund the payments through next year, along with allowing states more flexibility to apply for waivers from obamacare regulations.\n\ncongress owes struggling americans who buy their insurance in the individual market a breakthrough in the health care stalemate, said alexander, who heads the senate health committee. congress should act before the end of september to keep insurance available at a reasonable cost during 2018.\n\nbut the conservative house republican study committee was not as pleased.\n\namericans are already paying enough because of obamacare's pitfalls, said representative mark walker of north carolina, who chairs the committee. instead of the executive branch issuing unconstitutional payments to bail out insurance companies, the senate should continue working until they have passed a bill to repeal and replace obamacare.\n\n-- cnn's kevin liptak contributed to this story.
ted cruz is predicting historic growth for the u.s. economy if he's in the white house.\n\nfor the past several years, america's economy has grown around 2% a year. cruz said friday that he can get the economy expanding at 5% or more a year.\n\nthat hasn't happened since 1984.\n\nthe u.s. will have a minimum of 5% gdp growth, cruz said on cnbc's squawk box. gross domestic product, or gdp, is the measure of all the economy activity in a country.\n\nhow can cruz achieve what so many presidents -- republican and democrat -- haven't been able to do in the past 30 years?\n\ncruz says it's about going back to reagan style economics: cut taxes, scale back regulation on business and repeal obamacare.\n\nrelated: americans fear a life of 'dead-end crap jobs with crap wages'\n\ncruz's tax plan is better than reagan's, said arthur laffer, reagan's economic adviser. i think you'll get growth rates higher than reagan's.\n\nthe senator from texas who is battling trump for the republican nomination wants to do away with america's current tax system and go to a flat tax, where everyone pays the same relative amount.\n\ncruz says individuals should pay a 10% tax on their income and all businesses should pay 16% of their income.\n\nrelated: the cost of bringing home american jobs\n\nthe non-partisan tax policy center has analyzed all of the 2016 candidates tax plans. most americans would pay less in taxes under cruz's flat tax, but government debt would also likely soar.\n\nthe cruz plan would require unprecedented spending cuts to avoid adding to the federal debt, the tax policy center wrote.\n\ncruz and laffer disagree. they say that the economy will grow so much that it will bring more jobs and government revenue.\n\nthe numbers that are estimated are, if anything, underestimating the growth, cruz said friday.\n\nrelated: how donald trump could cause a recession\n\nit's a bold claim.\n\njeb bush was heavily criticized for being unrealistic when he promised to get the economy humming at 4% a year. cruz is aiming even higher.\n\nit's a very optimistic projection they are making, said dan sichel, a professor of economics at wellesley college and a former forecaster at the federal reserve.

(ap photo/david zalubowski, file)\n\n(cnn) —\n\na split appears to be emerging among conservatives about who donald trump should choose as his vice president, as the presumptive republican presidential nominee prepares to announce his running mate, according to conversations with several prominent republicans.\n\nmembers of the council for national policy – a powerful conservative organization – is meeting this week in cleveland to discuss policy and political strategy ahead of the republican national convention. texas sen. ted cruz, wisconsin gov. scott walker and republican national committee chairman reince priebus are among the speakers expected to address the gathering.\n\nbut a buzzing topic among attendees is who will trump choose as his running mate and there seems to be a divide about who it should be.\n\nmike pence would be fabulous, as trump's running mate, said one attendee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. he walks with us. he talks with us. he is one of us.\n\nbut pence, the indiana governor, is also viewed with suspicious eyes by some conservatives for agreeing to amend the religious freedom restoration act (rfra) last year.\n\ntony perkins, president of the family research council, said that pence would have been a good choice had he not amended rfra in 2015.\n\ni think there would be a number of conservatives who would have problems … with religious liberty being such a critical issue, perkins said of pence as trump's vice presidential running mate in an interview thursday.\n\ni am not saying there is not going to be any support, for pence if he his chosen as trump's running mate, but i am saying it would not be optimal for him, perkins said.\n\nperkins noted that a solid choice for conservatives of all stripes would be alabama sen. jeff sessions, who is said to be advising trump on his vice presidential decision.\n\nchris christie, another possible nominee, is viewed skeptically by at least one prominent conservative, ken blackwell, who emailed more than 200 conservative leaders on tuesday night with the subject line: christie is not a conservative!\n\nchristie has been on the wrong side of a number of key issues, blackwell wrote, referencing his record on obamacare, taxes and judicial appointments. we need to make it clear that a christie nomination for vice president would be unacceptable to conservatives!\n\nanother attendee of this week's cnp meeting noted that trump would be better served choosing newt gingrich, the former house speaker.\n\ni think gingrich is the safest bet, said the attendee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, noting that gingrich can play the role as chief critic of hillary clinton as well as help trump navigate washington. still gingrich, who has been married three times, is not fully beloved by all conservatives.\n\nperkins noted that trump's selection of a running mate is critical if the presumptive gop nominee wants to secure the full backing of the conservative movement.\n\nhe has to hit a home run with his vp pick. so far, he has made all the right moves, said perkins, who praised trump for releasing a list of names of judges he would nominate for a vacancy on the u.s. supreme court as well as allowing social conservatives to help drive the discussion this week on the rnc platform.\n\ni think if he makes the right pick, he will be on his way to solidifying conservative support, perkins said. i have to say that he is winning me over – slowly i am coming along.

concept.\n\nthe issue was always the conservatives were not brought to the table in the republican party, he said. now we've been brought to the table.\n\nhouse leaders pulled the gop health care bill from consideration friday after it became clear republicans did not have enough votes to pass the legislation, in part because of near-unified opposition from the freedom caucus.\n\nin the days since, the house leadership announced the republican party would move on from its seven-year promise to repeal and replace the affordable care act, and the house freedom caucus has taken a large share of the blame for the defeat.\n\none gop leadership aide predicted that poe's defection, which fox news first reported, could be just the first of the defections from the group.\n\ni feel like they've ostracized themselves like they haven't ever done before, the aide told cnn. i think this could be a breaking point for the membership of the freedom caucus.\n\nthe freedom caucus didn't immediately return a request for comment sunday.\n\nthroughout the negotiations, the caucus' chairman, mark meadows, said he was trying to get to yes and bring his members along. but in the end, the north carolina republican couldn't deliver the votes even after it appeared there might be a breakthrough wednesday.\n\nthe trump administration had offered the freedom caucus a repeal of obamacare's essential health benefits, regulatory changes that would mean insurers no longer would have to include benefits such as maternity care or mental health coverage in their plans. but the caucus rejected the olive branch, arguing that it alone would not be enough to drive down premiums.\n\nthe freedom caucus continued to push to repeal popular pieces of obamacare, such as the requirement that insurers cover people with preexisting conditions, something president donald trump had publicly said he wanted to keep in place.\n\nthe president felt burned by the freedom caucus's rejection of the compromise, a white house official said.\n\nit wasn't about the policy, the official told cnn. it didn't matter what policy we made because they (the freedom caucus) didn't want a deal. we were captives in an internal house caucus fight. the freedom caucus had too much interest in killing this to send a message to speaker ryan: 'you have too much power.'\n\non sunday morning, trump wasted little time publicly rebuking the conservative group.\n\ndemocrats are smiling in d.c. that the freedom caucus, with the help of club for growth and heritage, have saved planned parenthood & ocare!, the president tweeted.\n\nof course, members of the caucus weren't the only republicans opposed to the health care bill. a collection of moderates including rep. charlie dent of pennsylvania and powerful house appropriations chairman rodney frelinghuysen, of new jersey, had also come out against the bill.\n\nbut trump now seems to recognize the house freedom caucus's history as a rabble-rousing collection of leadership agitators, and being a part of a group the white house thinks brought down its first major legislative effort could be a politically vulnerable position.\n\nthey have a history of losing members after they've gone too far and their position is indefensible to the rest of the conference, the senior gop aide said sunday after poe announced his departure. it also probably doesn't help that the president of the united states publicly rebuked them this morning minutes before two of their leaders hit the sunday shows.\n\ncnn's theodore

washington (cnn) president donald trump's final campaign rally of 2019 was not only his longest ever but his most dishonest too.\n\ntrump made 81 false claims in the week running from december 16 to december 22. he made almost half of them, 40, at his december 18 rally in battle creek, michigan on the night he was impeached -- a wild affair in which he spoke for two hours and one minute , nearly 20 minutes longer than his previous longest rally speech\n\ntrump's dishonesty at the rally ran the gamut of subjects -- from impeachment to the size of his crowds to how far battle creek residents need to drive to dispose of their fluorescent light bulbs.\n\ntrump's previous record for false claims in a rally speech was 36, in wilkes-barre, pennsylvania in 2018. his record for any kind of speech, 60 false claims, came in his longest address of any kind, an epic of two hours and two minutes at the conservative political action conference in march\n\ntrump's total of 81 false claims the week of the rally was tied for the fifth-highest weekly total of the 25 weeks we have tracked at cnn since july 8.\n\ntrump made just nine false claims in the week from december 23 through december 29, the lowest of any week we have counted. trump has been in florida since december 20, and he has made few public remarks and had little on his public schedule since a 15-false-claim speech to conservative student group turning point usa on december 21.\n\ntrump made 1,540 false claims between july 8 and december 29, about nine per day.\n\nthe most egregious false claim: dishwasher dishonesty\n\nokay, it sounds kind of comedic when the president of the united states complains extremely inaccurately about dishwashers. but as we explained when we called this the most notable trump lie of december , it's also serious stuff. trump is using his false claim that modern dishwashers require more water and electricity than older dishwashers to try to sell an effort to weaken efficiency standards.\n\nthere is some possibility he is very confused rather than intentionally deceitful. but that would still be bad.\n\nthe most revealing false claim: military planes\n\ntrump makes false claims not only when trying to deceive low-information voters but when talking to people who are experts in the subject he is being inaccurate about.\n\nduring a christmas eve teleconference with members of the military, trump told them that three years ago, before he was president, they had to use old planes, but that now you have all brand new.\n\nmembers of the military are well aware of how wrong this is. as of late 2017, the average age of an air force plane was 28.3 years. trump's administration has continued to order new planes since then, but all brand new remains false.\n\nthe most absurd false claim: the war on christmas\n\nhaving promised in 2015 and 2016 that every store would use the phrase merry christmas again when he became president rather than happy holidays -- since, according to him , you don't ever see the word 'christmas' anymore' -- trump, naturally, claimed this december that all department stores are now saying merry christmas again.\n\nthat is false. just as it was false when he said they had all stopped referring to christmas in the first place.\n\nhere is the full list of 90 false claims from december 14 through december 27, starting with the ones we haven't previously included in one of these roundups:\n\ndemocrats\n\ndemocrats and steel\n\ntrump said of democrats: they want to close up your steel mills. they don't want your steel mills. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: there may be some democrats somewhere who want to shut down american steel mills, but this is not true of the party generally or of its leading presidential candidates.\n\nformer vice president joe biden, the leader in national polls of the democratic presidential primary, says the federal government should use tariffs on low-cost dumped foreign steel in an effort to protect domestic steel producers. vermont sen. bernie sanders is promising to create union, family-wage jobs in steel manufacturing. massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren has criticized the trump administration for how it has granted exemptions to trump's own steel tariffs -- complaining that the administration's acts have undermined american steel producers. south bend, indiana mayor pete buttigieg is calling for net-zero emissions from industry, including steel and concrete, manufacturing, and agriculture sectors, by 2050 -- so environmental improvements in steel production, not the end of steel production.\n\ntrump's unsubstantiated claims\n\ntrump mocked journalists for calling it unsubstantiated when he says joe biden had told ukrainian officials he would refuse to give $1 billion of taxpayer money to ukraine unless they get the prosecutor to stop looking at your son and your son's company. trump said, he's on tape. he's -- if that were me, it's the electric chair. they would bring the electric chair back. no, the guy's on tape and they always say it's unsubstantiated. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: trump's claims are unsubstantiated -- at best. there is no evidence biden ever tried to get a ukrainian prosecutor to stop investigating burisma, the ukrainian natural gas company where his son, hunter biden, had sat on the board of directors.\n\nrather, joe biden -- carrying out the policy of the us government and its european allies -- threatened to deny a $1 billion loan guarantee to ukraine unless it fired a prosecutor, viktor shokin, who was widely seen as corrupt or ineffective; there is no sign biden tried to thwart the burisma case. also, there is no evidence hunter biden was ever himself under investigation. and it is not even clear that shokin was carrying out the investigation into burisma or its owner, mykola zlochevsky, at the time joe biden applied the pressure; shokin's former deputy, vitaliy kasko, has said that the investigation was dormant at the time: there was no pressure from anyone from the us to close cases against zlochevsky. it was shelved by ukrainian prosecutors in 2014 and through 2015.\n\njoe biden is on tape at a 2018 event telling the story of how he pushed for shokin's firing, not on tape admitting he tried to stop any investigation or to help his son.\n\nbiden's crowds\n\nso biden has this rally, like you know, they got 200 seats -- but only a small number of people. so you know what they do? they set up a roundtable. so think of these people. they come in, they think they're gonna listen to the speech; they end up sitting at a roundtable, discussing. they must have been happy, right? -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: we could not find any cases in which biden was supposed to make a campaign speech but drew so few attendees that his campaign roped the people who did come into having a roundtable discussion with him instead. the biden campaign told us this did not happen; the trump campaign did not respond to a request to identify the event trump was talking about.\n\ndemocrats and refugees\n\nevery democrat running for president wants to open the floodgates to unlimited refugees from all around the world, overwhelming your communities and putting our national security at grave risk. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: democratic presidential candidates do want to allow in a greater number of refugees than trump has -- trump has set a cap of 18,000 refugees for the current fiscal year, : democratic presidential candidates do want to allow in a greater number of refugees than trump has -- trump has set a cap of 18,000 refugees for the current fiscal year, a historic low -- but it is not true that all of the candidates are proposing to allow unlimited refugees.\n\nfor example, biden calls for restoring refugee admissions in line with our historic practice under both democratic and republican administrations; his website says , he will set the annual global refugee admissions cap to 125,000, and seek to raise it over time commensurate with our responsibility, our values, and the unprecedented global need. warren wrote in july, i'll welcome 125,000 refugees in my first year, and ramping up to at least 175,000 refugees per year by the end of my first term.\n\nvermont sen. bernie sanders' plan says he would lift president trump's refugee caps and does not include a specific desired number of refugees -- sanders' campaign did not respond to a request for comment -- so it is possible to argue that sanders is calling for unlimited refugees. but that is not true of the entire field.\n\nmichelle obama, bill clinton and michigan\n\ntrump said that, on the last day of the 2016 election, hillary, barack obama, michelle obama, and bill clinton -- they did an emergency trip. they did an emergency trip to michigan at 6 o'clock. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: michelle obama and bill clinton did not go to michigan for hillary clinton's : michelle obama and bill clinton did not go to michigan for hillary clinton's rally in the state on the last day of the campaign, nor for president barack obama's rally in the state that day. both bill clinton, who campaigned in north carolina that day, and michelle obama joined hillary clinton, along with barack obama, at a nighttime rally in philadelphia.\n\nhillary clinton's final crowd in michigan\n\ntrump said that, at hillary clinton's emergency rally in michigan the day before the election, she had 500 people. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: clinton had a capacity crowd of more than 4,000 people for her rally at grand valley state university, according to local media : clinton had a capacity crowd of more than 4,000 people for her rally at grand valley state university, according to local media reports at the time. grand rapids' wood tv8 reported : in addition to the about 4,600 inside the fieldhouse for clinton's speech, there was an overflow crowd of several hundred more outside. people lined up hours beforehand to attend clinton's 4 p.m. rally.\n\nthis was not a one-time slip; trump has repeatedly put clinton's crowd at 500.\n\nan unfair trial\n\npelosi gives us the most unfair trial in the history of the u.s. congress... -- december 23 tweet\n\nfacts first: the house did not hold a trial at all. under the constitution, it is the : the house did not hold a trial at all. under the constitution, it is the senate that has the sole power to try impeachments.\n\nthis is not merely a matter of semantics. during the house impeachment process, republicans complained that trump was being denied constitutional rights afforded to criminal defendants -- wrongly suggesting to the public that the house process was tantamount to a trial.\n\nthe constitution and impeachment\n\nworse still, i have been deprived of basic constitutional due process from the beginning of this impeachment scam right up until the present. i have been denied the most fundamental rights afforded by the constitution, including the right to present evidence, to have my own counsel present, to confront accusers, and to call and cross-examine witnesses... -- december 17 anti-impeachment letter to house speaker nancy pelosi\n\nfacts first: the constitutional rights of criminal defendants do not apply to public officials in a house of representatives impeachment process, though trump is free to argue that they should. trump's counsel was denied the opportunity to participate in house intelligence committee impeachment hearings but was invited to participate in house judiciary committee hearings; trump's counsel declined that opportunity. house republicans were allowed to have their lawyer question witnesses at the house intelligence committee.\n\ntrump's crowds\n\nthe crowd in battle creek\n\ntrump referred to people standing in the crowd, then added, and i'm sorry we couldn't get you seats -- we didn't have any room. and by the way, 20,000 people outside had to leave. you know it's so cold outside we tell them, 'don't worry about a screen. go home, go home and watch.' -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: we do not know the exact number of trump supporters who were stuck outside because they were unable to get into his rally in battle creek, michigan, but it was nowhere close to 20,000. (trump has : we do not know the exact number of trump supporters who were stuck outside because they were unable to get into his rally in battle creek, michigan, but it was nowhere close to 20,000. (trump has long exaggerated the number of people stuck outside his events.)\n\nbattle creek city spokesperson jessica vanderkolk said in an email that the city's best guess was that there were about 1,000 people who were not allowed inside once the arena reached capacity. eric greene, a former journalist and managing editor of the battle creek enquirer newspaper who now works in public relations, wrote on twitter: trump just said there were 20,000 people who had to leave because they couldn't fit in the arena. this is blatantly false. i know because i was outside the arena at the moment they closed the doors at approximately 5:45 p.m. at that time, a few hundred people quietly walked away.\n\nthe battle creek arena had a capacity of about 5,500 for the trump event, according to the city and local media . brooks hepp, a current enquirer reporter, said in an email that he did not see the size of the overflow crowd at its peak, but he said the overflow area could not hold anywhere near 20,000 people, so that number is likely inaccurate. he said he would offer a rough guess of probably 2,000-3,000 people at its peak and 1,000 by the time trump started his speech.\n\npeople leaving trump rallies\n\ntrump said nobody ever leaves his rally speeches: i know they're coming back, nobody ever leaves our speeches. because is there a better place to be in the world than a trump rally? never. nobody. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: this is simply not true. people have been : this is simply not true. people have been seen leaving multiple trump rally speeches before he has finished speaking -- including this very speech. the new york times reported that as the speech went on, supporters began leaving in significant numbers or in some cases, appeared to doze off in their seats. michigan television station wkzo reported : some supporters started to leave early as the rally ran past 9:45 p.m.\n\ntrump's venues\n\ni've had crowds over the last couple of weeks -- we went to different, pennsylvania, florida, but -- i mean, thousands and thousands of people can't get into these, you know, nba arenas, right, big arenas. and we set records at every one, because we use the floor...but we use the floor, right, the basketball court. so we set records at every arena. they never even mentioned the crowds. they never mention the crowds, it's sort of amazing. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: trump does sometimes hold rallies at nba arenas, or at least nba-sized arenas, but many of his venues are much smaller than that. even when he has spoken in actual nba arenas, it is not true that he has set a record every time. and it's not true that the media never mentions his crowds. to the contrary, his crowds are a regular subject of media attention.\n\nbefore he spoke at this battle creek, michigan venue with an approximate capacity of 5,500 people, he spoke at a hershey, pennsylvania venue with an approximate capacity of 10,500 ; neither of them was an nba venue. his venue before that was an nba-sized venue in sunrise, florida -- the home of the florida panthers nhl team, with an approximate capacity of 20,000.\n\ntrump does not set an attendance record each time he holds a rally in an nba arena. the last actual nba arena he spoke in was the american airlines center in dallas. jason evans, a spokesman for the dallas fire-rescue department, told cnn that the fire department and the arena calculated an attendance of 18,500. the dallas mavericks, who play in the arena, had an average announced attendance of 20,013 per game last season, among the highest in the nba, according to espn data\n\nit is obviously false that the media never even mentions trump's crowds. the response of the crowd to his rhetoric is a regular part of media coverage of his rallies; media outlets regularly mention when a rally venue was filled to capacity; their stories regularly include quotes from people in the crowd.\n\neconomy\n\ntrade with europe\n\nspeaking of europe supposedly taking advantage of the us on trade, trump said, they don't take your product. they don't take your cars. they don't take your farm product. they don't take your medical machines. we do a big business, they sell us, we don't sell them, because they put restrictions. we have better equipment than them, but they make it so that our equipment doesn't qualify. you know, it's called artificial barriers or non-monetary barriers. it's brutal. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: while the european union does have non-tariff barriers that make it costly or difficult for us businesses to export products there -- you can read : while the european union does have non-tariff barriers that make it costly or difficult for us businesses to export products there -- you can read here , for example, about some of the requirements the eu imposes on pork products -- it is a major exaggeration to say eu countries simply don't take us farm products, cars or medical devices.\n\nas for farm products, the office of the us trade representative says on its website: u.s. domestic exports of agricultural products to the eu totaled $13.5 billion in 2018. the eu countries together would rank 3rd as an ag export market for the united states. the same website says the us exported $27.7 billion worth of optical and medical instruments to the eu in 2018.\n\naccording to a european automobile manufacturers' association report earlier this year, today, the us is the fourth biggest exporter of cars to the european union: 19% of the total value of us car exports heads for the eu, representing 12% of eu car imports by value. the eu's eurostat statistical office says that car imports from the us grew from 4 billion euros in 2002 to a peak of 7 billion euros in 2016, then fell to 6 billion euros in 2018.\n\nhenry ford and the assembly line\n\nthis is the state where henry ford invented the assembly line. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: it is a popular belief that ford invented the assembly line, but it is not correct. while ford was the : it is a popular belief that ford invented the assembly line, but it is not correct. while ford was the first to use a moving assembly line for the production of an automobile, ransom eli olds was the first to use an auto assembly line of any kind; he used one to build his oldsmobile curved dash cars at the beginning of the 1900s. (olds' production also happened in michigan.)\n\nolds' pioneering version of the assembly line was not a moving conveyor, as henry ford would install a decade later, but a parade of partially-completed cars swiveling from one work station to another on dollies, the national museum of american history explains\n\ninaccurate quotes from television\n\na ben domenech quote\n\n'this is political malpractice. this is a horrible judgement call on the part of the speaker. you put your members in trump friendly districts in a very difficult spot. it's only going to extend it out further. this looks like the joke that it actually is.' ben domenech. -- december 19 tweet\n\nfacts first: trump omitted a significant part of this quote -- in which domenech said on fox news that he was referring specifically to democrats in trump-friendly districts who voted for the impeachment. trump's omission erased the fact that members in trump-friendly districts voted against him.\n\nwe give trump significant latitude to make errors when quoting people on television, but we call it a false claim when he alters the meaning of the quote with major changes or omissions.\n\nan andy mccarthy quote\n\n'in the end here, nothing happened. we don't approach anything like the egregious conduct that should be necessary before a president should be removed from office. i believe that a president can't be removed from office if there is no reasonable possibility that the senate won't convict and remove the president - then the house should not be impeaching the president in the first place. if this is the new standard, every president from here on out is impeachable.' andy mccarthy @foxnews so well stated. thank you! -- december 18 tweet\n\nfacts first: trump omitted a significant part of this : trump omitted a significant part of this quote on fox news, too.\n\nin between the second-to-last sentence in trump's rendition of the quote (the house should not be impeaching the president in the first place) and the last sentence in trump's rendition (if this is the new standard, every president from here on out is impeachable), mccarthy said: to go back to brett baier's point earlier about the historic nature of today, yes, president trump will in the history books from after today, from here on out, be remembered as one of the few presidents in history who are impeached. but i think history also has to be looked at in terms of what does this mean for the history of the united states. i don't think the president for long is going to be one of the handful of presidents who is impeached, because...\n\nin other words, trump omitted the fact that a friendly pundit said he would go down in history for being impeached.\n\na ken starr quote\n\n'the evidence has to be overwhelming, and it is not. it's not even close.' ken starr, former independent counsel. -- december 18 tweet\n\nfacts first: trump exaggerated starr's comments. while starr said on fox news that it is just not the case that the evidence against trump is overwhelming, starr did not say it's not even close.\n\nhere's what starr actually said : the evidence, whether it's circumstantial or direct -- and i think it's virtually entirely circumstantial -- has to be overwhelming; not just beyond a reasonable doubt, overwhelming to the american people who aren't sitting in a courtroom and listening to every witness testify and drawing inferences and so forth. when you read the abuse of power article in the nixon impeachment, a fair-minded person looks at that, reads it, hears it and says he had got to go. that's just not the case here.\n\na doug collins quote\n\n'they just wanted to get at the president. they had no intention of having a proper investigation. they couldn't find any crimes so they did a vague abuse of power and abuse of congress, which every administration from the beginning has done.' @repdougcollins @foxandfriends -- december 18 tweet\n\nfacts first: as the washington : as the washington post and new york times both noted , trump misquoted collins -- adding in significant words that collins did not utter.\n\ncollins didn't say that every administration from the beginning had committed abuse of power and abuse of congress. he said : so they said, 'at the end of the day, we can't form any crimes. we're going to do a vague abuse of power. and while we're at it, let's just throw in abuse of -- obstruction of congress, because we didn't get our way.'\n\nenvironment, energy and regulation\n\ndishwashers\n\ntrump compared modern dishwashers unfavorably to older dishwashers, saying he was proposing to change federal regulations. he said that, in the past, you press it, boom, and the dishwasher cycle would run and be finished in five minutes; now, you press it 12 times. women tell me. he added, by the way, by the time they press it 10 times, you spend more on water and electric. don't forget. the whole thing is worse because you're spending all that money on electric. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: trump's claims were comprehensively inaccurate. energy-efficient modern dishwashers do not require people to press buttons 10 times or 12 times to start them. more importantly, those modern dishwashers use less water and electricity than older dishwashers, not more.\n\nthe federal government's website for the energy star energy efficiency program notes that energy star-certified dishwashers cut people's electricity bills and save water: a new energy star certified dishwasher will save, on average, 3,870 gallons of water over its lifetime. consumer reports wrote in october: today's dishwashers use about half the water and energy that dishwashers used 20 years ago. thanks to tougher federal efficiency standards, water usage is down to about 4 to 6 gallons per load -- and less water means less energy required to heat the water.\n\nit is possible that trump was confused. some conservative and industry groups have made a push to get the government to roll back efficiency standards for dishwashers. they argue that modern dishwashers take too long to finish. trump might have thought that the longer run times mean more water and electricity use, but that is not true.\n\nthe disposal of fluorescent light bulbs in battle creek, michigan\n\nwhen a light bulb is out, you've got to bring it to a dump. so let's say over here in battle creek, where's your nearest dump? [trump appears to hear a response from a member of the crowd.] ok, that's what, a couple of hundred miles away. so every time you lose, drive a couple of hundred miles. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: it is not true that people in battle creek, michigan need to drive a couple of hundred miles to dispose of fluorescent light bulbs. a spokesperson for the city of battle creek, jessica vanderkolk, said there are two collection events per year in battle creek itself where people can turn in such bulbs, plus two more collection events per year in the county seat about 11 miles away.\n\nin addition, major store chains, such as home depot and lowe's, allow people to drop off fluorescent bulbs there for free recycling. (we confirmed with the home depot and lowe's stores in the battle creek area that people can do so at those locations.)\n\nan environmental fine to san francisco or los angeles\n\nalleging environmental violations related to san francisco's population of homeless people and people who inject drugs, trump said, and we fined san francisco -- and los angeles and san francisco. but we've just sent them a tremendous dollar fine for what they're doing. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: there is no evidence that either san francisco or los angeles has been fined. trump's environmental protection agency : there is no evidence that either san francisco or los angeles has been fined. trump's environmental protection agency sent san francisco a notice of violation in october, but that notice merely mentioned the potential for fines in the future. will reisman, spokesperson for the san francisco public utilities commission, the entity to which the epa notice was sent, told cnn, we have not received any fines from the epa. the office of los angeles mayor eric garcetti said los angeles had not been fined either.\n\nthe epa would not respond directly when asked if trump's claim was correct. a spokesman told cnn to ask the white house, saying in an email: ...epa has issued [a notice of violation] to san francisco for failing to protect water quality. for details on the presidents remarks, please reach out to the wh. epa does not discuss ongoing enforcement actions. the white house declined to comment.\n\npenalties for killing bald eagles\n\ncomplaining that windmills (his word for wind turbines) kill birds in california, trump said that, by contrast, if you shoot a bald eagle, they want to put you in jail for 10 years. -- december 21 speech to turning point usa student action summit\n\nfacts first: penalties for shooting a bald eagle are much shorter than 10 years. it wasn't clear whether trump was talking about federal law or california law, but he was wrong either way.\n\nthe relevant federal laws do not include penalties nearly that long for killing a bald eagle, the national audubon society, a nonprofit that works to protect birds, told the toronto star in may, when trump made a five years version of this claim; the penalties are up to two years under the migratory bird treaty act, if someone knowingly shoots a bald eagle with intent to sell or barter it, and up to two years under the bald and gold eagle protection act, the national audubon society noted. (as the federal government's fish and wildlife service notes on its website, the maximum two-year penalty under the bald and golden eagle protection act is for a second conviction; a first conviction has a maximum penalty of one year.)\n\npatrick foy, a captain in the law enforcement division for the california department of fish and wildlife, sent cnn the relevant section from the state's fish and game code , which sets out the maximum state penalty for killing a bald eagle at a fine of $5,000, imprisonment in a county jail for a year or less, or both.\n\nbird deaths\n\na windmill will kill many bald eagles. it's true. and you know what? after a certain number, they make you turn the windmill off. that's true, by the way.  -- december 21 speech to turning point usa student action summit\n\nfacts first: while wind turbine operators are exempted from penalties only for a certain number of eagle deaths the federal government agrees to authorize, they are not forced to shut down if they exceed that number.\n\nwind turbine operators, like other entities whose activities accidentally kill birds, can apply for a permit of up to 30 years to kill a specified number of eagles without facing punishment. but companies whose operations have killed an unauthorized number of eagles are not forced to close; they may be compelled by the federal government to pay fines, make changes to their operations or try to find ways to reduce their impact on birds.\n\nit's not necessarily true that somebody's going to walk in the door and shut it down, joel merriman, director of the bird-smart wind energy campaign at the american bird conservancy, told cnn.\n\nfor example, in 2016, the fish and wildlife service touted four civil settlements over the previous 18 months that resulted in commitments from wind companies to pay $55,000 in penalties and to spend a minimum of $1.86 million over three years on research and development of avian detection and deterrent technologies. duke energy agreed in a 2013 plea agreement with the justice department to pay $1 million in fines to conservation groups and to come up with a plan to avoid bird deaths in the future.\n\ntrump might perhaps have been thinking of the well-known saga of the company altamont winds, which announced in 2015 that it would shut down its turbines in california's altamont pass. the turbines had been the subject of numerous complaints from bird advocates, but the shutdown was the company's own decision.\n\nsen. mazie hirono and the green new deal\n\nhow about the senator from hawaii? nasty...she wants the green new deal, and then they informed her that that does not include airplanes. and you're the senator from hawaii. so they said, 'what are you going to do?' and then they talked about building a train to hawaii, can you believe it? no, no, she wants it, even though you can't -- you'll never get to hawaii again. say goodbye to hawaii. no, it's crazy, isn't it, though? -- december 21 speech to turning point usa student action summit\n\nfacts first: it is not true that hawaii sen. mazie hirono decided to support the green new deal and then was informed afterward that the deal does not include airplanes, nor that she later started talking about building a train to hawaii. trump was mischaracterizing an exchange hirono had with a reporter in february.\n\nhere is what actually happened. when told by a reporter that the green new deal would try to eliminate air travel and move to high-speed rail across the country, hirono said that would be pretty hard for hawaii, then laughed. she did not explain her laughter at that moment, but as she explained later, the green new deal resolution hirono had endorsed does not actually call for the elimination of air travel.\n\nrather, the resolution calls for overhauling transportation systems in the united states to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail. that is not a call to completely eliminate air travel.\n\nso where did the reporter get his premise? possibly from a controversial faq page posted by a leading green new deal proponent, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, which had urged the government to build out high-speed rail at a scale where air travel stops becoming necessary. but other democrats did not endorse the faq, just the official resolution, and ocasio-cortez's office quickly deleted it.\n\nwhen trump made a similar claim about hirono, the green new deal and air travel in february, hirono told hawaiinewsnow: as usual, climate change denier donald trump makes things up and doesn't know what he's talking about. while the green new deal is an ambitious plan to combat climate change, it does not call for the elimination of air travel. i will continue to fight against this president's lies.\n\ndemocrats and factories\n\nand what they want to do is they want to get rid of all petroleum product. that means you basically won't have any factories in the united states. -- december 21 speech to turning point usa student action summit\n\nfacts first: it is true that some : it is true that some prominent democratic candidates want the us to end the use of fossil fuels over time, but achieving an end to american petroleum use would not mean there would be no american factories.\n\njoshua busby, an associate professor of public affairs at the university of texas who studies energy and environmental policy, noted that manufacturers who simply require electricity to power their factories could get that electricity from renewable sources. solar and wind are cost competitive across much of the united states with natural gas, and the lowest cost option in a number of locations, busby said. and he noted that most us petroleum use is in transportation -- motor gasoline alone made up 46% of us petroleum use in 2018, according to the federal government -- not in industrial production; the use of vehicles that run without using petroleum could be greatly expanded. some heavy industries will be difficult sectors to fully decarbonize and move to 100% renewables, but nobody is proposing to do that overnight, busby said.\n\naccomplishments\n\njudicial appointments\n\n187 new federal judges have been confirmed under the trump administration, including two great new united states supreme court justices. we are shattering every record! -- december 24 tweet\n\nfacts first: trump has set at least one important record on judicial appointments -- he has appointed more appeals court judges than any other president at this point in a term -- but not every record. notably, the statistic he cited in this tweet, 187 total judges confirmed, is not a record, according to russell wheeler, a visiting fellow at the brookings institution who tracks judicial appointments.\n\npresident jimmy carter had appointed 197 people to federal courts by december 20 of his third year in office, wheeler said. if you go by the percentage of the judiciary appointed, both carter (29%) and president richard nixon (31%) had trump (21%) beat, according to data wheeler provided to cnn.\n\ntrump had appointed 50 people to the federal appeals courts as of december 20, according to wheeler's data and recent news reports . carter had appointed 48 by the same point of his own presidency.\n\nmerry christmas\n\nand did you notice that everybody is saying merry christmas again? did you notice? saying merry christmas. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nand let me begin by wishing you a beautiful -- look, do you remember this? do you remember they were trying to take 'christmas' out of christmas? do you remember? they didn't want to let you say 'merry christmas.' you would go around, you'd see department stores that have everything -- red, snow, beautiful ribbons, bows. everything was there, but they wouldn't say 'merry christmas.' they're all saying 'merry christmas' again. you remember? i went through that, during the campaign: 'they going to say merry christmas again.' and they are. -- december 21 speech to turning point usa student action summit\n\nfacts first: there is no evidence that people are now saying merry christmas any more frequently than they did under previous presidents, nor that all stores that declined to use the phrase before trump's presidency have changed their policies.\n\nit's hard to measure this stuff, but one metric is the socially conservative american family association's annual list of retailers that it considers naughty or nice when it comes to its willingness to use the word christmas in promotional materials. not one of the 17 naughty companies the afa listed in a press release in december 2015 , the year trump launched his presidential campaign, had been promoted to nice on the 2019 list, though two had moved from naughty to marginal.\n\nmilitary airplanes\n\nso we spent a lot of money on brand-new airplanes, as you know. we were -- three years ago, you didn't have brand-new airplanes. you were not doing well. and now you have all brand new. -- december 24 teleconference with members of the military\n\nfacts first: this was a major exaggeration. while trump's administration has : this was a major exaggeration. while trump's administration has invested in new military planes, it is not even close to true that the planes currently in use are all brand new.\n\nin december 2018, the congressional budget office reported that the average air force plane in 2017 was 28.3 years old: they range widely in age from the 75 new aircraft that entered service in 2017 to the 21 60-year-old kc-135 tankers that entered service in 1958. the largest share of the fleet is 26--30 years old. the average age for fighter and attack planes was 26.4 years, for bombers 42.0 years, for tankers 53.7 years.\n\nin addition, the military was buying new aircraft all throughout the obama administration, like the f-35, said todd harrison, director of the aerospace security project and director of defense budget analysis at the center for strategic and international studies, a think tank.\n\nroger stone's involvement in the trump campaign\n\nyou know, roger stone was not involved in my campaign in any way -- other than the very, very beginning, before i -- i think, i -- long before i announced -- a little bit. and: and again, roger stone was not a part of it -- the campaign. he was somebody i've known over the years, but not a part of the campaign. very, very, very early on -- long before i -- i think long before i even announced, he was involved in a minor way. -- december 24 exchange with reporters after teleconference with members of the military\n\nfacts first: stone was involved in trump's campaign after trump announced his candidacy, not merely before. trump announced his run in june 2015; stone either resigned or was fired -- there is a dispute about : stone was involved in trump's campaign after trump announced his candidacy, not merely before. trump announced his run in june 2015; stone either resigned or was fired -- there is a dispute about what happened -- in august 2015, more than a month and a half into the campaign.\n\nprosecutors at stone's trial this year -- which resulted in his conviction on charges of lying to congress, witness tampering and obstructing a congressional committee proceeding -- introduced as evidence phone records that suggested stone and trump also spoke in 2016, after stone's official role with the campaign ended.\n\nthe ninth circuit court of appeals\n\n...how about the ninth circuit? do you know that, as of next week -- do you know that we're going to be even on the ninth circuit? this was a disaster. we put a lot of judges on the ninth circuit. -- december 21 speech to turning point usa student action summit\n\nfacts first: while trump has made : while trump has made 10 appointments to the ninth circuit court of appeals, whose decisions he has previously complained about, it was not true at the time he spoke that the 29-member court was going to be even by next week between judges appointed by republicans and democrats (next week has now passed.) the margin at the time was 16 democratic appointees to 13 republican appointees, and there were no additional vacancies for trump to fill.\n\nalthough it is true that president trump has 'put a lot of judges on the ninth circuit,' there is no chance that it will be tied by 'next week.' in fact, it probably won't be tied by next year, said arthur hellman, a professor at the university of pittsburgh school of law and an expert on the ninth circuit. to get a tie (or better), two democratic appointees would have to retire. all nine of the active judges appointed by president clinton are eligible to retire, but i doubt that any of them will do so before the november election. unless democratic appointees retire or leave the bench (or congress adds new judgeships), there can't be a republican majority or even a tie.\n\nthe commission on presidential debates\n\n...3 years ago they were forced to publicly apologize for modulating my microphone in the first debate against crooked hillary. -- december 16 tweet\n\nfacts first: the commission on presidential debates : the commission on presidential debates did not publicly apologize for trump's microphone issue at the first debate between trump and hillary clinton three years ago. (it also did not acknowledge any deliberate manipulation of trump's microphone.) it issued a one-line statement that said : regarding the first debate, there were issues regarding donald trump's audio that affected the sound level in the debate hall.\n\nhere are the claims trump made over these two weeks that we have previously fact checked in one of these weekly roundups:\n\nforeign and military affairs\n\nthe us share of nato\n\ntrump said the united states used to pay for 100% of nato. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: according to the most recent official nato : according to the most recent official nato figures , released in november 2019, us military spending represented between about 71% and about 73% of nato members' total military spending in 2014, 2015 and 2016. that is a hefty percentage, but 100% is an exaggeration. (the us share of nato military expenditures has declined to about 69% per year under trump.)\n\nprevious presidents and nato\n\ntrump said previous presidents had not demanded military spending increases from nato members: president obama would go down to make a speech. 'i'd like to thank everybody for being here, thanks a lot, great job, sayonara, bye.' bush, they all did. nobody ever asked for money. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: it's not true that obama and bush never asked nato members to increase their military spending. obama and bush both did so, though their public language was less confrontational than trump's has been.\n\nobama repeatedly urged nato allies to spend more. if we've got a collective defense, it means that everybody's got to chip in, and i've had some concerns about a diminished level of defense spending among some of our partners in nato, obama said in 2014. the situation in ukraine reminds us that our freedom isn't free and we've got to be willing to pay for the assets, the personnel, the training that's required to make sure that we have a credible nato force and an effective deterrent force.\n\nat bush's final nato summit, in 2008, bush called on nato allies to increase their defense investments to support both nato and eu operations.\n\nthe coast guard and hurricane harvey\n\nyou know, the coast guard, with the work they've done during hurricane season, two years ago, in texas -- in particular, texas -- because they saved 16,000 lives. nobody understands what that means -- 16,000. even me -- i heard that number, and i said, 'can that be possible? sixteen thousand.' they served 16,000 lives -- and saved. -- december 24 teleconference with members of the military\n\nfacts first: the coast guard says the correct number is 11,022 people rescued. (this was not a one-time slip; trump has regularly : the coast guard says the correct number is 11,022 people rescued. (this was not a one-time slip; trump has regularly said 16,000.)\n\nmilitary pay increases\n\nbut this christmas, i hope that every member of our military will feel the overwhelming love and gratitude of our nation for your faithful service. starting january 1st, you'll be getting your largest pay raise in more than a decade. and: ...it will be largest in over a decade, and you very much earned it. -- december 24 teleconference with members of the military\n\nfacts first: trump was exaggerating slightly when he said the troops will get their largest increase in more than and over a decade. both the 2019 pay increase of 2.6% and the planned 2020 increase of 3.1% are the largest : trump was exaggerating slightly when he said the troops will get their largest increase in more than and over a decade. both the 2019 pay increase of 2.6% and the planned 2020 increase of 3.1% are the largest since 2010 , so nine years and 10 years ago respectively.\n\n(we know this is a minor stretch, but trump has relentlessly embellished accurate numbers by adding words like over and more than, so it's a pattern of little dishonesty rather than a one-time error.)\n\nnato spending increases\n\nover the last period of just two years. i raised -- not from us, nothing from us -- $130 billion, but that's nothing. and over a short period of time, they will be paying $530 billion more, all of those countries. and: they have to pay -- $530 billion and the fake news doesn't want to even talk about it. they don't want to talk about it.' -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: trump's math was wrong: the $130 billion current increase in military spending by non-us nato members (over 2016 levels) cannot be added to the $400 billion increase expected by 2024; the $400 billion figure includes the $130 billion.\n\nnato secretary general jens stoltenberg explained during a meeting with trump on december 3 that non-us nato members have added a total of $130 billion to their defense budgets since 2016. by 2024, stoltenberg said, this number will increase to $400 billion.\n\nthe history of nato spending\n\ntrump said of military spending by nato members before he took office: i'm telling you, if you look, it's like 15 years, just down. he drew a downward-sloping line in the air with his hand. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: military spending by nato members had increased for two years prior to trump's presidency. according to the latest nato : military spending by nato members had increased for two years prior to trump's presidency. according to the latest nato figures , released in november, spending increased by 1.7% in 2015 and 3.0% in 2016.\n\nveterans choice\n\ntrump said three times that he was the one who got the veterans choice program passed. he said once that people had been trying to do so for 44 years, twice that people had been trying for almost 50 years.\n\nfacts first: the choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators bernie sanders and the late john mccain, was signed into law by barack obama in 2014. in 2018, trump signed the va mission act, which expanded and changed the program.\n\nmilitary spending\n\ntrump said twice that the us military has spent $2.5 trillion during his presidency.\n\nfacts first: trump was exaggerating. defense spending for fiscal years 2017, 2018 and 2019 was $2.05 trillion, and that includes more than three-and-a-half months of obama's tenure, since the 2017 fiscal year began in october 2016.\n\ntodd harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the center for strategic and international studies, said he thinks trump must have been including military funding for the 2020 fiscal year to get to the $2.5 trillion figure -- but the 2020 fiscal year just started on october 1, and harrison noted that the defense appropriation has not yet been approved by congress.\n\neconomy and trade\n\nchinese tariffs\n\nas you know, we're now getting along very well with china and trade. in fact, they just took tariffs off more than 800 products, where they were charging us tariffs. and now those tariffs are gone. -- december 24 teleconference with members of the military\n\nfacts first: gone was an exaggeration. china : gone was an exaggeration. china announced the day prior that it will lower, not eliminate, tariffs on more than 850 us products starting on january 1.\n\nmanufacturing jobs\n\nwell, we've got 600,000 manufacturing jobs and you're going to see a big, big increase. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: trump was exaggerating. the economy : trump was exaggerating. the economy added 497,000 manufacturing jobs between january 2017, when trump took office, and november 2019, official data shows. the number is 524,000 jobs added if you go back to november 2016, the month of trump's election, as trump often likes to do.\n\nhillary clinton and the trade agreement with south korea\n\n...the people that made these trade deals, it's like, where did they come? like the one in korea, that was a hillary clinton special. she said this will produce 250,000 new jobs, and i said, well, what happened? he said, well, she was right except it was for south korea, not for us. so it produced 250,000 jobs for south korea. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: there is no record of hillary clinton projecting an increase of 250,000 jobs because of the united states-korea free trade agreement (korus). president barack obama said the deal would support at least 70,000 american jobs.\n\nobama said in 2009 that increasing the us share of trade with asia from 9% to 10% could mean 250,000, 300,000 jobs, but he was not specifically attributing that estimate to the potential effects of a trade deal with south korea. republican rep. kevin brady later used an estimate of about 250,000 new jobs from trade agreements with south korea, colombia and panama combined, not just the one with south korea.\n\npelosi and usmca\n\nthe great usmca trade deal (mexico & canada) has been sitting on nancy pelosi's desk for 8 months, she doesn't even know what it says, & today, after passing by a wide margin in the house, pelosi tried to take credit for it... -- december 19 tweet\n\nfacts first: the united states-mexico-canada agreement was not been sitting on pelosi's desk for 8 months before she agreed in december to have the democrat-controlled house to pass it. though the trump administration had pushed pelosi to persuade the house to quickly pass the agreement, it had not sent her any implementing legislation.\n\nin fact, the president's trade team chose to negotiate with her to address the concerns of democrats rather than immediately sending her a bill to which some of her party's caucus might have had significant objections.\n\nhousehold income gains\n\ntotal income gains for median households will reach $10,000 a family. i'll give you a couple of quick numbers. so under president bush, for eight years, you saved $450, meaning you took in $450. ok, fine. under president obama, you took in $975. under president trump, including the energy savings and the regulation savings and the tax cuts savings, it's more than $10,000 in less than three years. pretty good, right? so for two eight years, you had a $400, $450 and a $975. that's eight years, $450. in less than three years, you had more than $10,000. that goes right into your pockets. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: we can't fact check trump's prediction that household income gains under him will reach $10,000 a family, but his claim that the number has already hit $10,000 in less than three years is inaccurate. a firm called sentier research has : we can't fact check trump's prediction that household income gains under him will reach $10,000 a family, but his claim that the number has already hit $10,000 in less than three years is inaccurate. a firm called sentier research has found pre-tax income gains of more than $5,00 between january 2017 and october 2019, but any gains from cuts to regulations or in reductions in energy prices would be included in this amount, not added on top of it. also, it is entirely unclear what trump is referring to when he talks about energy savings; household energy costs have increased since trump took office, as have gasoline costs. (gasoline costs are lower than they were for most of obama's presidency, but higher than they were in 2016.)\n\nyou can read a longer fact check here\n\njapanese automakers and michigan\n\nbut michigan's had the best year it's ever had. best year it's ever had. and that's because we have auto companies expanding and thriving and they're coming in from japan and they're coming in from a lot of other places. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: japanese automakers have announced just two new us plants during trump's presidency, and neither is to be built in michigan.\n\ntoyota and mazda announced a joint venture in 2018 to build a plant in alabama. kristin dziczek, vice president for industry, labor and economics at the center for automotive research, said in november there had been only one other japanese announcement of a new auto plant under trump: hino motors' 2017 decision to move its west virginia truck assembly operations to a bigger west virginia location.\n\nprescription drug prices\n\nour drug price is down for the first time in 51 years, drug prices came down... -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: trump was exaggerating. the : trump was exaggerating. the consumer price index for prescription drugs showed a 0.6% decline between december 2017 and december 2018, which was the first calendar-year decline since 1972 -- the first decline in 46 years, not the first one in more than 50 years. (as the washington post pointed out in its own fact check, some experts say the consumer price index is a flawed measure of trends in drug prices, since it doesn't include rebates that drug companies pay to insurers. the iqvia institute for human data science, which studies drug prices, found that net drug prices in the united states increased at an estimated 1.5% in 2018.\n\nobama and manufacturing\n\nremember the statement by president obama, 'you'd have to wave a magic wand.' remember, the magic wand, because manufacturing. and i said, you know, that sounds strange. what do you do if you don't have manufacturing? how do you make things, right? 'manufacturing jobs won't happen.' -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: trump's magic wand comment was a reference to a remark president barack obama made at a : trump's magic wand comment was a reference to a remark president barack obama made at a pbs town hall in 2016 -- but he was inaccurately describing what obama said. obama scoffed at trump's promises to bring back what obama called jobs of the past without providing specifics on how he would do so. contrary to trump's claims, though, obama didn't say manufacturing was dead or that new manufacturing jobs could not be created; obama boasted of how many manufacturing jobs were being created during his presidency, saying, we actually make more stuff, have a bigger manufacturing base today than we've had in most of our history.\n\nnovember jobs estimates\n\ntrump boasted of the 266,000 jobs added in november, then said, and you know they said -- if you're a business watcher, which i am. i love watching business, but they said they were guessing: could be 70,000, could be 80,000, maybe 90, maybe 110, somebody said. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: while the number of jobs added by the us economy in november, 266,000, did exceed analysts' expectations, those expectations were much higher than trump claimed. the : while the number of jobs added by the us economy in november, 266,000, did exceed analysts' expectations, those expectations were much higher than trump claimed. the median estimate from economists surveyed by reuters was 180,000 jobs added -- and the lowest of the economists' estimates was 120,000 jobs added.\n\ntrump did not specify who he was talking about when he repeatedly referred to an unnamed they and somebody; it is certainly plausible that somebody somewhere thought that a mere 70,000, 80,000 or 90,000 jobs would be added. (his last number, 110,000, wasn't too far off from reality.) but trump created the impression that he was talking about the expectations of economic experts.\n\nunemployment for women\n\ntrump said twice that the unemployment rate for women was the best or lowest in 71 years.\n\nfacts first: it had been 66 years, not 71 years, since the women's unemployment rate has been as low as it was in november, : it had been 66 years, not 71 years, since the women's unemployment rate has been as low as it was in november, 3.5% . (that's if you ignore the 3.4% in september and april.)\n\nenergy production\n\ntrump said three times that he had ended the war on american energy, and the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas. on a third occasion, he touted becoming the world's top energy producer as one of his accomplishments in office.\n\nfacts first: the us has not just now become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot : the us has not just now become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012 , according to the us government's energy information administration -- under the very obama administration trump is accusing of perpetrating a war on the industry.\n\nthe us became the top producer of crude oil in particular during trump's tenure. the united states has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when us natural gas production surpassed that of russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded saudi arabia's, the energy information administration says\n\nrevenue from tariffs on china\n\nand you know, china's paying us billions and billions of dollars a year. they never gave us 10 cents. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: americans make the actual tariff payments, and a bevy of economic studies, including a : americans make the actual tariff payments, and a bevy of economic studies, including a report in late november from the federal reserve bank of new york, have found that americans are bearing the overwhelming majority of the tariff costs, aside from the question of who is paying, it's not true that the treasury has never received 10 cents from tariffs on china. the us has had tariffs on china

impression that biden had recently told npr that his effort to oust ukrainian prosecutor general viktor shokin, or the 2018 video of him telling the story of his effort to oust shokin, looked bad. in fact, biden's looked bad comment was about something different: hunter biden's position on the board. specifically, biden said the appearance of hunter biden's presence on the board looked bad and it gave folks like rudy giuliani an excuse to come up with a trumpian kind of defense.\n\nwhat zelensky said\n\npresident zelensky has repeatedly declared that i did nothing wrong, and that there was no

continued: i don't want us to look like beggars. but you have to understand. we're at war. if you're our strategic partner, then you can't go blocking anything for us. i think that's just about

trump's dealings with ukraine) or the second whistleblower (whose lawyers said they had firsthand information corroborating claims made by the first whistleblower) are now somehow gone, let alone that they are gone because the first whistleblower was shown to be inaccurate.\n\nthe whistleblowers have not vanished, bradley moss, a colleague of mark zaid, a lawyer for the two whistleblowers, said on

(the law aims to make it easier for terminally ill patients to access medications that have not been granted final approval.) similar laws have been passed at the state level only since 2014, after the goldwater institute, a libertarian think tank, began pushing for them.\n\ni have no idea what 'they've been trying to get' for 44 years, alison bateman-house, assistant professor of medical ethics at new york university's langone health, said in response to a previous version of trump's claim. the right to try law was a creation of the goldwater institute, and it first became state law in 2014 (in colorado), relatively soon after it was first conceived of.\n\nmichigan's man of the year\n\ntrump said twice that he was named man of the year in michigan about 10 years ago.\n\nfacts first: cnn and other news outlets have found no evidence trump was ever named michigan's man of the year. you can read our full fact check on this claim here\n\ntrump's crowds\n\non separate occasions, trump said that i've never had an empty seat and that i don't think we've ever had an empty seat from the time i came down the escalator.\n\nfacts first: there have been empty seats at various trump rallies, including an october rally minneapolis, a july rally in greenville, north carolina, an october 2018 rally in houston and an april 2017 rally in harrisburg, pennsylvania, according to journalists on the scene.\n\nthe media\n\nnewspapers' election polls\n\nthe problem is the newspaper polls are more fake than the news they write. they write fake polls. it's true. they write fake polls. you call them suppression polls. you read them and you get depressed because it looks like you're doing badly. they do that. i think it's almost worse than what they write, and you can't get much worse than what they write. -- december 18 campaign rally in battle creek, michigan\n\nfacts first: there is simply no evidence that newspaper pollsters have manipulated their numbers to suppress the enthusiasm of trump voters, as trump has repeatedly alleged.\n\na cnn camera\n\ntrump praised fox news host laura ingraham, then said, you know, now the cnn -- the cnn cameras -- all the cameras just turned off. that's okay. they don't want to promote laura. -- december 21 speech to turning point usa student action summit\n\nfacts first: cnn did not turn off its camera as trump promoted ingraham; it was serving as the pool camera feeding the speech to various networks. and cnn did not stop broadcasting trump's speech; cnn was not even airing the speech live on television. (also, cnn's photojournalists at trump events have the tally lights on their cameras set permanently to off, so trump would have no way of seeing from the stage even if they did ever turn a camera off.) trump has repeatedly made : cnn did not turn off its camera as trump promoted ingraham; it was serving as the pool camera feeding the speech to various networks. and cnn did not stop broadcasting trump's speech; cnn was not even airing the speech live on television.

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\ndemocratic presidential candidate sen. amy klobuchar said not doing more to address prescription drug prices in the affordable care act was a missed opportunity by former president barack obama.\n\nklobuchar, in an interview with cnn's poppy harlow that aired friday morning, laid out policy positions on regulating large tech companies, addressing prescription drug prices and tackling the opioid epidemic. in all of her answers, however, klobuchar said either the former democratic president or some of her colleagues in congress did not grasp the issues early on.\n\nklobuchar, one of more than a dozen democrats running for president in 2020, has made prescription drug prices a paramount issue in both her senate work and in her campaign. and her comments about obama follow an earlier statement in which the minnesota democrat said high drug prices have been neglected under any administration in the last two decades.\n\ni see it as a missed opportunity, but now we must move forward, she said. and that's why i think both parties have been guilty of not bringing these up, but there's one party in charge right now and that's the republican party.\n\nklobuchar voted for the affordable care act, obama's sweeping healthcare law that passed the senate in 2009, but – like others in the democratic caucus – now believes that changes could be made to update the law.\n\nprescription drug prices were not nearly the spotlight issue that they are now, but even democrats at the time that the law was passed acknowledged more could have been done in the law to address health care issues.\n\ni would have liked to see this be part of the affordable care act. but it wasn't, in part, because they were working with the pharmaceutical companies on the premiums issue. they were working with them on getting support for the affordable care act because they knew that pharma could stop that bill in its tracks, she said.\n\nobama has met with a series of 2020 candidates, including klobuchar, and made defending his health care law a central theme of his post-presidency political work.\n\nklobuchar announced her 2020 run with a february speech in minneapolis and has since focused considerable attention on making key policy areas she has pushed in the senate – namely high prescription drug prices, fighting the opioid epidemic and regulation large technology companies – part of her 2020 message.\n\ni think there are members of congress that had their eyes closed because they don't want to deal with this, klobuchar told cnn about regulating technology companies.\n\nahead of launching her 2020 bid, klobuchar introduced a bill in february to modernize anti-trust enforcement rules, saying that these rules affect more than just price and output – it's part of our everyday lives, from the price of groceries at the market to the cost of prescription drugs.\n\nsen. elizabeth warren went further earlier this month when she suggested breaking up companies like amazon, google and facebook.\n\ntoday's big tech companies have too much power – too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy, the massachusetts democrat said. that's why my administration will make big, structural changes to the tech sector to promote more competition.\n\nklobuchar said she agreed with warren.\n\nsome of this is worth looking at, in terms of she's getting at the fact that there are conflicts, when they own companies that are being actually featured on their own platforms, the minnesota democrat said.\n\nbut she also attempted to take a more measured approach, telling cnn that she would only support breaking up companies if it is warranted.\n\nhow i would approach it is a little different, klobuchar said.\n\nif, in fact, the law shows that they should be broken up and it may well do that, she added. one, you try to change the laws so they're better suited for what we're dealing with, for things like a company being the only source for all of the companies underneath it.\n\non opioids, klobuchar said that when she worked with democrat sen. sheldon whitehouse of rhode island and republicans sens. rob portman of ohio and kelly ayotte of new hampshire to put this bill forward for a blueprint on tackling the opioid crisis other senators (were) kind of patting us on the head saying, 'oh yeah.'\n\nthe opioid crisis is one area that klobuchar, who proudly touts her work with other republicans, has found success with president donald trump. to date, the republican president has signed three bills dealing with opioids that klobuchar has worked on.\n\ni think they understand now, klobuchar said when asked if congress understands the crisis.\n\nklobuchar named republican sen. chuck grassley of iowa as one of the senators with whom she can work on this issue.\n\nchuck grassley's a bit of a maverick, klobuchar said with a laugh, giving him a nickname that harkened back to the late sen. john mccain. he's now chair of the finance committee, so he should be in a place to bring these bills up.

from it the future of one of the president's most significant campaign promises remains unclear\n\n(cnn) —\n\npresident donald trump on friday called for repealing the affordable care act immediately and replacing it later with another health care plan if republican senators are unable to pass their bill.\n\nif republican senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately repeal, and then replace at a later date, tweeted trump.\n\ntrump's declaration – which marks a political shift for him and could further imperil delicate negotiations on capitol hill – came shortly after sen. ben sasse, r-nebraska, urged the president in a letter to repeal obamacare now and replace later. the current republican plan in congress is to do both in one massive piece of legislation, though the senate's bill has struggled to gain necessary gop support.\n\non july 10, if we don't have agreement on a combined repeal and replace plan, we should immediately vote again on h.r. 3762, the december 2015 obamacare repeal legislation that the congress passed but president obama vetoed, sasse wrote in the letter. we should include a year-long implementation delay to give comfort to americans currently on obamacare that a replacement plan will be enacted before expiration.\n\na senate aide told cnn that sasse's team and the white house had been privately discussing getting the president to publicly support a straight repeal bill. once the two sides became confident that trump was interested, they drafted sasse's letter and arranged for him to appear on fox news friday morning to call for such a plan.\n\nsasse quickly approved of trump's tweet.\n\nsounds great, pres. @realdonaldtrump we are agreed. we need to break the logjam, he tweeted.\n\ntrump's message friday morning also marked a notable return to his efforts to push his agenda rather than distract from it, as he did on thursday when he viciously and personally attacked msnbc anchor mika brzezinski.\n\ntrump was criticized heavily on both sides of the aisle for the outburst, with sasse saying the tweets were beneath the dignity of his office.\n\na 'hand grenade' in negotiations?\n\nwhite house deputy press secretary sarah huckabee sanders said trump hasn't changed his thinking at all on health care as she fielded a question on trump's tweet this morning on the health care reform efforts.\n\nwe're still fully committed to pushing though with the senate at this point, but we're looking at every possible option of repealing and replacing obamacare. we are focused on doing that, sanders said.\n\nsanders also said she did not know where trump got the idea for that plan, noting that people have been talking about this for quite some time.\n\ni don't know where specifically it may have come from, she said.\n\nbut trump's tweet appears to mark a new public stance for him regarding health care.\n\ndays after being elected, he told cbs's lesley stahl on 60 minutes: it'll be repeal and replace. it will be essentially, simultaneously. it will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week, but probably, the same day, could be the same hour.\n\ntrump reiterated that position at a news conference as president-elect back in january.\n\nwe're going to do it simultaneously, he said. it'll be just fine. we're not going to have, like, a two-day period, and we're not going to have a two-year period where there's nothing. it will be repealed and replaced.\n\nthe president's tweet also could have the effect of further complicating health care negotiations. a gop official close to leadership and supportive of the current repeal/replace effort told cnn: nothing like rolling a hand grenade into ongoing negotiations, eh?\n\nthe concern, the official outlined, is that this now gives conservatives a reason to go back to their corner. while they were hardly at the breakthrough point, there's no question conservatives, particularly sen. ted cruz, had been working in good faith to get to a deal.\n\nnow the concern is conservatives can just say they wanted the 2015 repeal bill all along, and because the president clearly supports that plan, talks on a sweeping replacement plan can be scrapped.\n\na gop senate aide noted trump's initial opposition to a straight repeal bill.\n\nwe did this dance six months ago, the aide said. we've litigated repeal, delay, replace. thoroughly. the president spoke against it. this all might be more helpful if we weren't in the late stages of negotiations.\n\nappearing on cnn's new day on friday, rep. adam kinzinger, r-illinois, also rejected the president's suggestion.\n\ni think it's repeal and replace, he told cnn's chris cuomo. we can argue whether they like the system we're bringing them in or not, but simply a repeal, even with the sunset the year or two down the road – the problem (is) we know how washington works.\n\nhe explained: sometimes on deadlines we still don't get things done. you can't leave the american people out like this. this is how sequester happened, because we thought we could fix the problem and never did.\n\n'big surprise'\n\nearlier this year, hill republican leaders floated the idea of repealing obamacare and providing a transition period during which congress would write a new law. but many republicans opposed that idea, and along with trump calling for passing both simultaneously, the party shifted tactics.\n\none reason behind that shift is repealing obamacare without an immediate replacement plan would likely cause massive destabilization to an insurance market already unnerved by washington's efforts to address health care. many insurers are asking for another round of steep rate increases for 2018, and others aren't even willing to return to the exchanges at all.\n\nbut some companies say the market is stabilizing, so they plan to stay in the game and charge only a little bit more next year.\n\nthe affordable care act was troubled even before trump took office, but the republicans' quest to dismantle it has made things worse. trump has caused confusion about whether he'll continue key components of the law. the two at the top of the list: the mandate that everyone have insurance and the cost-sharing subsidies for lower-income americans.\n\npolling shows repealing obamacare outright was the least popular option as house republicans began negotiating on health care. according to a march cnn/orc survey, just 17% of americans favored repealing parts of the bill as opportunities arose, regardless of whether a replacement was ready, including only 26% of republicans.\n\nmeanwhile, the future of the gop health care efforts remains unclear. senate republican leaders scuttled plans for a vote on health care reform earlier this week as gop leaders criticized the bill, but trump was optimistic in his outlook wednesday.\n\nwe're going to have a big surprise, trump said during a brief photo opportunity with reporters as he welcomed the world series-winning chicago cubs at the white house. we're going to have a great, great surprise.\n\ntrump declined to say what the surprise would be, but his optimism contrasted significantly with the nine republican senators publicly expressing their opposition to the bill the president is championing.\n\nthe white house can only afford to lose two of the 52 republicans in the senate to pass the legislation.\n\ncnn's tami luhby, phil mattingly, lauren fox, manu raju and dylan stafford

(photo by mark wilson/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\npresident donald trump and house speaker paul ryan are pushing legislation that would repeal key aspects of the affordable care act.\n\nchanging the heath insurance marketplace under obamacare is complicated business, and there is no universal agreement on how any legislation would affect coverage.\n\nbut the congressional budget office, the nonpartisan scorekeeper on capitol hill, released its best guess in its official score of the legislation, and some of the numbers are quite large. below are some key figures from the report. you can read the entire document here.\n\nwhat would happen to the rate of uninsured?\n\n14 million more people would be uninsured in 2018.\n\n21 million more people would be uninsured by 2020.\n\n24 million more people would be uninsured by 2026.\n\nit's important to note these numbers represent the non-elderly population, since most americans get medicare after they turn 65. the rate of uninsured would rise drastically, both because the law would do away with the requirement that people either obtain insurance or pay a fine and, in the later years, because of changes to medicaid rules and spending is capped, according to cbo.\n\nwhat's the difference between the gop plan and obamacare?\n\n52 million people would be uninsured under the republican plan in 2026.\n\n28 million people would be uninsured under obamacare in 2026.\n\nwhy would the uninsured rate grow?\n\n– without penalties that people pay under obamacare, fewer would buy insurance.\n\n– later, the uninsured rate would rise as federal funding shrinks and states change medicaid rules.\n\nwould the cost of premiums rise or fall under the gop plan?\n\naverage premium costs in the non-group individual market – the obamacare exchanges – would go up 15% to 20% in 2018 and 2019.\n\naverage premium costs for single policyholders would then go down 10% by 2026 compared to obamacare.\n\nbut while average premiums would go down in those later years, the relief would not be universal. premiums would go up for older americans and down for younger americans.\n\nwhat would happen to premiums by age?\n\naverage prices in the individual market would be:\n\n20 percent to 25 percent lower for a 21-year-old.\n\n8 percent to 10 percent lower for a 40-year-old.\n\n20 percent to 25 percent higher for a 64-year-old.\n\nwhat would happen to the federal budget deficit?\n\nit would go down $337 billion by 2026. why? the government would spend $1.2 trillion less under the republican plan than under obamacare, but it would take in $900 billion less in taxes.
house gop lawmakers are preparing to fulfill their promise to repeal obamacare ... or major portions of it, anyway.\n\nthe house will vote on the legislation, called the american health care act, on thursday. republican leadership has already made several changes to placate both conservatives and moderates, but a number of members in both chambers remain concerned. so a lot may change before it reaches president trump's desk.\n\ncritics have ranged from conservative republicans to insurers to the aarp. conservatives complain that the bill does not fully repeal obamacare and that many provisions are too similar to the health reform law. insurers worry that republicans would cut federal support for medicaid and tax credits, leaving many of their customers without coverage. and the aarp fears that americans in their 50s and early 60s would see their premiums skyrocket and federal assistance reduced, though lawmakers are now promising to provide this group extra assistance.\n\nproponents of the bill say it would save the individual health market from collapse. the legislation would create a patient-centered health care system that provides americans more choice, greater control and lower costs, they argue.\n\nbut opponents say it could reverse the gains in coverage seen since the affordable care act was signed into law in 2010. the congressional budget office found that 24 million fewer people would be insured by 2026 under the gop bill.\n\nrelated: trump warns gop on health care: 'we won't have these crowds if we don't get this done'\n\nwhat the bill calls for\n\nrepeal the obamacare subsidies. the gop's plan would eliminate the obamacare subsidies, which are advanceable refundable tax credits based on a person's income and cost of coverage in their area. more than eight in 10 enrollees on the obamacare exchanges receive this assistance, but individuals making more than $47,500 and families of four earning more than $97,200 do not qualify. this provision would take effect in 2020.\n\nprovide refundable tax credits based on age and income instead. the republicans want to issue advanceable refundable tax credits to help people afford coverage on the individual market, but these credits will be based mainly on a person's age. the credits will range from $2,000 for 20-somethings to $4,000 for those in their early 60s. the credits will also have an income cap. those making more than $75,000 would see their tax credits start to phase out, and an enrollee making more than $215,000 would no longer be eligible. families with incomes above $150,000 would see their credits dwindle, while those earning more than $290,000 would no longer qualify. this provision would take effect in 2020.\n\nrelated: 5 ways the gop bill could change your health insurance\n\npush provision for bigger tax credits for older americans to senate. the house is setting aside roughly $85 billion in funding to provide additional tax credits to help older people buy policies on the individual market. but representatives are letting the senate handle the crafting of the legislation. many older consumers would face huge premium hikes under the gop bill because its tax credits are not as generous as obamacare's subsidies for lower-income enrollees in their 50s and early 60s.\n\nrepeal the individual and employer mandates. the gop's bill would get rid of the obamacare requirement that people must have health coverage or face a tax penalty. it would also eliminate the requirement that employers with at least 50 employees provide health insurance to their workers. under obamacare, these companies were required to provide affordable insurance to staffers who work more than 30 hours a week. they would face a penalty if they did not meet this criteria and their employee sought subsidies on the exchanges. these provisions take effect retroactively to 2016.\n\nrelated: cbo report: 24 million fewer insured by 2026 under gop health care bill\n\nput in place a continuous coverage requirement instead. the republican plan seeks to allow insurers to impose a 30% surcharge on the premiums of those who let their coverage lapse for at least 63 days. the plan would enable insurers to levy this surcharge for one year, but it would only apply to policies bought in the individual or small group markets.\n\nrepeal cost-sharing subsidies to lower deductibles and co-pays. the bill would kill the additional help that individuals earning less than roughly $30,000 a year receive to cover their out-of-pocket costs. more than half of the enrollees on the obamacare exchanges receive these subsidies. this provision would take effect in 2020.\n\nrelated: insurers worry low-income americans won't have coverage\n\ndelay the cadillac tax. the republican plan keeps but delays the controversial cadillac tax, which calls for imposing a 40% excise tax on generous employer health insurance plans. originally scheduled to go into effect in 2018, the law would have taxed employers on any premiums that exceed $10,200 for individual policies and $27,500 for family plans. after intense lobbying by companies and unions, lawmakers pushed back the start date to 2020. the republican plan delays it until 2026.\n\nloosen the age-band so insurers can charge older folks more. under obamacare, insurers could only charge older enrollees three times more than younger policy holders. the gop bill would widen that band to five-to-one, which would hike premiums for those in their 50s and early 60s, but reduce them for younger folks.\n\nrelated: if you're older and lower income, prepare to pay more under gop health bill\n\nrevamp medicaid funding. the gop bill would send the states a fixed amount of money per medicaid enrollee, known as a per-capita cap.\n\nstates could also opt to receive federal medicaid funding as a block grant for the adults and children in their program. under a block grant, states would get a fixed amount of federal funding each year, regardless of how many participants are in the program.\n\nstates, however, cannot opt to receive block grant funding for elderly and disabled participants. their federal support for those groups would still be based on enrollment.\n\neither option would limit federal responsibility, shifting that burden to the states. however, since states don't have the money to make up the difference, they would likely either reduce eligibility, curtail benefits or cut provider payments. the block grant would be more restrictive since the funding level would not adjust for increases in enrollment, which often happens in bad economic times.\n\nend enhanced federal funding for medicaid expansion. it would also end the enhanced match rate for medicaid expansion for new enrollees starting in 2020. those already in the program could stay as long as they remain continuously insured. states that have not already expanded would not be allowed to do so, starting immediately.\n\nallow states to institute work requirement for medicaid. states would now have the option of requiring able-bodied medicaid recipients to work, participate in job training programs or do community service. pregnant women, children under the age of 19, single parents of children under age six and single parents of children with disabilities are exempt.\n\nrelated: upstate new york gets $2.3 billion gift in republican health care bill\n\ngive most new york counties relief from medicaid payments. lawmakers added a provision that would ban the federal government from reimbursing new york state for medicaid funds raised by counties outside of new york city. the upstate counties and long island send $2.3 billion to the state to help pay for medicaid. the amendment would give the state the incentive to stop passing down medicaid costs to the counties, though state officials say it would mean fewer people would be covered and benefits would have to be curtailed.\n\nrelated: governors divided over medicaid's future\n\nrestore federal support for hospitals who cover many uninsured patients. the legislation would restore medicaid disproportionate share hospital payments in 2018 for states that didn't expand medicaid and in 2020 for states that did. under obamacare, these funds were set to disappear by 2020 since the original law called for all states to expand medicaid.\n\ncreate more generous health savings accounts. seeking to get more people to save money for health care expenses, the republican bill includes several provisions aimed at making health savings accounts more attractive. it raises the annual contribution limits to equal the maximum sum of the deductible and out-of-pocket expenses one would pay in a high-deductible insurance plan. so the limit would be at least $6,550 for an individual and $13,100 for a family in 2018.\n\nthe bill would also end the obamacare prohibition on paying for over-the-counter medications with funds from tax-advantaged accounts, such as hsas and flexible spending accounts. and it reduces the penalty from 20% to 10% if funds from an hsa are used for non-medical purposes. these provisions begin in 2018.\n\nban excess tax credits from going into health savings accounts. enrollees whose tax credits exceed the cost of their premiums would not be able to put the additional funds in health savings accounts. some conservatives are concerned these funds could be used to pay for abortions.\n\nrelated: companies offering hsas could bank on big profits under gop plan\n\nlift contribution caps on flexible spending accounts. obamacare put a cap on annual contributions to flexible spending accounts based on cost of living figures. for 2017, that cap was $2,600. the gop bill would do away with that limit as of december 31, 2017.\n\noffer two tax cuts for the wealthy. the bill would eliminate two taxes that obamacare imposed on the well-to-do to help pay for the law: the 3.8% tax on investment income and the 0.9% medicare payroll tax on incomes over $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for married couples who file jointly. the provision would take effect in 2017.\n\nrelated: here's how much millionaires would save under gop obamacare repeal bill\n\nrepeal the taxes on health insurers, prescription drug makers and medical devices. the bill seeks to lift the annual tax obamacare imposed on drug makers and health insurers and it would also get rid of the 2.3% excise tax on the sale of certain medical devices that was put in place. the taxes would disappear in 2017.\n\nsay goodbye to the tanning tax. the bill would eliminate a 10% tax on indoor tanning services that was introduced as part of obamacare. it would take effect in 2017.\n\nrelated: republican health care plan would repeal 'tanning tax'\n\nrepeal the tax break for health insurance executives' pay. the legislation would roll back the obamacare provision that placed a $500,000 limit on deductions for each executive's compensation. top insurers pay their leaders millions in compensation every year so this provision could mean a nice tax savings for the companies. the provision would begin in 2017.\n\nrelated: health care plan has tax break for insurance execs\n\nreduce the income threshold for deducting medical expenses. under the gop bill, taxpayers would be able to deduct medical expenses that exceed 5.8% of their adjusted gross income. obamacare had raised the threshold to 10%. this would begin in 2017.\n\ndefund planned parenthood. in keeping with long-standing republican beliefs, the legislation prohibits federal funding for planned parenthood. but the restriction is only for a year.\n\neliminate support for cdc prevention and public health fund. the bill would eliminate nearly $1 billion in funding for this program, which republicans call a slush fund. the centers for disease control says the money supports heart disease and stroke prevention, immunization, lead poisoning prevention and diabetes prevention, mostly through grants to states and local programs.\n\nrelated: advocates call foul on cdc cuts in repeal bill\n\nincrease funding for community health centers. the bill would provide an additional $422 million this year for community-based outpatient facilities that provide health services -- such as medical, dental and mental health -- to lower-income populations.\n\ncreate the patient and state stability fund. this $100 billion fund would be available to the states between 2018 and 2026 for a number of reasons. among them: offering financial assistance to high-risk patients, reducing the cost of providing coverage in the individual market, promoting access to preventative services as well as dental, vision, mental health and substance abuse services, and helping people reduce their out-of-pocket costs.\n\nrelated: these low income kids could lose access to dental care\n\nallow insurers to sell plans that cover less of the costs. obamacare created four tiers of coverage, each with a requirement to cover a certain share of policyholders' costs, on average. the bill would eliminate this rule. presumably, insurers would be able to offer plans with higher deductibles and co-pays. however, since the legislation does not lift the cap on out-of-pocket expenses, insurers could not require consumers to pay more than that for covered services. the deductibles for many bronze-tier plans are already pegged to that cap.\n\nwhat the bill doesn't change\n\nprotections for those with pre-existing conditions. insurers are not allowed to discriminate against those with pre-existing conditions. they cannot deny them coverage, nor charge them more.\n\nallowing kids under age 26 to remain on their parents policies. the republicans want to keep this obamacare provision, which has helped insure young adults. by one estimate, seven million people get coverage as a result.\n\nrelated: popular coverage for children under 26 may be health law's achilles heel\n\nkeeping annual and lifetime limits. prior to obamacare, many insurers in the individual market had caps on how much they'd cover each year or over an enrollee's lifetime. some would not pay anything after an enrollee's care costs more than $500,000 or $1 million. obamacare banned those limits.\n\nretaining out-of-pocket maximums. under obamacare, consumers don't have to pay anything after they hit the out-of-pocket maximum for in-network coverage. for 2017, the max is $7,150 for an individual and $14,300 for a family.\n\nmaintaining comprehensive benefits packages ... for now. obamacare requires insurers to cover 10 essential health benefits, including maternity, prescription drugs and mental health services. the republicans want to jettison this rule, but can't do so under the budget reconciliation process.

form and may be updated.\n\n\n\n[08:00:00] alisyn camerota, cnn anchor: cnn's rafael romo is going to join us live now from fajardo on puerto rico's east coast. rafael, what are you seeing?\n\n\n\nrafael romo, cnn correspondent: alisyn, let me show you what this hotel had to do to prevent catastrophic damage. they had to tie ropes to their front doors because they were afraid at one point that the air currents were so strong were going to completely destroy the lobby, and in a way that has already happened.\n\n\n\nlet me show you what flying debris has done to the lobby. they broke the glass above me, and right now the lobby is taking great amounts of water. and the reason why i am here, alisyn, is because our team, ourselves, had to be evacuated because conditions were so dangerous and precarious at one point.\n\n\n\ntake a look outside. all of that debris came down in the last three hours or so. that's when we could experience the strongest winds here in fajardo. and just to give you a point of reference, fajardo is located in the northeastern tip of the island of puerto rico. you also have to take into account that according to puerto rico's governor ricardo rossello, this is the strongest hurricane this island has seen in almost nine decades, so that gives you an idea of how bad the situation has been.\n\n\n\nwhat i can tell you at this hour is that the entire city is without power right now. also, many of the streets are impassable because of flooding. so a very, very difficult situation, and as you can see by the strength of the winds outside, this is not yet over. it's still going on very much, alisyn.\n\n\n\ncamerota: absolutely, rafael. thank you very much for showing us all the mess that is happening there.\n\n\n\nchris cuomo, cnn anchor: cnn's leyla santiago live in san juan. she is now inside, the conditions just too tough. leyla, how are you. we saw you getting blown around there.\n\n\n\nleyla santiago, cnn correspondent: i will tell you, those were some really tough winds and they are continuing behind me. this is now my view of hurricane irma. this is what the staff has put up to prepare -- excuse me, hurricane maria. this is what the staff has put up. much of what rafael is seeing in fajardo we are seeing here. these ropes are vibrating. you can see them shaking, and they are up on the walls that already have metal sheeting that was put up yesterday.\n\n\n\nbut i want to take a walk so you can see exactly what we are seeing in this hotel. let me show you, police officers are standing by waiting to do their jobs that they really can't do right now because it's too dangerous. i am told they are already getting calls for rescue but they cannot go out right now because it is too dangerous.\n\n\n\nand let me show you what else we are seeing in the hotel, which, by the way, has dozens of tourists that have taken shelter here. you can see they have towels on the ground because they are preparing for water that could possibly come in.\n\n\n\nand then beyond these walls where you see security in place right now, dozens of tourists are right now in the staircase seeking shelter from hurricane maria as it comes in. they have asked everyone to come down from this area because of what you saw earlier, chris, where i was almost blown away by these category four storm winds.\n\n\n\ni mean, it is incredible. i was talking to one of the officers who told me it's hard to watch, a, because this is their home, this is their island, they are getting calls for help. their own families are out there right now at this hour, 11,000 people -- at last check, anyway, 11,000 people in shelters, and this is an island of 3.5 million people. so it's not a large number given how many people are here.\n\n\n\nwe are running on generators. the power is out right now. and as of 11:00 p.m. when we last checked in with the power company, 30 percent of the power company's system had already been impacted. that was before we started to see what we saw, waking up to that ominous hum. the winds that are circulating, the debris, i watched as a starbucks sign came down from the building as part of the metal sheeting that many put up to try to protect ripped right through and had flying debris in this area of san juan.\n\n\n\nand let me put this into context as well. this is not the only storm that is looming over this island. there is an economic crisis, $70 billion in debt. so the rebuilding that is already being talked about by the governor and the people of puerto rico is not going to be easy by any means.\n\n\n\ncuomo: all right, leyla, thank you very much. keep the team safe and let us know what develops there in san juan. it's good to have you.\n\n\n\n[08:05:00] cnn meteorologist chad myers joining us with the latest forecast. what are we in terms of the progression of this hurricane maria across this island?\n\n\n\nchad myers, ams meteorologist: the center of the storm now is 15 miles south-southwest of where leyla is. that means the winds are going to shift in san juan in the next 15 minutes. for most of the night the winds were like this. for most of the morning hours when we actually had leyla live outside the winds were like this. but now that the eye has gone by, the winds are going to shift direction and come in like this. all of the debris we saw in her live shot will now be blown the other way. and debris is a really significant indicator of how much damage there is to the island. devastating doesn't even truly begin to what really is going to show in the daylight when we can actually get out there.\n\n\n\nat 140 to 150 miles per hour, the storm came onshore very close to our nick paton walsh there on the really, if you want to look for a big city, that would be the biggest city on the southeastern side of puerto rico. and 100-mile-per-hour winds over the entire island. the entire place had at least 100-mile-per-hour winds. that's the big white circle you see there. those winds are going to affect the dominican republic as well later on today.\n\n\n\na lot of rain coming in and we already have these flash flood warnings going on. some spots could pick up 20 or 15 inches of rain. i know that's not 40 or 50 like we had in harvey, but this is a mountainous island so this is going to run off very quickly.\n\n\n\nand then what happens? now we see the storm running up the east coast. let me show you what the models said overnight. yesterday, those same models were here, and i liked that solution. now they are here, not liking it so much. still no contact with the u.s. landfall- wise, but i don't like that progression to the west.\n\n\n\ncamerota: chad, thank you for monitoring this. obviously we'll check back with you.\n\n\n\njoining us on the phone now is the governor of puerto rico ricardo rossello. governor, where do we find you at this hour?\n\n\n\nricardo rossello, governor, puerto rico: hi, alisyn. we are in the executive mansion. we have a center operations here to make sure that we have redundancy with the emergency management center. what we've been seeing, as we expected and as we anticipated for the people of puerto rico, this is the most devastating storm either in a century or quite frankly in modern history. so critical right now is for people to recognize that the brunt of the storm is still to come. there's a lot of flooding. there's a lot of infrastructure damage, but the only thing that should matter right now is that people stay safe, that we can lives, and they we will start the rebuilding process.\n\n\n\ncamerota: governor, when you say this is the worst that we have seen in anybody's memory, just two weeks ago you were hit by irma and obviously we've heard that there are still scores of people who were without power as a result of irma. so how does this compare to other hurricanes you have seen and irma?\n\n\n\nrossello: there's no comparison, really. luckily for irma we were very prepared. we executed our protocols appropriately, so much so that we were far ahead in the rebuilding process, that we were able to serve as a platform for other u.s. citizens that were stranded on the island. unfortunately, of course, now we're feeling a second storm in two weeks, this one much more devastating than the first one. and now who knows what the damage will be? we are at about 60 percent out of electricity in puerto rico, and we should expect by the passage of the storm to be 100 percent out. telecommunications are failing. but again, infrastructure can be fixed. lives can't. camerota: we are looking of video right now of fajardo, that\n\n\n\nobviously where el conquistador is, and you can just see the destruction as well as the winds. what is your biggest fear at this hour?\n\n\n\nrossello: my biggest concern is for the people, right. we have been sort of blessed for a couple of decades that hurricanes have skimmed through but have not hit right through us. so my biggest fear prior to the storm was complacency. we have many fronts of danger, not only flooding regions, which we have plenty here in puerto rico, coastal lines where the surge is coming, but also we have mudslide potential and we have very vulnerable housing. we are talking wooden housing and so forth.\n\n\n\nso we made an enormous effort, not only the government but the municipal governments and the people of puerto rico to get people out of harm's way, get them into shelters, we opened 500 shelters that are concrete and will withstand the winds. but this is a dangerous storm.\n\n\n\n[08:10:00] and my biggest concern is, yes, we will feel the brunt of it for the next 12 hours, but afterwards we are going to get a lot of rain. and people might have a sense that they have gone through the worst part of it, but as we know with hurricanes, it's the flooding, it's the heavy rains that tend to be the number one cause of death.\n\n\n\ncamerota: governor, i want to ask you about the shelters, because the numbers that we're getting just seem like only a fraction of the people in puerto rico took advantage of the safety of a shelter, something like 11,000 evacuated their homes and headed to a shelter. but you have 3.5 million people. why didn't more go?\n\n\n\nrossello: well, there's two reasons. number one, we don't have all of the data. this has been done with the municipalities. so 11,000 should be an indicator that a lot more people have gone to the shelters. as soon as we have more data, i'm going to keep communicating through twitter and then communicating with people so they know the up-to-date numbers.\n\n\n\nbut the second reason is a lot of people have friends and family members that do have concrete housing. puerto rico, a lot of the infrastructure is built on hard concrete. and although some of the people may leave the coastal lines on flooding areas and on vulnerable housing, there are a lot of people that have strong concrete houses.\n\n\n\nand many of the people when we went to the emergency evacuation procedure, instead of going to the government shelter would go to family housing. so we don't know how many, what's the extent, but our hope is really that a lot of these people are not tabulated at this moment or have gone to seek shelter at a friend or family member's place.\n\n\n\ncamerota: and governor, do you have numbers yet on numbers of people who are hurt or any casualties?\n\n\n\nrossello: no, we don't have numbers on casualties. again, it talks a little bit to the strength of the storm. we have to get our rescue workers out fairly quickly. you know, once winds go to 50 miles per hour we got them out. but we are very attentive. we know that this is very dangerous and of course it's going to bring with it very likely injury and, of course, possible death.\n\n\n\nso we want to make sure that we are aware, that we can inform and that we can keep informing people that the best solution for you right now, if you have family members, if you have friends in puerto rico is to let them know that they should stay in safe shelter. there is no reason to go outside right now. it's too dangerous. and after the winds come by there's going to be a lot of rain which presents a lot of danger as well.\n\n\n\ncamerota: governor we just got an alert from the national weather service that i want to share with you. the eye of the storm is now 15 miles southwest of san juan, so it looks as though you have several more hours of going through the conditionings you are seeing right now.\n\n\n\nrossello: we will be bunkered down here in san juan, and hopefully we will withstand the storm, rebuild. of course we asked for our federal citizens to send us their thoughts and prayers, and once it passes we will be informing all of you.\n\n\n\ncamerota: and everyone is keeping you in their prayers this morning. governor ricardo rossello, thank you so much for joining us.\n\n\n\nrossello: thank you, alisyn.\n\n\n\ncamerota: joining us now is the fema administrator brock long. he is joined by a sign language interpreter so we can get out information to as broad an audience as possible. administrator, thank you for joining us.\n\n\n\nbrock long, fema administrator: good morning.\n\n\n\ncuomo: so with puerto rico, the u.s. virgin islands, we are talking about u.s. protected territories there. what do you have in place to get in there once maria has passed?\n\n\n\nlong: so actually we are very well positioned. we have more assets on the islands now than we did before irma hit. basically we have over 3,200 staff members in the islands collectively. we have multiple days' worth of commodities, meals, water, hygeine kits ready to go and we're ready to support governor rossello and governor mapp. i've already spoken with governor mapp this morning. so last night st. croix took a big hit. unfortunately the wind field expanded last night as it passed just to the south of st. croix basically putting 137-mile-per-hour wind gusts through st. croix. so we will continue to be ready to support.\n\n\n\ncuomo: we had a member of congress representing the u.s. virgin islands say that they may not have power for weeks or even months. it seems to be a very, very difficult living condition. what can fema do to help support during that power outage?\n\n\n\nlong: unfortunately the u.s. virgin islands and puerto rico both have very fragile power systems. after irma we had 90 percent of the power back on in puerto rico. i think we will see the majority of it knocked off not only in puerto rico but power will remain off in the virgin islands for a very long time.\n\n\n\n[08:15:00] we do we are working very closely with department of energy, he private power sector industry and looking at mutual aide, we had power poles ready to go to come into the islands and restring the lines. but because of the nature of the geography of the islands it's a logistical challenge so it will be a frustrating event to get the power back on.\n\n\n\ncuomo: all right. so, we wait to see what happens there.\n\n\n\nanother important part of this interview should be reminding people of what already has been wrought and still needs to be dealt with coming out of harvey, and irma. what is an update there in terms of what people are still dealing with in texas and the parts that were hit by harvey and irma?\n\n\n\nlong: well, we're working very diligently with governor abbott in texas to put together an innovative housing approach. the old way of doing business with, you know, the way that fema provided housing is not going to work for this unique event because of the magnitude of it. so, we are working with him to finalize agreements to where recovery is, basically supported by the federal government, managed by the state and executed at the local level.\n\n\n\ni continue to work with governor scott, irma, as well as other governors in the southeast to make sure that we are meeting demands, and providing them the correct bridge to recovery. you know, the good news is that the response is winding (ph) down from both harvey and irma, so that we can put those assets towards maria.\n\n\n\ncuomo: this is your opportunity to ask for more resources. do you have what you need? we know that the fema budget is one of the footballs being tossed back and forth, and we asked politicians not to play politics, with storm aid or with the fema budget, or at least not now. what kind of level of confidence are you getting from lawmakers that you are going to get what you requests?\n\n\n\nlong: no, congress has been performing their due diligence to help us out in the situation and it's a dynamic situation. we keep getting hit, so the target for budget needs continues to move, and they are tracking that very closely and working with us.\n\n\n\ni speak to congress, you know, daily, various members of congress daily, you know, about budget needs and we are communicating what we need to them very clearly so they know what to do.\n\n\n\ncuomo: all right. mr. administrator, thank you for joining us. let us know what information we can get out that is important to people.\n\n\n\nlong: you got it. thank you.\n\n\n\ncuomo: all right. be well.\n\n\n\nalisyn?\n\n\n\ncamerota: and, chris, there's more breaking news. a powerful earthquake in mexico city, and more than 200 people have been killed. this was a 7.1 magnitude quake struck the country and at this hour, there's a frantic search for survivors.\n\n\n\ncnn's rosa flores is in mexico city. she's at the scene of search of this collapsed office building.\n\n\n\nwhat's happening, rosa?\n\n\n\nrosa flores, cnn correspondent: well, alisyn, i just talked to a first responder on the sidelines who tells me that at least four people have been rescued in this building that you see behind me this morning. and as day breaks, they are hoping to continue the search and hoping to find more people alive.\n\n\n\nbut there are dozens of people here waiting, waiting anxiously and grappling with the fact that they might not get good news after first responders go through this mountain of debris. now, this is one of dozens of buildings that collapsed here in mexico city. now, just to give you an idea of the magnitude of this, we are 75 miles from the epicenter of this earthquake and dozens of buildings collapsed. glass buckled. they crashed -- came crashing down.\n\n\n\nthere are buildings and people trapped in buildings all over, and hundreds, perhaps thousands of first responders, military, family, friends, going through the rubble trying to find loved ones. there are lists, like the one you see over my shoulder close to the buildings that have collapsed. those are the lists of the people who have been rescued.\n\n\n\nso, people come here, look at that list to see if their loved one has been rescued. if their loved one is not on that list, they wait. you probably see them behind me. there was a woman weeping loudly just moments ago that i talked to, and she says she has been trying to communicate with her daughter via text message, via whatsapp, and she says that she doesn't get an answer.\n\n\n\nthe last time she saw her daughter, she was in that building that you see behind me that is now collapsed.\n\n\n\nso, chris, a lot of very tense moments. people here in a lot of pain grappling with the fact that they might have lost loved ones -- chris.\n\n\n\ncuomo: the waiting, as we know, rosa, is the worst part in a situation like this. prayers go to the point that miracles happen when it comes to recovery. certainly, nothing is a guarantee. this is a horrible situation. but time may wind up being a friend as much as a foe for them, because they have to wait, but hopefully, more people may come out of that building alive.\n\n\n\n[08:20:00] rosa, let us know if there are any updates. thank you.\n\n\n\nall right. so, we have to cover what is going on with the health care, because they're coming down to the fire, the gop is trying to get something to repeal and replace obamacare. that would be delivering on a signature promise.\n\n\n\nthe president is tweeting saying that the bill is great. why does the american medical association, the aarp, and even republican governors say he's wrong? we're going to take you through two different lawmakers' perfective on this.\n\n\n\nand we want to remind you of the jimmy kimmel test.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\njimmy kimmel, late night host: this guy, bill cassidy, just lied right to my face. there's a new jimmy kimmel test for you, and it's called the lie detector test. you are welcome to stop by the studio and take it anytime. there you go.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncuomo: the senator is going to be on new day. what is his response? does he believe he failed the kimmel test?\n\n\n\nthere's the senator, one of the two sponsors of this bill and will be on new day right after the break.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\ncuomo: senate republicans are making a last ditch effort to repeal obamacare with the graham-cassidy bill. one of the men behind it is senator bill cassidy of louisiana. he's previously said he'd only support a bill that passed what he coined the jimmy kimmel test. jimmy kimmel himself does not think that's the case.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\n[08:25:01] kimmel: i don't know what happened to bill cassidy, but when he was on this publicity tour, he listed demands for a health care bill very clearly. these were his words. he said he wants coverage for all, no discrimination based on pre-existing conditions and no lifetime caps.\n\n\n\nguess what? the new bill does none of those things. and this guy, bill cassidy, just lied right to my face.\n\n\n\ndo you believe that every american regardless of income should be able to get regular checkups, maternity care, et cetera, all of those things that people who have health care get and need?\n\n\n\nsen. bill cassidy (r), louisiana: yep.\n\n\n\nkimmel: so, yep is washington for nope, i guess.\n\n\n\nstop using my name, ok? because i don't want my name on it. there's a new jimmy kimmel test for you, it's called the lie detector test. you are welcome to stop by the studio and take it anytime.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncuomo: harsh words, not apparently in jest.\n\n\n\nand joining us now is senator bill cassidy.\n\n\n\nwhat is your response, senator?\n\n\n\ncassidy: i'm sorry he doesn't understand. under graham-cassidy- heller-johnson, more people will have coverage and we protect those with pre-existing conditions. states like maine, virginia, florida, missouri, there will be billions more dollars to provide health insurance coverage for those in those states who have been passed by obamacare and we protect those with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\n\ncuomo: well, the counter-argument will be pre-existing conditions will be up to the pricing of the particular state and market. it's not what it is now where you can't allow insurance companies to cherry-pick and punish people for pre-existing conditions. so, the protection is not the same, senator, on that one point.\n\n\n\ncassidy: the protection is absolutely the same. there's a specific provision that says that if a state applies for a waiver, it must ensure that those with pre-existing conditions have affordable and adequate coverage. affordable and adequate coverage --\n\n\n\ncuomo: but the schedule of what people might pay, that is out there making the rounds, pending a cbo score, which you have to wait for under the rules for this type of reconciliation, the price won't be the same as it is now. it's going to be different for people.\n\n\n\ncassidy: i think the price will actually be lower. what is being circulated is by those who wish to preserve obamacare and they are doing everything they can to discredit the alternative.\n\n\n\nbut the reality is, if you are in maine, virginia, texas, tennessee, there will be money in your state to help lower your premiums and provide coverage. and by the way, we protect those with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\n\ncuomo: right. but protect means that they don't get priced out of their own care. that's the affordable part. that winds up being the rub.\n\n\n\nyes, you are giving money to the states directly as a block grant. yes, some governors will like that. but you have some republican governors, you've got the ama, the american medical association, you got the aarp, you got the cbo who are all saying, no, this bill does not keep as many people covered as is the case right now.\n\n\n\ncassidy: can i respond to that?\n\n\n\ncuomo: absolutely.\n\n\n\ncassidy: we actually will cover more.\n\n\n\nthe reason they based that is on a study of a different bill, but it depends upon the individual mandate. and those folks put great credit in the individual mandate which penalizes, coerces working families into purchasing insurance.\n\n\n\nas it turns out, the best data shows that the individual mandate does not work. what does work is giving power to governors.\n\n\n\nbut there's a fundamental difference. democrats think the washington, d.c. should have the power and people should be coerced. republicans think the state and the patients should have the power and that we should help those families, not penalized them.\n\n\n\nthere's a fundamental difference, but graham-cassidy will ensure more folks and we protect those with preexisting condition.\n\n\n\ncuomo: but then, why do you have governors of your own party coming up and saying that's not true? that even though you're going to give me the money and i like the control, you're going to cut the amount of money that i have, and in fact, those block grants are going to go away altogether at some point in the future, so there's going to be less money in the system which you like because you want to take money out and use it for tax reform, or whatever you want to do it. but if you take money out, you can't cover as many people.\n\n\n\ncassidy: a couple of things. we do take money out because we eliminate the mandated penalties.\n\n\n\ncuomo: and tax credits.\n\n\n\ncassidy: fifty-eight percent of those penalties are paid by families who make $50,000 or less. if you are in maine, florida, virginia, missouri, you get far more money than you do under the status quo.\n\n\n\nwe actually -- speaking of governors, we had i think 14 or 15 governors that signed a letter yesterday which they published say that they were in support of this. i think there was six who are not, there's i think 15 or 16 who are.\n\n\n\nand the study show that the best way to get people covered is not through a mandate, through penalties, but through getting a governor engaged. our bill gives the governor responsibility, which he or she may not want, but that's the best way to get people covered.\n\n\n\ncuomo: but, governor, giving -- governor -- senator, not yet, senator, giving people the ability to have coverage and it being affordable are very different things.

(photo by rick kern/wireimage)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nhillary clinton on thursday slammed republican gov. paul lepage's recent announcement that he won't expand medicaid in maine until the state finds a way to pay for it even though voters approved a ballot measure supporting the program's expansion.\n\nwho appointed these people king? clinton asked.\n\nspeaking at a health care symposium at geisinger medical center near danville, pennsylvania, clinton said compromise should be a key tenet for improving health care in the united states.\n\nthe government requires these people to compromise, clinton said. we all have to pull our wisdom and our efforts to come up with the best way forward. politics like this are toxic and unhealthy and hurting our effort to move forward and better rationalize the cost delivery systems.\n\nclinton said she feared that going forward, more people would be left out of the kind of care they need. were going to have children with serious health care problems not get the care they need early enough in order to have a more successful future, she said.\n\nbut, really, that all comes under the rubric of debates that are ill-informed, clinton said. i was shocked at the level of ignorance that was displayed by people advocating for the repeal and replacement of the affordable care act.\n\nclinton said people did not realize the importance of the affordable care act until it came under threat.\n\npeople hated the affordable care act until it was threatened, she said. and in virginia on tuesday, the no. 1 issue that people cited for coming out to vote was health care. so all of a sudden, because it was in the spotlight with the debate on how to get rid of it, people said, 'oh my god my cousin has that, or my daughter just aged out of our policy.'\n\nclinton said public officials failed to communicate the benefits of obamacare.\n\ni think we missed the boat on defending it and explaining it better than we did.
the poorest american families could lose federal benefits worth a third of their income, on average, if the house republican health care bill becomes law, according to a new report.\n\nat the same time, the richest households would receive a tax break of $5,640 a year, according to the study conducted by the urban institute and the urban-brookings tax policy center, which looks at the impact on families with different incomes in 2022.\n\nrelated: gop health care bill in limbo after white house meeting\n\nthe legislation, which is expected to be voted on friday, would hit those making less than $10,000 a year so hard because these folks receive hefty amounts of government assistance from obamacare. many benefit from the expansion of medicaid to low-income adults, while those who earn just a bit more receive generous subsidies that lower their premiums, deductibles and co-pays.\n\nthe gop bill, titled the american health care act, would eliminate the enhanced federal funding for medicaid expansion and cap federal support of the entire program. it would also replace obamacare's subsidies with less generous tax credits based mainly on age, rather than income. (individuals who earn more than $215,000 and couples making more than $290,000 don't qualify for tax credits, under the gop bill.)\n\non average, families who earn less than $50,000 a year would be worse off under the bill, researchers concluded.\n\nrelated: cbo report: 24 million fewer insured by 2026 under gop health care bill\n\na congressional budget office report found that 24 million fewer people would be insured in 2026, including 14 million who would have had medicaid, if the gop bill becomes law.\n\non the flip side, the house bill would jettison two taxes that fall on individuals making more than $200,000 and couples making more than $250,000, starting this year. so wealthier taxpayers would benefit most from the bill.
if republicans want to come along, great. democrats are arguing republicans can vote for budget reconciliation. if republicans don't like the plan, they can keep talking to the white house, but the underlying takeaway from the meeting on monday night -- and all the messages from the white house in the days before that -- is the president is only willing to negotiate so much. republicans' $618 billion proposal with no state and local funding is not going to cut it . period.\n\nbottom line: president joe biden has the house. biden has the senate. he has a procedural process that gives him the chance to pass a $1.9 trillion relief package with just democratic votes and conveniently, it's a process that republicans used just four years ago to jam through a tax plan and try to repeal obamacare.\n\ndemocrats are making a two-pronged calculation\n\nwe will see on the second point, but when you are talking about giving people direct checks , expanding unemployment insurance, giving people more money to buy food and raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour , you aren't talking about unpopular ideas. democratic aides tell cnn over and over again this isn't repealing obamacare. they are giving people something, not taking something away, and that's emboldened members to act swiftly and decisively and not give in to talk that they have to unify the country by bringing republicans onboard with a plan.\n\nthat doesn't mean that the impact this could have on the debt and deficit isn't real. that doesn't mean that republicans aren't going to argue that this plan isn't needed. it's true that there are still billions from the last package that haven't gone out the door. many republicans argue it's irresponsible to spend more when you don't even know what you need. those are arguments they can make to the public. but, democrats are feeling confident that they can win that public fight.\n\na bit on the mechanics\n\none democratic aide familiar with the senate's process told cnn that the plan is for the house and senate committees to work in coordination over the next week and a half to hammer out legislative text. throughout the drafting, democrats in the senate will be consulting with the senate parliamentarian to make sure their plans are actually allowed under the rules that govern reconciliation. the house will vote to pass the plan first. then, the senate will move.\n\nbefore the senate goes to the floor, they will engage in multiple meetings with senate republican staff and the senate parliamentarian on the merits of each provision they want included and whether the provisions meets the strict rules of what can be allowed through reconciliation. the fight over the minimum wage is expected to be a massive one here, but there will be others as well. this process happens in private over several meetings, but it's crucial to determining the scope of what democrats can do.\n\nthe goal is to be finished and have the bill signed into law by march 14, this senate aide tells cnn. that gives some time for lawmakers to pass this before unemployment benefits run out at the end of march.\n\nit's a massive undertaking, but democrats aren't working from scratch here. they are going to be taking biden's $1.9 trillion plan and making it a bill. a lot of the work has already been done on the front end to make sure every committee has the amount of money they need to make this plan a reality. the house and senate budgets gave 12 and 11 committees respectively reconciliation instructions. that is a lot. it's going to be messy. aides say they are very clear about what they have to do here, and they are confident this can be done swiftly.\n\nstill, there are going to be some intra-party schisms on how this bill ultimately looks. not all democrats are comfortable with raising the minimum wage to $15, for example. in new york, that amount might make sense. in montana and west virginia -- where the cost of living skews much lower -- that kind of minimum wage could be the difference between a business staying profitable and not. that's why you have some democrats arguing any minimum wage increase should be regional, while others are arguing that it should be phased in.\n\na reminder: the twists and turns of reconciliation are going to be countless. this process is complicated, cumbersome and will force democrats to walk through a tricky negotiation and stay together in a way they haven't had to do in recent years. add on top of it the fact that biden has pledged to the twists and turns of reconciliation are going to be countless. this process is complicated, cumbersome and will force democrats to walk through a tricky negotiation and stay together in a way they haven't had to do in recent years. add on top of it the fact that biden has pledged to keep talking to republicans throughout this process and the reality that senate majority leader chuck schumer can't lose a single member of his caucus and it's fair to say that democrats have to operate darn near flawlessly to pull this entire thing off by mid march. passing the budget resolution is the easy part. getting everyone to the other side of this process without a massive internal backlash? that's a lot harder.\n\non power sharing: why democrats are still not in control of committees\n\nthe organizing resolution hasn't been passed yet.\n\nbut, the talks have dragged on. they've been productive. they are close to an agreement, but they have dragged on among staff. the initial fight over the filibuster delayed important talks over other procedural and weedy negotiations. the hope and expectation was that the agreement would look very similar to the power sharing agreement of 2001, but that 2001 agreement only lasted a few months and there are some operational changes that had to be made. it's taking time, maybe even longer than it should, but aides say they are close. it could be finished as soon as tuesday.\n\nthe issue is now we are seeing some real effects of what that means for the way the senate is run. sen. lindsey graham, a south carolina republican who is technically still the chairman of the senate judiciary committee, announced monday night he would not allow a hearing to go forward on biden's attorney general nominee merrick garland on february 8 because he argued those confirmation hearings for attorney general are typically two days. the senate impeachment trial starts on february 9 . again, aides say party leaders are close. we will see if this gets buttoned up tuesday.\n\nkeep an eye on republicans\n\nthe republican civil war continues on tuesday morning.\n\nwe are watching to see if house minority leader kevin mccarthy finally meets with rep. marjorie taylor greene on tuesday evening and whether he kicks her off of her committees or waits for house democrats to make that move.\n\nhouse democrats have a rules committee meeting scheduled on a resolution to remove her from budget and education on wednesday. a reminder that just because they pass the resolution out of the rules panel doesn't mean it has to go to the floor. it's designed to be a fail safe to force mccarthy to act.\n\nhouse democrats will have a conference call at 9 a.m. et on wednesday where this issue could come up. there is some growing concern that forcing greene off committees through a floor vote could set a dangerous precedent for the future if republicans take back the house and then use the move to oust democrats they don't like from their committee assignments. usually, this is a call leadership makes. giving the full house a vote is extremely unusual.

(photo by atta kenare / afp) (photo credit should read atta kenare/afp/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nso much of the trump presidency to this moment has been about undoing president barack obama.\n\nannouncing the us would leave the iran nuclear deal, president donald trump was still more concerned with how badly he said it was negotiated than with what would come next.\n\nhe called it flawed, horrible, poorly negotiated and defective at its core and promised vaguely to work with allies toward something new.\n\nthere's a pattern here. whatever obama did was bad and trump will deliver something better.\n\nhe immediately as president pulled out of the trans-pacific partnership, the massive trade deal obama spent so much time working on. (the other countries in tpp have carried on without the us instead.)\n\nhe spent scads of his political capital trying, in vain, to dismantle obamacare. and when that didn't work, the president and republicans set about starving it instead.\n\nwithout regard to its effect on the health insurance market, he's hacked at the law where he could and made a point of declaring it dead.\n\nthere's no such thing as obamacare anymore, he said after republicans used their tax cuts package to zero out the penalty for not having health insurance.\n\n00:50 - source: cnn trump: no such thing as obamacare anymore\n\nhe said he'll pull the us out of the paris climate agreement, isolating the us on that issue on the world stage.\n\nhe's kept a scandal-ridden environmental protection agency administrator in place largely because of the perception that scott pruitt has been effective at starting the process of undoing obama-era environmental regulations.\n\nnow, 17 months into office, trump will argue he's finally on the cusp of actually delivering something he can point to as better.\n\nthat's probably why so much of his iran announcement dealt with north korea, another nuclear aspiring country.\n\ntrump inherited no international deal on north korea. and he has upended decades of foreign policy orthodoxy to bring north korea's dictator kim jong un to the negotiating table.\n\nhe offered those forthcoming talks up as proof he would deliver on his word.\n\nand it's his own word that trump views as most important. us commitments seem to begin with his presidency since previous presidents entered into bad deals. good deals will happen in the future. trust him.\n\n\n\nthe reality is the jcpoa was obama's deal, said middle east expert aaron david miller on cnn's new day wednesday. the north korean business is trump's ride into the history books. if he succeeds it will reframe his foreign policy presidency.\n\naaron david miller: the jcpoa was obama's deal. the north korean business is trump's ride into the history books. https://t.co/pturgbakdy — zach wolf (@zbyronwolf) may 9, 2018\n\nthe odd thing here is that north korea wants the world to believe it is nuclear capable, and iran does not.\n\nnorth korea's kim said recently the country no longer needs to test its weapons capabilities because they are complete.\n\nwhether that was a boast or not is unclear, but this week presents us with the us president nixing an international agreement to curb a nuclear program with a country that promised it was no longer pursuing a nuclear deal and doubling down on his own ability to negotiate with a strongman who says he already has nuclear weapons.\n\ntrump has made no promises that he will be able to reach an agreement with north korea, but he is betting on it big time. and as he approaches the halfway point of his presidency, it will be the first time he can deliver on his promise to negotiate better deals than his predecessor instead of just unwinding them.
(cnn) no wonder congressional democrats remain so united behind president joe biden's new administration: quietly but quickly, they are taking major strides toward their shared goal of curbing economic inequality.\n\nthe $1,400 relief checks in biden's coronavirus rescue legislation have dominated the headlines. but less-familiar provisions in the giant $1.9 trillion package could have a larger long-term impact on the disparities of income and wealth that have animated democratic politics for decades.\n\ncongressional committees began assembling the pieces last week with public attention riveted on the senate impeachment trial of former president donald trump . as currently drafted, they would rapidly lift material circumstances for working-class americans by expanding health insurance subsidies, sending child tax credit checks to parents , defraying child care costs so parents can return to work and further subsidizing employment for low-income americans without children.\n\nthat's aside from the provision more than doubling the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour over the next five years -- though democratic lawmakers expect the minimum-wage hike ultimately to be stricken under the special budget rules they are using to avoid a republican filibuster.\n\neven without it, the measure would slash the number of children living in poverty and families without health insurance. it reflects the consequence of last month's senate runoff victories in georgia, which unexpectedly gave democrats narrow control of the senate as well as the house -- a moment of pent-up demand, party solidarity, and legislative opportunity that former presidents bill clinton and barack obama could only envy.\n\nthere's more democratic unity than ever on taking bold steps on an economic dignity compact, said gene sperling, who authored a 2020 book on that subject after working for both previous democratic presidents. (it's) possible for 2021 to be one of the greatest years of progressive accomplishment in the past century.\n\ntemporary changes with permanent effects\n\nin a capital accustomed to legislative gridlock, the scale of biden's opportunity has largely escaped notice. that's partly because those economic provisions in emergency legislation to combat the coronavirus pandemic are drafted to be only temporary.\n\nbut biden and fellow democrats don't intend them to be temporary. nor did president donald trump intend his 2017 personal income tax cuts to expire after 10 years. to conform with the budget rules that apply to biden's covid relief package now, those tax cuts are set to expire after a decade to avoid an impermissible increase in budget deficits.\n\nlike republicans with tax cuts, democrats will count on the looming expiration cliff to persuade congress to extend those temporary benefits for low-income families when the time comes. however long they last, those benefits would have a major impact.\n\nthe joint tax committee of congress estimates that the expanded health insurance subsidies, child tax credit, child care credit and earned income tax credit would total more than $125 billion in 2022. that compares to the $190-billion average annual cost of the trump tax cuts.\n\nthe child tax credit would send $300 monthly checks to low-income parents with children under 6. the center on budget and policy priorities, a leading liberal advocacy group, says it would lift 4.1 million children above the poverty line, producing historic reductions of 40% in the number still living in poverty.\n\nthe expanded earned income tax credit would benefit 17 million low-paid workers without children, nearly tripling the maximum credit to around $1,500 and lifting the income cutoff to $21,000 from $16,000. the child care tax credit would cover half the cost of care for kids under 13, up to $4,000 for families earning less than $125,000 per year.\n\nthe health care provisions of the covid relief bill would help americans who don't currently qualify for subsidies -- now limited to those with incomes below 400% of poverty -- buy coverage from affordable care act marketplaces and make such coverage free for unemployed and lower-income workers. the 12 states that have not yet expanded medicaid under obamacare would receive robust new financial incentives to do so.\n\nthose provisions don't represent the entire health care agenda biden campaigned on last year, but analysts estimate they could reach 10 million of the 29 million americans still without health insurance. half a loaf, said larry levitt of the kaiser family foundation, but it's a very significant half.\n\nshifting to offense\n\nit marks an abrupt reversal from defense to offense for democrats who have spent the last decade fending off republican attempts to curtail or repeal obamacare. in his new book the ten year war, journalist jonathan cohn notes that a senate in which 50 members representing a clear majority of the population had the ability to pass legislation that could have produced a much more ambitious health care bill.\n\nthat's precisely the senate the georgia runoffs produced. using the same filibuster shield that lets democrats pass the covid relief bill without republican help, biden could still pursue other big chunks of his health care agenda in the economic recovery package he plans to propose later this year.\n\nthose other chunks include a government-run public option to compete with private plans on aca marketplaces and a medicare expansion lowering the age of eligibility to 60. whether or not those eventually get enacted, there is no sign yet of democratic fractures that would threaten passage of the covid relief package in the next few weeks.\n\none of the things i came to congress for was to get to universal health care, said house budget committee chairman john yarmuth of kentucky, who sponsored the spending outline for biden's proposal. the closer we get to that, i'm thrilled.\n\ncorrection: an earlier version of this story misstated the proposed changes in affordable care act subsidies.

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nhighlighting the divide facing democrats in expanding health insurance coverage via medicare, a group of lawmakers wednesday reintroduced bills that would allow americans to buy into the program at age 50 – rather than giving everyone access.\n\nthe legislation, spearheaded by sen. debbie stabenow of michigan and rep. brian higgins of new york, is a more moderate approach to promoting affordable coverage – a main goal of the democrats and a key plank in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nit's considered a stepping stone to the more progressive medicare for all framework, favored by several declared and potential candidates vying for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination.\n\nthe bill's co-sponsors include 2020 democratic hopefuls sens. cory booker of new jersey, kamala harris of california and amy klobuchar of minnesota, as well as sens. kirsten gillibrand of new york and jeff merkley of oregon, who are considering bids. several of them, including booker, gillibrand, harris and merkley, also backed sen. bernie sanders'$2 2017 medicare for all legislation.\n\nthe advantages of the buy in approach, sponsors say, is that it could be enacted quickly – unlike medicare for all, which would greatly overhaul the nation's health care system.\n\nit could happen now if it passed, using the current system – a trusted system – with those individuals who are most struggling right now in terms of health care costs, stabenow said.\n\nthe medicare buy in bills, versions of which have been introduced previously, would let americans ages 50 to 64 purchase medicare plans through the affordable care act exchanges. enrollees would cover the premiums, so it would not require federal government funding. however, lower- and moderate-income participants could qualify for obamacare subsidies to help defray their costs.\n\nmedicare, however, typically has much lower deductibles than exchange plans, but doesn't offer all of the same protections. consumers would have to buy separate part d plans to cover prescription medications or enroll in medicare advantage plans, which are offered by insurers and provide drug benefits.\n\nalso, enrollees may have to purchase supplemental medigap policies to shield them against high out-of-pocket costs since, unlike obamacare plans, medicare doesn't have an annual or lifetime cap. all of this additional coverage would be available to those age 50-plus on the exchanges.\n\nthe bills have not been analyzed by the congressional budget office, but higgins' office said premiums would have been around $8,200 in 2017, about 40% lower than a gold plan for a 60-year-old on the obamacare exchange. this would include drug coverage.\n\nsupporters also argue expanding medicare access will strengthen the obamacare exchanges since older americans, who are often sicker and costlier, will be shifted to medicare. this should reduce premiums for those remaining in affordable care act plans.\n\nthe buy in bills would retain the private insurance system – a source of controversy within the movement to expand coverage. many of those supporting medicare for all want to eliminate the industry, but many americans like their plans, leading some candidates to shy away from calling for the demise of insurers.\n\na recent kaiser family foundation poll found that 77% of respondents favor the medicare buy in approach, compared to 56% who support medicare for all.\n\nat least one major hospital group, however, opposes the bill. the federation of american hospitals, which represents investor-owned or managed hospitals, said that it will hurt consumers because medicare's low rates will squeeze care providers.\n\nthere is no question that medicare works for seniors and others who depend on it, said chip kahn, the federation's president. but expanding the program with hospitals facing the lowest medicare margins in history will make it more difficult to provide the critical care that all americans expect and deserve. instead of focusing on medicare buy-ins and other variations of single-payer proposals, congress should work to sustain and expand affordable private coverage.

(cnn) —\n\namericans are as divided as congressional democrats about how to expand health care coverage to more people.\n\ncoming off their midterm election romp, progressive democrats feel they have a mandate to push for a universal medicare-for-all plan. but some of their democratic peers support less drastic changes to the nation's health care system.\n\na national medicare-for-all plan received the lowest favorability score in kaiser family foundation's january tracking poll, released wednesday. some 56% of respondents said they favor medicare-for-all, in which all americans would get their insurance from a single government plan.\n\nbut roughly three-quarters of americans prefer other proposals to expand medicare or medicaid, kaiser found. some 77% favor allowing people age 50 to 64 to buy into medicare, while 75% would allow people who don't have job-based insurance to buy into medicaid, the government health insurance program for low-income americans.\n\nsome 74% favor creating a national health insurance program similar to medicare, but allowing people to keep the coverage they currently have, according to kaiser.\n\na majority of democrats and independents favor all four of these options, but only buying into medicare or medicaid garners the support of about two-thirds of republicans. less than a quarter of republicans favor medicare-for-all and 47% support a national plan that would allow people to keep their coverage.\n\nsupport for a national medicare-for-all plan swings wildly after folks hear about the potential effects. it spikes when respondents are told that it would guarantee health insurance as a right or eliminate premiums and reduce out-of-pocket costs.\n\nbut favorability slumps when they are told it would eliminate private health insurance, raise taxes or threaten the current medicare program. and it tanks when told it would lead to delays in receiving care.\n\nmany people don't think medicare-for-all would have an impact on them.\n\nnot surprisingly, the uninsured age 18 to 64 are most likely to say they'd be better off, at 43%. but 37% of this group don't think it would have much of an effect, while 19% thought it would leave them worse off.\n\nsenior citizens, however, are not buying the republican argument that medicare-for-all would hurt the existing medicare program. only a quarter of kaiser respondents 65 and older thought they'd be worse off if a national plan were implemented.\n\ndespite all the hype surrounding medicare-for-all, americans want lawmakers to focus on other health care issues.\n\nfirst up is making sure that the affordable care act's coverage protections for those with pre-existing conditions remain. close behind is lowering prescription drug costs.\n\njust over 1 in 10 respondents want lawmakers to implement medicare-for-all, though the same share want to repeal and replace obamacare.\n\nprotecting people from surprise medical bills ranks last.
charleston, south carolina (cnn) former president barack obama is intentionally staying on the sidelines of the democratic primary fight , though you may not know it from all of those campaign ads in which he is playing a starring role.\n\nhe's been a leader throughout the country for the past 12 years, obama says in one of the ads, giving a glance to the former new york mayor. mr. michael bloomberg is here.\n\nthose brief words from obama have played tens of thousands of times on television and repeated even more on digital ads for bloomberg. they date back more than six years, when obama visited a brooklyn high school.\n\non that day in october 2013, the president was actually praising bloomberg's tenure as mayor -- a point the bloomberg presidential campaign left out of the ads.\n\ni want to give a special shout-out to a man who's been an extraordinary mayor for this city, obama said that day. he's been a leader throughout the country for the past 12 years, mr. michael bloomberg is here.\n\nbloomberg, of course, is hardly the only presidential candidate trying to step into the glow of the former president. at least five democratic contenders have used obama in their advertising.\n\nisn't it amazing how everybody is barack's best friend now? biden said last week in nevada, delivering a sarcastic laugh. man, look at all these ads, right? it's amazing.\n\nbut for biden, the unprecedented advertising barrage from bloomberg is hardly amusing, considering his campaign does not have the money -- or anywhere close to it -- to compete.\n\na week before super tuesday, when bloomberg faces voters for the first time in this presidential race, the images alongside obama are powerful ones. the ads show the two men meeting in the oval office and on marine one, surveying damage from hurricane sandy in 2012.\n\na great president and an effective mayor, a narrator in the ad says. leadership that makes a difference.\n\nthrough the ads, the bloomberg campaign is hoping to make the former mayor more acceptable to black voters -- given his controversy over stop-and-frisk police tactics -- and trying to soften the claim biden is making to the obama legacy.\n\nwhen asked by cnn about the ads, biden bristles, saying: come on, man!\n\nyet the former vice president cannot afford tv advertising to amplify his argument that bloomberg was hardly always a big obama admirer.\n\nyou can spend a lot of money when you have $62 billion, but you can't do away with your record, biden said, pointing out that bloomberg criticized the obama administration's signature achievement, the affordable care act.\n\nso just how close were bloomberg and obama?\n\nthe mayor -- a republican-turned-independent -- and the president found common ground on guns and climate change. but they had many policy difference -- notably on obamacare.\n\nin a 2010 speech, just months after the law passed, bloomberg called it a disgrace. he described obamacare as just another program that's going to cost a lot of money.\n\na decade later, as he's running for the democratic presidential nomination, bloomberg has fully embraced obamacare and supports a medicare-like public option that builds on the same health care law he once spoke out against.\n\nwhile a spokesman for obama declined to comment on the bloomberg ads, the spots have drawn the ire of several former obama staffers, who have not forgotten bloomberg's tepid endorsement of obama, just five days before the 2012 election.\n\nit was damning with faint praise to say the least, said dan pfeiffer, a longtime obama adviser. at the time, a lot of us though, like, not endorsing would have been more constructive.\n\nin the op-ed published on bloomberg news, the former mayor praised republican nominee mitt romney, but said he would grudgingly vote for obama and offered a critique of his first term in the white house.\n\nin 2008, obama ran as a pragmatic problem-solver and consensus-builder. but as president, he devoted little time and effort to developing and sustaining a coalition of centrists, which doomed hope for any real progress on illegal guns, immigration, tax reform, job creation and deficit reduction, bloomberg wrote. and rather than uniting the country around a message of shared sacrifice, he engaged in partisan attacks and has embraced a divisive populist agenda focused more on redistributing income than creating it.\n\nin a 2016 speech, discovered by cnn's kfile , bloomberg acknowledged the slight.\n\nthe second obama election, i wrote a very back-handed endorsement of obama, bloomberg said. saying i thought he hadn't done the right thing, hadn't done, hadn't been good at things that i think are important and romney would be a better person at doing that. but romney did not stick with the values that he had when he was governor of massachusetts.\n\nthe difference between the bloomberg advertising campaign -- and the other democratic rivals -- is the financial muscle behind the television spots.\n\nas for the former president, he has not issued an endorsement and has no immediate plans to do so.\n\nhe's uniquely positioned to unify the party at the end of this, so appearing to interfere now would take away his ability to do so when his voice can have the most impact, a person close to obama told cnn. he's said he'll work hard for whoever the nominee is -- and that includes mayor bloomberg.\n\nit's an open question whether the ads actually work and help lift bloomberg's candidacy.\n\ntracy hughes, a south carolina military veteran, said she did a double-take when she first saw the bloomberg ads. after doing some research, she now knows obama didn't endorse bloomberg -- or anyone.\n\ni believe it's just a ploy, to me, to use president barack obama -- his legacy and his history -- to try and win votes, said hughes, who intends to vote for biden. it's not a good thing at all to do, because we can see right through it.

a new senate bill to repeal obamacare would leave 32 million more people uninsured by 2026 than under current law, according to a congressional budget office analysis released wednesday.\n\nthe republicans' latest attempt to fulfill their years-long pledge would effectively repeal obamacare in 2020, giving lawmakers until then to come up with a replacement plan.\n\nthe ramifications of not replacing the law immediately would be severe. three-quarters of the nation would live in areas with no insurers participating in the individual market by 2026 -- leaving many without an option if they do not have employer-provided or government health insurance, such as medicare or medicaid.\n\nalso, premiums would about double by 2026, compared to current law, the cbo found.\n\nit's unlikely gop lawmakers will approve this bill, though these frightening figures will make it even harder for them to proceed down this path. house republican leaders cast aside an attempt to swiftly and simply repeal obamacare earlier this year after encountering stiff opposition from fellow lawmakers and others, who said it was critical to come up with a replacement bill at the same time.\n\nthe idea unexpectedly resurfaced earlier this week after republicans' effort to repeal and replace obamacare ran aground in the senate on monday night. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said he would call a vote on a repeal bill modeled on 2015 legislation that was passed by both chambers before being vetoed by then-president obama.\n\nthis bill, unveiled wednesday afternoon, is meant to be a wake-up call for republican senators, to serve as a reminder that most of them voted for it just two years ago. mcconnell is essentially daring republicans to reverse their vote and support the status quo they've been campaigning against for seven years.\n\nrelated: trump to gop senators: 'inaction is not an option'\n\nthe cbo score could also pressure republicans to consider going back to the negotiating table to find a path forward on their more comprehensive health care bill, which would leave 22 million more americans uninsured over the next decade. that is what president trump asked them to do on wednesday during their lunch at the white house, though earlier in the week he called for lawmakers to repeal the obamacare now and replace it later.\n\nthe administration pushed back on the report.\n\nwe continue to believe that cbo's methodology is flawed, and this score fails to take into account the president's full plan, which includes a replacement for obamacare and administrative actions to reduce costs and expand access to quality, affordable care, a white house official said.\n\nhere's what the new bill would do:\n\n-- get rid of the individual and employer mandates, two of the least favorite provisions of the law, by reducing the penalty to $0. this provision would be retroactive to 2016.\n\n-- effectively end obamacare in 2020 by eliminating the federal subsidies that help people afford individual coverage.\n\n-- eliminate medicaid expansion starting in 2020.\n\n-- repeal taxes on the wealthy, health insurers, medical device makers and others.\n\n-- defund planned parenthood for one year.\n\n-- increase funding for substance abuse and mental health needs by $1.5 billion over two years.\n\nenacting the legislation would decrease deficits by $473 billion over the next decade, however this doesn't take into account the cost of a replacement plan.\n\nrelated: will obamacare really fail?\n\nin some important ways, however, this bill repeals less of obamacare than the legislation that passed the house and the version that was under consideration in the senate until this week. it doesn't touch obamacare's insurance provisions, including the immensely popular protections for those with pre-existing conditions. that will make it more likely to comply with senate rules that will allow it to be passed with a simple majority.\n\nalso, it would not curtail federal support for the overall medicaid program as the house and senate health care bills would have.\n\nstill, repealing obamacare without replacing it would throw the individual market into chaos, prompting insurers to start exiting swiftly. lawmakers wouldn't have a lot of time to come up with a replacement, said cynthia cox, associate director at the kaiser family foundation.\n\ninsurers are mid-negotiation for participating next year. repeal without a replacement will destabilize the market in 2018. — cynthia cox (@cynthiaccox) july 19, 2017\n\nsome 17 million fewer people would be insured next year, leaving only an estimated 84% of americans covered, compared to 90% under current law, the cbo found. premiums would be roughly 25% higher mainly because many younger and healthier people would drop their coverage since they would no longer be penalized for being uninsured.\n\nby 2026, a total of some 59 million people would lack coverage under this bill, compared to 28 million under current law, the agency estimated.\n\ncnn's lauren fox and dan merica contributed to this report.

new york (cnn business) a badly designed app is causing chaos in iowa. that shouldn't shock anyone.\n\nif you think everyone who designs software is a genius, remember that software developers created healthcare.gov, windows 8 and icloud . and they redesigned snapchat . user interfaces are tricky, and they too often take intuition for granted. bugs happen. and developers are human, eager to rush their products out the door -- often before they've been adequately tested.\n\nthat appears to be what happened at iowa's caucuses monday night. precinct chairs were supposed to enter primary election results into a new election app, but many had trouble getting the app to work. that held up the tabulation of results, and just about every voter, candidate and campaign staffer in iowa went home disappointed, confused and anxious.\n\napp design is hard. it needs to translate abstract concepts into intuitive gestures and taps. you can only display so much on a smartphone screen. placing additional features and settings off screen where they can be easily found is a tricky business. developers also need to rigorously test their apps to ensure they've squashed bugs that can crop up in thousands of lines of code.\n\nbut a well-designed app is only part of the challenge app makers face. they need to ensure the servers and systems supporting the app are robust, particularly during high-traffic hours of the day -- like when thousands of people are entering election results at the same time.

a legend in the senate, a hero for the country and a statesman who shaped the country on everything from us foreign policy to immigration reform, has left a hole in the heart of washington.\n\nthe maverick and conservative who was, at times, willing to take on his own party died saturday at a time when tumult and uncertainty looms in both the nation's capital and the capitol and mccain's brand of straight-talking politics seems almost to be slipping away.\n\njohn mccain's life is proof that some truths are timeless. character. courage. integrity. honor. a life lived embodying those truths casts a long, long shadow, former vice president joe biden said in a statement saturday night. john mccain will cast a long shadow. his impact on america hasn't ended. not even close. it will go on for many years to come.\n\nthe vietnam veteran survived more than five years as a prisoner of war, ran for president twice, won the republican nomination in 2008 and became known for his frankness, humor and stubbornness in the capitol building. lawmakers on both sides of the aisle were devastated by the loss saturday, struggling to imagine washington without him.\n\nin an era filled with cynicism about national unity and public service, john mccain's life shone as a bright example. he showed us that boundless patriotism and self-sacrifice are not outdated concepts or clichés, but the building blocks of an extraordinary american life, majority leader mitch mcconnell said in a statement about mccain.\n\nin an emotional interview, arizona republican sen. jeff flake, lamented on cnn how hard it would be to go on without mccain.\n\nit's tough. i am going to miss him, flake said. i have admired him my entire life. it's tough to imagine the senate without him. it's tough to imagine politics without john mccain.\n\nsenate minority leader chuck schumer released a statement saying he'd introduce a resolution to rename the russell office building after him.\n\nas you go through life, you meet few truly great people. john mccain was one of them. his dedication to his country and the military were unsurpassed, and maybe most of all, he was a truth teller – never afraid to speak truth to power in an era where that has become all too rare, schumer said. the senate, the united states, and the world are lesser places without john mccain.\n\ninside the halls of congress\n\nmccain prized the senate as an institution and the senate floor as a hotbed for debate. he preferred working bills through the committee process before bringing them to the floor and worked across the aisle on some of the senate's most controversial issues, including immigration reform, a topic that landed him on the wrong side of the right wing of his party sometimes.\n\nin 2017, just after he was diagnosed with brain cancer, mccain openly addressed some of his fears for the senate, admonishing his own colleagues in a stirring speech for bending to what he believed was a partisan brand of politicking, warning them that grave consequences awaited a body that only careened blindly from one party's control to another.\n\nwe are getting nothing done, my friends, we're getting nothing done, mccain said.\n\nwhile he prized unity and conservatism, he will be remembered for opposing a narrow repeal of the affordable care act in 2017 with a dramatic thumbs-down that shocked the chamber and reset the fate of obamacare – a decision that seemed almost unimaginable at a time when republicans had spent almost a decade campaigning to undo the law.\n\nin mccain's absence, it's hard to know what will come of the senate – his beloved institution – or the republican party, for whom he was the standard-bearer in 2008.\n\njohn cared deeply about the senate. he fought tirelessly for the senate and invested a lot of time and care in younger senators, sen. chris coons, a democrat from delaware, told dana bash on cnn. when i first met him, he was pretty intimidating and chairman of the armed services committee, two-time presidential candidate, a global leading figure, and he could be gruff, and he put me through my paces, but once you demonstrated to him you would stand up for your own principles and push back and debate with him, he was a remarkable friend and great mentor.\n\nmccain will lie in state in the arizona capitol on wednesday, the day mccain *would have* turned 82 years old, according to the state's governor, doug ducey. after that service, he will be taken to washington on thursday, and will lie in state in the capitol on friday, according to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell's office.\n\nmccain will have a national memorial service at washington's national cathedral on saturday, according to the family statement. after that, he will be taken to annapolis, maryland, where he will be laid to rest.\n\ncnn's dana bash, jeff zeleny and keith allen contributed to this report.
areva martin is a cnn legal analyst, a civil rights attorney and st. louis native. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. view more opinion on cnn.\n\n(cnn) many of us vividly recall the hotly contested 2016 primary race between bernie sanders and hillary clinton, whom i strongly supported. sanders' message of fighting income inequality and pushing for medicare for all resonated with many democratic voters, as it does now, and after winning the new hampshire primary he seemed to have momentum on his side. but the race inevitably shifted to the south and its heavy contingent of black voters.\n\nclinton benefited from her husband's popularity with black voters and pulverized sanders in south carolina by 47 percentage points. sanders next got crushed on super tuesday, losing the southern and southwest states of virginia, georgia, alabama, tennessee, arkansas, and texas.\n\nin 2020, sanders was determined to avoid repeating that history.\n\nhe tried to increase his percentage of the black vote by blanketing facebook with ads that highlighted his long-standing commitment to civil rights. he also talked up issues of paramount importance to the black community -- criminal justice reform and social-economic injustice. sanders enlisted the help of influential black surrogates such as harvard professor cornel west and rapper killer mike . he began airing a tv ad that features former president barack obama's past praise of him, even though he has positioned himself as the anti-establishment candidate. former obama aides like david axelrod questioned the ad given that sanders and the former president were not particularly close. in mississippi , his campaign funded an ad campaign on black radio.\n\nbut despite all this, sanders once again failed miserably with black voters. he got crushed, again, in south carolina and then suffered a blowout loss on super tuesday.\n\nand tuesday night, he suffered perhaps a fatal blow by losing the three ms -- mississippi, missouri, and michigan.\n\nso, what did sanders do wrong this time? well, it didn't help that on the sunday before super tuesday he failed to appear at a bloody sunday ceremonial event in selma , alabama, that honors the civil rights leaders who marched across the edmund pettus bridge.\n\nsanders compounded that mistake by canceling a rally in mississippi . perhaps unknown to him is that many african americans from my hometown of st. louis hail from the south and have deep ties to blacks in alabama, mississippi, and georgia. sanders' actions were an affront not just to those southerners, but to blacks in missouri.\n\nanother crucial mistake by the presidential hopeful was his failure to control the vitriol coming from his bernie bro supporters. one example: after joe biden trounced sanders in south carolina by garnering 61% of the black vote, one sanders supporter explained biden's victory on twitter, saying, people won't say it but the truth is that many voters in sc are low information voters. which is a nice way to put it.\n\nsince south carolina's democratic electorate is more than 60% african american, the perception is that the sanders supporter was equating low information voters to black voters who support biden.\n\nin fact, exit polling shows that white voters favored biden to sanders by a margin of 33% to 23% and that those with advanced degrees preferred biden over sanders 51% to 15%.\n\nsanders' relentless attacks on millionaires and billionaires didn't resonate with a large segment of the black community that takes pride in the successes of black billionaires such as robert smith , who paid off the student loan debt of the entire 2019 graduating class at morehouse college. sanders doesn't seem to understand that although many african americans suffer from an economic system stacked against them, we are economically aspirational.\n\njust watched how biden's wins differ from clinton's in 2016 replay more videos ... must watch how biden's wins differ from clinton's in 2016 02:57\n\nmany african americans applaud the high achievement and success of billionaires like oprah winfrey, jay-z and michael jordan.\n\nbut sanders' biggest mistake, undoubtedly, was his failure to understand the mindset of middle-aged and older african americans.\n\nfor many of these voters, trump's relentless attempts to dismantle obamacare and destroy the entire legacy of the first black president -- barack obama -- has been an unending nightmare. the unyielding assault and systematic attack on other prominent african american leaders, like congresswoman maxine waters, and the dismantling of safety net programs like the supplemental nutrition assistance program for seniors made removing trump from office a pivotal issue for many black voters.\n\njoe biden is not the perfect candidate. i take issue with many of the votes he cast as a senator and i wish his candidacy resonated more with younger voters. but biden understands the importance of black voters and he has his pulse on the electorate. he had a regular presence in african american churches and gained the support of 100 black faith leaders in south carolina leading up to the state's primary.\n\nmany african americans feel his concern for the problems plaguing our community is genuine, which is why he has scored overwhelming victories over sanders in every state with a sizable number of black voters.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter. join us on twitter and facebook
story highlights it's friday the 13th, a date for which a horror movie is named\n\n(cnn) —\n\nanother friday the 13th is upon us, and this particular day/date combo is enough to make the superstitious barricade themselves indoors. there was even a full moon!\n\nthus, the best way to round up a busy week in politics is through gifs from the classic friday the 13th horror franchise.\n\nboth republicans and democrats claimed the other side was basically destroying the country. not really all that different from any other week, except this week focused primarily on obamacare.\n\nrepublicans want to repeal it and started the work on capitol hill with the annual budget process.\n\nthe law is collapsing, and so we've got to rescue people, house speaker paul ryan said in a cnn town hall thursday.\n\ndemocrats want to keep it.\n\nsen. bernie sanders – who appeared on a cnn town hall earlier in the week – said repealing obamacare could throw 30 million people off their health insurance.\n\nand if that happens, many of these people will die, sanders said.\n\nthe other big story on the hill was the beginning of confirmation hearings for president-elect donald trump's cabinet nominees. biggies included sen. jeff sessions for attorney general, rex tillerson for secretary of state and james mattis – who clarified his nickname should not be mad dog – for defense secretary.\n\nspeaking of those hearings, sessions sat through eight hours of testimony on tuesday. he was questioned on his record on race, religious minorities and enhanced interrogation techniques.\n\nmattis, a retired marine general, had to be granted a waiver by the senate to even be eligible for his post because of an existing law banning military officials from becoming defense secretary within seven years of retirement.\n\nthe waiver passed the senate 81-17 and the house 268-151 – no funny business there.\n\nduring the hearing for rep. mike pompeo's nomination to be cia director, the power mysteriously went out, forcing the hearing into a temporary recess. at least no one went by themselves to check the circuit breakers.\n\nspeaking of people named jason, rep. jason chaffetz declared that he would continue the investigation into hillary clinton's use of a private email server.\n\nlike every good monster, that email thing comes back every time you think it's dead.\n\none of the biggest fights in congress this week was ridiculous, but was no laughing matter for those involved. rep. william lacy clay rehanged a constituent's artwork in the cannon tunnel multiple times after his republican colleagues removed it.\n\nrepublicans said the piece – which depicts police officers as pigs – was offensive.\n\nregardless of your stance on the content, the idea of grown adults playing capture the flag with a painting is classic politics. imagine doing that at any job other than congress or on the office.\n\nnext week is the inauguration of trump, and with so much to do with so little time before the new administration takes over, it's going to be another long week. and we all know that sequels to horror movies are always so much better than their predecessors. right?

sens. tom cotton, ted cruz and rand paul have had issues with the gop health care plan get it right, don't get it fast, sen. tom cotton tweeted\n\n(cnn) —\n\nseveral high-profile republican senators cast doubt thursday on the chances of the gop leadership plan to replace obamacare, saying the process is moving too quickly and adding to a raft of woes for house speaker paul ryan and president donald trump.\n\nthe house bill as currently drafted, i don't believe will pass the senate, said sen. ted cruz, one day after he and his family dined with trump and first lady melania trump as part of the president's efforts to woo conservatives to support the plan. however, the texas republican added: we can fix it.\n\nsince republicans can't count on any democratic support to get through congress, gop leaders are counting on a near-uniform front to advance the health care legislation, a level of unity that wasn't on display over the past several days in either the house or the senate.\n\nhouse leaders are also trying to advance this leg of the obamacare repeal as part of the reconciliation process, which helps inoculate the bill from the threat of a filibuster but means leaders wanted the legislation wrapped in advance of the mid-april easter recess. that deadline, however, did not appear to work for sen. tom cotton.\n\nno normal american cares whether a health care bill passes before the easter recess or the memorial day recess or any other recess, the arkansas republican told reporters. they don't care that we get health care done fast. they care that we get it done right.\n\ncotton, generally seen as a trump ally, blasted the house thursday morning, accusing them of ramming health care through the same way that democrats did eight years ago.\n\nhouse health-care bill can't pass senate w/o major changes. to my friends in house: pause, start over. get it right, don't get it fast, cotton tweeted thursday morning.\n\ncotton added: what matters in long run is better, more affordable health care for americans, not house leaders' arbitrary legislative calendar.\n\nconservatives in the house have laid out a set of demands they say is needed to earn enough votes for the bill to pass the chamber. and even as house lawmakers worked through the night wednesday and into the morning thursday pushing through the health care bill, the white house and house republican leaders continued their coordinated lobbying effort.\n\nand other senators have said they simply don't want to weigh in without seeing the impact the congressional budget office determines in its score of the proposal.\n\nit's kind of crazy they're voting without a score, sen. bill cassidy, a louisiana republican, said thursday.\n\ncotton also raised those concerns in a tweet.\n\ngop shouldn't act like dems did in o'care. no excuse to release bill mon night, start voting wed. with no budget estimate, he continued.\n\nand members of the house felt the pressure of the leadership's timeline. asked about cotton's tweets, rep. steve king agreed that house republicans were moving too quickly and did not give congress enough time to improve it.\n\nwe should have had more time to digest it. i would have rather seen it out for a week or 10 days before they go to a committee and mark it up, the iowa republican told cuomo. it really isn't much time for anybody to bring amendments to try to make the change.\n\nrepublicans can only afford to lose a few votes in the senate, and some members have been vocal with their criticism including sen. rand paul, who's repeatedly called the current bill obamacare lite.\n\nbut senate gop leaders insist they will have enough support to pass health care through the senate.\n\nwe don't know what the house bill is yet, because it hasn't passed the house, said senate majority whip john cornyn. we have been working very closely with them because we want to make sure that whatever they send us passes the byrd rule test.\n\nwe will pass it and it will be signed by the president, cornyn said.\n\ncnn's eugene scott contributed to this report.

uncertainty.\n\n\n\n(end videotape) camerota: thanks to leyla santiago there.\n\n\n\njoining us now on the phone is the governor of puerto rico, ricardo rossello. governor, thank you very much for taking the time to talk to us. i understand that they're -- the death toll is rising in puerto rico. can you give us the latest numbers?\n\n\n\ngov. ricardo rossello, puerto rico (via phone): good morning to everyone.\n\n\n\nwe have been receiving partial information. let me be clear that still part of the island is lacking communications. so what we have is some preliminary assessments about 13 deaths at this -- at this juncture. so we're -- we will keep you abreast of what's going on.\n\n\n\nbut certainly, still, some of the western part of the island, southern part of the island, southeast part of the island, we're still trying to break through. keep in mind we're 24 hours just post-hurricane warning. and right now our efforts are to make sure that we have everybody safe and that we can rescue people. our efforts have already produced almost 700 rescues. so we're clearly focused on that.\n\n\n\ncamerota: yes, of course, governor. it's just hard to really wrap our heads around what's happening in puerto rico this morning. we're looking at the video. i mean, whole neighborhoods and towns are underwater. can you give us a sense for what the conditions are for the 3.5 million people there?\n\n\n\nrossello: yes. well, the flooding areas, as we anticipated, were -- were going to get several feet of water. it's been significant. yesterday during the morning i had to go to one of the towns to help rescue people that were on the rooftops because of water flooded more than anticipated.\n\n\n\nso we have a lot of flooding. we have reports of, you know, just complete devastation of vulnerable housing. of course, it's still raining over here, which is one of our main messages right now. keep safe. still seek shelter. because mudslides and surges as well as flooding continues.\n\n\n\n[06:05:05] so that's essentially the landscape. and and we're still trying to see some of the hardest hit areas such as the southeastern part of the island. we still are lacking in communication there. but that's essentially a major disaster here in puerto rico, and what our focus is, again, is trying to save as many lives as we can.\n\n\n\ncamerota: of course. i mean, some of the areas have gotten 40 inches of rain. i mean, and this is the aftermath. what we're looking at right now, we're watching some of the 700 rescues that you're talking about.\n\n\n\ncan we talk about the power grid? i mean, when we've spoken to you, as well as when we've spoken to the head of the power and light company, i mean, the estimates are just really disheartening that it's going to be between some -- i mean, do you still believe it will be between four and six months to get power restored there?\n\n\n\nrossello: we'll get a better sense today. today we will fly over puerto rico. we will see how the transmission lines handled the storm. if there is severe devastation in those transmission lines, it's going to take weeks and months to repair those.\n\n\n\nhowever, if the devastation is not as severe, then we can restore it quickly. but our warning, you know, when we came in eight months ago to this administration was that we had a very weak energy grid here in puerto rico, and we needed to restore it. so of course, that takes time. but now, certainly, with the help of fema and working together, we're going to have to not only restore it but make sure we mitigate future impact so that we can restore energy quicker.\n\n\n\ncamerota: but governor, what's that going to look like for all of the people in puerto rico? i mean, how are they going to work and live and function without power?\n\n\n\nrossello: well -- yes, well, it's tough, but we've been -- we've been working on mitigation strategies. we have plenty of -- of generators that are coming in. mind you, the estimates of time of getting power is getting full power. so we expect to start getting power in different areas of puerto rico as we start restoring the system.\n\n\n\nso there's been a lot of solidarity, i would say, however, alisyn. and this is one of the silver linings here. puerto rico became a platform to help u.s. citizens. after irma blazed through the islands, we rescued and repatriated over 3,500 u.s. citizens.\n\n\n\nbut now there's a lot of people, a lot of governors. you know, the federal government has been phenomenal. fema has been great.\n\n\n\ncamerota: yes.\n\n\n\nrossello: so now our efforts, you know, obviously still within the warning signs and danger making sure that people are safe, saving life. but immediately after that, start rebuilding puerto rico stronger than ever.\n\n\n\ncamerota: governor, i know you spoke to president trump last night. what did you ask him for and what did he offer?\n\n\n\nrossello: well, the president has been phenomenal in this situation. he's been, both in irma and maria, he has offered an pre-landfall emergency declaration. he's already declared most of the island a disaster area so that we can start the rebuilding process quickly. and he just said that he loved the people of puerto rico, and that he would help, that he would stand by us in our rebuilding process.\n\n\n\ncamerota: governor, obviously, we know that you have weeks and months ahead of you that are going to be really challenging. we appreciate you giving us a status report. governor rossello, thank you very much for being on new day.\n\n\n\nrossello: thank you, alisyn. and thank you for all of the people that have poured their hearts, their prayers, governors, congressmen. just regular american citizens calling and pouring out their help. thank you for all of that. puerto rico is going to need you at this juncture, and we're very grateful for your consideration at this time.\n\n\n\ncamerota: everyone is thinking of you, governor. we'll speak to you again soon.\n\n\n\nchris.\n\n\n\ncuomo: all right. the answer to a frequently-asked question. the reason you're seeing so much federal aid in puerto rico is two-fold. one, humanity demands it. and second, puerto rico is not a sovereign. it's a commonwealth of the united states. it's a territory. those are americans there. so you're going to see continued resources from the united states government.\n\n\n\nnow there's a very different story on the island of dominica. it's considered almost a complete loss, and it's mostly inaccessible after hurricane maria. cnn is one of the only reporting teams on the island right now, and the widespread destruction is everywhere.\n\n\n\ncnn's michael holmes is there -- michael.\n\n\n\nmichael holmes, cnn correspondent: chris, i've got to tell you, i haven't seen anything quite like this. we've been covering irma and then maria for a couple of weeks now. this is by far the worst we've seen.\n\n\n\ndominica is an island of 70,000 or so people. it has been decimated from end to end. we're in the capital, roseau, at the moment. everywhere i look around me, i can see roofs torn off and, in many cases, down below, houses completely demolished.\n\n\n\n[06:10:07] there are massive trees. this is an island of rain forests. massive trees, washed down the rivers and banged up against bridges. there is no power. there is no running water. very little aid has gotten in so far. you mentioned the isolated villages. there are many of these villages, hillside villages all around this island. we flew around the island a day or so ago before we could actually land. and those places have all been decimated, as well.\n\n\n\nyou look around, there is -- there is debris littering like confetti around the fields and the hillsides. there have been a lot of mudslides. this -- we talked to the prime minister yesterday. this is an agriculture-based economy. cane fields. you've got banana plantations, citrus growth. gone. everything. there's not a leaf on this island, chris.\n\n\n\nthe rain forest, you can't see where they are. they're just not there. look at before pictures of this online and look at it now, and you've just got to shake your head. it's total devastation.\n\n\n\nthe prime minister is heading off to the u.n. g.a. today. he's going to go there and make a plaintive cry for help. they're worried here they're going to get forgotten. this was the first-place hit by maria. category 5. full-on hit. they're worried they're going to get forgotten because of other places that have been hit by irma and maria. further down the line, of course, the devastation in puerto rico and other places like that.\n\n\n\nthis little island basically has nothing and has nothing going forward in terms of an economy. the nascent (ph) -- the tourism industry, done. the agriculture industry, done. they need help. they need it now. no power. no water. precious little food -- alisyn.\n\n\n\ncamerota: michael, the video is just incredible. the aerial shots of what it looks like today. thank you very much for the reporting from there.\n\n\n\nso hurricane maria is still a powerful category 3 storm as it takes aim at the turks and caicos. cnn meteorologist chad myers has the latest forecast.\n\n\n\nwhat are you seeing this morning, chad?\n\n\n\nchad myers, cnn meteorologist: alisyn, i've seen the storm now going into the turks and caicos away from the dominican republic. still 125 miles per hour. it did gain a lot of strength as it got back into the water, as we expected. but still traveling to the north and to the northwest.\n\n\n\nnow, there is still a little chance that this makes a slight left turn back toward the u.s., and i'll show you why. a hundred and ten miles per hour, though, in the middle of the atlantic. missing bermuda, too. see that little jog to the left? why did they push it back? this is the hurricane center forecast five days from now. why did they push it to the left? because the european level has a slight jog as it tries to interact with jose. this will rotate around each other. and that's this part of the wiggle. so that's why the model turns a little bit farther to the left, and so does the official hurricane track.\n\n\n\nbut for now it stays onshore and makes a right-hand turn. maybe making a run at atlantic canada but for now the atlantic ocean -- chris.\n\n\n\ncuomo: got to keep an eye on it. we know you will. chad, thank you very much.\n\n\n\nall right. so now to mexico and the race against time. there are human chains of volunteers and workers, often digging by hand through rubble for survivors. the death toll from that magnitude 7.1 earthquake right now stands at well over 250 and continues to rise.\n\n\n\ncnn's rosa flores is live in mexico city -- rosa.\n\n\n\nrosa flores, cnn correspondent: well, chris, there are at least 10 collapsed buildings here in mexico city who are believed to have people trapped inside. the building that you see behind me is one of them. at this hour, rescuers telling us that operations here have stopped because of the rain that pummeled mexico city overnight. that rain added weight to the building that is already unstable. and this rain just one added stress to an already very dangerous operation to save lives.\n\n\n\n(begin videotape)\n\n\n\nflores (voice-over): search-and-rescue teams frantically combing through collapsed buildings, desperate for signs of life amid the mangled rebar and blocks of concrete. mexico's president telling the public that authorities believe there are still people buried alive. the emergency officials using high-tech cameras and rescue dogs, hoping it isn't too late.\n\n\n\nthese workers build a makeshift ladder to reach the top of the rubble before calling for silence to listen for any survivors. these scenes playing out across mexico city and surrounding towns as thousands work together removing buckets of debris and piece of wood, one piece at a time. a painstaking task done carefully to avoid a further collapse.\n\n\n\namid the chaos, moments of joy as people are pulled from the rubble. workers celebrate as this survivor is brought to safety. other efforts coming up empty, like the urgent seven for a young girl authorities believed was trapped under this collapsed elementary school. the world eagerly awaited news of her fate before officials announced that all of the students and teachers had been accounted for, either at home, in hospitals or dead.\n\n\n\n[06:15:08] nevertheless, rescuers remained hopeful and determined as the global community rallies around mexico. volunteers from around the world coming from as far away as japan and taiwan, working together with hundreds of ordinary people who have flocked to the area to do whatever they can to help save lives.\n\n\n\nsofia broid, mexico city resident: i'm a mom and a graphic designer. i'm not prepared to -- to do any of this. but there's always something you can do.\n\n\n\n(end videotape)\n\n\n\nflores: and as we take another live look here, i can tell you that rescue workers have been saying that, while operations have seized here for the moment, while they wait for this delicate building to settle after the rain from overnight, they do believe that people are trapped in what they are calling capsules, alisyn.\n\n\n\nand these capsules, they say, were created when that building collapsed, but it allowed people to stay in these crevasses, in these areas. and the reason why they believe that there are people trapped inside is because they say they used heat sensors. and there were positive readings coming from those sensors and the sophisticated equipment that they're using here in mexico city.\n\n\n\ncamerota: oh, my gosh. let's pray that they can get to them today when daylight comes up there. thank you very much, rosa.\n\n\n\nso north korea. kim jong-un firing insults at president trump and issuing an ominous new warning to the united states. we have all the new details for you, next.\n\n\n\n(commercial break) [06:20:14] camerota: north korea issuing an ominous new warning. their foreign minister says it may test a hydrogen bomb over the pacific ocean. this comes as the rhetoric escalates between the reclusive leader and trump.\n\n\n\ncnn's joe johns is live near bedminster, new jersey, where the president is waking up this morning. what's the latest, joe?\n\n\n\njoe johns, cnn correspondent: alisyn, this is a war of words that continues to escalate. north korea's foreign minister ri young ho indicating that north korea could explode a hydrogen bomb over the pacific in retaliation for the president's speech before the united nations. though he did say that the final decision, of course, will be left up to kim jong-un.\n\n\n\nkim, for his part, promising the harshest countermeasures in history, indicating the united states would pay dearly for the speech. let's listen to some of those incendiary words that set off this word conflict.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\ntrump: the united states has great strength and patience. but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy north korea. rocket man is on a suicide mission for himself and for his regime.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\njohns: kim also referred to president trump as a doddered or deranged and senile old man. that was in response to the president's latest executive order, indicating that financial institutions can participate in economics with the united states or north korea but not both.\n\n\n\nthe president of the united states also indicated yesterday that china has, in fact, informed its associated banking system not to participate in financial transactions with north korea, though that could not be confirmed.\n\n\n\nthe president is expected to have a quiet day here in new jersey before heading off to alabama to participate in a rally for luther strange, who's trying to win the election against the popular former chief supreme court justice, roy moore.\n\n\n\nback to you.\n\n\n\ncuomo: all right, joe. so we have rocket man on one side, dotard on the other. war of words. the question is, where does it lead?\n\n\n\nlet's discuss. we have cnn political analysts maggie haberman and david sanger, both also correspondents from the new york times.\n\n\n\nso david, you got to hear from mcmaster yesterday and lay out the thoughts about north korea and the bigger concerns about iran and what the goal is with russia. now you have the events of the president announcing a more holistic look. what's your takeaway?\n\n\n\ndavid sanger, cnn political analyst: well i think the biggest development here, chris, is actually the threat of an atmospheric test, which american officials have been concerned about privately for some time. and it was very interesting that the foreign minister of north korea gave voice to that just around the time that kim jong-un did that somewhat remarkable direct attack on president trump.\n\n\n\nan atmospheric test would be a very big thing. there has not been one in nearly four decades. the chinese were the last ones to do it. the united states banned them with a few other nations at the end of the kennedy administration in 1963 in the partial test ban treaty. because they are such an environmental disaster. and of course, we sickened a lot of people when -- near the bikini atoll when the u.s. conducted such tests in the '50s.\n\n\n\nmy guess is that that would be an incredibly provocative act that could well change the administration's own calculus about its need for preemptive action.\n\n\n\nand as general mcmaster, who you had on yesterday, who was the one who has talked the most about taking some kind of preventive step, whether this is a holistic approach, as you suggest, i'm not convinced yet. because the effort to suggest that they may pull back from the iran treaty, i think, would make it much harder to the sign any kind of agreement with north korea.\n\n\n\ncamerota: david, i want to stay with you for one second. because what about this development of possibly president xi issuing an order to china's central bank to tell all the other banks to stop transactions with north korea. what do we know?\n\n\n\nsanger: well, it looks like the order came out from the central bank, alisyn. it looks like it's for real. i think it was a preventive measure by the chinese to protect their own financial system, because they've seen this order signed by the president. and while i don't think the order itself will change very much in the north korean calculus, it's a big deal if the chinese suddenly have come to the conclusion they can no longer bank with the north.\n\n\n\n[06:25:11] cuomo: now, maggie, we heard from mcmaster yesterday, the kind of fulsome praise for the use of rocket man, that it was accurate and that it was evocative and got people's attention and that they are perfectly happy with the state of play there. how deep does that go?\n\n\n\nmaggie haberman, cnn political analyst: i don't think that the remarks that are said publicly about -- by administration officials about what president trump says are always the most genuine.\n\n\n\ni think that that speech was very striking, as you know, because it was basically in line with what this president has been saying in terms of more fiery rhetoric for a while. and they were all part of this process. the speech was not a surprise to people. the speech went through the normal speech process. there was nothing unusual about it. i think that, look, they're dealing with no good option. i do believe\n\n\n\nthat there is some degree of placating the president so that he doesn't essentially react against his own advisers on this, so that he feels as if his language is his own.\n\n\n\nit did not play great at the u.n. as we know, this is unusual, to say the least. but i think that you are dealing with advisers to president trump who are trying to basically contain his own reactions to a situation at hand, and i think that they have a dual hand to play there.\n\n\n\ncamerota: david, it also did not play great in pyongyang. kim jong- un then issued his own statement in reaction to president trump's statement. so here's what kim jong-un said: he is unfit to hold the prerogative of supreme command of a country, and he is surely a rogue and a gangster fond of playing with fire rather than a politician. i will make the man holding the prerogative of the supreme command of the u.s. pay dearly for his speech calling for totally destroying north korea. whatever trump might have expected he will face results beyond his expectation. i will surely and definitely tame the mentally deranged u.s. dotard with fire.\n\n\n\nthat's colorful. that's always sort of interesting. but i mean, so you -- is there any -- are there any repercussions from the escalating rhetoric?\n\n\n\nsanger: well, it is colorful. i saw last night that dotard was among the most searched terms last night. i confess i had to go back and refresh my memory, as well.\n\n\n\ncuomo: you usually use it as dotaring. like, this guy -- the old one, the person, an old person, boss...\n\n\n\ncamerota: that's doddering, isn't it?\n\n\n\ncuomo: a doddering idiot, you know? but now it's back. it is back.\n\n\n\ncamerota: doddering. i thought it was dotard. but again, this is -- he's confused us this morning.\n\n\n\nsanger: that's right. so a few things about this. first, this is exactly where kim jong-un wants to be. he wants to be right on par with the president of the united states.\n\n\n\ni mean, imagine this. the guy is running a tiny, starving country of 25 million people who we would never think about except on world food day if it was not for the fact that they have nuclear weapons.\n\n\n\nso he sees the nuclear weapons as the one thing that has cast him in the midst of the world stage and preserves his regime. and here he is, doing a one-on-one, and we're sitting here talking about him in that regard.\n\n\n\nso he considers this to be a bit of a success. the concern here is that you have many paths by which this escalation of rhetoric could actually escalate out in the real world. and that's why the atmospheric test, i think, would be a

story highlights trump is heavily involved in the 2018 midterm planning process, the white house says trump's team has interviewed over 100 prospective trump-backed candidates a president's party often takes a beating at the ballot box in the first midterm election after they win the white house\n\n(cnn) —\n\ndonald trump, keen to fill the halls of congress with his acolytes while defending his record as president, is already fully involved in his administration's political efforts ahead of the 2018 midterms, senior white house officials tell cnn.\n\ntrump is eager to be front and center in next year's races and has told white house advisers that he wants to keep a robust schedule. the midterms will undoubtedly be viewed as a referendum on trump, meaning that as the president campaigns for others, he will also be looking to boost his own standing.\n\nhe takes his role as the leader of the party very seriously, white house political director bill stepien said in an interview. he loved the campaign trail last year. he loves governing. i am sure he is going to love to get back to the campaign trail next year.\n\ntrump's decision to dive headfirst into the midterms comes with considerable risk, though.\n\nhis unpopularity, especially in key states with bellwether senate races, will make it difficult for him to fully endorse some republican candidates. additionally, the more trump is involved, the more blame he will take if republicans suffer sizable losses in these contests, a trend that would fall in line with historic norms.\n\nrepublicans fired the opening salvo of the 2018 campaign at the white house on wednesday, when leader after leader touted their newly passed tax plan and, most notably, trump's leadership.\n\nsomething this big, something this generational, something this profound, could not have been done without exquisite presidential leadership, house speaker paul ryan said at the white house event. mr. president, thank you for getting us over the finish line.\n\nrepublicans, however, have to convince the already skeptical american electorate that their victory will benefit them. polls, including a cnn survey released earlier this week, find the plan is unpopular with a majority of american voters, given it is seen by most as benefiting the wealthy over middle class americans. republicans are confident the plan will get more popular over time as americans see more money in their paychecks.\n\nthe highest profile test of trump's clout came in alabama earlier this month, where republican roy moore surprisingly lost a us senate race to democrat doug jones, the first time the ruby-red state has elected a democrat in two decades. republicans have argued that moore, who was accused of sexual impropriety by multiple women near the end of the campaign, was a unique candidate, but the loss has some republicans girding for a difficult 2018.\n\nrepublican campaign committees in washington, while welcoming of trump's support, are also somewhat skeptical of his ability to help in a cadre of swing districts and states where the president's policies will loom over any republican running.\n\nthat dynamic could set up an awkward dance for republicans, where the eager president could be pushing his aides for more involvement in races where he isn't necessarily wanted.\n\nwhere will trump help?\n\nstepien told cnn that trump is willing to deal with the political realities of 2018, even if that means staying out of the way in some races.\n\nthe president is a very results-oriented president. he wants seats won, stepien said. there are obvious ways to help candidates. … there are less obvious ways to engage.\n\nthe primary senate and house republican campaign committees have so far cautiously approached trump's 2018 involvement.\n\nthere is a role for the president. he is the president and brings a lot of tangibles to the table, but it is really dependent on what every district needs, said a senior national republican congressional committee official, who added that the committee could see trump active in states like minnesota and pennsylvania.\n\na republican strategist with knowledge of national republican senatorial committee plans echoed that sentiment, arguing that while trump can play a pivotal role in key senate races, the white house and republican committees will have to work to determine where he is an asset and where he won't be.\n\nthe strategist highlighted trump's ability to help in montana, north dakota, west virginia, missouri and indiana – all states trump won in 2016 by double digits that have key senate races in 2018.\n\nleft unsaid, however, is that trump could hurt senate candidates in nevada and arizona, two states that could tip the balance of the senate in 2018.\n\nlongtime republican operatives were more direct in how the balancing act will affect republicans.\n\nin any administration there's a delicate balance between trying to distance yourself from the president and knowing that your opponent will never let you do so, said doug heye, a former communications director of the republican national committee. republicans certainly saw that in 2006, and are now preparing themselves for a similar reaction, albeit with increased democratic enthusiasm, next year.\n\nsurveys for prospective candidates\n\ntrump has signaled his eagerness by getting personally involved in the vetting and candidate recruitment phase of his administration's 2018 plans.\n\nhe has already begun to personally speak with prospective candidates, officials say.\n\nhe is very eager, said one senior white house official. he wants to deliver on what he talked about in 2016. electing more republicans in november is the way to do that.\n\ntrump's team has interviewed over 100 prospective trump-backed candidates and plans to send each a survey to gauge how well they match up ideologically with the president.\n\nthe surveys, according to the senior official, are broad and open-ended questionnaires where each republican hopeful is expected to detail their views on a host of issues, from trump's plan for a border wall to their views on efforts to repeal obamacare.\n\nwe leave it fairly open ended, one official said of the questionnaire, which was first reported by the washington post. we want to know how seriously these candidates are going to take these endeavors and these exercises. are they responsive? do they put time into it? those are all important things, almost as important as how closely they align with the president.\n\nthe surveys will go out throughout 2018, the official added, and could change as issue areas important to the white house change.\n\nhistory is working against trump\n\nall this work is an effort to buck a historic trend: a president's party often takes a beating at the ballot box in the first midterm election after they take control of the white house.\n\npolling is working against trump, too. a cnn poll released tuesday found that trump has the lowest approval rating of any modern president at the end of their first year in office, with 35% of american approving of his handling of the job.\n\npresident barack obama lost 63 seats in the house and six in the senate in 2010, president bill clinton lost 54 seats in the house and eight seats in senate in 1994 and president george bush lost 31 seats in the house and six in the senate in 2006 (his first, in 2002, was an anomaly given how close the election was to the september 11, 2001, terrorist attacks).\n\nafterward, all presidents were forced to confront the reckoning.\n\nin a news conference after the 1994 election, clinton admitted that democrats were held accountable for their governing. obama, likewise, had to be careful about where he campaigned during his time in office and was given a shellacking – as he put it – in the 2010 midterms.\n\nso far, white house officials have argued the midterms will not be a referendum on trump.\n\ni think it is the referendum on the people whose names are on the ballot, and that's congress, stepien said. i think voters voiced a lot of frustration this year about the lack of progress in congress in passing the president's agenda that they voted for overwhelmingly just a year ago.\n\nthe outside (adviser) factor\n\nanother factor for republicans when figuring out trump's involvement: former white house chief strategist steve bannon.\n\nbannon, a self-fashioned kingmaker in conservative politics, has made it clear that he intends to be active during the midterms. while he has kept most of his focus on the senate – he campaigned twice for moore in alabama - a source close to bannon says he intends to be active in house races next year.\n\nafter speaker ryan pulled out of a fund-raiser for rep. lee zeldin of new york due to zeldin's opposition to the tax bill, bannon joined with other trump-aligned republicans to raise, according to organizers, around $100,000. the source close to bannon says the former white house aide expects to do more of that for people steve thinks will prosecute the president's agenda.\n\nbut bannon's political compass has some republicans worried. many say his backing of moore – even after multiple women accused the judge of sexual impropriety when they were in their teens and moore was in his 30s – shows a hubris that needs to be checked. and they worry that trump, who listens to bannon, could be backed into bad decisions because of the former white house aide's confidence.
the trump administration plans to spend 90% less on advertising to get people to sign up for obamacare than former president obama did last year.\n\nthe administration will spend $10 million on promotions during open enrollment season this fall, compared to $100 million a year ago, the centers for medicare & medicaid services, which administers obamacare, said thursday. it will focus on radio and digital ads, as well as email to existing enrollees.\n\nat the same time, it is cutting funding for so-called navigators -- who help people sign up for coverage -- by 41%. the 98 navigator groups will receive a total of $37 million for the coming enrollment season.\n\nwith congress' effort to repeal and replace obamacare on hold, all eyes are on whether the trump administration will work to stabilize or undermine the health reform law. president trump has repeatedly said obamacare is dead. he has raised questions about whether he will try to dismantle the law by discontinuing funding for a key set of subsidies or weakening enforcement of the individual mandate.\n\nanother wild card is how the administration will handle open enrollment, which this year will run from november 1 through december 15 -- half the length that it did under obama, who actively promoted the sign-up period. trump officials had been largely silent about their plans until now, though they have repeatedly said the law is failing americans.\n\nthe administration justified the budget cuts by saying it was basing advertising on effectiveness and performance. democrats and obamacare supporters quickly decried the move as sabotage.\n\nrelated: hickenlooper: health care reform should be 'trans-partisan'\n\ncms officials pointed to the fact that the agency spent about $100 million last year and 9.2 million people signed up for coverage through the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, for 2017.\n\nin 2015, the agency spent $51.2 million and 9.6 million americans bought policies. officials stressed that there was a 42% decline in first-time enrollees.\n\nthe administration is also revamping the navigator program after more than three-quarters of the grantees failed to achieve their enrollment goals, officials said. this fall, navigators will receive funding based on their meeting their targets. for instance, a grantee that enrolls only 30% of its goal will receive no more than 30% of its funding from the previous year.\n\nnavigators signed up roughly 81,500 people in 2016.\n\njudging effectiveness by the amount of money spent and not the results achieved is irresponsible and unhelpful to the american people, said caitlin oakley, press secretary for the department of health and human services. a health care system that has caused premiums to double and left nearly half of our counties with only one coverage option is not working. the trump administration is determined to serve the american people instead of trying to sell them a bad deal.\n\nrelated: actually, obamacare will be available everywhere in 2018\n\nadvertising and outreach, however, are seen as critical to maintaining and boosting obamacare enrollment. in fact, a bipartisan coalition of governors -- led by republican governor john kasich of ohio and democratic governor john hickenlooper of colorado -- on wednesday urged the administration to continue to fund outreach and enrollment efforts.\n\nin particular, it helps attract young and healthy consumers who may not feel they need coverage. the sick, who are eager to secure insurance, are more likely to know where to sign up.\n\ncutting aca outreach will result in fewer people insured, and those who fail to sign up will be the healthiest. that will push premiums up. — larry levitt (@larry_levitt) august 31, 2017\n\nthis is not the first time the trump administration has pulled advertising for obamacare. it halted up to $5 million worth of ads just days after taking office in january. the campaign was intended to alert consumers to the end of the 2017 sign-up period on january 31. outreach is considered critical in the final days of the enrollment period to remind consumers -- particularly younger ones -- of the deadline. sign ups typically surge during this time.
benjamin jealous is a visiting scholar at the annenberg school for communication at the university of pennsylvania and a board member at pigeonly.com . he is the former national president and ceo of the naacp. he resides in maryland and was his state's 2018 democratic nominee for governor. the views expressed in this commentary are his own. view more opinion on cnn.\n\n(cnn) nearly 30 years ago, i met stacey abrams at a training for student organizers hosted by the a. philip randolph institute, an organization for african american trade unionists. i had just been suspended by columbia university for protesting the university's plans to turn the audubon ballroom, where malcolm x was shot to death, into a biomedical research facility. and abrams was on her way to becoming student body president of spelman college.\n\ncoming of age and eager to make a difference, we were brimming with hopeful visions of a level playing field for all americans. i believed in her ambition to create a more just and equitable society in the south, and that is exactly what i have had the privilege to witness over the last three decades. as an activist, attorney and formidable political leader, she has proven time and time again her ability to break barriers for others.\n\nand it's time for abrams to break one more barrier — as joe biden's vice-presidential candidate. she has many of the strengths that can help biden win in november, including popularity among key democratic constituencies: progressives, young voters and voters of color — and the data backs it up\n\nbut abrams has something more — a determination to get the job done, no matter what challenges may stand in her way. and given the stakes of the 2020 election, that tenacity will be a quality critical to winning back the white house in november\n\nas the youngest president in the history of the naacp, i understand what it means to be underestimated for a job — and i know there are many who may doubt if abrams is capable of taking on the vice-presidential task. after all, when there is no precedent for your power, no figure in authority to emulate, it becomes difficult for others to accept the legitimacy of your capability.\n\nhowever, for abrams, these barriers have often been present, and not once did they stand in her way. for example, i saw firsthand how effective she was as the georgia house democratic leader, and i might add, the first woman to lead a party in either house of the georgia legislature.\n\ni saw how abrams harnessed the power of labor unions and generous donors to train and hire low-income rural georgians to sign one another up for obamacare when her state refused to accept the federal funds for medicaid expansion. whenever those in power refused to act, abrams was on the ground with everyday georgians working to ensure that their communities had the care and resources to get ahead and stay ahead. and there is no doubt she would adopt a similar approach at the national level, too.\n\nbut abrams also brings something to politics that is often lacking — creative approaches to complex challenges, and given the current pandemic crisis we are facing, we need her creative thinking, now more than ever.\n\nstacey abrams and benjamin jealous\n\nbut abrams has another key quality for high office — when she sees injustice, she takes action. in the wake of allegations of rampant voter suppression plaguing the 2018 election and the silencing of georgians across their state, abrams flexed her executive repertoire by building an 18-state voter protection network, fair fight 2020 , that is wholly unprecedented in democratic politics. abrams has worked with federal, state and local leaders to build up the organization, raise millions of dollars to finance the efforts in georgia and nationally, and anticipate gop suppression tactics.\n\nshe has created a national organization, fair count , to target hard-to-count voters in the 2020 census. fair count is operating in multiple states and works in partnership with groups preparing for redistricting. and on top of an ever-expanding portfolio of service, abrams launched a 12-state policy initiative, the southern economic advancement project, that is helping bring progressive policy and implementation strategies to the south. in short, she knew even if she could not become governor, that there was still work that needed to be done — and now she is doing just that.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter. join us on twitter and facebook\n\nmy confidence in abrams is not a dig on any other potential pick for vice president, but a recognition that leadership and experience can be gained in more than one way — and that the proof is not just a glossy cover letter, but the tangible results of hard work in communities across the country.\n\ni would be remiss if i did not mention a former president who was counted out and dismissed because he only had a short stint in the senate on his side — and minimal management history — but his dramatic success shows that sometimes titles and lines on a resume are not the most predictive metric. former president barack obama changed the calculation of what it means to be day-one ready, and a vice president abrams would do just the same. abrams may not look like the traditional candidate, but to accomplish what she has in the south and across the country, she had to buck tradition.

source: cnn gop panelist: market plunge doesn't mean economy is bad\n\n'crumbs'\n\ntrump also signaled that a comment by house democratic leader nancy pelosi that bonuses given to some workers by corporations were crumbs compared to the huge windfall their employers have reaped through the tax cut, will be a hook for the entire gop campaign.\n\nrepublicans appear to believe they have a rhetorical gem comparable to hillary clinton's notorious reference to trump supporters as deplorables that animated the 2016 election campaign.\n\ni really think her statement 'crumbs' will be equivalent. i think this is not a good day for nancy pelosi, she is our secret weapon, trump said.\n\nin the electoral context, it doesn't matter that the remark by pelosi at a press conference in washington has been ripped out of context.\n\nin the same way as trump's bold claims about the economy often exaggerate reality, pelosi's remark will serve as a thematic talking point for trump's attempts to fire up the voters who helped him win the white house as he battles to safeguard republican majorities in congress in november.\n\nwhat else can go wrong?\n\neven if the economy is still doing well: the many other complications of trump as president, including the russia probe, his own unpredictable behavior, and even a possible looming war on the korean peninsula could emerge as dominant themes and help democrats.\n\nin many ways, 2018 could be the ultimate test of the mantra that in elections it's the economy, stupid, a theme first voiced by bill clinton's 1992 campaign.\n\nwhile trump is a strong performer on the stump, and wants to throw himself into campaigning for the gop majority in the midterms, a few moments in monday's appearance showed why some vulnerable republicans in swing districts might want to keep him at arms' length.\n\nhis comment that pelosi and her senate counterpart chuck schumer were treasonous because they didn't clap his state of the union address might have delighted voters who flocked to trump because of his refusal to bow to political correctness.\n\nbut they also overshadowed the rest of the speech, could fan doubts among independent voters who worry about his temperament and are sure to give democrats yet another reason to go out in november to vote against him.\n\n03:01 - source: cnn trump touts economy as stock market plunges\n\nwhat 2018 means for 2020\n\nand there were signs in trump's speech that he has the jitters about how things could turn out in november, as democrats eye an unexpectedly strong showing in the senate and have genuine hopes of seizing the house, a scenario that could potentially present trump with an impeachment drama down the road.\n\nhe mused on the unfortunate history of first-term presidents and midterm elections, suggesting that voters who saw the gains of a big presidential election win suddenly became complacent only two years later.\n\nthe people are happy, and they don't get out, and they don't vote like they should. maybe they go to a movie in '18, trump told his supporters.\n\nthey sit back and then they get clobbered, because the other people are desperate, and they get out and they have more energy, he said, arguing that his tremendous success made him even more vulnerable to such a fate.\n\nin another stream of consciousness digression, trump suddenly started pondering his prospects in his own re-election race, wondering what a bad showing in november would portend for his hopes of a second term.\n\ni know we are going to do great in '20 because by that time – see what happens is, if you did badly in '18, now you're all angry again, and your going 'why?' but we want to do great in '18 and we're going to do really well in 20. that's when we go again and keep this great journey going, ok?
(cnn) president joe biden is reopening enrollment on the federal affordable care act exchanges as part of two health care executive actions that he signed thursday, taking a step to help uninsured americans that former president donald trump rejected.\n\nit's biden's first move toward delivering on his campaign promise to bolster the landmark health reform law that he championed as vice president. and it comes as more americans could be facing the loss of coverage because of the pandemic-fueled economic downturn.\n\ntoday, i'm about to sign two executive orders that basically, the best way to describe them, to undo the damage trump has done, biden said. there's nothing new that we are doing here other than restoring the affordable care act and restoring medicaid to the way it was before trump became president.\n\nopen enrollment on the federal exchanges, which the trump administration cut in half to six weeks, ended on december 15. but biden has the power to reopen sign-ups, which will allow the uninsured to select policies under a special enrollment period.\n\nbiden's order calls on the department of health and human services to reopen enrollment on healthcare.gov, which serves 36 states, to those who need coverage from february 15 until may 15. the agency did so on thursday.\n\nas we continue to battle covid-19, it's even more critical that americans have meaningful access to health care, biden said.\n\ntrump refused to take this step last year, despite heavy lobbying from elected officials of both parties and the health care industry. eleven states that run their own obamacare exchanges, along with the district of columbia, allowed their uninsured residents to obtain coverage outside the usual time frame. most, if not all, are also expected to reopen their enrollment, a white house official said.\n\nsoon after the president signed the executive order, california announced it would open its exchange from february 1 to may 15.\n\nthursday's executive orders focus on health care. biden also signed measures aimed at strengthening medicaid, as well as rescinding the so-called mexico city policy -- which bans the us government from funding foreign nonprofits that perform or promote abortions -- and reviewing the title x abortion referral restrictions.\n\nbiden has turned to executive actions in his first days in office to swiftly start putting in place his agenda and to wipe out that of his predecessor.\n\nreversing trump administration directives\n\nas part of thursday's executive measures, biden is directing federal agencies to reexamine a multitude of actions taken by his predecessor.\n\nhe changed and made more inaccessible, more expensive and more difficult for people to qualify for either of those two items, the affordable care act or medicaid, he continued.\n\nthese include policies that weaken protections for people with preexisting conditions and that undermine the obamacare exchanges or other health insurance markets.\n\nhe also wants agencies to review measures that make it more difficult to enroll in medicaid and the affordable care act and that reduce affordability or financial assistance, including for dependents.\n\nand the president is asking agencies to look at affordable care act and medicaid waivers and demonstration projects that the trump administration approved or put in place that may reduce coverage or undermine the programs, including work requirements.\n\nthe agencies will also consider whether additional actions are needed to strengthen and protect access to health care.\n\naugmenting the affordable care act\n\nincreasing the number of insured americans by strengthening the affordable care act was at the heart of biden's health care campaign promises. however, his two main measures -- creating a government-run public option and increasing obamacare's federal premium subsidies -- will require congress and face plenty of opposition.\n\nthe president included a proposal to boost affordable care act subsidies so that consumers don't pay more than 8.5% of their income for coverage in his $1.9 trillion relief package , which is already facing hurdles on capitol hill.\n\nreopening enrollment is a much easier lift, though it's unclear how much impact it will have.\n\nanyone who loses job-based health insurance coverage is already eligible to sign up on the exchanges within 60 days of becoming uninsured. enrollment in the first five months of 2020 jumped 46% compared to the same period the year before, the trump administration said in june.\n\nalso, more people have appeared to hold on to job-based coverage than expected, while those who have lost their employment and most of their income have turned to medicaid. between february and august, medicaid enrollment jumped by more than 5.8 million people, or 9.1%, according to federal data released in late december.\n\nduring the most recent open enrollment period, overall obamacare sign-ups for 2021 coverage increased when comparing the 36 states participating on the federal exchange both this year and last year -- the only time that happened under trump. but the number of new consumers for 2021 slid somewhat.\n\nnearly 9 uninsured million people could get free or subsidized bronze plans on the affordable care act exchanges during a special enrollment period, according to a kaiser family foundation analysis released wednesday. bronze plans typically have lower premiums, but higher deductibles and out-of-pocket costs.\n\na total of about 15 million uninsured people could shop for coverage on the exchanges, kaiser said.\n\nmaking the changes work\n\nthe key to reopening enrollment will be publicizing it and providing help for people to sign up, according to a recent kaiser discussion with navigators who assist those looking for coverage on the exchanges. they also say the period should last more than six weeks.\n\nthe trump administration slashed advertising by 90% and deeply cut funding for enrollment assistance -- two measures biden is expected to reverse. unspent revenue from exchange user fees appears to have accumulated to more than $1 billion over fiscal years 2018 to 2020, according to kaiser.\n\njust over half of consumers who looked for coverage during the open enrollment period for 2020 coverage encountered difficulties, and nearly 5 million folks sought in-person help but couldn't get it, according to a kaiser family foundation analysis released monday.\n\nthe centers for medicare and medicaid services, which runs the federal exchange, said thursday that it will spend $50 million on outreach and education, including advertisements on broadcast and digital platforms. the agency also will conduct an outreach campaign with community groups to raise awareness of the new opportunity to enroll in english, spanish and other languages.\n\nthe outreach budget for healthcare.gov was slashed dramatically during the prior administration, the white house official said. so folks who were uninsured weren't really given the opportunity to learn about the ability to get coverage. that's what we're aiming to rectify during this special enrollment period.\n\nmany health care moves expected\n\nthursday's measures will likely be the first of many efforts to bolster the affordable care act and roll back trump administration health care actions.\n\namong biden's top priorities will likely be saving the law itself from being declared unconstitutional by the supreme court. the justices are currently considering a case brought of a coalition of republican state attorneys general -- and backed by the trump administration. it revolves around congress reducing the penalty for not having health insurance to zero several years ago, which the states argue rendered the individual mandate unconstitutional and the entire law invalid.\n\nthe case will continue even if the justice department under biden withdraws, because it originated with texas and other republican-led states. but the president could work with the new democratic majority in congress to short circuit the gop states' legal argument -- by setting the penalty at a $1, for instance.\n\nbiden's executive measures will also likely lead to the reversal of various measures the trump administration put in place to chip away at the affordable care act. these include broadening the duration of short-term health plans to a year, and, more recently, allowing georgia to stop using the federal exchange , healthcare.gov, and shift to a private sector model instead. the centers for medicare and medicaid services went a step further in recent weeks, establishing a pathway for all states to do this for 2023.\n\nbiden's health care officials are also expected to focus on medicaid.\n\nthe supreme court recently agreed to consider the approval of work requirements in arkansas and new hampshire, which were voided by lower courts.\n\nthese measures run counter to biden's promise to expand access to medicaid so his administration will likely seek to limit or undo these waivers during his term, as well as possibly restore the criteria on waivers' impact on increasing coverage.\n\nthe department of health and human services is expected to take a very close look at the approvals involving work requirements, based on thursday's executive order, the white house official said.\n\nalso, congress has limited states' ability to trim their medicaid rolls during the public health emergency. the biden administration may want to continue some of those provisions after it ends.\n\nthis story has been updated with additional developments.
we counted at least 14 false claims in our first dive into the transcript, plus four claims that were lacking some important context.\n\nthe numbers might well rise as we delve deeper, but here's the preliminary list:\n\nhunter biden's career\n\ntrump claimed that, before democratic presidential candidate joe biden's son hunter biden was appointed to the board of directors of ukrainian natural gas company burisma holdings, hunter biden didn't have a job.\n\nbefore joe biden became vice president in 2009, hunter biden, a lawyer who graduated from yale law school, worked as a lobbyist. he became a partner at a law and lobbying firm in 2001. (he stopped lobbying late in the 2008 election.) before that, he had worked for financial services company mbna, rising to senior vice president and worked for the us commerce department.\n\nnone of this is to say that hunter biden's name was not a factor in the burisma appointment; hunter biden has acknowledged that he would probably not have been asked to be on the board if he were not a biden. but trump's repeat portrayal of him as a pitiful unemployed man is inaccurate.\n\nunemployment in pennsylvania and scranton\n\ntrump claimed that this area of pennsylvania, and pennsylvania itself, has the best numbers it's ever had. it's got the best economy it's ever had. it has the best unemployment numbers it's ever had. and scranton has the lowest and best unemployment numbers they've -- and employment numbers too -- that they've ever had, by far.\n\nfacts first: neither the unemployment rate for pennsylvania nor the unemployment rate for the scranton area is at its lowest level ever. and both rates have crept higher over the past several months.\n\nthe pennsylvania state unemployment rate was at 4.5% in december 2019, worse than the best rates under presidents bill clinton and george w. bush. (the rate increased steadily in 2019 from the 3.8% rate in of april, may and june, which was the state's lowest rate since at least 1976.)\n\nthe december 2019 unemployment rate for the scranton/wilkes-barre/hazleton area was 5.6% -- worse than various rates under clinton and bush and also worse than the rate in obama's last full month in office, 5.4% in december 2016. it hit 4.0% in april 2019, which was the lowest for the area since at least 1990.)\n\nthe coronavirus\n\ntrump claimed, we got hit with the virus really three weeks ago, if you think about it, i guess. that's when we first started really to see some possible effects.\n\nfacts first: the us had its : the us had its first confirmed case of the coronavirus on january 21, more than six weeks before trump spoke here, so it's not true that the us had not really seen even some possible effects until three weeks ago.\n\nobama and coronavirus testing\n\ntrump repeated his claim that he had reversed an obama-era decision that had somehow impeded testing for the coronavirus, saying, they made some decisions which were not good decisions. we inherited decisions that they made, and that's fine ... we undid some of the regulations that were made that made it very difficult, but i'm not blaming anybody.\n\nfacts first: there is no regulation from president barack obama that impeded coronavirus testing. the obama administration did put forward a draft proposal related to lab testing, but it was never implemented. when asked what obama administration decision trump might be referring to, peter kyriacopolous, chief policy officer at the association of public health laboratories, said: we aren't sure what rule is being referenced. dr. joshua sharfstein, who was principal deputy commissioner of the fda under obama and is now professor of the practice at johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health, said, there wasn't a policy that was put into place that inhibited them. there was no obama policy they were reversing.\n\nobama and kim jong un\n\ntrump claimed obama called north korean leader kim jong un many times but kim jong un did not want to talk to him. and me, he wanted to talk to.\n\nfacts first: there is no evidence that obama called kim even once. this is a total fabrication, susan rice, who served as obama's national security adviser, : there is no evidence that obama called kim even once. this is a total fabrication, susan rice, who served as obama's national security adviser, said on twitter in response to a previous version of this trump claim. there's also no evidence for trump's previous claim that obama begged kim for a meeting.\n\nan lng plant in louisiana\n\ntrump claimed i opened up lng plants in louisiana where companies had been unable to get permits for for 10, 12, 14 years and longer. he said, i got them built, a $10 billion plant in louisiana.\n\nfacts first: the $10 billion lng facility trump visited in louisiana in 2019 was : the $10 billion lng facility trump visited in louisiana in 2019 was granted its key permits under obama , and its construction also began under obama. federal regulators have approved other multi-billion-dollar lng facilities for louisiana under trump, but they had not been waiting anywhere close to 10 or 14 years for approval.\n\nthe whistleblower\n\ntrump called the whistleblower who complained about his dealings with ukraine a phony whistleblower and claimed this person had described a call that didn't exist.\n\nfacts first: the whistleblower's account of trump's july call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky has been proven substantially accurate. in fact, the rough transcript trump released showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. you can read a full fact check : the whistleblower's account of trump's july call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky has been proven substantially accurate. in fact, the rough transcript trump released showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. you can read a full fact check here\n\ncourt vacancies\n\ntrump claimed president barack obama left him 142 openings on the courts, in part because senate majority leader mitch mcconnell -- who thwarted many of obama's judicial nominees -- did a great job.\n\nfacts first: this is trump's usual exaggerated figure. there were 104 court vacancies on january 1, 2017, 19 days before trump took office, according to : this is trump's usual exaggerated figure. there were 104 court vacancies on january 1, 2017, 19 days before trump took office, according to russell wheeler , a visiting fellow at the brookings institution who tracks judicial appointments.\n\nthe history of court vacancies\n\ntrump claimed that normally, presidents are left no court vacancies at all; if you have one, he said, it's lucky.\n\nfacts first: it is standard for presidents to inherit dozens of vacancies. : it is standard for presidents to inherit dozens of vacancies. according to wheeler , there were 53 vacancies on january 1, 2009, just before obama took office; 80 vacancies on january 1, 2001, just before george w. bush took office; 107 vacancies on january 1, 1993, just before bill clinton took office.\n\nthe mexican border\n\ntrump claimed that we have right now 27,000 mexican soldiers on our border.\n\nfacts first: mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the us border in particular; mexico's defense minister : mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the us border in particular; mexico's defense minister said in october that it was about 15,000 on the us border, about 12,000 on mexico's own southern border.\n\nthe soviet union and afghanistan\n\ntalking about the history of war in afghanistan, trump claimed the soviet union became russia because of afghanistan.\n\nfacts first: this was an exaggeration. experts : this was an exaggeration. experts say the soviet union's failed afghanistan war was far from the only reason for its collapse, though the war did contribute.\n\npre-existing conditions\n\ntrump claimed that pre-existing conditions, 100%, we take care of.\n\nfacts first: trump administration has repeatedly supported : trump administration has repeatedly supported bills that would weaken obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. trump is currently supporting a republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of obamacare void. he has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds, though he promised again at the town hall that republicans would have one.\n\ntariffs on china\n\ntrump claimed, china is paying us billions and billions of dollars because of what i did to them with tariffs.\n\nfacts first: study after study has shown that americans are bearing the vast majority of the cost of the tariffs. and it is americans who make the actual tariff payments.\n\nair quality\n\ntrump said he wants the us to have the world's cleanest air and water, then claimed, our conditions now are much better than they were three years ago.\n\nfacts first: by several : by several measures , us air was cleaner under obama than it has been under trump. three of the six types of pollutants identified by the clean air act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before trump took office, according to environmental protection agency data. there were more unhealthy air days for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016, and researchers from carnegie mellon university who studied environmental protection agency data found that air pollution increased between 2016 and 2018.\n\nhere are some claims that were not flat false but were lacking some key context:\n\nthe visa lottery\n\nasked about illegal immigration, trump brought up loopholes like how they pick lotteries, and they have people coming into our country.\n\nfacts first: trump was vague here, but he suggested -- as he has previously claimed explicitly -- that it is foreign countries, they, who conduct lotteries for immigration to the us. the lottery for us green cards is : trump was vague here, but he suggested -- as he has previously claimed explicitly -- that it is foreign countries, they, who conduct lotteries for immigration to the us. the lottery for us green cards is conducted by the us state department , not by other governments.\n\nsouthwest border apprehensions\n\nspeaking about immigration, trump said that it has now been nine or 10 months where the numbers are way down.\n\nfacts first: after : after eight consecutive months of declines , the number of border patrol arrests on the southern border increased from 29,200 in january to 30,068 in february, the government confirmed earlier in the day of trump's town hall. the numbers are still down from last year, and the announcement of the increase was only hours old, so we'll give trump some leeway.\n\nthe military and ammunition\n\ntrump told a story about how the military was so depleted under obama and biden that a general advised him against some sort of military action because we have no ammunition.\n\nfacts first: we don't know what a general may or may not have told trump, but it's clearly not true that the world's most powerful military had no ammunition at any point under obama or trump. according to military officials, there was a shortfall in certain kinds of munitions, particularly precision-guided bombs, late in the obama presidency and early in the trump presidency. it has never been clear how dire the shortfall was. you can read a full fact check : we don't know what a general may or may not have told trump, but it's clearly not true that the world's most powerful military had no ammunition at any point under obama or trump. according to military officials, there was a shortfall in certain kinds of munitions, particularly precision-guided bombs, late in the obama presidency and early in the trump presidency. it has never been clear how dire the shortfall was. you can read a full fact check here\n\na gallup poll\n\ntrump touted a gallup poll in which he said he was given tremendous marks for his handling of the coronavirus.\n\nfacts first: the : the poll was positive for trump, as 77% percent of respondents in that poll did say they had confidence in the federal government's ability to handle a coronavirus outbreak. but here's some important context: the poll did not ask about trump in particular. the poll asked about confidence in the government's future acts, not about its actual work to date and, critically, it was conducted from february 3-16, when there were far fewer reported cases and trump was still, at minimum, 10 days away from appointing vice president mike pence as his point man on the response.\n\nthis story has been updated to include an additional claim by trump about obama and coronavirus testing.
washington (cnn) the supreme court cleared the way monday for insurers to sue in order to collect some $12 billion in obamacare payments.\n\nin an 8-1 opinion penned by justice sonia sotomayor, the court said that congress created a rare money-mandating obligation requiring the federal government to make payments under the law.\n\nthese holdings reflect a principle as old as the nation itself: the government should honor its obligations, sotomayor wrote.\n\nin the early days of the affordable care act, insurers agreed to offer lower premiums to encourage participation in health care exchanges because the law guaranteed partial reimbursement for their losses. but the payments never came after congress, then controlled by republicans, ultimately declined to appropriate the money.\n\ninsurers initially had a tough time setting premiums on the obamacare exchanges since they didn't know how sick their new customers would be. many miscalculated in the early years, racking up billions in losses.\n\nread more
the trump administration is giving insurers a few more weeks to revise their obamacare rate requests for 2018.\n\nthe final filing date is now september 5, rather than august 16.\n\nmore time, however, is unlikely to calm carriers' jitters. insurers want to know whether the trump administration will continue to fund a key set of obamacare subsidies and enforce the individual mandate. many are asking for big rate hikes or are exiting the market completely because of the uncertainty of the health reform law's future under the republicans.\n\ntrump has recently threatened to cut off the payments for the cost-sharing subsidies, which reduce deductibles and co-pays for lower-income enrollees. these payments, which go directly to insurers, are the subject of a court battle between the house of representatives and the trump administration, which inherited the case from the obama administration.\n\nif a new healthcare bill is not approved quickly, bailouts for insurance companies and bailouts for members of congress will end very soon! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) july 29, 2017\n\ncarriers that assumed the cost-sharing subsidy payments would be discontinued added between 2% to 23% to their premium requests for next year, according to a kaiser family foundation survey of 21 major cities released this week.\n\ninsurers that assumed the individual mandate would not be enforced requested an additional 1.2% to 20%. the mandate requires nearly all americans to get coverage or pay a penalty. it is key to drawing in younger and healthier consumers.\n\nrelated: trump-fueled uncertainty spurs obamacare insurers to leave, hike premiums\n\nthe two major industry lobbying groups either declined to comment or did not return an email requesting a response to the new deadline.\n\ninsurers have until september 27 to commit to participating in the exchanges next year. open enrollment starts november 1.

in houston, inside of tomorrow night's cnn republican debate and tuesday's primary. one of 13 primaries and caucuses being held march 1st, any or all of which donald trump now stands a good chance of winning. which would only add and it going bus that he could take it all after dealing his two main rivals across in blow last night in nevada, it was his third straight victory and fair to say it's shaken the republican party.\n\n\n\nin a moment, more of my conversation with donald trump, but first cnn white house correspondent jim acosta with a tour of the political landscape and political rumble.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\njim acosta, cnn senior white house correspondent: donald trump's first campaign event after his win in nevada says it all.\n\n\n\ndonald trump, (r) presidential candidate: thank you everybody.\n\n\n\nacosta: eyeing the bible belt states up for grabs on super tuesday next week, trump appealed to christian conservatives by sitting down with televangelist, pat robertson.\n\n\n\ntrump: you inspire us all.\n\n\n\nacosta: trump talked about forgiveness, perhaps even for his arch rival ted cruz, maybe.\n\n\n\ntrump: i can forgive every once in a while there will be something that went too far and over the last few weeks and, you know things were said that were lies. i've got to be a good person today, at least for the next hour or so.\n\n\n\nacosta: that trump isn't spending much time talking about his opponents. he's busy envisioning his days in the white house. the ultimate political outsider saying he would likely want a political insider as his vice president.\n\n\n\ntrump: i do want somebody that's political because i want to get lots of great legislation that we all want passed.\n\n\n\nacosta: and strong conservatives for the supreme court.\n\n\n\ntrump: pro-life.\n\n\n\npat robertson, televangelist: starts with that.\n\n\n\ntrump: that a very conservative, very, very smart. i mean like judge scalia he was a perfect representative.\n\n\n\nacosta: on day one of the trump administration, the gop front-runner vows he'll scrap obamacare, improve veteran's health care and end the president's executive actions to slow deportation of the undocumented.\n\n\n\ntrump: especially the one on the border where people are allowed to come in just pour into our country like swiss cheese.\n\n\n\nacosta: trump is heading in the super tuesday with a lead that is ballooning quickly with five times the number of delegates as his nearest rivals.\n\n\n\ntrump: the establishment, the media, the special interest, the lobbyists, the donors, they're all against me.\n\n\n\nacosta: trump is also warning a new ad, warning that d.c. establishment is out to get him. and he's making the case republicans should consider how he's expanding the party and get on board.\n\n\n\ntrump: we won with highly educated, we won with poorly educated. i really love the poorly educated. and you know what i really, i'm happy about because i've been saying it for a long time, 46 percent with the hispanics, 46 percent, number one with hispanics.\n\n\n\nacosta: the contenders vying to be the anti-trump insist the race is far from over.\n\n\n\nted cruz, (r) presidential candidate: we can't get this wrong. we can't be fooled by p.t. barnum. the time for the clowns and the acrobat's of the dancing bears has passed.\n\n\n\nacosta: cruz went back to delegate-rich texas to secure the endorsement of that state's popular governor. marco rubio is urging supporters to pick a candidate who can actually win in november.\n\n\n\nmarco rubio, (r) presidential candidate: we can just to like someone as angry.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nacosta: we maybe way to have but trump is not slowing down, his got a bunch of events lined up throughout the south and southwest to set a table for super tuesday next week and all of the early polls indicate trump has a chance to clean up and perhaps force some of his rivals out of the race. anderson?\n\n\n\ncooper: jim acosta, jim thanks very much. back with panel board gloria borger, david chalian, amanda carpenter, kevin madden, ana navarro and jeffrey lord. david chalian in terms the road ahead for donald trump, i mean the numbers look, just the delegate count looks very good.\n\n\n\ndavid chalian, cnn political director: yes, he's got a significant delegate lead right now and those are not easy to give up because especially between now and march 15th, everything is awarded on a proportional basis, so no matter - you know if he continues to win the contests with the kind of margins we have seen in new hampshire, south carolina and nevada now, he consistently builds up a bigger and bigger delegate lead and just makes it difficult for cruz or rubio or anyone else to sort of dig into that.\n\n\n\ncooper: and gloria at some point, somewhere along the way, ted cruz, any of his other opponents have to start winning somewhere. and it's not clear where that's going to be other than ...\n\n\n\ngloria borger, cnn cheif political analyst: they do.\n\n\n\ncooper: ... that's ted cruz in texas.\n\n\n\n[21:05:03] borger: cruz can say he wants something because he did, but marco rubio started out this campaign as everybody's second choice and seems to be finishing this so far as everybody's second choice. he's got to win somewhere. you can't become the establishment sort of candidate with all of these endorsements, but don't have -- you need voters, too.\n\n\n\nyou know, endorsements aren't enough and i think that's marco rubio's problem, which is why today, we see him more frontally taking on donald trump.\n\n\n\ngradually tip toeing into that arena. he understands now, i think, that he's got to start taking him on.\n\n\n\ncooper: well, what is the route forward for a cruz, for rubio, if there is one?\n\n\n\namanda carpenter, cnn political commentator: well, if you think the dynamics of this race has to change in some manners. something big has to happen before next tuesday from shift the momentum that donald trump is building in building.\n\n\n\ni mean, like david pointed out, next week on tuesday, there's going to be proportional delegates allocated if trump rolls and then goes into the next tuesday where it's winner take all states.\n\n\n\ntrump is going to swing like a guillotine and take everything up. so, i've been encouraging, you know, cruz last night and even online today to do something very bold, shift the way talks about.\n\n\n\nadopt some of donald trump's frankness in talking about issues, not in the lens of being conservative or ideological but just straight to the voters, because that's appealing right now. and as race to deal about adopting to what the voters want without mimicking the worst of his tactics.\n\n\n\nkevin madden, cnn political commentator: and it has to be a two-man race. i think that's one of the big problem is that this looks like a big stare down between ted cruz and marco rubio and who's going to be that person to take donald trump head on.\n\n\n\nand the only way to make that argument is to have somebody like ted cruz get upset in his own home state and then leave the rest of the calendar for marco rubio to go with donald trump. but ...\n\n\n\ncooper: somebody has to drop out.\n\n\n\nmadden: yeah. and that's -- it's a dream scenario for marco rubio, but it's hard to see it happening.\n\n\n\ncooper: but i mean, jeffrey, to donald trump's point, even if ted cruz drops out, he believes he would pick up a fair amount of ted cruz supporters.\n\n\n\njeffrey lord, cnn political commentator: that's right. i mean, i think that's reasonable to think that he will get that a lot of ted cruz supporters.\n\n\n\ni think i heard today that a new york congressman who had been supporting jeb bush endorsed donald trump today.\n\n\n\ncarpenter: yeah.\n\n\n\nlord: and that, i think, is that's definitely about that opponent. you just can't expect all of the bush people and all of the support for these other candidates to go, you know, behind marco rubio. i think some of them are going to go to donald trump.\n\n\n\nana navarro, cnn political commentator: look, i think one of the problems that marco rubio and ted cruz are having is that they are so bogged down in this intra-fight amongst themselves.\n\n\n\nit's now lasted very long time. it's gone on now for about two months. it's getting very exhausting, very repetitive. and it makes them look as wealthy candidates. in the mean time, you've got john kasich who has no plan to drop out, playing the role of mr. rogers.\n\n\n\nisn't it a beautiful day in the neighborhood, waiting for these two guys to kill each other off and be the last man standing. at some point, there is going to be one last man standing against donald trump.\n\n\n\nhe's going to be battered, bruised, maybe poverty stricken. but the question is, will it be in time to be able to take on donald trump?\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\nlord: one of the thing that's going to start to happen here very suddenly is, one of these people is going to start to think, well, maybe i can't win, but i better not overstep because i could be number two.\n\n\n\nthat's what happened with george h.w. bush and ronald reagan and finally ...\n\n\n\nborger: you mean marco rubio?\n\n\n\ncarpenter: i think there's a better chance of the third party going on.\n\n\n\nchalian: what they could possibly popped in my head?\n\n\n\nnavarro: i actually think there's less of a chance of a marco rubio or even a ted cruz being number two than maybe setting themselves up to be the next one in line which in the republican party has been an important notion.\n\n\n\nchalian: people do not end campaigns for any reason other than they run out of money. and i think that is completely true. and if you look at cruz ...\n\n\n\nnavarro: or fresh laundry.\n\n\n\nchalian: ... and john kasich right now, i just don't see anybody running out of money and not being able to go through at least to get to march 15th and those winners take all states.\n\n\n\nmadden: all right.\n\n\n\nchalian: so, i don't see anyway that this is going to be short circuited into a two-man race in the next two, three weeks.\n\n\n\nmadden: no, i think your right.\n\n\n\nborger: and the more they take on each other, cruz and rubio, the more they enlarge donald trump who sort of hovers above them and, you know, that's why you're going to see them start, or rubio start taking on trump.\n\n\n\nnavarro: you'll also going to see him start to take him on because, i think that for a lot of jeb bush donors and marco rubio is going after them and wants to appeal ...\n\n\n\nborger: right.\n\n\n\nnavarro: ... to some of those supporters.\n\n\n\nit's important to have a candidate and back a candidate who can and will take on donald trump.\n\n\n\ncooper: so tomorrow night at the cnn debate here in houston, did you anticipate that or do you anticipate more assaults on donald trump?\n\n\n\ncarpenter: yeah, i do. just because there's been so much pressure on both ted cruz and marco rubio to stop fighting each other and take on donald trump.\n\n\n\ni think ted cruz and marco rubio will be competing to see who could take a stronger stand against donald trump.\n\n\n\nbecause what this is really all about, who can stop trump? who will the donors get behind and give them the money and say, this is our guy. this is our best chance going forward.\n\n\n\nchalian: amanda.\n\n\n\n[21:10:09] cooper: kevin, have donors been giving money to run ads against trump? i mean, doesn't seem like really ...\n\n\n\nmadden: well, if you talk to folks in both camps, probably cruz and rubio camps, they'll tell you that the money is coming in, that they feel that they have enough of the resources that they need to go on and take donald trump on.\n\n\n\nand i think tomorrow night, there will be enough attacks to go around.\n\n\n\ncarpenter: yeah.\n\n\n\nmadden: but i think it's very clear that i believe that one of these campaigns has to come to the conclusion that the way to consolidate, that anti-trump or to become the alternative is to show that your best position to take donald trump on and finally start making some -- making some progress.\n\n\n\ncooper: but right now, cruz and rubio are both arguing that. i mean, they're both arguing that they're the ones ...\n\n\n\nmadden: i think the best way to take it on is not to, not to play bumper cars with cruz and rubio ...\n\n\n\ncooper: right.\n\n\n\nmadden: ... but is to point the boat directly into the wind of donald trump and take him on.\n\n\n\nnavarro: and actually cruz has been doing it a lot more forcefully the last several weeks. and rubio has i believe that's going to change and then may start changing tomorrow.\n\n\n\nlord: i have -- at this point, donald trump has had everything including the kitchen sink thrown at him. i'm honestly not sure what more can be said in one of these debates that's going to hurt him.\n\n\n\ncooper: we -- gloria and david stick around. i want to get there take in a moment on senate republicans fighting any obama supreme court appointee and what the president can do about it.\n\n\n\nand also next my -- more on my conversation with donald trump, covered a lot of ground including that questions of his taxes and when the public will get or look at them if they will.\n\n\n\n(begin audio clip)\n\n\n\ntrump: and i have many, many companies. i have, you know, tremendously, you know, i have a very complex system of taxes. and frankly, i get audited every single year. but we'll make a determination over the next couple of months. it's very complicated.\n\n\n\n(end audio clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: and later, gary tuchman goes to texas-mexico border talking to voters there about the issue that trump has made such a big part of his campaign.\n\n\n\nwe'll be back in a moment.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[21:15:33] cooper: as the candidates get ready for tomorrow night's cnn republican debate here in houston with all eyes on donald trump. we had a chance to talk with them late today. we spoke quite awhile about quite a lot form primary wins to vice presidential pits to his taxes whether he is going to release them. here is some of the moment.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: mr. donald congratulations. an enormous win last night in nevada you're third in a row beating your opponents nearly every category. do you see the race of the nomination ending sooner than maybe a lot of pundits predicted?\n\n\n\ntrump: well, i don't see is going to the convention. i think we're doing very well.\n\n\n\ncooper: compare to senator cruz i mean you've been pretty modest in going after senator rubio. i just want to get your reaction to something that rubio said this morning about your in nevada. i'm going to play a sound bite from him.\n\n\n\nrubio: the majority of republican voters in this country do not want donald trump to be the nominee. i think that's been pretty clear. now, the problem is that they are divided up among four people.\n\n\n\ncooper: do you buy that argument that it's the fact that there's a divided field going against you that is allowing you to win?\n\n\n\ntrump: no, i don't. because actually i think i would do every well with, you know, one on one. i'd almost like that. it would really be a simplification. you know, when you get up to 46 and 47 percent and that's in a five-person field. so that's a very, very high position. and, you know, i laugh at the pundits when they say, well, you know, if you add on all of the rest, it's 53. well, when people leave, i pick up a lot of votes.\n\n\n\ncooper: you're gearing up obviously for the cnn debate tomorrow night in houston. what do you see as senator rubio's biggest vulnerability?\n\n\n\ntrump: well, i think i'll save that for tomorrow night. so we have to keep some good action for tomorrow night. but, we'll, you know, we'll be totally prepared. and, you know, people have not done very well against me. so far everybody that's attacked me has gone down.\n\n\n\ncooper: you talked about also winning the 44 percent of the latino vote last night. obviously there are some polling experts who point out there were so few people involved in the caucus in terms of latinos the win for you represents about one-half of 1 percentage of the entire latino population in nevada. are you planning to make more of an outreach to latinos, to african-americans?\n\n\n\ntrump: well, i think so. i mean and i don't when you say one half of 1 percent, i don't know what that represents. i can say that we got 46 percent of the latino vote or the hispanic vote, and that was far more than anybody else in the field. and that's pretty good, i think.\n\n\n\nyou know, now obviously, it's not the whole nation but it's what we had to deal with. we were dealing with that area and we got 46 percent of the vote. and i think that's indicative of the nation, actually.\n\n\n\ncooper: you've been asked when you'll release your tax returns on monday you said you'd do it, at some point. just today your probably know mitt romney said, i think there's reason to believe there's a bombshell in trump's taxes. now, we should point out, and mitt romney refused to release his taxes for quite a while. he ultimately did. but, why not just put it out there?\n\n\n\ntrump: well, because by return they're extremely complex and i'll make a determination at the right time. i mean no rush to do it. nobody is bringing it up except to mitt romney and the reason he brings it up is that he lost in the last election and lost very badly. that many, many companies.\n\n\n\ni have, you know, tremendously, you know, i have a very complex system of taxes. and, frankly i get order that every single year. but, we'll make a determination over the next couple of months. it's very complicated.\n\n\n\ncooper: that point blank, is does that mean you absolutely will release them? just a question of when?\n\n\n\ntrump: no, i'll make a determination i will be making that determine over the next, i would say, couple of months we'll make that determination, absolutely.\n\n\n\ncooper: and, finally did you actually make it and become president of the united states, i'm not going to ask you who your vice president would be. obviously it's too early for that. you wouldn't even say if you had been considering it, but are you going to look for somebody with political experience to kind of help you with congress. to actually help you once you're in washington if you get there?\n\n\n\ntrump: yes. the answer to that is yes. i would, i would not do. i mean look i'm very political and i've been political. but, i would absolutely not pay another business person. i will have many, many business people, i mean, some of the great, you know, carl icahn endorsed me. many of them endorsed me, the best ones. but we'll going to have them in terms of play. cooper: for vice president, you would want somebody with congressional experience\n\n\n\ntrump: i would want to somebody with political skill because i think that's where i would really want that. you know, with the dealing with congress, et cetera, et cetera.\n\n\n\ni also i think in terms of vice president, the key is, who would be a great president. if something should happen, who would be a great president? that has to be the first. but i would really want somebody that would be in the world of politics in that case.\n\n\n\n[21:20:04] i will keep it going really beautifully, but i like the concept of politics. not 100 percent, but i think i like the concept of having somebody that's in the world of politics for that position.\n\n\n\ncooper: donald trump, again, congratulations on last night.\n\n\n\ntrump: thank you very much, anderson.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: as you there he mentions support with latino voters in nevada which might mean his comments about mexicans earlier in his campaign or illegal immigrants, i should say from mexico won't hurt him with that demographic. the question is, now how is it playing with voters where living on the borders of this state. our gary tuchman tonight reports.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\ngary tuchman, cnn national correspondent: george brenzovich is a ranch owner in el paso county, texas. his ranch are short walk from the mexican border. and one of the most violent border areas there is.\n\n\n\nare you carrying a gun right now?\n\n\n\ngeorge brenzovich, el paso county ranch owner: yes, sir. it's a normal thing out here.\n\n\n\ntuchman: would you ever walk down here without carrying a gun?\n\n\n\nbrenzovich: no.\n\n\n\ntuchman: because?\n\n\n\nbrenzovich: i'm no fool.\n\n\n\ntuchman: brenzovich never voted for a democrat for president. and that string will continue this year. illegal immigration issue he says has a lot to do with it.\n\n\n\nbrenzovich: we need to secure the border and prosecute those that came in illegally. deport but going to secure this border first. tuchman: the rio grande separates the united states from mexico from one end of texas to the other. there are fences and walls in this state but not right here. and you could see the rio grande right over here which separates the two countries, mexico is over here, has no water in it. it's just mud. very easy to cross. the only water we see is right here in this swampy area.\n\n\n\nabout a half mile away there is a border fence but it abruptly comes to an end. anyone can just wander around it. one more reason george brenzovich and his wife want this area more secure asap. so who is their choice for president?\n\n\n\nbrenzovich: i've got all my cards on the table for donald trump.\n\n\n\ntuchman: brenzovich he has faith in the new york city billionaire.\n\n\n\ndo you think donald trump knows what he's talking about?\n\n\n\nbrenzovich: i think absolutely. i think nafta is a big failure. we'll use all that money to build a wall you can't imagine.\n\n\n\ntuchman: there are registered republicans on the texas border who don't much like trump. steven brewer likes the immigration stance of ben carson whom he will vote for tuesday.\n\n\n\ndo you think carson is tough enough on that?\n\n\n\nsteven brewer, el paso republican voter: i believe that he's tough enough. i believe he's fair. i believe that donald trump is over the top. he really is. what he wants to do with immigration, especially in this area on the border it's just its going to breed ill will between the two countries.\n\n\n\ntuchman: but this republican says the former reality show host is not over the top. saying he was thinking of voting for rubio but will instead vote for trump.\n\n\n\ndoes it trouble you that he talks about sending everyone back who is undocumented in this country?\n\n\n\njoel chacon, el paso county republican voter: no, i'd help him. i think a lot of people would help him.\n\n\n\ntuchman: in george brenzovich is one of them. he wants his land back from the people crossing through it illegally. he wants his safety back so he doesn't have to carry a gun nearly everywhere he goes.\n\n\n\nbrenzovich: i'm retired. my roots are deep. my property is paid off. i'm staying.\n\n\n\ntuchman: gary tuchman, cnn, el paso county, texas.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: right along the border. just ahead, how ted cruz is faring in his home state we know he's a polarizing figure in washington certainly and capitol hill. but can he win the hearts and minds of the texas voters? we'll take you to a diner in dallas to find out what people there are thinking and saying.\n\n\n\nand later, deadly tornadoes strike the southeastern united states. the latest on whether the powerful storm system is hitting as we come to you live from the university of houston where the side of the cnn gop debate is tomorrow night.\n\n\n\nwe'll be right back.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[21:27:35] cooper: after coming in third in nevada, ted cruz has his eyes planted firmly on super tuesday. today he said he believes it will be the most important day of the election and that he'll have a very good night. and one of the states voting on super tuesday is obviously is his home state of texas.\n\n\n\nrandi kaye went to a dallas diner to find out whether cruz style which can be divisive certainly on capitol hill is playing well with the voters in the lone star state. here's what's she found.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nunindentified female: i just want to have with topping, please.\n\n\n\nrandi kaye, cnn correspondent: at the diner of dallas, super sized burgers, and super tuesday go hand in hand.\n\n\n\nunidentified female: chicken, fries and stake.\n\n\n\nkaye: everyone here had an opinion about whether or not texas senator ted cruz will win his home state. especially after finishing third everywhere but iowa.\n\n\n\ndo you think ted cruz can win his home state of texas?\n\n\n\nmichael harrington, texas voter: no.\n\n\n\nkaye: do you want him to?\n\n\n\ngeorge sparks, ted cruz supporter: no. negative, no. this is a very conservative state. and i feel he'll have the backing to do it.\n\n\n\nkaye: you don't think his too conservative for texas?\n\n\n\nsparks: i hope not.\n\n\n\nkaye: do you think that ted cruz can win texas on super tuesday?\n\n\n\nrachel fenion, undecided republican voter: i really don't think he can, no. i think he's too divisive.\n\n\n\nkaye: sam rogers thinks cruz will win texas. she is voting for him because he is anti-establishment.\n\n\n\nsam rogers, ted cruz supporter: the fact that he's not popular means he's hard to work with. if he's hard to work with that means he's not just going along with how things have been. and things honestly haven't been good.\n\n\n\nkaye: this republican voter disagrees suggesting cruz's unwillingness to bend has done his party more harm than good.\n\n\n\ndan crimmins, undecided republican voter: he's unwielding and he just will not negotiate.\n\n\n\nkaye: and you think that would be bad for washington?\n\n\n\ncrimmins: i think it's what we have now. i mean, what's the change? and that's why trump is winning.\n\n\n\nkaye: some here are looking for a more compassionate conservative. after all, this is bush country and there's no love lost between george w. and cruz.\n\n\n\ncrimmins: i think george bush, george w. bush was more compassionate, more outreaching. ted cruz to me, i am a republican. however, but i think he is kind of the bison.\n\n\n\nfenion: i think that we have a lot of hard-liners in washington right now and we see where the country is because of that, you know, 17 percent approval rating for congress, things like that. i think people need to come together a lot more and i think that to his being a hard-liner would not go over well in washington.\n\n\n\nkaye: this woman disagrees.\n\n\n\nrogers: i think compassionate is not what's playing well right now.\n\n\n\n[21:30:01] kaye: do you think ted cruz is the guy who can bring down donald trump?\n\n\n\nrogers: if anyone can do it, it will be him.\n\n\n\nkaye: and like donald trump, ted cruz is extremely polarizing, almost a rorschach test what you see is in the eye to the beholder.\n\n\n\nunindentified male: i like that he stands to\n\n\n\nsparks: i like that he stands for the constitution.\n\n\n\ncrimmins: he looks fake, i just don't think people really believe what he says.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: randi joins me now from dallas. where is ted cruz in the polls in texas? is he making headway? kaye: well, there's a new statewide poll, anderson out tonight in texas from the university of houston. and that poll does show ted cruz 15 points ahead of donald trump. i should point out that only about 400 voters were included in that poll but here's what's interesting, anderson, 19 percent of those polled say they are still undecided.\n\n\n\nso, i guess we'll have to watch the cnn republican debate tomorrow night to try and make up their minds. i mean we hear donald trump saying that he would like to win texas. he is also saying that he expects to see ted cruz go way, way down in texas. those are his words. so we'll see what's happens come super tuesday. anderson.\n\n\n\ncooper: all right, randi, thanks very much. be sure to tune in tomorrow night when the republicans meet here at the university of houston. wolf blitzer is going to be moderating the cnn telemundo salem radio network republican presidential debate starting at 8:30 p.m. eastern. join us here at 8:00 p.m. for the run-up to the debate.\n\n\n\njust ahead you may not recognize this man. not a household name, at least it's not nationwide. his name is being floated as a potential nominee for the supreme court justice. and he's a republican.\n\n\n\nquestion is, how that play into senate republicans plans to block any nominee by president obama. we'll look into that next.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[21:35:33] cooper: we see developments tonight in the battle over replacing the late supreme court justice antonin scalia.\n\n\n\nthere's a name being floated. the source confirming that cnn the republican nevada governor ryan sandoval is being vetted by the white house. now the news, comes even as senate majority leader mitch mcconnell is saying there will be no hearing for anyone president obama choses.\n\n\n\ntoday the president said it's his job. he's got a year left, and he's going to do it.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nbarack obama, president of the united states of america: one side made a nomination, then leader mcconnell and all the members of the senate are going to make a decision about how do they fulfill their constitutional responsibilities.\n\n\n\ni recognized the politics are hard for them because the easier thing to do is to give in to the most extreme voices within their party and stand pat and do nothing. but that's not our job. our job is to fulfill our constitutional duties.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: but joining me now is cnn senior political reporter manu raju. so you spoke with senate minority leader harry reid in nevada state. what did he have to say about the possibility of sandoval being the nominee?\n\n\n\nmanu raju, cnn senior political reporter: hey anderson, reid and brian sandoval have a long and sometimes complicated history together, reid had proposed sandoval to a federal judgeship during the george w. bush era.\n\n\n\nsandoval later ran for governor and defeated reid's son rory in the 2010 elections. and sandoval is actually heavily courted by republicans to run in 2016 for the senate seat that reid now holds. but sandoval have already declined.\n\n\n\nnow reid told me today that he thinks it would be smart for president obama to give sandoval a lifetime position on the supreme court.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nraju: you met with brian sandoval. he's been mentioned as a possible supreme court justice. do you think that he'd be a good supreme court justice?\n\n\n\nsen. henry reid, (d) nevada: you know, i don't pick the justices but i know if he were picked, i would support the man. he's a good person. he has a great record and he's been a tremendously good governor. in spite, in spite of having to deal with some very big problems there.\n\n\n\nraju: so do you advise the white house to pick a moderate republican who could divide the republican party or pick a progressive that could fire up the liberal base?\n\n\n\nreid: i've talk to the president, i talked to his chief of staff many times. i talked to his political guy today. and he should pick who he thinks is the best.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nraju: now anderson, it's unclear if this is just a trial balloon floated by reid to make republicans look unreasonable for refusing to consider a moderate hispanic republican. but we do know that reid and sandoval discussed the possibility of a supreme court nomination in that private meeting on monday.\n\n\n\nand while sandoval's office says the obama administration has not yet contacted the governor, he is at least being considered as of now.\n\n\n\ncooper: and how are republicans going to react to the news?\n\n\n\nraju: well, not very well anderson. leading the party lunch today, i talked to a number of republican senators. and up and down they're saying they will refuse to consider a nominee no matter who it is. they think it let should be left to the next president and as deb fisher, a republican of nebraska told me, it's not about the person, she said.\n\n\n\ncooper: all right. manu raju, thanks, manu. well, joining me now, cnn senior legal analyst jeffrey toobin, with me again, cnn political director david chalian and cnn chief political analyst gloria borger. jeff, i mean, you know the court probably better than anybody. i loved your book the nine. is this a political trial balloon to see how the senate reacts or do you think the white house is seriously considering governor sandoval?\n\n\n\njeffrey toobin, fmr federal prosecutor: well i think it's probably a combination of all of those things. i mean, look, the most important fact here is that the republican senate is not going to consider anybody. barring some political development that just seems completely unlikely at this point.\n\n\n\nso this is a political act. and the idea of considering a moderate republican is a good symbol for democratic president. makes him look broad minded is a comparison to the what he would say is the very close minded republican senate.\n\n\n\nbut keep in mind also, the democrats would not be happy with a brian sandoval appointment. he is certainly more liberal than most republicans today, but he is someone who said the affordable care act was unconstitutional. yes, he's been pro-choice as a governor. but democrats care too much about this seat to give it away to a republican.\n\n\n\nso, i don't think it's going to happen. but this is the first of several names we're going to hear, and they're mostly for political positioning, and i think that's really what sandoval trial balloon is.\n\n\n\n[21:40:03] cooper: yeah then gloria, i mean to jeff's point, how bad of a position would it put republicans in to just obstruct it?\n\n\n\nborger: well, i think harry reid knows that it would make them squirm and that's why he's talking about it.\n\n\n\nbut i think, to jeff's point, that this would truly alienate the democratic base to such a degree that i don't think president obama would do it. he has said that he is going to take the long view and not the short-term view.\n\n\n\nthe short-term view would be to do something that makes republicans squirm. and i just don't think that that is what the president has been talking about doing ...\n\n\n\ncooper: and david, part of this is also to fire up the democratic base?\n\n\n\nborger: right.\n\n\n\ncooper: to gloria's point, senate may not be the one do it.\n\n\n\nchalian: yeah. the way i've been thinking about the politics of this is sort of whoever barack obama names to this job is basically going to become de facto, hillary clinton's running mate for the rest of this season, because she's going to want to use this to fire up the base and bash the republicans for saying they should be giving this person a vote.\n\n\n\nand so, brian sandoval doesn't fit that mode ...\n\n\n\nborger: yeah.\n\n\n\nchalian: ... in my mind of what the white house would really like to put forward, what hillary clinton with the democratic party would like to have out there every single day as sort of a calling card and to uses cajole against the republicans.\n\n\n\ntoobin: and anderson ...\n\n\n\nborger: i mean the politician. i mean, he is a constitutional scholar ...\n\n\n\ncooper: right.\n\n\n\nborger: ... but he's a politician.\n\n\n\ncooper: jeff?\n\n\n\ntoobin: well, you know, he -- the president wrote a post today for scotus blog which is a website devoted to the supreme court. and he talked about, you know, the kind of justice he wants. and it was, it was very clear, i thought, that the president is talking about a sitting judge, someone who is a judge now, who has a record as a judge, who has impeccable qualifications.\n\n\n\nso i think that returns us to the judge universe of candidates, the paul watford's, the sri srinivasan's, the jean kelly's, not the politicians, even though i think it would be a good idea to have some politicians on the supreme court again. they used to be on the court all the time.\n\n\n\ncooper: and jeff, where do you stand on the sort of the precedence of this? because i mean -- again, the president today said, look, this is not something that written in the constitution that a sitting president in the last year, can't nominate, in fact that he is saying this is part of his duty.\n\n\n\ntoobin: you know, it is certainly the president's right to nominate someone and he will, and he should. but it's also the senate's right to advice and consent or withhold consent.\n\n\n\nand these supreme court nominations have always been more about power than principle. the republicans know this is a seat that could turn the court to five liberals for a generation. there have not been five liberals on the supreme court for two generations, since the late 60s.\n\n\n\nthere is no way the supreme court is going to give president obama this opportunity. and it doesn't matter what joe biden said in 1992. it doesn't matter what mitch mcconnell said today. they're just not going to do it because they don't want to give up that seat and they have the power to stop him.\n\n\n\ncooper: and yet, i mean, again, republicans do point to joe biden said ...\n\n\n\nborger: right.\n\n\n\ncooper: ... you know, and to sort of show the hypocrisy that exists, frankly, on both sides.\n\n\n\nborger: right. and joe biden said that by the way, i think four months before the election. not 10 or 11 months before the election.\n\n\n\nchalian: but still.\n\n\n\nborger: but still. but of course they're going to use it. but the time frame is a little bit, is a little bit different.\n\n\n\ncooper: right.\n\n\n\nborger: so.\n\n\n\ncooper: all right. gloria borger, jeffrey toobin, thank you, david chalian as well.\n\n\n\ncoming up, the battle intensifies between the apple and the fbi over killer's iphone. what apple ceo tim cook said just a short time ago.\n\n\n\nand next, and deadly storm system sends tornadoes ripping through the southeast and now dangerous weather hitting parts of the northeast. well, the latest from our weather center when we come back.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[21:47:45] cooper: a rare february, tornado watch has been issued for parts of the northeast including washington, baltimore and philadelphia as a powerful storm system is on the move.\n\n\n\nreports of buildings down to the west in lancaster, pennsylvania, degree reportedly making hard for emergency vehicles to get through and no information yet on any injuries.\n\n\n\nat least six people were killed as tornadoes ripped through mississippi and louisiana and a possible tornado touched down in waverly, virginia, devastating that small town.\n\n\n\nright now, there are more than 200,000 people without power from the carolinas up to the northeast.\n\n\n\nmeteorologist, tom sater joins me now from the cnn weather center at atlanta with the latest. what's happening with the system, tom?\n\n\n\ntom sater, cnn meteorologist: well, it's still pretty strong, anderson.\n\n\n\ni mean, we've got massive winds right now that are still creating blizzard conditions in the great lakes.\n\n\n\nwe still have a threat for severe weather from around the philadelphia area to new york city and we still have rivers and streams that have been rising.\n\n\n\nthis storm is massive in its size taking up a third of the country. and it's been a triple threat, really.\n\n\n\nbesides the flooding and blizzard conditions, it's been the severe weather.\n\n\n\ntake a look, yesterday afternoon, 36 tornadoes, three fatalities, two in louisiana, one in southern mississippi. over toward escambia county in florida near pensacola, over 200 homes have been damaged or destroyed.\n\n\n\nbut, it didn't end there. again, during the heat of the day, which believe it or not, up were 60s and 70 degree temperatures on the east coast, we had many more, a total of 51 tornadoes.\n\n\n\nand unfortunately, the tragedies continue. about 45 miles south of richmond, virginia, in a town of waverly, virginia, we lost three more citizens, another tornado moving through the area. see that thunderstorm right there.\n\n\n\nthe youngest of the three victims was a 2 year old boy. authorities found the three bodies thrown 300 yards from their destroyed mobile home.\n\n\n\nwe had hail, numerous reports of golf ball-sized hail, baseball size hail, even one report of softball sized hail near the north carolina border.\n\n\n\n2,100 flights, anderson, were canceled today in the u.s. blizzard conditions in chicago canceled over 650 of them.\n\n\n\nbut, really, it's been about the rare event. i mean, the northern extent of having tornado watches and warnings in february just does not happen when you get up to areas of pennsylvania into new york. it's just unbelievable.\n\n\n\n[21:50:06] cooper: yeah, i mean, how unexpected was this?\n\n\n\nsater: well, the storm prediction center did do a pretty good job of yesterday's bulls eye in the south east. and today's they expanded it somewhat.\n\n\n\nbut i have to point out, i mean until 11:00 a tornado lot and still and affect moving east now at philadelphia but in yellow here anderson, including new york city until 2:00 in the morning. we could have some strong thunderstorms, just now looking at the possibility of tornadoes, thank goodness, but highly unusual, changing the lives of thousands of u.s. citizens the last couple of days.\n\n\n\ncooper: yeah. tom sater. tom thanks.\n\n\n\nthe new york times is reporting that apple engineers have begun developing new security measures that would prevent the government from breaking into a locked iphone like the ones that belonged to one of the san bernardino terrorists. the killer's iphone is that the center of the stand of the both sides digging their hills, is a short time ago. here what's apple ceo tim cook said on abc news.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\ntim cook, apple inc. ceo: this case is not about my phone. this case is about the future. what is at stake here is can the government compel apple to write software that we believe would make hundreds of millions of customers vulnerable around the world including the u.s.\n\n\n\nunidentified male: and you have to write that system in order to unlock that phone.\n\n\n\ncook: yes, the only way we know will be to write a piece of software that we view as the software equivalent of cancer. we think its bad news to write. we would never write it, we have never written it and that is what is take here.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: well the fbi and justice department see it differently. earlier i spoke to john miller, the new york city police department of deputy commissioner of the counterterrorism and intelligence here, and the nypd police commissioner william bratton reaching it wrote an off head about this battle to the new york times.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: so john, tim cook did an interview today with abc news. and in the interview he said the request by the fbi would set a precedent that he said is bad for america and that he could and his words could expose people to incredible vulnerabilities, essentially he saying they're been asked to create new software that could potentially create a backdoor that would make everybody's phone vulnerable.\n\n\n\njohn miller, deputy commissioner, new york police deparment: so this is the kind of talk that's confusing the issue here. we've got to get to the baseline issue. so what's this really about, it's not about a back door, it's about a front door when the government comes in with a legal search warrant.\n\n\n\nunder ios 7, apple very proudly announced that not only does it provides a security and privacy for apple's users but allows apple to comply with legal search warrants in cases involving robbery, kidnapping, lies in the terrorism.\n\n\n\nso one has to asked him cook, what changed between the time that apple held a key of its own that could open a phone for legal process and when they came out with ios 8 at which point apple announced and, apple will not perform ios data extractions in response to government search warrants.\n\n\n\nbut behind every phone where we request a search warrant, there is a crime behind every crime, there's a victim.\n\n\n\ncooper: but aren't the phones more vulnerable potentially to hackers if there is a master lock or a back door to an operating system?\n\n\n\nmiller: i don't see how. it's about the physical phone. it's not about hacking into the system. the apple that says that they're so worried about this back door also encourages users to pay apple to store large amounts of data in the cloud, which is far more vulnerable to hackers than the actual device where you'd have to figure out the code.\n\n\n\ncooper: but one of the arguments is that the fbi made a mistake, essentially, that apple was willing to help them get access to the cloud of this particular user, but the city which owned the phone along with the fbi changed the password remotely thereby making it impossible for apple to help the fbi get access to the cloud.\n\n\n\nso wouldn't this not have happened if there hadn't been a mistake by the fbi?\n\n\n\nmiller: i think the only cloud that is relevant in this scenario is clouding the issue. by zeroing in on one obscure fact about this case. obfuscates the real question here. the real question for apple and for tim cook is do we want to produce a warrant-proof phone that is a mass storage device for information at a time when every criminal and every criminal network uses these communications these devices for their bread and butter.\n\n\n\ncooper: i want to read something that at the director of the fbi james comey recently said, he said quote we have awesome new technology that creates a serious tension between two values we all treasure, privacy and safety. that tension should not resolve by corporations that sell stuff for living. it also should not be resolved by the fbi which investigates for a living, it should be resolved by the american people, deciding how we want to govern ourselves in a world we have never seen before.\n\n\n\n[21:55:05] i mean for those millions of iphone users who see this as an invasion of their privacy, what do say?\n\n\n\nmiller: i don't see how any iphone users see this as an invasion of their privacy. the one thing that, you know, director comey says better than anybody else is, this isn't going to be solved by the fbi yelling at apple and apple yelling back at the fbi. this is a question for the american people that's not really about privacy.\n\n\n\napple is framing it as privacy, i think in some measure because in marketing products that other people make similar products of -- the thing that sets you apart in a business model is what makes my product different.\n\n\n\ncooper: so, you're saying essentially this is about marketing? you really believe that this is just kind of a marketing effort by apple to kind of show the world they have a great private secure system?\n\n\n\nmiller: i'm saying in the marketplace, the thing that makes you sell over the other guys and apple and android are locked in this competition in a daily basis. the thing that will set you apart is the thing that was -- that makes you different. cooper: john miller. it's always good to have on john. thanks.\n\n\n\nmiller: thanks. thanks for having me.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\ncooper: we talked about a lot more. you can the entire interview with ac360.com.\n\n\n\nwe'll

asked rep. mo brooks, a republican from alabama, who said he was leaning yes.\n\nyou're going to vote 'no' and then shut down the government? asked rep. mark sanford, a republican from south carolina, when asked if the house freedom caucus was doing little more than paving the way for a big increase in spending in a later deal by supporting short-term continuing resolutions.\n\nleadership also had to convince defense hawks to back another short-term spending bill after they've said repeatedly that they have deep concerns about how that could affect the military.\n\ngop rep. bradley byrne of alabama said he was struggling with his vote.\n\ncontinuing resolutions are hurting the readiness of our troops, endangering our troops, and for those of us defense hawks, we find it very difficult to support crs, byrne said. the alternative is to let the democrats crash the whole government, and that's what they are trying to do.\n\nin the senate, more uncertainty looms. there, majority leader mitch mcconnell must win democratic votes, and many senators were still not saying tuesday how they'd vote on a short-term continuing resolution.\n\ni'm just tired of voting for crs, said sen. angus king, an independent from maine who caucuses with the democrats.
(cnn) uninsured americans can start signing up for coverage on the federal affordable care act exchange starting monday, but the biden administration has not allocated more funds to help them enroll.\n\nhowever, there hasn't been any announcement of additional funding for enrollment assistance, which the trump administration slashed by 84%, on average, since 2017. some 30 organizations received a total of only $10 million last summer.\n\nthat has worried some navigator groups, who weren't prepared to keep increased staffing levels beyond the traditional open enrollment period in november and december.\n\ni'm very stressed about it, said jodi ray, director of florida covering kids & families, the sole navigator group for the sunshine state. we could really use some more resources on the ground to do this. that's the thing i'm worried about the most because there is going to be marketing that's going to drive people to assistance.\n\nthe department of health and human services said it is looking into the issue.\n\ncms is working quickly to reevaluate the funding needs of the grantees, a spokesman said.\n\nray expects to be busy during the special enrollment period, which runs through mid-may. her group was slammed during the fall enrollment season, with many newly unemployed residents seeking help selecting from the dozens of options on the exchange. many were unsure how to project their income for the year, which is crucial to determine the subsidies they'll receive.\n\nif people are calling us, they need help. and we want to be able to help them, said ray, who personally assisted nearly three dozen clients. but there's a limit to what a human being can do.\n\nsome 2.1 million floridians selected policies during open enrollment last fall , up from 1.9 million the year before. sign ups on the federal exchange increased nationwide for the first time under the trump administration.\n\nfor the special enrollment period, ray will have only 48 staffers, the majority of whom are part-time. that's down from the 60 people, also mainly part-timers, who worked during the most recent open enrollment period.\n\nin arizona, the sole remaining navigator group had its annual funding slashed from about $2 million under the obama administration to $370,000 more recently.\n\nthe arizona alliance for community health centers can rely on enrollment counselors in its medical offices, but it had to reduce the number of navigators for open enrollment to around 28, down from around 40 prior to the cuts. and some of those folks are working fewer hours.\n\nwhat's more, some of the groups the alliance contracts with to provide enrollment assistance likely spent most of their funding during the fall sign up season.\n\nwe will manage the best we can, but a shot of cash or additional funding to the navigator program would make more hours and more people available, said allen gjersvig, the alliance's director of outreach and enrollment services. sure hope it comes.\n\namericans are still unfamiliar with exchanges\n\neven though the obamacare exchanges opened in 2014, many americans remain unfamiliar with the coverage. just under two-thirds of uninsured adults said they had heard nothing or only a little about financial assistance for policies, according to an urban institute study conducted in september.\n\nand half of consumers who looked for coverage for 2020 during open enrollment encountered difficulties, and nearly 5 million consumers unsuccessfully sought in-person help, according to the kaiser family foundation.\n\nwhat's more, two in five consumers who received guidance said it was somewhat or very unlikely they would have enrolled without it, kaiser found\n\nit's pretty clear navigator assistance matters enormously in getting the word out, in helping people get through the application and in connecting to coverage, said karen pollitz, senior fellow for health reform and private insurance at kaiser.\n\nthere are about 15 million uninsured people who could shop for coverage on the exchanges, though not all are eligible for a subsidy, according to the foundation.\n\nthe biden administration also likely has plenty of funding to put towards enrollment assistance, in addition to marketing. the centers for medicare and medicaid services has amassed more than $1 billion in unused user fees from obamacare insurers, kaiser estimates.\n\nthere are several reasons why the biden administration may not have announced a boost in funding for navigators, who also help clients enroll in medicaid if they qualify. first, congress has not confirmed biden's pick for health and human services secretary, xavier becerra , and the president has yet to name an administrator for the centers for medicare and medicaid services, which runs the federal exchange.\n\nalso, it's quicker to pump money into marketing budgets than to increase grants to the navigators, said sabrina corlette, co-director of the center on health insurance reforms at georgetown university.\n\nthere's absolutely an intent to get more money to navigators, she said. it's just how quickly they can get those wheels in motion.

story highlights aetna said this week it is significantly reducing its presence on individual health exchanges in 2017 sreedhar potarazu: if obamacare were a patient, it would be bedridden, gasping for breath and struggling to survive\n\neditor's note: sreedhar potarazu, an ophthalmologist and entrepreneur, is the founder of enziime, a software company focused on providing data science applications to assess health care delivery. he is the author of get off the dime: the secret of changing who pays for your health care. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely his.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthis week, aetna announced it plans to withdraw from 11 of the 15 states where it currently offers health insurance through public exchanges. it is the latest blow for americans who depend on obamacare for their health insurance, and puts them in the crossfire between the federal government and the health insurance companies whose proposed mergers it has just blocked. it's a battle that hurts everyone – and one that jeopardizes the affordable care act.\n\nphoto: courtesy sreedhar potarazu sreedhar potarazu\n\nthis reality stands in stark contrast with president barack obama's rosier assessment of the law, published recently in the journal of the american medical association. in what was widely seen as a report card, the president wrote: the affordable care act has made significant progress toward solving long-standing challenges facing the u.s. health care system related to access, affordability, and quality of care.\n\nbut is this a fair assessment?\n\nthere's no doubt the law has succeeded in terms of the first of those three pillars: access. obamacare provides financial assistance for people who otherwise would be unable to afford health insurance; it mandates that people with pre-existing conditions cannot be denied insurance; and it allows parents to keep their children on their policies until they reach the age of 26. the president noted that the uninsured rate has declined by 43% since the law was passed, and the department of health and human services has reported that an estimated 20 million people have gained health insurance since the aca went into effect.\n\nbut, contrary to what the president says, the law's other two pillars deserve a grade of incomplete. the jury is still out on whether the aca has delivered on its promises of affordability and quality of care, and surely everyone – whether republican or democrat – agrees that it will require dramatic changes to be sustainable in the years to come.\n\nbut the challenge of agreeing on what form that change should take was underscored by the quite different perspectives offered in two articles in the last few weeks by two of the aca's architects.\n\npeter r. orszag, who was director of the office of management and budget when the aca was passed, wrote a glowing editorial in the journal of the american medical association in which he hailed the substantial deceleration in health care costs. he said that even the most optimistic forecasts were conservative relative to what has since occurred.\n\nfundamentally, orszag said, the aca is working.\n\none problem, though, is that the costs to consumers are rising dramatically. the insurance companies have been seeking severe increases in their rates, and the mergers of some insurers and the announcements that others were seeking to merge, even before aetna's announcement on monday, are limiting the number of policy options, which further raises rates. all of this might be happening today even if obamacare didn't exist. but the law's financial construct clearly served as an accelerant for insurers attempting to mitigate losses.\n\nas to the question of quality, another architect of the law, bob kocher, who was special assistant to the president for health care and economic policy from 2009 to 2010, came up with a very different grade than orszag.\n\nin his op-ed in the wall street journal, titled how i was wrong about obamacare, kocher wrote that the quality of care has been negatively affected by the consolidation of doctors into larger physician groups, which he initially thought would be desirable.\n\nover the past five years, kocher wrote, published research, some of it well summarized on a harvard medical school site, has indicated that savings and quality improvement are generated much more often by independent primary care doctors than by large hospital-centric health systems….\n\nlarge health systems deliver 'personalized' care in the same way that gm can sell you a car with the desired options. yet personal relationships of the kind often found in smaller practices are the key to the practice of medicine.\n\nthe consolidation of practices was already happening when obamacare took effect, but it has accelerated because of the reduced payments to hospitals and provider systems the law has created. there is power in numbers, and consolidation gives providers better leverage in negotiating reimbursement rates and minimizing cost variances.\n\norszag and kocher's contradictory conclusions beg the question: if the original architects of the aca themselves are confused over the success or failure of the aca, then shouldn't we all be? is hillary clinton right when she says this a good law that requires incremental changes? or is donald trump right when he says the law should be repealed outright?\n\nryan has a point\n\nwhoever is elected would do well to pay attention to the concerns outlined by house speaker paul ryan in a better way: our vision for a confident america.\n\nryan writes in his policy paper that insurance premiums are rising and that certain plans are becoming unaffordable; that many states have been reluctant to expand medicaid, which was intended to be a factor in the law's success; that many of the regional co-ops that were created to provide health services have failed, and that others are unsustainable; and that many of the major insurance companies have decided not to provide policies in certain regions of the country.\n\nryan proposes repealing obamacare and implementing a new law that would include among its features: expanding consumer-directed health care options; making support for coverage portable; preserving employer-sponsored insurance; purchasing across state lines; and protecting employers' flexibility to self-insure.\n\nthe next president would be well advised to consider ryan's proposals and accept that he or she will need to work with him either to improve the current law or to structure a new one.\n\nbut arguably the biggest piece in the puzzle for whoever sits in the white house next year will be how to build and sustain a truly coordinated network of care that can share information collaboratively.\n\norszag, in hailing the law's success, pointed to its achievements in lowering the rates of hospital infections and of readmission for diagnoses like pneumonia and congestive heart failure. but while these are indeed significant accomplishments, to see improvements like these across the board, hospitals and caregivers must have quick and ready access to patient data. and although billions of dollars have already been invested with this goal in mind, they have been focused more on costs and billing than on quality care.\n\nthe reality is that our health care system is being frozen by outdated technology that prevents providers from seamlessly sharing patient and treatment data. if we are unwilling to roll up our sleeves and start devoting the money that's needed to build a powerful data infrastructure, there simply is no way we can get to a place where every care coordinator and every provider has an understanding of a patient's medical past and what treatments will be appropriate going forward.\n\nwe have made significant progress on the first pillar of the affordable care act: access. we have numerous reasonable proposals to improve the second pillar: affordability. it's the third pillar – quality of care – that will continue to be elusive unless we commit ourselves to the necessary changes.
washington (cnn) the fallout from wednesday's congressional session to count the 2020 electoral votes will echo for years to come. the state of the presidential electoral process. the state of the country. the state of a political party. the state of a congress potentially moving into a new era of democratic control .\n\nthe significance shouldn't be minimized. when the actions of president donald trump are factored in, there is no precedent for this moment. have there been objections in past years? yes. have there been objections of this nature, given the pressure from the clearly defeated leader of the country? nope.\n\nthe bottom line\n\nlet's make this abundantly clear: this process ends with the certification of joe biden as the 46th president of the united states. everything in between now and the final elector tally being read off is noise. boisterous. unruly. likely unseemly. at times barely tethered to reality. but it's not actionable or tangible in terms of having an actual effect. that being said, however long it takes -- and it will not be a short day -- this ends the same way: biden is inaugurated on january 20.\n\nwhat doesn't end is battle inside the republican party that has flooded into the open the last several days. what doesn't end is how the country moves on from this moment -- if it does at all.\n\nwhat to watch\n\nthis one is pretty simple: the members of the 117th congress. part of the day they'll be together in joint session. part of the day they'll separate to their own chambers to handle expected objections. there will be debate and there will be votes. but this is mostly a day of watching the respective floors.\n\ninside the gop objection effort\n\nthe ad hoc nature of this entire endeavor began with a few house republicans making noises that they planned to challenge the results of this election. it was a long-shot effort. it still is.\n\nthey were the usual trump allies: rep. jim jordan, the top republican on judiciary, plus rep. mo brooks of alabama and andy biggs of arizona. but even those members are still in the dark about how far some senators are going to be willing to go wednesday.\n\nif it seems like this entire movement is untethered to one leader, that's because it is. members are having their own conversations with trump. they are having one-off meetings with one another. but this isn't a centrally organized effort. you have sens. josh hawley and ted cruz. you have the top republican in the house, kevin mccarthy, in an entirely different position than that of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell.\n\na gop source familiar with the plans tells cnn that while there have been phone calls and one-on-one conversations, senators are making their own choices about objections. the house is learning about some of their plans second-hand. and while house members are lined up and prepared to challenge six states -- arizona, georgia, michigan, nevada, pennsylvania and wisconsin -- they recognize that those efforts only go somewhere if a senator is willing to sign on.\n\nwhat wednesday looks like\n\nthe beginning of the day will be ceremonial. the sergeant at arms will announce the senate and vice president mike pence will enter the chamber. he will take his seat as the presiding officer, call the joint session to order and we will be off to the races. at this point, pence will instruct the four tellers -- sens. roy blunt of missouri and amy klobuchar of minnesota, and reps. rodney davis of illinois and zoe lofgren of california -- to take their place at the desk where pence will begin to hand the state elector certificates to tellers one by one.\n\nfirst will be alabama, then alaska, then arizona.\n\nat this point, we expect that a gop member will raise an objection to the electoral results from arizona. pence will ask if there is an objection in writing that has been signed by a senator. cruz has made it clear he will sign on.\n\nonce that is presented, pence will ask each chamber to go and deliberate separately. then the real fight begins.\n\nthe debate\n\nthe law outlines that the house and senate will have up to two hours to debate, but how that time is divided and who will speak has not fully been flushed out.\n\nin the senate, mcconnell has been working toward an agreement that would allow for an hour of debate for those supporting the objection and another hour for those who are opposed to it. but in order to pass it, mcconnell would need unanimous consent. we expect that some democrats are going to want to speak out against cruz's challenge. but the more interesting moment will come when republican senators stand up in opposition.\n\neach member can only speak for up to five minutes, but all eyes are going to be on the republican members opposed to overturning the results and whether they actually speak up knowing trump will be watching closely. so far, we know that at least one republican senator -- pat toomey of pennsylvania -- plans to speak out at least against the objection to the pennsylvania results.\n\nbut he's retiring. keep your eyes out for sens. ben sasse of nebraska, lisa murkowski of alaska and tom cotton of arkansas. in the house, the debate could be more unruly. we know house speaker nancy pelosi will be presiding. she will call on members to speak, and again, each member will only have up to five minutes.\n\nthe vote\n\nthis is expected to go much more quickly in the senate than it will in the house. the house will have to vote in groups as they have throughout the pandemic. that could stretch to hours per vote. the expectation is that the senate will have to wait each time for the house to finish its business before the joint session can resume.\n\nthe other objections\n\nwe still don't know exactly how many objections could come wednesday. we expect sen. kelly loeffler, who cnn has projected just lost her runoff race to the rev. raphael warnock , to object to georgia. we know that hawley will object to pennsylvania.\n\nthat leaves michigan, nevada and wisconsin still potentially on the table. senators have been less inclined to go down the route of the latter three, even as their house colleagues have pressed them repeatedly to do just that.\n\nthe calculation becomes how much pain the senators want to actually inflict, because, again, we all know how this ends: biden will be the next president. no republican in the house or senate is under any illusions that is the reality. this circus is for an audience of one. and the question of how many objections there will be is partly a question of when will trump be satisfied that republicans fought for him on the floor.\n\nthe role of the vice president\n\nlet's be abundantly clear here: it is largely as traffic cop (as guided by the parliamentarians), ceremonial in nature as the person who announces tallies. even the guiding resolution passed by the senate to lay out the rules of the joint session make clear that's his role.\n\nthe president can say whatever he wants about whatever he thinks pence's role is in this scenario. none of what he's saying is accurate. pence, as cnn's ted barrett reported, huddled with the parliamentarians for several hours earlier this week. and he's mike pence, so it's fair to say he's fully prepared -- and fully aware -- of what his role is here.\n\nhow long will it take\n\nthis is largely a calculation of how many objections there are, how long it takes to vote and, of course, whether or not leadership breaks at any point to come back thursday. right now, the expectation is democratic and republican leaders want to go straight through the night if they have to. making this too easy and giving members a break only emboldens trump loyalists to object to more states, get more airtime and delay the inevitable. still, don't expect members to be on the floor the entire time. they have hideaways and offices they can retreat to. they've been encouraged to stay away because of the pandemic until it's time to vote or speak.\n\nestimates are just that: estimates. but aides have been allotting roughly four hours per objection.\n\nkeep an eye on (but don't pay too much attention to):\n\nthere will be the actual objections -- valid ones, with precedent -- immediately triggering action between the two chambers.\n\nand then, people involved say, there will likely be ... other stuff. think along the lines of the many theories being pitched to trump by his lawyers -- theories without any legal basis whatsoever. theories like:\n\nthe call for competing slates of electors. no competing slates have been delivered to congress, because no competing slates have been submitted by the proper state authorities. this is outside the bounds of the session and will be rejected.\n\nthe unilateral authority of the chair to reject specific slates. a member may pop up and attempt to cite thomas jefferson or richard nixon in arguing pence has unilateral authority to make decisions on electors. he does not. period. and this examples aren't even remotely close to apples-to-apples precedent. (jefferson's related to a technical glitch, not a change in outcome. nixon's related to competing slates of electors in which he opened the question to congress to object but didn't make the decision on his own.)\n\nrepeated efforts to adjourn the proceedings in order to secure a 10-day investigation (as called for by the cruz group). it's statutorily prohibited.\n\nthe republican party\n\nthere's no direct comparison to where the party is right now, but the closest parallel you can draw is back in 2013 when then-freshman-sen. cruz led his party to shut down the government. the base was with cruz. the leadership was not. and the saga that unfolded left the party splintered for years -- it was a moment that left republican rank-and-file members who hadn't stood with cruz forced to explain to their voters how shutting down the government wasn't going to end obamacare. it wasn't possible, but it didn't mean that some members didn't face the ire of the electorate.\n\ngop aides say that the base is furious right now at anyone who isn't standing with trump. the only hope most members have is that the large number of republicans who are going to rebuke this effort in the senate will only amount to a temporary blip and not a long-lasting stain on party unity.\n\nthe numbers\n\nas it currently stands, 24 republican senators have said they will certify biden's election. thirteen say they will object. aides tell us the former number will grow much larger over the course of the day. to be clear here: the momentum has swung hard against the objectors inside the conference. and not just on ideological lines.\n\nmcconnell\n\nquietly, and without much fanfare, mcconnell has made a series of moves in the last several weeks to steer his conference (and, by extension, his party) away from trump. keep an eye on his remarks on wednesday -- he'll be the first one up, and given his clear objections to the decision by members of his conference to object to several states, what he says will be extremely notable.
in the past week, the federal reserve expressed confidence in america's economy, the u.s. unemployment rate hit a 10-year low, and the presidential election in france showed that the tide of anti-european union populism may be ebbing.\n\nyou'd think these events would lift the stock market. but they haven't.\n\nsolid earnings from leading companies haven't moved the needle, either. neither has president trump's first big legislative win -- the passage of his health care plan by the house last week.\n\nsince april 25, stocks have barely budged. the dow closed that day at 20,996 -- and on monday afternoon, it was in almost exactly the same place. the s&p 500 and nasdaq have moved only slightly higher in that time.\n\nso why is the market going nowhere?\n\nwall street is still waiting for trump to unveil the specifics of his massive tax cut plan.\n\nthe trump administration released a one-page outline on april 26, and treasury secretary steven mnuchin and economic adviser gary cohn talked about it briefly. but investors want more details.\n\nrelated: how the economy is really doing\n\nthey hope lower tax rates for individuals and businesses, and other tax reform, will give a big boost to the economy.\n\nsome argue that lower corporate taxes could bring a flood of cash back into the economy, creating an effect similar to fed stimulus programs after the financial crisis.\n\napple (aapl), google owner alphabet (googl), microsoft (msft), cisco (csco) and oracle (orcl) are collectively sitting on more than half a trillion dollars in cash. they're holding much of it overseas to take advantage of lower tax rates.\n\nand the trump team has promised a one-time tax break for companies if they bring back, or repatriate, that cash to the united states.\n\nif these and other companies use that overseas cash to build plants in the united states and hire more american workers, it could substantially boost consumer spending and the broader economy.\n\nmeaningful change on taxes would arguably have a much bigger impact on markets and the economy than replacing obamacare and paring back the dodd-frank financial reform law. lower taxes could unleash spending by real people and corporations.\n\nbut until investors have a better sense of what trump's economic team will propose, the market may continue to tread water.\n\nrelated: wall street to trump: read our lips. just fix taxes\n\nstocks have already enjoyed a solid run since trump defeated hillary clinton in november.\n\nthe dow, s&p 500 and nasdaq are at or near record highs. and wall street's so-called fear gauge, a measure of volatility known as the vix (vix), dipped below 10 on monday and is the lowest in a decade.\n\ncnnmoney's fear & greed index, which looks at the vix and six other measures, has edged higher in recent weeks, too. it's in neutral territory but not far from registering greed.\n\nso one could argue there has been too much complacency in the market. investors now need to be more prudent. and trump has to actually deliver on his promise to come up with a tax plan that can make it through congress.

(ap photo/mark humphrey)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nentering 2017, and the dawn of the trump era, the prevailing hit on suddenly powerless democrats was that they had no message and, worse, no ideas. when it came to political combat, the party had been schooled by the president-elect, who understood that millions of americans were hungry for some sort of populist revival.\n\nparts of this analysis pop up in the ongoing and often tedious debate over whether sen. bernie sanders, handily defeated by hillary clinton in the democratic primaries, would have been better positioned to beat trump in the general election. one of the better arguments in sanders' favor – though no sure shot – contends that voters who wanted to cast a ballot for a populist candidate in 2016 would have broken, if just barely, for the progressive brand if given the choice that november.\n\nthe score-settling twitter skirmishes that litigate these points, every hour of every day, might be tiresome, but the underlying questions – and answers – are still relevant. what's become increasingly clear over the past year is that the democratic party of 2018 has broken cleanly in sanders' direction. what that means for sanders' aspirations is unclear. pundits often err in conflating the message with the messenger, the politician with his politics. that sanders' ideas are taking hold assures him, personally, of very little.\n\nstill, it hardly requires a capitol hill press badge, or regular contact with party poobahs, to see where democrats are headed – and how they are setting up to govern if they can regain control of congress and the white house.\n\nin less than a year, beginning around when republican efforts to tear down obamacare and scale back medicaid were ramping up, members of the senate democratic caucus have crafted no fewer than five pieces of legislation that would expand medicare to cover more – or all – americans. a new bill this week from new jersey sen. cory booker would create a pilot program for a federal jobs guarantee. democratic sens. elizabeth warren, jeff merkley, kamala harris and kirsten gillibrand are all cosponsors. sanders' more comprehensive version is on the way. gillibrand also introduced legislation this week that would require the us post office to offer bank services, effectively creating a public option for personal banking. the list goes on.\n\nto varying degrees, these bills have one crucial thing in common: they take steps toward removing private industry – and with it, profit motives – from critical aspects of public life. unlike obamacare, which required americans to obtain health coverage, offered subsidies or increased access to medicaid to those who couldn't afford it, the new crop of democratic policy pitches largely remove the middle man. implicit is the argument that government should protect citizens from destitution, but that it should take an affirmative role in seeking to improve their lives.\n\nthis marks a return, in large part, to the democrats' new deal ethos. it's not a coincidence progressives have been citing president franklin d. roosevelt's second bill of rights in some recent messaging. nor that the party named its official policy slate, introduced last summer, the better deal. though snarked upon by some at the time, and largely drowned out initially by, of all things, the unusual public exhibition of jared kushner's voice, it represented yet another sign of the democratic establishment's shifting ideological moorings.\n\nas duke public policy professor william darity jr. told cnn recently, during a conversation about the growing support among senate democrats for the jobs guarantee policy he's helped craft and push for years, the party's decades-old habit of self-censoring themselves before they put forth legislation to be considered seems to be diminishing.\n\nstill, there remains considerable worry within liberal circles about the prospect of ceding too much influence to the progressive left. the behind-the-scenes jockeying to clear contested midterm primary fields is one contentious battleground. others will pop up when – and if – democrats actually win a congressional majority this fall. while the house is very clearly in touching distance, the senate will be a much tougher nut to crack. how democratic officials would interpret their mandate, should their resistance be so empowered, is an open question.\n\nbeing shut out of power so completely, as the democrats are now, can be liberating. it's in the party's dna to regard the responsibility of governing as a most serious task, and certainly not one to be trifled with by a person or organization adjudged to be insufficiently savvy or pragmatic.\n\nthe opening of the floodgates for these bold new progressive bills has been, at least in part, a result of the freedom created by trump and the gop's grip on congress. for all the work and advocacy that's gone into the new-look democratic legislation, the documents remain – for now – little more than glorified press releases.
paul: i can't in good faith look the other way\n\nspeaker of the house paul ryan(l) r-wi listens while senate majority leader senator mitch mcconnell (r-ky) speaks to the press after meetings with us president donald trump at the white house february 27, 2017 in washington, dc. / afp / brendan smialowski (photo credit should read brendan smialowski/afp/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthe trump administration outlined its policy priorities on monday in a budget that calls for billions of dollars to fight the opioid epidemic, secure the country's borders and overhaul safety net programs.\n\nhere are some of the key proposals:\n\nfight the opioid epidemic\n\nthe administration calls for directing $17 billion to fight and address the scourge of opioid addiction, which trump labeled a national health emergency in october. this includes funding for traditional efforts, such as grants and medicare funding for treatment programs.\n\nthe plans also call for a national media campaign to raise awareness of the issue, as well as training and monitoring for medical professionals who prescribe opioids. the administration seeks to take its message to schools by bolstering a grant program for elementary and middle schools, which would help fund efforts such as trauma counseling, violence prevention and targeted academic support for young victims.\n\nsecure the southern border\n\nthe outline includes an $18 billion request to fund construction of a border wall, including $1.6 billion for approximately 65 miles of border wall in south texas.\n\ntrump is also seeking 2,000 immigration and customs enforcement agents (double the number scheduled to be hired this fiscal year), 750 border patrol agents and 75 additional immigration judge teams to hear immigration cases. the administration is also asking for funding for technology improvements to make the immigration system more efficient.\n\nfood stamps and paid family leave\n\nthe administration seeks to codify its position that recipients of federal assistance who can work should have jobs.\n\nits proposal includes a requirement that able-bodied recipients of federal rental assistance shoulder more of their housing costs through work, and suggests a similar requirement be implemented for the supplemental nutrition assistance program, known as food stamps.\n\nalong with other changes, adding a work requirement to food stamps would help ensure americans in need of assistance have access to a nutritious diet while significantly reducing the cost to taxpayers.\n\nthe proposal also calls for states to create paid family leave programs similar to the unemployment insurance system. the administration said it supports six weeks of paid family leave to new mothers and fathers, including adoptive parents, so all families can afford to take time to recover from childbirth and bond with a new child.\n\nstudent loans\n\nthe proposal calls for a fairly substantial overhaul of the education department's student loan programs, including consolidating the increasingly common income-based repayment plans into a single program.\n\nit also proposed changes to aid programs for low-income students, such as turning the federal work study program into a job training initiative.\n\nthe plan calls for making colleges and universities, particularly those that consistently fail to deliver a quality education, partly financially responsible if former students cannot earn enough money to pay back their student loans.\n\nprioritize fossil fuel programs\n\nthe proposal outlines how several government departments are focusing resources and time on fossil fuel programs, largely at the expense of renewable energy and climate change programs.\n\nthe energy department plans to invest in oil and clean coal research, and the interior department is proposing opening up additional federal lands to oil drilling. the environmental protection agency outlined a proposal to close the climate change research and partnership programs, cuts that would save taxpayers millions of dollars.\n\nrepeal obamacare\n\nrepublicans in congress failed to repeal obamacare last year, but the administration wants them to try again.\n\nthe proposal calls on lawmakers to act as soon as possible by reconsidering a proposal similar to the one drafted by gop sens. lindsey graham and dean heller.\n\npentagon\n\nthe defense department is asking for a major boost in military spending for 2019, requesting congress approve a budget of $686 billion – one of the largest in its history.\n\nmilitary officials say the increase of $80 billion from 2017 is primarily aimed at deterring threats from russia and china.\n\nrelated: pentagon asks for major budget increase amid threats from russia, china and north korea\n\nprivatize space station missions\n\nthe administration proposed turning much of nasa's work at the international space station over to private companies within the next decade. nasa's role would be to support human space exploration and to pursue a campaign that would establish us preeminence to, around, and on the moon.\n\ncnn money: trump administration wants to privatize space station missions\n\nmeals on wheels again in the cross-hairs\n\nthe president's proposal calls for eliminating a housing and urban development program that funds local charitable and community causes.\n\nthe community development block grant, or cdbg, provides funding to organizations like meals on wheels; the program received an outpouring of support last year when the administration also proposed eliminating cdbg. the administration reiterated its belief that cdbg has not demonstrated sufficient impact to continue.\n\nstudies have shown that the allocation

source: cnn trump wants a temporary deal on health care\n\nstill needs congress\n\nthough congress has shelved its effort to repeal and replace obamacare, a signature campaign promise for the president, trump has not let it go. while he cannot wipe away the health reform law with the stroke of a pen, trump – who often blasted former president barack obama for using executive orders – can use those orders to direct agencies to amend guidance and regulations to broaden how the law is implemented.\n\nhis plan announced thursday has drawn backing from lawmakers like sen. rand paul, the kentucky republican who has identified specific reforms that could be made by the president alone. paul, who also criticized obama on executive orders, was among those present for the signing.\n\nthe order could let millions of americans sign up for coverage comparable to that offered by large companies, which is generally well-regarded, paul said in a press conference. the policies could be open to small firms but also to large organizations, he said, citing the international franchise association, which has millions of members.\n\npaul brushed aside concerns that those in association health plans would have skimpy coverage.\n\nwhy don't we let the little individual – the plumber, the baker, the accountant, the small doctor or attorney – let them join together in associations and so they can have the same buying power that the big corporations have, paul told cnn's jake tapper on the lead.\n\ntrump's efforts with congressional republicans to repeal and replace the affordable care act have floundered after analyses of the gop replacement plans showed the number of americans without insurance would increase by more than 20 million people, as compared to current law.\n\ndemocrats railed against trump's move, saying it would hurt the current health care markets.\n\nhaving failed to repeal the #aca in congress, @potus is using a wrecking ball to singlehandedly rip apart & sabotage our healthcare system, senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-new york, tweeted.\n\nhaving failed to repeal the #aca in congress, @potus is using a wrecking ball to singlehandedly rip apart & sabotage our healthcare system. — chuck schumer (@senschumer) october 12, 2017\n\nthis is a case where doing something is worse than doing nothing, ezekiel emanuel, an oncologist and one of the architects of obamacare, said on cnn. it's not going to solve the problem at all and remember, it effects a very small number of people.\n\nit won't do anything for a lot of the people on the exchange who are not members of franchises or trade associations, emanuel said. so this is more show than actual reality in terms of making health care affordable for americans.\n\nwhat the order may do\n\nexactly how the agencies would change current regulations remains to be seen.\n\nassociation health plans, which are usually sponsored by trade organizations or interest groups, already exist. spurred by the executive order, federal agencies could amend the rules governing these plans so they are no longer subject to state regulation, said health policy experts. instead, the nationwide plans may come under the same federal oversight as large-employer policies.\n\nlarge group plans do not have to adhere to all of obamacare's provisions, such as the requirement to provide comprehensive policies that cover prescription drugs, mental health and substance abuse, according to kevin lucia, project director at georgetown university's health policy institute.\n\nthe switch could also allow association plans to deny coverage to the group or set rates based on the medical history of those in the group, so plans with younger, healthier members could offer lower premiums. the administration said that employers participating in these plans would not be allowed to exclude employees or develop premiums based on health conditions.\n\nthe president's action also looks to expand the use of short-term insurance plans. these policies are also not subject to obamacare regulations so they can exclude those with pre-existing conditions or base rates on consumers' health background. also, they usually offer less comprehensive coverage.\n\nthe obama administration limited these plans' coverage to 90 days. previously, they had been available for up to a year.\n\nthis story has been updated.
(cnn) welcome to cnn's fact check coverage of the democratic presidential debate hosted by nbc news and msnbc and held in las vegas ahead of saturday's nevada caucuses.\n\ntonight was the ninth presidential debate, and the first that presidential candidate mike bloomberg qualified for. many of the other candidates on stage attacked the former new york mayor and billionaire on his previous policies, like stop and frisk and his campaign's significant ad spending\n\nfor candidates sen. elizabeth warren and former vice president joe biden, the debate offered a chance to turn around their poor showings in new hampshire and iowa, while sen. bernie sanders looke to keep his lead in national polling and overtake former south bend, indiana, mayor pete buttigieg's delegate lead.\n\ncnn fact checked candidate's claims raging from policy projections, their work history and alleged accolades and attacks on those sharing the stage.\n\nwarren's claim about bloomberg calling women 'horse-faced lesbians'\n\nwarren accused bloomberg of saying derogatory things about women.\n\ni'd like to talk about who we're running against, warren said, a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians. and no, i'm not talking about donald trump, i'm talking about mayor bloomberg.\n\nfacts first: it's not clear whether bloomberg ever said these specific words, but they have been attributed to him. the quote warren is referencing is from a booklet of alleged bloomberg quotes given to him by an employee as a gift for his birthday in 1990. while the introduction of the book says these are all actual quotes, bloomberg has denied that he actually said any of them.\n\nthe washington post recently uploaded a copy of the booklet of alleged bloomberg quotes , which includes a criticism of the british royal family, calling them a bunch of misfits -- a gay, an architect, that horsey faced lesbian, and a kid who gave up koo stark for some fat broad.\n\nbloomberg's presidential campaign spokesman stu loeser told the post that mike simply did not say the things somebody wrote in this gag gift, which has been circulating for 30 years and has been quoted in every previous election mike has been in.\n\nthe post also reported that a bloomberg spokesman said in 2001 that 'some of the things he might have said' and bloomberg apologized to 'anyone that was offended by' the comments.\n\nhowever, as cnn has reported , bloomberg has been accused of sexist and misogynistic behavior in the past. his campaign chairwoman responded to new questions about those accusations to cnn, saying in part, in any large organization, there are going to be complaints -- but mike has never tolerated any kind of discrimination or harassment, and he's created cultures that are all about equality and inclusion.\n\n-- holmes lybrand\n\nbiden's claim about bloomberg calling obamacare a disgrace\n\nbiden said bloomberg called obamacare a disgrace after it passed.\n\nthe mayor said, when we passed it, the signature piece of this administration, it's a disgrace, biden said. they're the exact words. it was a disgrace. look it up, check it out, it was a disgrace.\n\nfacts first: this is true.\n\nbloomberg did call the final obamacare bill a disgrace during a july 2010 event at dartmouth college, just months after the law's passage. bloomberg added that the law did absolutely nothing to fix the big health care problems calling it just another program that's going to cost a lot more money.\n\nbloomberg defended himself at the debate, saying, i was in favor of it. i thought it didn't go as far as we should, comments his campaign also made to cnn's kfile on sunday . his campaign pointed to comments he made in 2013 on a radio program after the bill's passage as a sign of his support. congress passed this, so let's try it at least, bloomberg said.\n\nsome parts of obamacare i don't think will work, i don't think is fair, i don't think is intelligent, whatever. but i don't have a better answer other than let's try this, bloomberg also said.\n\n-- andrew kaczynski\n\nbiden on bloomberg's use of stop and frisk\n\nbiden said that bloomberg, as mayor of new york city, had stop and frisk -- throwing close to five million young black men up against a wall.\n\nfacts first: there were approximately 5 million total stop and frisk stops during bloomberg's tenure as mayor between 2002 and 2013, but biden was inaccurate when he said that this was the number of young black men stopped. of about 5.08 million total stops under bloomberg, about half, approximately 2.6 million stops, were of black people -- men and women of all ages, according to police data compiled by the there were approximately 5 million total stop and frisk stops during bloomberg's tenure as mayor between 2002 and 2013, but biden was inaccurate when he said that this was the number of young black men stopped. of about 5.08 million total stops under bloomberg, about half, approximately 2.6 million stops, were of black people -- men and women of all ages, according to police data compiled by the new york civil liberties union\n\nbiden spokesman michael gwin said biden meant to refer to the total number of stops. gwin correctly noted that the stops disproportionately targeted young african-american and hispanic men.\n\nbloomberg advocated stop and frisk even after a federal judge ruled in 2013 that the way new york was using stop and frisk was unconstitutional. he began apologizing for stop and frisk in november 2019, the month he launched his presidential campaign, saying he only belatedly realized that too many innocent people were being harmed. however, his account of what happened has left out important information.\n\nyou

republican-held areas.\n\ni'm the one on this stage that had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country when i led the ticket, as well as bringing in rural and suburban voters. and i've done that as well, she said. and i'm the only one with the receipts to have done that in republican congressional districts over and over again.\n\nfacts first: partly true. minnesota had the highest voter turnout rate of any state during each of her senate campaigns, but klobuchar is not the only candidate who has won republican-held congressional districts\n\nbiden, who spent most of his career as the senator for delaware, won in republican congressional districts.\n\nbiden first won the 1972 election to be senator from delaware and was repeatedly re-elected to serve in that position by considerable margins until he became vice president in 2009. during that time, delaware's sole congressional district was held by republicans from 1973 to 1983, and from 1993 to 2011.\n\nturnout was highest in minnesota in years when klobuchar ran. in her three election years, minnesota had the highest state voter turnout nationwide.\n\n-- caroline kelly\n\nwarren on buttigieg and klobuchar health care proposals\n\nwarren attacked several of her rivals on their health care plans, particularly buttigieg and klobuchar.\n\nmayor buttigieg, there are four expenses that families pay, right, premiums, deductibles, co-pays, uncovered medical expenses. mayor buttigieg says he will put a cap only on the premiums. and that means families are going to pick up the rest of the costs. amy, i looked online at your plan. it's two paragraphs, warren said.\n\nfacts first: warren is misleading in her description of buttigieg's plan and wrong on klobuchar's policy, which warren also compared to a post-it note. warren is misleading in her description of buttigieg's plan and wrong on klobuchar's policy, which warren also compared to a post-it note. buttigieg's plan would help lower deductibles and co-pays, in addition to premiums. and klobuchar's proposal is more than two paragraphs.\n\nbuttigieg's proposal , which he calls medicare for all who want it , would create a government-run health insurance plan, known as a public option, that would be sold on the affordable care act exchanges. as warren noted, he would expand federal premium subsidies for obamacare policies so that more americans qualify, and they wouldn't have to pay more than 8.5% of their income for that coverage.\n\nhowever, while buttigieg's proposal doesn't set caps on consumers' out-of-pocket spending, it would reduce what they have to pay for medical care in two ways. he would tie those premium subsidies to gold policies, which typically have lower deductibles and co-pays than the silver plans that obamacare premium subsidies are based on now.\n\nand he calls for increasing cost-sharing assistance, which currently caps what low-income americans who buy obamacare policies have to pay for care, though he doesn't provide details.\n\nklobuchar's website has one page that outlines her health care proposals in five paragraphs that briefly summarize her proposals on health care, prescription drugs, addiction and mental health, reproductive rights and seniors. but each of those paragraphs, except the one on reproductive rights, has a link to other pages with more details on her plans.\n\nwarren supports medicare for all, which would eliminate premiums, deductibles and co-pays, though she would first implement a public option-type plan that would have premiums and co-pays for some americans.\n\n-- tami luhby\n\nbuttigieg on hostility of sanders followers\n\nbuttigieg criticized sanders' handling of bullying by some of his online followers and asked, why did this pattern arise? why is it especially the case among your supporters? sanders retorted, i don't think it is especially the case.\n\nfacts first: while online harassment occurs across the political spectrum and the scope of the issue is hard to quantify, sanders has battled allegations since 2016 that his supporters engage in harassment. a digital media expert who looked into it : while online harassment occurs across the political spectrum and the scope of the issue is hard to quantify, sanders has battled allegations since 2016 that his supporters engage in harassment. a digital media expert who looked into it told cnn that the hostility from some sanders' followers outweighs that of his democratic rivals.\n\nsanders leads the democratic field in raw measures of engagement on social media with more than 10 million followers on twitter and 5 million likes on his campaign's official facebook page.\n\namong unofficial facebook pages created by supporters of democratic candidates, sanders also leads with 2.5 million followers and roughly 58,000 posts between november and january, more than that of all other democratic candidates combined, according to data from the analytics company crowdtangle.\n\nanytime you have far greater numbers, you have far greater potential for harm, said ben decker, who runs the digital investigations consultancy memetica. decker, who has monitored facebook groups supporting democratic candidates and who previously spoke to cnn , said he has observed higher levels of online harassment among sanders' followers relative to those of his democratic rivals.\n\nin january, the washington post reported that sanders supporters had weaponized facebook to spread angry memes about other democratic contenders and cited data showing that since 2019, almost 3,000 active pro-sanders facebook pages have generated more than 290 million shares, likes or other actions.\n\nat a cnn town hall tuesday, sanders said members of his campaign have also experienced harassment, and he disavowed all such behavior. i do not believe in online bullying, he said. end of discussion.\n\n-- curt devine\n\nbloomberg on releasing his tax returns\n\nbloomberg on wednesday claimed that he released his tax returns every year to the public for the 12 years he served as the mayor of new york.\n\ni put up my tax return every year for 12 years in city hall, bloomberg said during his first appearance on the democratic debate stage in las vegas.\n\nhe added that his returns would be out in a few weeks.\n\nwe are preparing it, he said. the number of pages will probably be thousands of pages. i can't go to turbo tax.\n\nfacts first: this is misleading. the billionaire mayor allowed reporters to review his tax documents, but didn't publicly release his full tax returns during his 12-year tenure from 2002 to 2013.\n\nas mayor, bloomberg invited reporters every year from the wall street journal and other outlets to review filings for hours and hours of time with the mayor's accountants, stu loeser, a bloomberg campaign spokesman told cnn. the sessions offered journalists a chance to ask for explanations about every page, schedule and addendum in his taxes, loeser said.\n\nbut in the last peek at the mayor's tax returns in 2013, the journal described those disclosures as highly-redacted, and reported that the documents never quite offered a full view of bloomberg's wealth. for example, the mayor's accountants often used a code letter to represent a range of dollar amounts rather than listing an actual figure, the journal reported.\n\nbloomberg has not released his tax returns since embarking on his presidential campaign, and has also not yet filed financial disclosures required of candidates to the federal election commission.\n\nthe new york times reported in january that bloomberg received a second extension that would allow him to keep the details of his personal wealth under wraps until after millions of americans in 14 states vote on super tuesday. he now has until march 20 to file.\n\n-- donna borak\n\nbloomberg and biden on stop and frisk\n\nbloomberg and biden had an exchange about stop and frisk policing in which both of them got things wrong.\n\nbloomberg said he reduced stop and frisk by 95% after deciding the policy had gone too far, while biden said the decline was due to the obama administration's decision to send monitors to assess the situation.\n\nfacts first: bloomberg was misleading by omission when he cited a 95% decline in stop and frisk without explaining that the reduction happened only in the last two years of his 12-year mayoralty, following a 605% increase in his first 10 years.\n\nand while biden was correct that bloomberg fought the appointment of a monitor to oversee new york city's compliance with a court order to reform stop and frisk, he was misleading on two other points about the monitor.\n\nbiden claimed the monitor was sent by the obama administration, though the monitor was a private lawyer appointed by a federal judge with the obama administration's endorsement.\n\nbiden also gave the false impression that the monitor was the reason the number of stops declined.\n\nwhat bloomberg said\n\nbloomberg delivered his now-familiar narrative about how his administration reduced the use of stop and frisk by 95% after he discovered too many stops were occurring.\n\nwhat bloomberg didn't mention, as usual, was when this decline happened . while there was indeed a 95% drop in stops, it occurred after a 605% increase in the use of stop and frisk over his first 10 years in office.\n\nin claiming to have come to a discovery (his campaign says it happened around may or june of 2012) about the excesses of the policy, bloomberg also omitted the fact that he continued to advocate stop and frisk for years after he supposedly had this change of heart. and he did not mention the pressure he had faced from the federal judge who had signaled in 2012 that she would soon rule against new york's use of stop and frisk. (you can read a full fact check here .)\n\nwhat biden said\n\nafter bloomberg spoke, biden argued that the reason stop and frisk actually declined was that president barack obama sent moderators to new york city to oversee the city's use of stop and frisk, appearing to mean monitors. he then added: our administration sent in people to monitor it.\n\nthe obama department of justice did recommend to a federal judge who was hearing a lawsuit against stop and frisk that she appoint an independent monitor to oversee new york city's compliance with a reform order she might issue in the event she found its use of stop and frisk unconstitutional.\n\nthe judge, shira scheindlin, found new york city's use of the policy unconstitutional, in august 2013, and did appoint a monitor. but this was her decision, not the obama administration's. the monitor , peter zimroth, was a lawyer at a private firm, not someone from the federal government who could have been sent by the president.\n\nbiden was correct that bloomberg argued against the appointment of a monitor. because the bloomberg administration in new york city appealed the ruling and won a freeze in october 2013, zimroth's work was put on hold until november 2014 , under bloomberg's successor bill de blasio, who dropped the bloomberg-era appeal.\n\nbut biden was incorrect that the monitor was the reason the use of stop and frisk declined: the number of stops had already plummeted by the time zimroth started in 2014. the 95% decline transpired between the first quarter of 2012 and the fourth quarter of 2013.\n\n-- daniel dale

(general motors was the main manufacturer rescued by the obama administration.)\n\nwhile most banks survived, close to 10 million homeowners lost their houses to foreclosure; millions of people lost their jobs.\n\nthat overwhelming tilt in favor of helping struggling businesses instead of suffering individuals is, in my view, one of the reasons populism gained strength, as demonstrated by elections throughout western democracies in the 2010s.\n\nthis time, the source of the problem is not a breakdown in the financial system. this is very different. we now face a major health assault. the pandemic is not only causing illnesses and straining health care resources, it is attacking the economy from a multitude of angles. manufacturers are facing supply chain disruption, shortages are developing and demand is collapsing.\n\nit's a supply-and-demand pincer move unlike any we've seen before, made more acute by uncertainty over how severe it will be and how long it will last.\n\nthe obvious first order of business is clear: everyone should have access to health care right now. it's not only the humane thing to do, it's the smartest way to slow the contagion. people who become infected should not fear bankruptcy if they go to the doctor. if they do, the epidemic will continue to spread.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter. join us on twitter and facebook\n\nthat is more important in the us than in any other developed country, because the us has a mind-boggling number of uninsured people. since trump came to office, the numbers have been climbing as he tries to dismantle the affordable care act, or obamacare. millions lost coverage in 2018, bringing the number of uninsured to 27.5 million, according to the us census. (the administration is still in court trying to end obamacare.)\n\nit should go without saying that testing for the virus should be free.\n\nthat's just the start. as economists predict the world may soon plunge into recession, some are promoting a modest cash payment to every individual to stimulate consumption and help the most vulnerable navigate this crisis. that seems reasonable.\n\nthe government should require businesses to provide paid time off to employees. that is not overreach; it is for the protection of all of us. and for the tens of millions who work in the gig economy, who do not get paid if they don't work, financial assistance should be made available immediately, so that uber drivers and grubhub delivery people don't find it necessary to keep working while they're sick, potentially driving the virus from one home to another.\n\nbut that's not all. that's the individual side of the coronavirus emergency package.\n\nthe government should help the business sector as well. the fed is doing what it can, injecting cash into the economy, but covid-19 poses a mortal threat to the travel industry. authorities are reasonably urging people to avoid cruise ships; they are steering people away from air travel and recommending social distancing, which means no restaurants, no large public events, no movies.\n\nthe right thing to do is to help the affected industries survive.\n\nin the midst of an election campaign, we will surely hear complaints about socialism for businesses, but that would be misguided. america should have smart, humane capitalism.\n\ngo ahead, bail out the airlines if they need it. give a hand to the industries that suffer the harshest blow. offer low-interest credit to small businesses, to restaurants, dry cleaners, landscaping companies.\n\nand, if the economy does tip into recession, extend unemployment benefits. instead of slashing food stamps and other aid to the poor, as the trump administration is doing, expand it. protect workers and support business. that's not just the moral thing to do, all of these measures will help the economy get back on its feet faster.\n\nhow would the government pay for all this?\n\ntrump found it possible to dig a trillion-dollar hole in the budget for a tax cut during good times. that was elective, unnecessary. this is urgent, indispensable.\n\nhelp the people; help businesses; give the market system a hand when it's about to stumble.\n\nthis is not a problem that will be solved by blaming the news media as trump did amid the market selloff. it requires smart, humane, energetic action.\n\nif trump resists these measures, those around him who can still seek to persuade him can explain that after enacting these policies, when this is all over, trump can claim it was his brilliance that made it stop.

(photo by joe raedle/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\npresident donald trump once said taking executive action on immigration was an unconstitutional action that could lead to impeachment.\n\ntrump's past comments are at odds with his current plans to declare a national emergency and other executive actions to secure funding for a border wall.\n\ntrump made the comments on fox news' fox and friends in november 2014 when asked about executive actions by then-president barack obama that would halt deportations for the undocumented parents of children born in the united states.\n\nnow he has to use executive action and this is a very, very dangerous thing that should be overwritten easily by the supreme court, trump said.\n\nso we're looking now at a situation, it should absolutely not pass muster in terms of constitutionality, but it depends on what these justices do, he added.\n\nthe white house did not return a request for comment.\n\ntrump was also asked if the obama had committed any impeachable offenses. he said obama could certainly be impeached for his executive action on immigration.\n\nwell, he certainly did something that was unconstitutional, trump said. now, it depends on justice (john) roberts. if he wants to just curry favor in the beltway like he did with obamacare, because that's the only reason he did it. because he knows he was wrong, but it certainly depends on what happens. i mean, i think certainly he could be impeached and certainly they could shut down the government.\n\nthe comments from trump echo a tweet he sent, also from november 2014, in which he wrote, repubs must not allow pres obama to subvert the constitution of the us for his own benefit & because he is unable to negotiate w/ congress.
president trump boasted last week that millions of people are joining association health plans, one alternative to obamacare that he's planning to expand.\n\nnow here's the good news. we've created associations, millions of people are joining associations. millions. that were formerly in obamacare or didn't have insurance. or didn't have health care. millions of people, he said in an interview with the new york times. it could be as high as 50%. you watch. so that's a big thing.\n\nassociation health plans, along with short-term health policies, are at the heart of trump's drive to increase choice and lower costs in the health insurance market -- and chip away at the affordable care act.\n\nhowever, no one has joined these new associations yet. the trump administration has yet to act on the president's executive order that would expand access to these groups.\n\ntrump unveiled the executive order in mid-october, shortly after congress ran out of time to repeal and replace obamacare. federal agencies still haven't released proposed regulations, though trump's directive gave them 60 days to consider doing so.\n\nthe department of health and human services declined to comment. the department of labor and office of management and budget did not return requests for comment. health policy experts expect the proposed rules to be issued this month. then, it could take weeks or months for the insurance plans to appear on the market.\n\nrelated: trump begins obamacare dismantling with executive order\n\nthe president says the executive order will boost competition, give consumers more options and lower premiums. critics, however, argue that these policies would provide skimpier coverage and would raise the cost of plans on the obamacare exchanges by siphoning off younger and healthier consumers.\n\nmuch will depend on how the new regulations are written, but here are the kind of policies americans could buy if trump's plan is realized:\n\nassociation health plans: these plans are usually sponsored by trade organizations or interest groups. small businesses, and possibly individuals, could find it easier to obtain health insurance through association health plans, which would let them leverage their greater numbers to secure less expensive policies.\n\nassociation health plans have existed for decades, though they have a long history of fraud and insolvency, which left some policyholders and providers on the hook for millions of dollars in unpaid claims, said experts from georgetown university's health policy institute. the affordable care act largely eliminated their advantage because it required the plans to meet the same comprehensive regulations as the small business insurance market.\n\nthe trump administration could amend the rules governing these plans so they are no longer subject to state regulation, said health policy experts. instead, the nationwide plans may come under the same federal oversight as large-employer policies, which are not subject to all of obamacare's mandates. for instance, large-employer plans don't have to provide comprehensive coverage that includes prescription drug, substance abuse and maternity benefits. eliminating these would make plans less expensive, but could leave policyholders who need these benefits out in the cold.\n\nhave you belonged to an association health plan or do you wish to join one? is a short-term health insurance policy right for you? email healthcarestories@cnn.com and you could be included in an upcoming article.\n\nalso, small businesses with sicker workers could find themselves paying higher premiums than their peers with a healthier workforce. while companies can't exclude or charge higher premiums to individual workers based on their pre-existing conditions, the rates an employer pays as a whole are based on the health status of its workers. under obamacare, a small business' premium is not determined by its workers' medical history.\n\nrelated: how trump's executive order can hurt those with pre-existing conditions\n\nassociation plans also could try to cherry pick small businesses with younger and healthier staffers by charging very high premiums or offering skimpier benefits to firms with older and sicker workers or those with more women, who tend to use more health care services.\n\nshort-term health plans: the obama administration limited the duration of short-term health plans to no more than 90 days in order to make them less attractive. the executive order is expected to lift that cap, enabling consumers to buy policies that would last just under a year.\n\nthe advantage: short-term plans don't have to adhere to obamacare's regulations so consumers would have a wider array of options with lower monthly rates.\n\nthe disadvantage: these policies can exclude those with pre-existing conditions or base rates on consumers' medical history. they can also offer skimpier benefits so policyholders may have to pay more out of pocket if they actually need care.\n\nif someone is healthy, they could have the option of a less expensive, less comprehensive policy, but there is a risk, said cori uccello, senior health fellow at the american academy of actuaries.\n\nrelated: what's in trump's health care executive order?\n\nthese plans have also been around for a long time, but those who have them are not considered insured and are subject to the obamacare penalty. of course, that won't be a concern starting next year since congress has effectively repealed the individual mandate requiring nearly all americans to have coverage.\n\nstates would likely retain oversight of these policies and could impose their own rules, said sabrina corlette, research professor at georgetown's health policy institute. for instance, new york and new jersey currently don't let insurers sell short-term plans that don't comply with obamacare -- and no short-term plans are available in either of those states.\n\nat least two major insurers have indicated they are eager to expand their offerings.\n\nunitedhealth (unh) already has about 300,000 members in association health plans. the performance is strong and generally in keeping with our broader portfolio, dan schumacher, the insurer's president, said in its october earnings call. unitedhealth is also excited to see the duration of short-term policies extended, he said.\n\nat aetna (aet), ceo mark bertolini said the company is looking to jump start its short-term policy offerings.\n\nwe are actually looking at reenergizing a program we had prior to the aca, but [with] more [of] a focus [on a] short-term, one-year kind of plan, or transition plan, versus just the skinny benefit, which leaves a lot of people at some moral harm at some point, he said in the company's october earnings call. and so we have to think about what kind of plan it would look like ... we're already all over that. as soon as the executive order came out, we were on top of it.\n\nthe executive order would also expand employers' ability to give workers cash to buy coverage elsewhere under a system known as health reimbursement arrangements. the agencies were given 120 days to propose these regulations.

who has pledged to restore congressional oversight, rothfus says\n\neditor's note: rep. keith rothfus, a republican, represents pennsylvania's 12th district in the us congress. the opinions expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n\n\n(cnn) —\n\nhouse republicans have had a tough decade. many of us elected in 2010, 2012 and 2014 went to washington to challenge president obama's big-government, progressive agenda that was sending our country down the wrong track, driving up debt, and imposing growth-choking, washington-knows-best regulations on our health care, financial services, energy and other industries.\n\nphoto: courtesy keith rothfus rep. keith rothfus (r-pa)\n\nalthough president obama and congressional liberals blocked many of our efforts, we have enacted critical opioid, infrastructure, human trafficking and veterans legislation. and while the obama agenda has not been stopped, it has been slowed. in the past 5½ years, congressional republicans blocked, among other things:\n\nan additional $850 billion in deficit spending;\n\nincome tax increases on 99% of the american people;\n\nthe closing of the guantanamo bay terrorist detention center; and\n\na job-killing carbon tax.\n\nwe've also exposed agencies and high-ranking officials who violated fundamental precepts of public service. we've put bills on the president's desk to repeal obamacare and block implementation of onerous epa rules. and the senate has exercised its constitutional prerogative to decline consideration of the supreme court nominee of a president who has willfully overstepped his constitutional limits.\n\na platform for the future\n\nanother important thing we have done is to develop a first-of-its-kind platform: a better way. if implemented, a better way would not only restore american leadership in the world, it would generate a true economic expansion that would lift wages, increase job opportunities and generate revenues that will help us keep the commitments we've made to our seniors and veterans.\n\nbut our proposals for health care, tax and regulatory reform, strengthening security and generating upward mobility will only become reality if someone in the white house signs our legislation. that is the fulcrum on which we sit. we simply cannot afford another four years of sputtering zero to 2% economic growth. that is the consequence if a better way is not enacted into law. hillary clinton's status quo, big-government policies will only lead to more debt, doubt and decline.\n\nwhile i appreciate the concerns i hear from some constituents and fellow members about the choices the american people face this november, i encourage everyone to consider something that has been missing in this debate. it actually concerns one of the planks in our better way platform, and that has to do with the people with which i serve – the members of the united states congress.\n\nin a better way, we describe how congress can reclaim its constitutional responsibilities. those responsibilities go to the heart of the notion of self-rule. our founders recognized that in our country, the people are the sovereign. the people exercise that sovereignty through elected representatives, who in turn enact laws to which the people are subject. if the people do not consent to those laws, they can change their representatives.\n\nregulatory superstate\n\nour regulatory, administrative superstate, however, has replaced the sovereignty of the american people with the sovereignty of unelected and unaccountable washington bureaucrats. while the american people can replace the members of congress, they cannot replace the unelected bureaucrats who have promulgated 600 major rules over the last seven years that will have an estimated cost of billions to implement. those rules are among the man-made headwinds that are strangling economic growth, keeping wages stagnant and forcing jobs overseas.\n\nwhen you couple the regulatory leviathan with our broken appropriations process, where congress gets cornered into take-it-or-leave-it omnibus spending bills that grotesquely limit its spending power, the legislative branch today exercises far less authority than the constitution grants to it.\n\nbut now the good news. our historic better way platform puts us on offense. this is fitting, because we, the people's representatives, are the ones who should be setting the nation's policy agenda. it is in congress where government of, by and for the people happens.\n\nwhat then, of the presidential election? the simple fact is that only one of the candidates will sign our proposals. indeed, donald trump has committed to signing the reins act, which requires congressional approval before major rules and regulations become effective. significantly, the reins act represents the most far-reaching restoration of congressional constitutional authority in history.\n\ndonald trump is following our lead on other matters as well. for example, his tax plan has evolved to conform more closely to our tax plan in the better way.\n\nour three branches of government are supposed to be independent and separate. that means, for example that if a republican were in the white house, a republican congress would still be free to exercise its own, independent constitutional role. and there should be a healthy tension between the branches.\n\ni would expect such with a republican congress and a trump administration. unlike the manner in which congressional democrats have circled the wagons to defend president obama's unconstitutional overreach and clinton's email debacle, benghazi lies and failed tenure at the state department, i fully expect to see a republican congress hold a president trump accountable.\n\nwe have already seen, for example, members of our party disagree with trump when he expresses opinions that are inconsistent with their own.\n\nholding president trump accountable\n\nholding a president trump accountable includes ensuring he keeps the commitments he has made to conservatives, especially regarding nominations to the supreme court. who knows, as we conduct such oversight, it is possible our democratic colleagues may finally understand that a large part of the past six years of gop house control has not been about like or dislike of president obama, but about his failed policies and the protection of institutional, constitutional prerogatives of the united states congress.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nand while a trump administration will be subject to checks and balances from a republican congress, i expect a president trump to exercise the executive branch's checks and balances as well.\n\nit would be great to see trump help congress find spending discipline by forcing congress to abandon its bipartisan, spend-by-omnibus tradition. he should veto any of these thousand-page, trillion-dollar bills that reach his desk.\n\nin doing so, he would be following through on president reagan's 1988 admonition that congress shouldn't send another one of these to the president. president reagan never made good on his veto threat for such bills; president trump should. he should accompany that veto with a demand that congress send him a two-week continuing resolution to fund the government temporarily, during which time congress should work round the clock to get individual appropriations bills to his desk.\n\nnone of this happens, however, if hillary clinton is president. with donald trump, you have someone who has already pledged to sign transformative legislation to restore congressional oversight, has embraced tax reform and health care reform proposals similar to those in a better way and pledged to support conservative nominees to the supreme court.\n\nshould he not follow through on these commitments, congress will exercise stringent oversight. in other words, a trump administration offers a rare opportunity for a resurgent legislative branch.\n\nours is a unique moment in history. it is time for congress to step up and into the role the founders envisioned for the branch closest to the people. that makes this coming election day a date with destiny we should embrace.
(cnn) cnn commentators and guest analysts offer their take on sunday night's second presidential candidate debate. the opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors\n\ndavid gergen: trump blows a big one\n\nwhatever chance donald trump still had of capturing the white house largely evaporated sunday night in his second debate with hillary clinton.\n\ncoming off the worst 10 days of any campaign in recent history, trump desperately needed a win in order to reverse his slide in the polls. he was indeed better than in the first debate and she was not as commanding. even so, he blew his opportunity for victory in the first 20 minutes and could never fully recover. cnn's poll found that by 57-34%, a majority of voters watching them thought she got the best of him.\n\nhis loss came through a series of bizarre moments. the first was his surprise pre-debate appearance with four female accusers of bill clinton. while a case can be made for re-hearing their claims of long ago, the event seemed like a stunt and trump never made real use of it in the debate.\n\nbut more damning still was the way he handled the disgusting video from 11 years ago in which he made vulgar sexual remarks. trump could possibly have achieved a measure of forgiveness if he had issued a sincere, thoughtful apology about his past as well as some ugly incidents in this campaign. but his apology was limited in scope, seemed slightly dismissive, and went off track when he mixed isis into the conversation.\n\njust watched trump vs. the moderators at the town hall debate replay more videos ... must watch trump vs. the moderators at the town hall debate 01:39\n\nadding insult to injury, he then went into an incredulous rant about hillary's deleted emails. it was an entirely legitimate attack until he vowed that if elected, he would instruct his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to pursue her and that if he were president today, she would be in jail.\n\nsay what? those are the way tin-pot dictators act, jailing their political opponents. if he had done a half hour studying up (something that seems beyond him), he would know that under the law, a president can request -- but not order -- the justice department to appoint a special prosecutor and justice must then make a decision independent from white house control. trump has a strange tropism toward richard nixon, forgetting that such safeguards were put in place precisely because of his abuses of power.\n\noverall, trump's debate performance may have given heart to his base supporters, stopping his slide, but did little to bring new voters into the fold, especially women. voter preferences are now hardening, and more trouble could lie ahead.\n\nin the next few days, we will learn whether the rnc and other gop stalwarts rally behind him or pull more plugs. we will see, too, whether he and his vice presidential pick, michael pence, patch up their differences.\n\nhaving told moderator anderson cooper that he never actually groped or assaulted any women the way he bragged about in the tape, trump's apology also leaves him wide open to new women contradicting his claims and to new tapes of scurrilous remarks.\n\nhillary's team shouldn't yet measure the drapes in the oval office, but i bet their transition folks are now working with fresh energy. victory -- and perhaps a big one -- seems almost within their grasp.\n\nerrol louis: trump's shocking threat\n\nerrol louis\n\ndonald trump, with his campaign on the ropes, came out swinging. he made a few solid points, especially on reforming the tax code, but otherwise seemed irritated and irritable, in a continuation of the meltdown that began after a leaked video on friday showed him making lewd comments about women.\n\ntrump struggled with the town hall-style format, frequently looming over clinton as she answered questions, interrupting her frequently and bickering with moderators martha raddatz and anderson cooper over whether he got enough time to respond to questions.\n\nat other points his assertions were downright shocking, such as his blunt threat to, as president, have a special investigator look into hillary clinton's emails and potentially jail her. he also admitted not having paid federal income tax for decades, implying that other wealthy americans do the same and blaming clinton for not reforming the tax code during her years in the senate.\n\nanother startling moment was trump's admission he and his running mate, mike pence, haven't discussed key syria policies and actually disagree on the key issue of whether to launch military strikes at the forces of syrian dictator bashar al-assad, a direct contradiction of what pence said at the recent vice presidential candidates' debate.\n\ntrump did well enough to keep his campaign alive and give hope to his supporters -- but his debate performance did little to counter clinton's main angle of attack: that he's simply not qualified or prepared to serve as president.\n\njust watched 60 seconds of pure vitriol from sunday's town hall debate replay more videos ... must watch 60 seconds of pure vitriol from

no one's surprise there was no sign of the humility or contrition many, including his own supporters, called for in response to the devastating video released on friday showing trump bragging about groping women in the most vile terms. instead, he chose to pivot and go directly on the attack against hillary clinton every chance he got.\n\nat times, trump brought the level of discourse embarrassingly low with all sense of presidential decorum thrown out the window. gone were the pleasantries and respect with trump referring to mrs. clinton as a pronoun (she, her) throughout the evening. clearly this was done on purpose to diminish clinton. she handled it like a seasoned professional, making her look like the adult in the room. trump once again demonstrated why he's temperamentally unfit for the presidency.\n\nhowever, once the conversation turned to more substantive topics, trump was able to focus more on clinton's failed record, forcing her to play defense for much of the night, particularly on her emails, obamacare and energy policy.\n\ntrump did falter badly on syria. he seemingly sided with putin over his own running mate, emphatically saying he disagreed with mike pence on the policy and hadn't even spoken to him about the crisis in syria.\n\nheading into this debate, trump's campaign was possibly mortally wounded. he performed well enough to stop the bleeding, for now. but did he do anything to close the gap with key swing state constituencies he needs to win? doubtful. fortunately for trump, hillary clinton is such a flawed candidate, she was unable to land the knockout blow. this one was a draw.\n\ntara setmayer is former communications director for rep. dana rohrabacher, r-california, and a cnn political commentator.\n\ntim stanley: will trump's good night make a difference?\n\ntimothy stanley\n\ndonald trump had a good night. it started poorly because it had to start poorly; discussion of his locker room banter was bound to be personally embarrassing. he sounded like he was giving a legal deposition. when clinton and the moderators demanded greater clarity, he lost his temper and called bill clinton an abuser of women. i suspect he didn't intend to do that. the man has skin as thin as gossamer.\n\nbut after that the debate turned to clinton, and trump's constant attacks were effective. the problem is that while trump is an eccentric candidate, clinton is a poor one. she struggled to explain why she was running, overused cliches and gave lawyerly answers that sounded like she was squirming. she even let trump tell a good gag at her expense about abraham lincoln.\n\nbut how do we judge victory in this unpredictable climate? for trump it will be warm words from senior republicans and an end to gop withdrawals from his campaign. that does not spell victory in november.\n\ntimothy stanley is a historian and columnist for britain's daily telegraph. he is the author of citizen hollywood: how the

bragging about sexually assaulting women and try to laugh it all off in a debate as locker room talk. but what were the debate moderators supposed to do sunday night? spend more than a few minutes conveying america's utter disgust at this latest example of trump's pattern of misogyny? nah, a few minutes is enough i guess. so on to policy, right?\n\nno, because almost as depressing was trump's repeated unwillingness to actually answer the questions that were posed to him. how would trump ensure that pre-existing conditions are still covered by health insurance without some sort of universal coverage mandate? we don't know, he didn't answer.\n\nwhat would trump do about the refugee crisis in syria? we don't know, he didn't answer — twice. question after question, trump said nothing. i mean, words came out of his mouth but they barely formed sentences and they definitely didn't form thoughts. he basically vomited fragments of nothingness all over hillary clinton and america. and like clinton, we all just had to sit there — frustrated and annoyed.\n\nwhat's especially depressing is that our media, let alone our democracy, seems ill-equipped to handle anything like trump. martha raddatz and anderson cooper tried, but fact checking trump doesn't work because trump doesn't care about facts. in fact, he denies he's lying as he's lying and then, for extra audacity, accuses everyone else of being liars. i keep waiting for the ghost of george orwell to show up on the debate stage and bite trump on the ankles.\n\ndonald trump is a perverse man who is perverting not only our democracy but the very concept of truth. he tried to win the debate just like one wins a limbo contest — by lowering the bar. that should depress all of us.\n\nsally kohn, a cnn political

candidate would win sunday night's debate. donald trump was emerging out of the fallout from a blistering, embarrassing, potentially fatal recording of him suggesting he's used his celebrity to sexually assault women. in the hours before the debate, he gathered four women who claim they'd been victims of either hillary clinton's husband or her to exploit their pain for his own personal gain. clinton, on the other hand, suffered a significant, if overshadowed, leak about her previously private speeches.\n\nbut it's safe to say, clinton came in with the advantage, and trump came in with an almost impossible recovery mission. he did little to recover, but it's also hard to see where she used that advantage effectively.\n\nhe was undisciplined and puerile, whining about the moderators treating him unfairly, which is never a winning strategy. he missed obvious openings to attack clinton, for example, on the revelations she's advocated for open borders in those private speeches. he lurked behind her uncomfortably while she spoke, a visual he was either unaware of or maybe actually totally aware of.\n\nbut while clinton was cool and collected, and seemed far more comfortable than he did, she had a clear strategy to wait for trump to hang himself, instead of going for the jugular on the easy issue. she had an opportunity tonight to end his campaign for good, either by baiting him into a trap or just throwing a knockout. i'm not sure she did either.\n\nundecided and independent voters will have to decide if they respect her for taking the high ground, or judge her for failing to more aggressively call him out.\n\njeff yang: moderators were winners, trump was not\n\njeff yang\n\nit's hard to imagine that there are pundits who are calling this debate a draw -- or even a victory on points for trump. he blustered, he blathered, he blazed a scorched-earth trail of spite and fury across the stage, and through it all, clinton remained cool, collected and, dare i say it, presidential.\n\nevery slur and slander from 30 years of unhinged clinton hatred was dragged before the audience of uncommitted voters (is there really such a thing as a muslim american uncommitted voter?). none of the attacks stuck, because they seemed nasty and irrelevant, and put trump in the position of being a barker for a particularly unpleasant sideshow.\n\nwhat did stick was the impression that even a modulated trump is entirely unfit for office. his fascistic vow to investigate and jail clinton upon election; his throwing of his running mate mike pence under the runaway trump train; his inability to directly answer any of the moderators' questions -- none of these could've given comfort to members of his party that a trump win would be anything but pyrrhic.\n\nand as for the moderators anderson cooper and martha raddatz: did someone slip peds into their drinking water? this is the first time we've seen this kind of muscular, unyielding and disciplined questioning from the floorkeepers at a debate, and the demand that the candidates actually engage the topics being asked was bracing and refreshing. more of the same at debate 3, please...if there is one after this utter fiasco of a week for the trump campaign.\n\njeff yang is a columnist for the wall street journal and a frequent contributor to radio shows including public radio international's the

failed to bury the 'access hollywood' tape\n\nnayyera haq\n\nit was impossible to tune into this debate without thinking about the leaked tape of trump's comments about women. so it's a good thing the moderators brought it up at the get-go, giving trump a chance to reiterate his apology, let clinton get a jab in, and move his campaign forward.\n\ntrump failed. he failed to take the opportunity to bury the story and instead doubled-down on the locker room talk explanation. trump failed to show his understanding of modern social norms, instead sticking to a sensibility stuck in the culture of the '70s playboy mansion. and he failed to assuage his republican colleagues, who are abandoning his campaign in droves, that he can speak to women voters.\n\neven scarier, trump openly admitted to not understanding laws designed to protect women; in response to a direct question from moderators, trump wouldn't say that grabbing women's genitalia is considered sexual assault.\n\non friday night, president obama signed the sexual assault survivors' rights act. by contrast trump spent the next 72 hours defending locker room talk and rape culture. expect the narrative and evidence of trump being

trump's bragging about sexual assault during a 2005 taping of an entertainment television show, the 2016 presidential election has officially turned into a hunger games styled nightmare for the american people.\n\ntrump's repulsive comments about women cast a shadow over sunday night's second presidential debate in st. louis. over the weekend, scores of high-profile members of the republican establishment finally reached their breaking point, openly calling for trump to drop out of the race.\n\nmoderator anderson cooper bluntly asked trump whether he realized his comments about kissing and groping women without permission amounted to a confession of sexual assault.\n\ntrump characterized his comments as locker room talk and claimed to have great respect for women. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton identified trump as unfit to lead, by virtue of the latest controversy and the litany of racist, sexist and xenophobic comments the billionaire real estate developer has made throughout the campaign.\n\ntrump, who invited to the debate three women who claimed to be victims of sexual harassment and assault by former president bill clinton, responded with a surreal defense of his own words by attacking former president bill clinton as a sexual predator enabled by hillary clinton.\n\nthe most bizarre presidential debate in history featured trump, a candidate rejected by many of his own party's leaders, threatening to appoint a special prosecutor to reopen the fbi investigation into her emails. clinton countered that she was grateful a man like trump was not president. because you'd be in jail, trump shot back, in a line that served as red meat to his core base of supporters.\n\nfaced with insurrection in the ranks of the republican party on a historic scale, trump fought back through his most unvarnished display of anger, petulance and disingenuous concern for the plight of african-americans and latinos, two groups he's routinely offended during his campaign.\n\nclinton found her rhetorical footing answering questions about rising islamophobia that trump's calls for bans on muslims have greatly contributed to. clinton offered a nuanced vision of american society that included muslim americans and differentiated between religious extremists who advocate terror and ordinary americans who happen to practice the islamic faith.\n\nultimately, this second debate, which featured no opening handshake between two candidates who apparently despise one another, illustrated more than just the polarizing nature of contemporary american politics.\n\ntrump's fitness for the presidency has now been openly questioned by some of the leading figures in his own party, including former secretary of state condoleezza rice (who asked him to withdraw) and arizona sen. john mccain (who rescinded his endorsement).\n\nverbal fisticuffs between trump and clinton over emails, tax returns, and sexual assault have turned a presidential contest into a brutal spectator sport filled with vulgar exchanges that made the spectacle unfit to be watched by children. a largely substance free example of the worst kind of political theater — one largely devoid of serious policy discussion — this debate exemplified how modern day american politics has reached a historic low.\n\npeniel joseph is the barbara jordan chair in

'not unproud' of alicia machado tweet 01:23\n\njulian zelizer: clinton missed a knockout punch\n\ndonald trump attempted to move away from the access hollywood controversy by returning to the themes that animated his primary campaign. he returned to threats from isis, illegal immigration, liberal supreme court justices and hillary clinton's scandals — from email-gate to paid speeches to her husband's sexual past.\n\nat moments he lashed out against clinton in trumpian fashion, going so far as to call her the devil and saying that if he was president she would be in jail. he painted her as a liar and professional politician who says one thing and then does something else.\n\nif the goal was to stop, at least temporarily, the incessant discussion of his comments on the bus with billy bush and the calls for him to step down, trump was successful. he probably re-energized some of his base and turned attention back to clinton's controversies. there were several moments when clinton found herself on the defense and stumbled in her responses.\n\nthe problem is that the debate can't remake the basic character of this candidacy or the problems that he has created. the access hollywood tapes were the tip of a very big iceberg. he apologized for the comments, yet without much gusto. on top of that, there are very likely more trump controversies on the way.\n\nthe long list of prominent republicans who have announced they now will not vote for trump is well known. the deep record of polarizing and controversial positions and statements won't go away. within this debate itself, there were many occasions when trump reminded undecided voters about why so many republicans are not on his side. when he threatened to put his opponent in jail on live television he crossed another boundary in campaign history. he even seems to disagree about policy with his vice presidential running mate.\n\nthe reason the tape had such an impact was because of who trump has been and the kind of campaign that he has run since entering the race. it is hard to see how this debate enables trump to broaden his electoral base, which is essential if he wants to win.\n\nwhile trump was able to use this debate to shift attention away from the recording, he didn't score a win in terms of the overall quality of the debate (his answers were filled with misstatements, vague references and scattershot statements on unrelated issues) and he didn't erase the problems that he has created for his party. however, clinton didn't accomplish the kind of knockout punch that her supporters were hoping for.\n\njust watched clinton: repealing obamacare would be a loss for all replay more videos ... must watch clinton: repealing obamacare would be a loss for all 02:08\n\nfrida ghitis: trump showed he doesn't get it\n\nfrida ghitis\n\nthe top question on everyone's mind was how trump would handle the issue of the tape in which he speaks in deeply offensive ways about women. on that topic, he showed he absolutely does not get it. this was locker room talk, he said several times (then awkwardly pivoted to talk about isis.) and even though he added, i'm not proud of it. i apologize..., the repeated mantra that it was locker room talk showed he believes it's only natural, really ok for men to refer to women in those terms, and perhaps even to sexually assault women in the way he described in that tape.\n\nthat may satisfy his core supporters. in fact, his entire performance may have played well with his most devoted followers, but it's hard to imagine that many independents watched this debate and decided to vote for trump. his base feels good now, but he didn't persuade many undecideds, and certainly didn't peel away any clinton supporters.\n\nhe came across as a rude, overbearing and nasty man. she has tremendous hate in her heart, he said, looming over hillary clinton and pacing while she spoke. when he spoke, she sat listening, almost never interrupting him, even when he lied; a painful sacrifice clinton has decided she must make in order not to be seen as pushy, or unlikable, or some other unfeminine trait.\n\nin one jaw-dropping moment, trump threatened to put hillary clinton in prison if he becomes president, marking a new low for american democracy in an election season filled with new lows.\n\nsome of his attacks on clinton landed forcefully, such as on her emails and speeches. clinton could have defended herself more forcefully and attacked more frequently. but the overwhelming tone of the debate was one of trump making harsh personal attacks against his rival, pleasing hillary-haters and turning off voters trying to make up their minds.\n\non foreign policy, it was also one shocking statement after another. he said he disagreed with his running mate mike pence and his roundly praised statements on syria. pence said he would consider attacking russia and the syrian regime if they don't stop the slaughter in aleppo. trump said no, and offered a policy that surely brought cheers in damascus and syria. then he made bizarre statements, such as russia is new in terms of nuclear, we are old and tired.\n\ntrump repeated old lies, such as the claim that he opposed the war in iraq. when clinton said that claim had been debunked (as it has) he cut in, leaning into the microphone and uttering has not been debunked, sounding like alec baldwin playing donald trump.\n\non the whole, trump put on a performance that undoubtedly made his diehard fans feel reassured, but one that confirmed that he does not understand what is wrong with his attitude toward women, toward muslims and toward russia, and reminding us that he has a jumbled, dangerous foreign policy, and continues to undercut america's fundamental democratic traditions.\n\nfrida ghitis is a world affairs columnist for the miami herald and world politics review, and a former cnn producer and correspondent. follow her

also says we should've taken their oil. guarding immobile, sometimes flammable infrastructure, while plundering and pillaging a sovereign nation is colonialism. had more republicans actually paid attention to take their oil, at least they wouldn't have been surprised by grab them by the p---y.\n\nbecause islamophobia is misogyny is racism. my god, my race, my wealth, my gender, or what have you, permits me to do unto you as i'd never accept being done unto me. take their oil. settle their land. grope their bodies.\n\nin response to a question about islamophobia, trump told an allegedly undecided muslim voter— a term that makes about as much sense as clean coal -- that we have to keep in mind the problem of terrorism.\n\nif the moderators had been bolder, they'd have asked donald trump if the violence by radical white supremacists permits us to infringe on the rights of white americans generally.\n\nwe should not, as melania trump pleaded, simply forgive her husband's indiscretions, and move on to the important issues. the average trump voter is not motivated by economic anxiety. stop finding politically correct terms for blatant racists. they'd rather we undo decades of social progress than yield an inch on exploitative structures that keep them powerful.\n\nas we were reminded this friday, that privilege isn't ever benign. it came about through violence, and maintains itself through violence: over bodies, over land, over culture. i'd hoped trump would be out of the race by this weekend, but it seems even sexual predation isn't enough to wake our country up. don't ask if clinton won or lost. ask what happened to us.\n\nharoon moghul is a senior fellow at the center for global policy. his next book, how to be a muslim, will be out in

have lost the debate. at the combination town hall/presidential debate that politico described as the most consequential forum in history, donald trump repeatedly clashed with the moderators and made himself look awfully small over the course of 90 minutes. overall, hillary clinton's steady presence triumphed over trump's typically uneven performance.\n\nfrom the start, trump seemed exhausted and low energy as he faced off with clinton. the first question of the night, about whether each candidate was modeling appropriate behavior for young people, was one that was certainly expected. but trump blew it. he missed his chance to show genuine contrition for his recently revealed behavior. instead his explanation for his lewd remarks about the access hollywood host and a soap opera actress was that it was locker room talk. this was a weak rationalization that will not improve his standing with women -- or anyone who has ever been in a locker room in their life.\n\ntrump's body language was especially revealing tonight. he fidgeted. he paced the stage. at times he lurked behind clinton, giving off a creepy stalker vibe. and, just like the last debate, he seemed stricken with a case of the sniffles. these were all distractions on top of his rambling answers. consider that he answered a question from a muslim woman about islamophobia by apparently encouraging racial profiling of muslim americans. or that he may have conceded that he did not pay federal income taxes for years.\n\nworse, once again trump could not resist interrupting clinton, or making coarse comments -- like his statement that if he were president, he would have a special prosecutor investigate her and that she would be jailed. does he not understand that using the judicial branch to go after your political opponents is against the law? his statement that clinton has tremendous hate in her heart showed a stunning lack of self-awareness from the man who has disparaged latinos, immigrants, a gold star family, a former miss universe, and people with disabilities -- among others.\n\nfor her part, clinton provided clear answers on her positions on everything from the affordable care act to syria. she was prepared for the inevitable questions about wikileaks and her deleted emails. her best answer of the evening was likely when she enumerated the qualifications she would look for in a supreme court justice.\n\nthis was the rare evening where trump faced a high bar in terms of what he had to accomplish. not only did he not manage effective damage control of his latest scandal, it seems unlikely that he won over any undecided or independent voters tonight. however, he likely may have alienated some with his boorish, petulant behavior on full display.\n\ntoward the end of this town hall debate that featured relatively few questions from the audience, trump described the american nuclear program as we're old, we're tired, we're exhausted. he could have been describing his sub-par performance.\n\nraul a. reyes is an attorney and member of the usa today board of contributors. follow him @raulareyes\n\nroxanne jones: a pitch to his base\n\nroxanne jones\n\nif i were watching a vegas lounge act, i may have gotten a few chuckles at some of donald trump's quick comebacks during the debate. too bad, this is a campaign for the highest office in the land, and not a comedy night. it's not one-liners most voters are looking for but substance, strategy and clear vision to move america forward. we deserve so much more from the man who wants to be president.\n\nafter coming out of the box sounding more like a playground punk, trump picked it up a bit when he took hillary clinton to task for deleting thousands of emails while she was secretary of state. she apologized (again), took responsibility (again) and said if she had it to do over again, she would not have used her private server. clinton was wrong. she was investigated and cleared of any illegal acts. you either believe her, or not. move on.\n\nunemployment rates in the u.s. stand at 5.0%, that's 7.9 million out of work americans. for blacks and hispanics, the picture is bleaker (black 8.3%, hispanics 6.4%). and notice that trump did not deny sending jobs to china by buying low-grade chinese metal to build his buildings. not exactly a winning jobs strategy for americans.\n\njust watched trump on the

terrorism. will the next president send our sons and daughters to war? trump doesn't seem to be too worried about the middle east. he shockingly admitted that he hadn't talked to pence about aleppo, and when pressed by moderator martha raddatz, he couldn't come up with one detailed answer about how he would handle the war in syria. one of the major issues of our time and he has no plan. that's beyond troubling.\n\nbut then again, i suspect, talking about foreign policy, a solid jobs plan, college costs are not topics that come up during locker room banter, where apparently trump does his best talking, bragging about groping women and encouraging sex assault. so while trump may have looked more poised than what we saw in his bombastic behavior during the first debate, he did little to appeal to voters outside of his diehard followers, for whom he can do no wrong. and he'll need more than them to win.\n\ni've been in my share of locker rooms covering sports over the past 20 years and while lewd talk is real, i've yet to hear an athlete use the crude, childlike words trump used describing how he approaches women: grab them by the p—y. ... you can do anything.\n\nclinton was in

more people have health insurance than ever before, but many still struggle to pay for care. according to a new report, medical debt is the no. 1 reason consumers reported being contacted by a collection agency. if efforts to overhaul the affordable care act result in more people losing their coverage, those numbers could rise.\n\nthe study by the consumer financial protection bureau found that 59% of people who reported they had been contacted by a debt collector said it was for medical services. telecommunications bills were the second most common type of overdue bill for which debt collectors pursued payment, at 37%, and utilities were third, reported by 28%.\n\nunlike other types of debt, people with medical debt were prevalent across a range of income levels, credit scores and ages. the survey sample was drawn from the cfpb's consumer credit panel, a random sample of credit records from one of the three major credit reporting agencies.\n\nconducted between december 2014 and march 2015, the survey asked respondents about their experiences over the past year with debt collectors.\n\nrelated: trump and obamacare: where we go from here\n\nhaving medical debt turned over to collections can be a double whammy.\n\nit's not just that people may be reluctant to go for care because of the debt they might incur, said mark rukavina, a boston-based health care consultant whose work has focused on affordability and medical debt. it might also ruin their credit. having a medical bill in collection can substantially reduce consumers' credit scores, rukavina said.\n\nthe affordable care act required nonprofit hospitals to take several steps to retain their federal nonprofit status, including establishing written charity care policies. hospitals must determine whether patients are eligible under their policies and provide it for those who are. they also must limit how much uninsured patients are charged and restrict aggressive billing and collections activities. under those rules, nonprofit hospitals are barred from initiating extraordinary collection actions (such as reporting to credit bureaus, garnishing wages or placing a lien on property or taking legal action) until 120 days after the first billing statement is sent.\n\nrelated: trump's hhs pick: right to medicaid may not be guaranteed\n\nalthough the rule doesn't apply to for-profit hospitals, the regulation introduced a federal standard for reporting medical debt, rukavina said.\n\nthe proportion of families that said they were having trouble paying their medical bills declined between september 2013, before the health law's insurance marketplaces opened in 2014, and march 2015, according to an analysis by the urban institute. the study found that the percentage of families that had problems paying medical bills declined from 22% in 2013 to 17.3% in 2015. being uninsured, having a low income and enrolling in a high-deductible plan each increased the odds of having trouble paying medical bills, the study found.\n\nrepublicans have vowed to press ahead with plans to repeal the affordable care act, but since they don't have enough votes in the senate to get a full repeal through, they are initially focusing on specific provisions that can be undone by a simple majority vote during the budget process. the nonpartisan congressional budget office reported last week that under a republican plan last year to partially repeal the law, 18 million people would become uninsured in the first year, rising to 32 million in 2026.\n\nbecause more people would be uninsured, they'd be exposed to the full cost of their care and you'd very likely see the number of people who are carrying medical debt increase, said sara collins, vice president of health care coverage and access at the commonwealth fund, whose biennial insurance surveys examine issues of medical debt and underinsurance.\n\nrelated: repealing obamacare affects everyone\n\nif that happens, consumer protections could be even more important. before the health law passed in 2010, some states passed hospital fair pricing laws that generally restricted how much hospitals could charge uninsured patients for care to no more than what is paid by public and private insurers. the law typically also required hospitals to provide free care to low-income uninsured patients.\n\nthe laws were often initiated in response to aggressive billing and collection practices by hospitals, which would charge uninsured patients far higher rates than those paid by insured patients, who benefited from discounts negotiated by their health plans.\n\nthe health law drew on elements of state fair pricing laws, and republican senator chuck grassley, was instrumental in adding those provisions, according to rukavina. as such, they may be more likely to be retained in a republican replacement to the law.\n\nstate fair pricing laws typically reduce the amount that uninsured patients pay by about 25% to 30%, a recent study found.\n\nsince the affordable care act passed, there hasn't been much new activity at the state level on these laws, but that could change.\n\nin an ideal world, these laws would be redundant or unnecessary, said benedic ippolito, a research fellow at the american enterprise institute who co-authored the study. this type of legislation appears to be a little more relevant now than we would have thought it would be.\n\nkaiser health news is national health policy news service that is part of the nonpartisan henry j. kaiser family foundation.
nota del editor: frida ghitis, exproductora y corresponsal de cnn, es columnista de temas internacionales. es colaboradora frecuente de opinión de cnn, columnista colaboradora de the washington post y columnista de world politics review. síguela en twitter @fridaghitis. las opiniones expresadas en este comentario son propias de la autora.\n\n(cnn) — el yerno y asesor del presidente donald trump, jared kushner, rara vez habla al público. ahora sabemos por qué. cuando se paró en el podio de la casa blanca el jueves, lo que los estadounidenses escucharon fue la escalofriante actuación del creyente en un pequeño gobierno, hecha en un momento en que solo un gran gobierno puede salvar la situación.\n\nde todas las veces que podía ocurrir una pandemia, ¿tuvo que suceder justo durante el reinado de una administración que quiere reducir el gobierno a una fracción de su capacidad? ¿tenía que venir bajo un presidente que no respeta la experiencia o las calificaciones esenciales, que se ha rodeado de personas cuyo talento principal es su capacidad para rendirle homenaje público?\n\nsi alguna vez hubo un momento para un gran gobierno, para programas ambiciosos, para un papel central de las autoridades federales, es ahora. si alguna vez hubo un tiempo para personas calificadas en el gobierno, es ahora.\n\nla presencia translúcida de kushner, su afecto, sin el más mínimo indicio de empatía, en perfecta sincronía con sus insensibles palabras, fue un espectáculo apropiado para nuestros tiempos de pesadilla.\n\nahora sabemos por qué trump lo ha puesto a cargo de tantos problemas insolubles. kushner padece una superabundancia de confianza injustificada en sí mismo. él es un trump introvertido; arrogancia sin rimbombancia.\n\nkushner reprendió a los gobernadores, con ciudadanos que literalmente jadeaban por aire, por pedirle al gobierno federal que ayudara a encontrar ventiladores que salvaran vidas. «no nos pidan cosas cuando no saben lo que tienen en sus propios estados. solo porque tienen miedo, preguntan a sus profesionales médicos y ellos no lo saben», dijo.\n\nen un momento sugirió que la reserva federal de suministros médicos de emergencia no está destinada a los estados. se supone que es nuestra reserva», dijo. no está claro a quién se refería con «nuestra».\n\nes un hecho bien documentado que trump ocupó innumerables puestos gubernamentales con personas completamente descalificadas para sus trabajos. no es sorprendente, entonces, que la implementación de los programas de emergencia esté resultando menos que impresionante. millones de estadounidenses ya han perdido sus empleos apenas unas semanas después de la pandemia, por lo que el congreso aprobó rápidamente billones de dólares en programas de ayuda.\n\nmuchos profesionales del gobierno están haciendo todo lo posible en una emergencia sin precedentes, pero los primeros días del plan de rescate no son alentadores. los trabajadores de restaurantes, desempleados de repente, con familias que alimentar, pueden no recibir el cheque prometido de us$ 1.200 por meses. a pesar de los votos para que las personas contaran con el dinero en dos semanas, parece que podría tomar 20 semanas, es decir, cuatro meses, que los cheques sean enviados por correo.\n\nlas pequeñas empresas que se preguntaban si llegaría la ayuda a tiempo para evitar la bancarrota, vieron con esperanza cuando el secretario del tesoro steven mnuchin dijo el jueves que los préstamos de emergencia estarían disponibles a partir del día siguiente. pero justo cuando habló, los bancos dijeron que todavía necesitaban la orientación de la administración de pequeñas empresas antes de poder desembolsar los fondos.\n\ntrump negó ordenar pase de máxima seguridad para jared kushner 2:56\n\nlos programas son enormes. quizás los problemas puedan resolverse pronto.\n\npero no hay excusa para la incompetencia y las demoras durante esta crisis de coronavirus que han sido resultado directo del desdén de trump & co. por el gobierno.\n\nla realidad ineludible es que algunos desafíos son tan desalentadores que solo el gobierno puede organizar una respuesta efectiva; algunos tan catastróficos, que solo el gobierno federal tiene la fuerza para hacerlo.\n\nlos neoyorquinos mueren a razón de uno cada tres minutos. la economía nacional está ahora en coma inducido, un esfuerzo desesperado por evitar una catástrofe aún mayor. ahora es cuando la tierra debería temblar con los sonidos de la caballería al rescate. en medio de todo esto, trump lanza incansablemente pequeños ataques contra los demócratas, y va a fox news para decirle a sean hannity: «no creo que necesites 40.000 o 30.000 ventiladores», después que andrew cuomo, gobernador del estado que es el epicentro nacional de la pandemia abogara por ayuda urgente.\n\ngabriel sherman, en vanity fair, escribió que, según algunos informes, fue kushner quien le dijo a trump que «…estoy haciendo mis propias proyecciones … nueva york no necesita todos los ventiladores», asegura un participante en una reunión reciente en la casa blanca. andrew cuomo explicó durante un foro de cnn sobre el coronavirus: «es muy simple: una persona ingresa a la unidad de la uci. necesitan el ventilador o muere». la ayuda puede llegar, pero no sin demora.\n\nsi el gobierno federal estuviera en buenas manos, se habría hecho cargo de la crisis mucho antes. trump no habría resistido las llamadas urgentes para promulgar la ley de producción de defensa hace semanas, cuando la cámara de comercio lo persuadió de no usar su poder para ordenar la producción de ventiladores.\n\nahora los estados, observando cómo el maremoto de casos avanza en su dirección, están luchando para asegurar los suministros necesarios. increíblemente, están compitiendo unos contra otros, y ahora compiten contra la agencia federal para el manejo de emergencias (fema).\n\nel jueves en cnn, andrew cuomo hizo una sugerencia tan práctica, tan lógica, que es difícil creer que no se haya implementado. en lugar de que todos luchen simultáneamente por adquirir los mismos productos -incluso de china, nada menos-, ¿por qué no disponer un despliegue continuo de suministros, distribuidos donde se necesitan, a medida que la pandemia aumenta en diferentes estados en diferentes momentos?\n\nimagine una administración proactiva, eficiente, transparente y confiable, coordinando la compra, producción y distribución de ventiladores y equipos de protección a los lugares donde se necesitan, y organizando el transporte de excedentes de un estado a otro, según surja la necesidad.\n\ntrump y el coronavirus: promesas y realidades 3:05\n\nel buen gobierno que desearíamos tener también habría asegurado que todos tengan seguro médico. increíblemente, trump rechazó el jueves una propuesta para reabrir la inscripción de obamacare para que los estadounidenses sin seguro puedan obtener cobertura en medio de proyecciones de que millones podrían enfermarse. incluso las compañías de seguros de salud estaban presionando para eso, pero trump dijo que no.\n\nla casa blanca dice que está explorando otras opciones, pero no está claro cuáles podrían ser. con millones perdiendo sus empleos, y el seguro de la mayoría de las personas vinculado al empleo, la cantidad de personas sin seguro podría aumentar en el peor momento posible.\n\ncon una administración más competente, los barcos del hospital de la marina desplegados con tanta fanfarria no flotarían en su mayoría vacíos, ya que los pacientes se concentran en hospitales desbordados. «una maraña de protocolos militares y obstáculos burocráticos ha impedido que el comfort acepte a muchos pacientes», informó the new york times.\n\nsin un gobierno fuerte y grande, incluso los parangones del capitalismo, las corporaciones icónicas del país, podrían desaparecer. gracias a un estímulo, los contribuyentes los están salvando. el gobierno debería salvar a los contribuyentes, sus medios de vida, sus vidas.\n\npero este gobierno no cree mucho en el gobierno. al principio había prometido «deconstruir» el siniestro «estado administrativo». es dolorosamente evidente cuánto necesitamos administradores experimentados.\n\nparafraseando a una figura de otra crisis, vas a una pandemia con el gobierno que tienes. solo podemos esperar que esta administración mejore rápidamente, y luego deberíamos intentar contar con un mejor gobierno antes de la próxima crisis.
repealing and replacing obamacare not only would change health coverage and costs for tens of millions of americans, it would also give a juicy tax gift to the rich.\n\nrolling back obamacare would provide a nearly $1 trillion tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthy and businesses.\n\nbut if republican repeal efforts fail, house speaker paul ryan signaled tuesday that no one should expect lawmakers to include those tax cuts in tax reform.\n\nif the health care bill doesn't pass, then that trillion dollars of obamacare taxes ... we won't incorporate those in tax reform, ryan said on cnbc's power lunch.we will have to put those off to the side and they will have to be gotten to when we get to health care reform.\n\ngiven how hard repealing obamacare has been so far, there's little reason to assume it will get much easier. so for all intents and purposes those taxes will stand indefinitely. they include a high-income medicare surtax on investment income and on wages over $200,000 ($250,000 if married).\n\nthe likely reason why tax writers have decided to leave obamacare tax cuts off the agenda is cost, plain and simple. it would make their efforts to reform the tax code that much more expensive and therefore harder to pay for. and they will need to pay for it as a condition for passing it with a simple majority in the senate.\n\nadding $1 trillion to the cost of the tax bill would make it even harder to make it revenue neutral. as it is, it's a heavy lift, said roberton williams, a senior fellow at the tax policy center.\n\nrelated: who pays if congress kills the state and local tax deduction\n\ntax reform will be a heavy lift for many reasons. for starters, there are still big disagreements within the republican party itself as to how low tax rates should be and whether it's even necessary to pay for tax cuts.\n\nif they're not paid for, not only would tax reform add substantially to deficits, but under senate rules, they would expire at the end of the budget window instead of becoming permanent, which is what ryan wants.\n\nthe white house has been in regular talks with leaders and top tax writers in the house and senate to come up with a framework for a tax reform bill they can all agree on.\n\ndespite what many skeptics believe, ryan on tuesday said after a speech before the national association of manufacturers that he's confident there will be a tax reform bill on the floor this fall and passage by the end of the year.

(photo by win mcnamee/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthe forced resignation of homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen is not just the usual story of an administration racked by chaos and the short shelf life of almost everyone who works for an imperious and grudge-bearing president.\n\nnielsen was hardly a moderate out of step with president donald trump on his signature issue of immigration. she became the administration's public face of the zero-tolerance policy that caused widespread outrage after hundreds of migrant children were separated from their parents.\n\nbut she is nonetheless paying the price for a crisis exacerbated by the president's decision-making amid a major surge in migrants crossing the border.\n\nher departure is a victory for conservative immigration voices, such as white house policy adviser stephen miller, who have long had trump's ear and are pushing the president to adopt an even more hardline border policy.\n\nit's a sign of a government stocked with acting secretaries and hampered by thin personnel benches, stretched beyond functionality by trump's impulses and the most prodigious staffing burn rate of any modern president.\n\nnielsen's ouster fits with a pattern of trump forcing out officials who have pushed back against his more radical instincts or been unable to carry them out, or who have earned his ire for being unwilling to match his defiance for governing practice and convention. they include former secretary of state rex tillerson, ex-attorney general jeff sessions, former national security adviser h.r. mcmaster and former chief of staff john kelly.\n\nyet there is also a more fundamental reason for nielsen's departure that gets closer to the heart of trump's behavior and political strategy than almost all of the many, previous exits from his administration.\n\nnielsen's demise is the clearest indication yet of the impossibility of reconciling trump's ideological and emotional instincts on immigration – which helped make him president – with legal, humanitarian and international realities.\n\nnielsen believed the situation was becoming untenable with trump becoming increasingly unhinged about the border crisis and making unreasonable and even impossible requests, a senior administration official told cnn's jake tapper on sunday.\n\nher departure mirrors that of former defense secretary james mattis last year, whose authority was shredded by a sudden, and apparently spontaneous announcement of a syria withdrawal by the president, but who had gradually grown apart from his boss.\n\nin both cases, the complexity of serious policy problems, often in life or death situations, clashed with the political instincts of a president who abhors detail and prefers to govern from the gut, while ignoring conventional expertise – even from subordinates that in no way could be considered moderates.\n\nas the crisis on the us-mexico border worsened, trump's tolerance for nielsen snapped.\n\nand the president might also have gone looking for a scapegoat.\n\nlast week, he was forced to climb down on a public threat to close the southern border after officials, business groups and political leaders warned of a pending economic disaster if he went ahead.\n\nhe covered his blushes by going on a tear on immigration, with some of the most unconstrained rhetoric on the issue ever heard by an american president, that was scorching even by the standards of trump himself.\n\ncan't take you anymore. can't take you. our country is full … can't take you anymore, i'm sorry. so turn around. that's the way it is, trump said in a message to asylum seekers during a trip to the border on friday.\n\na day later, trump mocked those fleeing persecution seeking a better life in the united states, portraying asylum seekers as criminals and gang members, rather than the families nielsen described in a cnn interview last week.\n\n'i am very fearful for my life,' trump said mockingly during a speech to the republican jewish coalition on saturday. i am very worried that i will be accosted if i am sent back home. no, no, he'll do the accosting!\n\nasylum, oh give him asylum! he's afraid! trump said.\n\ntense meeting\n\n00:40 - source: cnn secy. kirstjen nielsen is leaving, trump tweets\n\nnielsen's departure, confirmed in a tense white house meeting with trump on sunday afternoon, came after days of speculation and was in retrospect a logical consequence of the president's boiling frustration.\n\nhe had been dissatisfied with nielsen for months, though their relationship appeared to improve marginally during the government shutdown that spanned the turn of the year and turned into another political reverse for trump.\n\nspeculation about her status ballooned last week, after trump suddenly declared that he would halt hundreds of millions of dollars in aid to honduras, el salvador and guatemala, accusing them of sending migrants to the us border.\n\nthe move utterly undercut nielsen who had just days before signed what her department called a historic, regional compact to tackle undocumented migration at its source.\n\nimmigration experts said that the aid cutoff would ultimately make the situation far worse as it would exacerbate the deprivation and lawlessness in central america that is a key driver of migration and asylum claims.\n\nnielsen's departure comes as more critical moments loom for the administration that are likely to test trump's equilibrium at a time when he is already furious about the border situation.\n\nwhen he was not fulminating about immigration over the weekend, he was lashing out at special counsel robert mueller and democratic demands that all of his report should be released.\n\nattorney general william barr, caught between an angry president and democrats in congress after finding there was no evidence to support election collusion between the trump campaign and russia, has pledged to release a redacted version of the report by mid-month.\n\nthe white house is also trying to escape a self-imposed snafu over health care policy after sending confusing signals of whether the president wanted a new bid to replace obamacare before or after the 2020 election.\n\nand this week, the administration is expected to significantly escalate tensions with iran by against throwing caution to the wind by designating the islamic revolutionary guard corps as a terrorist organization, a move some in the defense and intelligence communities fear could expose us personnel in the middle east to reprisals.\n\nimmigration the campaign cornerstone\n\n01:32 - source: cnn cuomo to dhs sec: why's trump viewing fencing, not kids?\n\nas he seeks to manage the immigration crisis, the president now has a chance to insert a like-minded replacement in what in the wake of nielsen's departure looks like an increasingly impossible job.\n\ntrump has already signaled that he will make immigration a centerpiece of his 2020 re-election bid and has every political incentive, since he is basing his hopes of a second term on energizing his base, to turn up the heat on the issue.\n\nthe new secretary will also face the same limits as nielsen. as much as trump rages against asylum claims, they are codified in us and international laws that he in practice cannot just disregard.\n\nhe recently found out that his preferred, dramatic solution of just closing the border would cause a swift and massive economic backlash that in itself could harm his hopes of winning a second term.\n\nthe president is already pushing his power to the limit, and possibly beyond it by seeking to use a national emergency declaration to redirect money already allocated by congress for other projects to the border wall that was at the symbolic center of his 2016 campaign.\n\nfor all his fiery speeches, it is difficult for trump to argue that his hardline approach on immigration is actually working.\n\nafter years of declines, the tide of asylum seeking and undocumented migrants crossing the border has climbed dramatically.\n\nthe white house says us customs and border protection engaged in more than 100,000 border enforcement actions in march – the most for one month in more than a decade.\n\nit argues that trump has reassigned customs officers to the border and directed them to return as many migrants as possible to mexico to wait for immigration proceedings on the southern side of the border.\n\nbut ultimately, there will be no solution to the border problem and the chronic glut in the asylum and court systems, without action by congress.\n\nnielsen did everything she could to make the problem better, a senior department of homeland security official told cnn's geneva sands on sunday.\n\nworst place for you to be is where you need congress to act, the official said.\n\nthe white house wants asylum law tightened and the power to detain families traveling with children – a practice democrats have branded inhumane.\n\ntrump named kevin mcaleenan, the commissioner of us customs and border protection, as acting replacement for nielsen at the department of homeland security.\n\nmcaleenan is not seen as an ideologue and served former president barack obama – so there must be considerable doubt about how long he will also be in the post – but he has less problematic ties with congress than nielsen.\n\nattempts at reaching a broad political solution on the border have been complicated by trump's choice to use immigration as a rallying call for his base and his adoption of rhetoric that stains any political common ground.\n\nhe has several times pulled out of immigration deals with democrats that might have helped mitigate the situation at the border apparently because he feared a backlash from his most fervent supporters and cheerleaders in conservative media.\n\ndemocrats complain that the so-called master of the art of the deal wants to win on all his immigration priorities while offering nothing in return – for example a path to legal status for people brought to the us illegally and who are protected by the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program.\n\nthey also argue that his rhetoric is incompatible with the founding principles of a nation built on immigration.\n\nwhen even the most radical voices in the administration aren't radical enough for president trump, you know he's completely lost touch with the american people, senate minority leader chuck schumer said sunday, remarking on nielsen's departure.\n\nyet while there is evidence that trump's flame throwing commentary on immigration hurt republicans in swing districts and helped democrats win the house in midterm elections, trump's warning that the us is under assault by marauding caravans of immigrants is widely backed by his supporters.\n\nthat's why ultimately, even nielsen, who was reviled on the left over the family separations policy and attempted to shape the president's instincts into a workable policy always seemed doomed.\n\ntrump has shown that he will always, eventually side with the themes and voters that powered his political rise even faced with insurmountable political and practical obstacles.\n\ncnn's jim acosta, geneva sands, jeff zeleny, kaitlan collins, jeremy diamond and jake tapper.

(time) with a $650 million investment. but that company, koch industries, will have no influence on meredith's editorial or managerial operations, said meredith spokesman art slusark.\n\nconsistent with its past practices, [koch] will be a silent and passive investor, he said. as far as the brothers themselves, slusark said, no one from meredith has ever met with, spoken to or communicated with the koch brothers in any fashion.\n\nin a call with investors monday, meredith ceo steve lacy said that koch industries wasn't asking for as much control of the company as some other potential backers.\n\nrelated: time inc. has new owners, including the koch brothers\n\nwe were looking for some support, but in all sincerity, not looking for a lot of help in running the business. so that eliminated a number of the players who came around the table, he said on the call. he said that the fact that koch industries didn't ask for a seat on the board, either as a voting or non-voting member, without a doubt, made the offer from [koch] the most attractive.\n\nbillionaires charles and david koch are known for funneling hundreds of millions of dollars toward issues including efforts to repeal obamacare, cutting taxes and government spending, and reducing government regulation, particularly limits on carbon emissions.\n\nthus their investment in meredith's purchase of time has stirred up concerns that they intend to call the shots, or at least have their say, on time inc.'s coverage, despite meredith's claims to the contrary.\n\nmeredith wanted to buy time inc. back in 2012, but didn't want time magazine, former time editor richard stengel tweeted early monday. the difference now is the koch brothers' money. even though they won't have a seat on the board, hard to imagine they won't influence the editorial side.\n\nmeredith wanted to buy time inc back in 2012, but didn't want time magazine. the difference now is the koch brothers' money. even though they won't have a seat on the board, hard to imagine they won't influence the editorial side. https://t.co/gvlzokc205 — richard stengel (@stengel) november 27, 2017\n\nnobody, but nobody, buys news media properties *unless* it is to exercise some influence through or over them, tweeted emily bell, a journalism professor at columbia university. she said investing in financially troubled print media doesn't make any sense as a business decision -- only as a means to influence coverage.\n\nnobody, but nobody, buys news media properties *unless* it is to exercise some influence through or over them...not least because it usually makes little economic sense otherwise #time #kochbrothers — emily bell (@emilybell) november 27, 2017\n\nthe investment, which slusark said amounts to 15% of the financing that meredith has lined up, comes from the koch equity division arm of privately held koch industries. the companies in which it has announced investments are fairly low profile, such as guardian, a leading manufacturer of glass products, and adt/protection one, the home security company. there are no other media companies on its public list of investments.\n\nin return for koch's $650 million investment in meredith, it will receive preferred shares in the company that will pay a dividend of 8.5%. essentially this is a three-year loan.\n\nmeredith is best known for non-political magazines aimed at women such as better homes & gardens and family circle. lacy insisted to investors that he's not looking to make big changes in the editorial policies at time or other publications. he said that while he does plan to eliminate $400 million to $500 million in costs from the combined companies, he doesn't expect to cut newsroom budgets.\n\nrelated: why there's so much anxiety in the media business right now\n\nclearly, the editorial functions, the creative activities, are always sacred because that's where you generate the 25% of the revenue, from circulation, which we count on in good times and in bad, lacy said. and it's the most sacred and the safest revenue stream of any media company. and unlike some of the newer digital players, we get paid for our content, which is what i like.\n\nmeredith president tom harty did say that the company might sell some of time inc.'s current roster of magazines after the deal closes, though he said it would be premature to say which ones might be put up for sale.\n\nin addition to time, time inc. owns fortune, money, sports illustrated and in style, among other titles as well as people, the most profitable title in the entire magazine industry.
the trump administration is about to start letting states require many medicaid recipients to work for their benefits.\n\nbut millions of americans in the health care safety net program already have jobs.\n\nsome 60% of working age, non-disabled medicaid enrollees are working, according to a new report from the kaiser family foundation. that's about 15 million people.\n\nplus, nearly eight in 10 recipients live in families with at least one worker.\n\nit's more common for medicaid enrollees to hold jobs if they live in states that expanded medicaid under obamacare. some 31 states, plus the district of columbia, broadened their medicaid programs to include adults earning up to roughly $16,600 a year.\n\nrelated: trump administration opens door for medicaid work requirements\n\njust over one-fifth of medicaid enrollees who hold part-time jobs cited economic factors, such as the inability to find full-time positions and weak business conditions, as the reason they aren't working more. more than a quarter of part-timers said they are in school or have family obligations.\n\nsome 65% of men on medicaid are working, while 56% of women are employed. enrollees who live in the south are less likely to hold jobs than those in other regions, though the rates were similar in rural and urban areas nationwide.\n\nnot surprisingly, the more education a recipient has, the more likely they are to be employed. about half of those who didn't finish high school have jobs, but nearly 70% of those with at least a bachelor's degree do.\n\nmedicaid recipients commonly work in agriculture, construction, leisure and hospitality and retail -- some 40% of enrollees are in these industries. about one-fifth work in the health services or education fields. many of these sectors often don't offer employees health insurance. also, part-time workers usually don't qualify for workplace benefits.\n\nrelated: trump administration wants more people to work for food stamps\n\nwhen it comes to those who aren't employed, most cite illness or family obligations as the reason why.\n\nmany people can have physical or mental health problems -- such as arthritis or asthma -- that don't meet the criteria for federal disability programs, but still interfere with their ability to work, kaiser said.\n\nthe trump administration has signaled that it will allow states to impose work requirements on working-age, non-disabled adults. the obama administration repeatedly rejected states' requests to do so, saying it wasn't consistent with medicaid's purpose to provide access to medical care.\n\nat least nine states have submitted waivers to require these enrollees to participate in some type of community engagement, such as working, volunteering, going to school or entering a job training program, in order to qualify for benefits.
(cnn) —\n\nwhen sen. john mccain's family announced friday that he was ending medical treatment for aggressive brain cancer, the news shook capitol hill and prompted support from his republican and democratic colleagues alike. but one prominent voice was missing: president donald trump's.\n\nthe white house press office did not react to the news, and when trump traveled to ohio in the evening he did not mention the ailing senator in a nearly hour-long speech to ohio republicans, which ran a gamut of topics from the death of mollie tibbetts to nfl protests to kanye west.\n\nin past months, trump has frequently referenced mccain's 2017 health care vote on the campaign trail without naming him, drawing the ire of the arizona republican's family.\n\none of our wonderful senators said 'thumbs down' at 2 o'clock in the morning, the president said at a campaign event for new york's rep. claudia tenney earlier this month.\n\nthe senator's daughter, conservative commentator meghan mccain, called trump's comments gross and pathetic at the time.\n\nalthough trump claimed the senate was one vote away, in reality the vote was only to go to conference with the house on the senate's skinny repeal of obamacare.\n\nthe president did not repeat that reference, which has become a familiar refrain in his stump speech, on friday evening.\n\ntrump also did not mention mccain at a signing ceremony earlier this month at fort drum, new york, for a defense spending bill the senator had spearheaded, the john s. mccain national defense authorization act.\n\ntrump expressed support for mccain when the senator's tumor was first diagnosed.\n\nsenator john mccain has always been a fighter, the president said in a statement at the time. melania and i send our thoughts and prayers to senator mccain, cindy, and their entire family. get well soon.\n\na white house official said trump also called mccain following word of the senator's diagnosis.\n\nand before that health care vote, the president called mccain an american hero in a tweet.\n\nspeaking to reporters on the south lawn of the white house last december, trump said he had talked with the senator's wife.\n\ni did speak to cindy mccain, and i wished her well. i wished john well. they've headed back, but i understand he'll come if we ever needed his vote, which hopefully we won't. but the word is john will come back if we need his vote, and it's too bad, trump said.\n\nhe continued, it's tough. he's going through a very, he's going through a very tough time. there's no question about it, but he will come back if we need his vote.\n\nthe two have had a tortured relationship and mccain, who was diagnosed with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer, in july 2017, has been one of the administration's most outspoken republican critics.\n\ntrump has previously attacked mccain's record of service, saying the vietnam veteran and one-time prisoner of war is not a war hero because he was captured.\n\nhe is not a war hero, trump told pollster frank luntz, who was hosting a july 2015 question-and-answer session at the family leadership summit in ames, iowa.\n\nhe is a war hero, luntz interjected.\n\nhe is a war hero because he was captured? trump said, cutting him off. i like people that weren't captured, ok? i hate to tell you. he is a war hero because he was captured. ok, you can have – i believe perhaps he is a war hero.\n\ntrump has since acknowledged that mccain is a hero, but he refused to apologize in subsequent interviews.\n\ncnn's lauren fox and ashley killough contributed to this report.
as she has in prior debates, minnesota sen. amy klobuchar asserted wednesday that she's won elections in republican-held areas.\n\ni'm the one on this stage that had the highest voter turnout of any state in the country when i led the ticket, as well as bringing in rural and suburban voters. and i've done that as well, she said. and i'm the only one with the receipts to have done that in republican congressional districts over and over again.\n\nfacts first: partly true. minnesota had the highest voter turnout rate of any state during each of her senate campaigns, but klobuchar is not the only candidate who has won republican-held congressional districts\n\nformer vice president joe biden, who spent most of his career as the senator for delaware, won in republican congressional districts.\n\nbiden first won the 1972 election to be senator from delaware and was repeatedly re-elected to serve in that position by considerable margins until he became vice president in 2009. during that time, delaware's sole congressional district was held by republicans from 1973 to 1983, and from 1993 to 2011.\n\nturnout was highest in minnesota in years when klobuchar ran. in her three election years, minnesota had the highest state voter turnout nationwide.

the catheter cowboy is back.\n\njohn oliver is again trying to reach president trump with a satirical commercial on cable news -- this time taking aim at house republicans' proposal to replace obamacare.\n\noliver, the host of last week tonight on hbo, says the 30-second ad is scheduled to run in washington on wednesday during the fox & friends morning show on fox news channel, a program trump watches and tweets about.\n\nwho better to tell trump what this bill will do than someone who stands to be hurt by it -- someone in his 60s, in rural america, with an unspecified medical problem that requires constant treatment, oliver said on his show sunday night, introducing the spot.\n\nafter a voiceover announcer starts the commercial with attention catheter patients, a cowboy comes on to discuss the health care bill.\n\nrelated: john oliver runs ads on cable news in bid to reach trump\n\nhealth care is a complicated business. everybody knows that. literally, everybody, he says, mocking trump's remark last week that nobody knew health care could be so complicated.\n\nalso, if my premiums go up and my subsidies go down, i'm going to end up paying more. that's basic math there, fella, the cowboy continues.\n\nrelated: if you're older and lower income, prepare to pay more under gop health care bill\n\nthe fact is if that happens, millions of folks like me might get real angry, which is worth thinking about if you're the sort of person who likes being popular, he said. you get that. right? right?\n\nlast month, oliver used the catheter cowboy to explain the nuclear triad -- the land-based, sea-based and air-based u.s. nuclear forces. he took out commercials on cnn, msnbc and fox news morning shows.
(cnn) —\n\nthe trump administration took the final step tuesday in its plan aimed at making health insurance policies cheaper for some small businesses.\n\nthe administration released its final rule governing association health plans, which allow small businesses and the self-employed to band together based on their industry or location and buy health insurance. the rule stems from an executive order that trump signed in october aimed at providing alternatives to the affordable care act, which it is bent on dismantling.\n\nbut the move is expected to weaken some of the affordable care act's consumer protections for those buying these plans and make coverage more expensive for those who remain on the obamacare exchanges.\n\nthe rule allows association health plans to be regulated in the same way as large employer policies. that would free them from having to adhere to some of obamacare's rules, particularly the one requiring insurers to offer comprehensive coverage. plans can start being offered as soon as september 1.\n\nmany of our laws, particularly obamacare, make healthcare coverage more expensive for small businesses than large companies, said labor secretary alexander acosta. ahps are about more choice, more access, and more coverage.\n\nrelated: these small businesses are psyched for trump's new health plans\n\nthese plans would likely have lower premiums, but they would also provide fewer benefits – which could leave sicker and older workers out in the cold. also, the offerings could be less attractive to young women if they don't cover maternity benefits.\n\nthe proposed regulation would allow associations to base an employer's rates on the gender, age and industry of its workers, which could leave firms with many younger men paying less, but those with older workers and women saddled with higher premiums. currently, the affordable care act bans insurers from basing premiums on gender or industry and limits the amount that can be based on age.\n\nhowever, plans would not be allowed to set premiums based on workers' health status, which critics of the executive order had feared.\n\nit also maintains state regulators' oversight of these policies. this allows them to retain some say in what benefits are offered and to monitor the financial health of the plans, depending on how the associations are set up. many state regulators have been very wary of association health plans, citing their long history of fraud and insolvency.\n\nconsumer watchdogs are concerned that the association health plans will siphon off younger and healthier workers, leaving older and sicker americans in the obamacare exchanges for individuals and small firms.\n\nsome 3.2 million enrollees in obamacare's individual and small group markets could shift their coverage to these new policies, according to an analysis by avalere health, a consulting firm. losing those enrollees could prompt insurers to raise rates by 3.5% on the obamacare individual market and 0.5% in the small business exchanges.\n\nthose buying association health plans could see their premiums drop $9,700 a year compared to the individual market and $2,900 a year versus the small business exchanges. that's largely because the plans will offer less generous benefits and have healthier enrollees, according to avalere.\n\navalere's projections for the plans' enrollment are roughly in line with the congressional budget office's estimate of 4 million members. in addition, the cbo also noted that about 10% of the 4 million people buying these plans in 2023 and beyond would have been uninsured otherwise.\n\nmany patient advocacy groups have also spoken out against the trump administration's move, saying they're concerned it could lead to more instability in the individual and small business markets and leave policyholders paying more for needed care.\n\nwe expect this new federal law will spark a rise in both insurers refusing to pay medical bills and medical bankruptcies, both of which have fallen since 2010,when the health law went into effect, said frederick isasi, executive director of families usa, a left-leaning advocacy organization. when the people who are tricked into buying these cheap, junk plans need their health insurance to cover their medical care, they'll realize they've been swindled out of their money with no comprehensive health coverage to show for it.\n\nassociation health plans, which have existed for decades, have long been a favorite tool of republicans. several industry groups have praised trump's effort to broaden eligibility.\n\ntoday is a great day for america's franchise job creators and their employees in the fight for high quality, less expensive health coverage, said robert cresanti, chief executive officer of the international franchise association.\n\ncatherine monson can't wait to set up an association health plans that her franchisees can offer their workers. she's the chief executive of fastsigns international, a signage and visual graphics company that has more than 600 locations and 6,000 employees across the country.\n\nour franchisees compete with big companies for labor, said monson, a longtime advocate of the plans. we want to have the same benefits at about the same price.\n\nassociations will likely offer members a range of policies, including some that are more comprehensive, said chris condeluci, who runs cc law & policy, a health care legal and policy practice, and supports the administration's move. some may opt to raise the rate of the more basic plans in order to lower the premiums of the ones with richer benefits.\n\nrelated: trump administration tells court it won't defend key provisions of the affordable care act\n\nthe trump administration is also readying the final rule for short-term health plans, which would serve as another alternative to obamacare. officials are expected to allow these plans to be sold for up to a year, as opposed to the current 90-day limit.\n\nshort-term plans don't have to adhere to obamacare's regulations so consumers would have a wider array of options with lower monthly rates. but these policies can exclude those with pre-existing conditions or base rates on a person's medical history. they can also offer skimpier benefits so policyholders may have to pay more out of pocket if they actually need care.

(photo by doug mills-pool/getty images)\n\npresident donald trump delivered his 2019 state of the union address on tuesday. read the president's speech as prepared for delivery and released by the white house.\n\nmadam speaker, mr. vice president, members of congress, the first lady of the united states, and my fellow americans:\n\nwe meet tonight at a moment of unlimited potential. as we begin a new congress, i stand here ready to work with you to achieve historic breakthroughs for all americans.\n\nmillions of our fellow citizens are watching us now, gathered in this great chamber, hoping that we will govern not as two parties but as one nation.\n\nthe agenda i will lay out this evening is not a republican agenda or a democrat agenda. it is the agenda of the american people.\n\nmany of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend american jobs and demand fair trade for american workers; to rebuild and revitalize our nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts america's interests first.\n\nthere is a new opportunity in american politics, if only we have the courage to seize it. victory is not winning for our party. victory is winning for our country.\n\nthis year, america will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of america's mission, and the power of american pride.\n\nin june, we mark 75 years since the start of what general dwight d. eisenhower called the great crusade – the allied liberation of europe in world war ii. on d-day, june 6, 1944, 15,000 young american men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. here with us tonight are three of those heroes: private first class joseph reilly, staff sergeant irving locker, and sergeant herman zeitchik. gentlemen, we salute you.\n\nin 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the american flag on the face of the moon. half a century later, we are joined by one of the apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: buzz aldrin. this year, american astronauts will go back to space on american rockets.\n\nin the 20th century, america saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great american adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. an amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.\n\nwe can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before.\n\nbut we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution – and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.\n\ntogether, we can break decades of political stalemate. we can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of america's future. the decision is ours to make.\n\nwe must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.\n\ntonight, i ask you to choose greatness.\n\nover the last 2 years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades.\n\nin just over 2 years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom – a boom that has rarely been seen before. we have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs – something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started.\n\nwages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who i promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps. the united states economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. african-american, hispanic-american and asian-american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. unemployment for americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. more people are working now than at any time in our history — 157 million.\n\nwe passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.\n\nwe virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms.\n\nwe eliminated the very unpopular obamacare individual mandate penalty – and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.\n\nmy administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.\n\nwe have unleashed a revolution in american energy – the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. and now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy.\n\nafter 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and america is winning each and every day. members of congress: the state of our union is strong. our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.\n\non friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone – almost double what was expected. an economic miracle is taking place in the united states – and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics, or ridiculous partisan investigations.\n\nif there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. it just doesn't work that way!\n\nwe must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad.\n\nthis new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the senate – some after years of waiting. the senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.\n\nnow is the time for bipartisan action. believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible.\n\nin the last congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new farm bill, historic va reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed va accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.\n\nand just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform. last year, i heard through friends the story of alice johnson. i was deeply moved. in 1997, alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. she had a big impact on that prison population – and far beyond.\n\nalice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing – and the need to remedy this injustice. she served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life.\n\nin june, i commuted alice's sentence – and she is here with us tonight. alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.\n\nwhen i saw alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, i knew i did the right thing.\n\ninspired by stories like alice's, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the first step act into law. this legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the african-american community. the first step act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. now, states across the country are following our lead. america is a nation that believes in redemption.\n\nwe are also joined tonight by matthew charles from tennessee. in 1996, at age 30, matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. now, matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the first step act. matthew, on behalf of all americans: welcome home.\n\nas we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. now, republicans and democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.\n\nthe congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.\n\nnow is the time for the congress to show the world that america is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business.\n\nas we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the united states. we have just heard that mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. i have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.\n\nthis is a moral issue. the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all americans. we have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. this includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. i want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.\n\ntonight, i am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country.\n\nno issue better illustrates the divide between america's working class and america's political class than illegal immigration. wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.\n\nmeanwhile, working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration – reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.\n\ntolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate – it is cruel. one in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.\n\nhuman traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.\n\ntens of thousands of innocent americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities – including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl.\n\nthe savage gang, ms-13, now operates in 20 different american states, and they almost all come through our southern border. just yesterday, an ms-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in new york city. we are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in.\n\nyear after year, countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens.\n\ni've gotten to know many wonderful angel moms, dads, and families – no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.\n\nhere tonight is debra bissell. just three weeks ago, debra's parents, gerald and sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their reno, nevada, home by an illegal alien. they were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. also here tonight are gerald and sharon's granddaughter, heather, and great‑granddaughter, madison.\n\nto debra, heather, madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. but i will never forget, and i will fight for the memory of gerald and sharon, that it should never happen again.\n\nnot one more american life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border.\n\nin the last 2 years, our brave ice officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings.\n\nwe are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ice special agent elvin hernandez. when elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the united states from the dominican republic. at the age of eight, elvin told his dad he wanted to become a special agent. today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. elvin says: if i can make sure these young girls get their justice, i've done my job. thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.\n\nspecial agent hernandez, please stand: we will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement – and i pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ice.\n\nmy administration has sent to the congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.\n\nit includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. in the past, most of the people in this room voted for a wall – but the proper wall never got built. i'll get it built.\n\nthis is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier – not just a simple concrete wall. it will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.\n\nsan diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. in response, and at the request of san diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.\n\nthe border city of el paso, texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime – one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our nation's most dangerous cities. now, with a powerful barrier in place, el paso is one of our safest cities.\n\nsimply put, walls work and walls save lives. so let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make america safe.\n\nas we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.\n\nno one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before – and exactly one century after the congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the congress than ever before.\n\nas part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this thursday we are launching the first ever government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries.\n\nto build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount – reversing decades of calamitous trade policies.\n\nwe are now making it clear to china that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of american jobs and wealth has come to an end.\n\ntherefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of chinese goods – and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. but i don't blame china for taking advantage of us – i blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. i have great respect for president xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with china. but it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect american jobs.\n\nanother historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as nafta.\n\ni have met the men and women of michigan, ohio, pennsylvania, indiana, new hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by nafta. for years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. but no one ever tried – until now.\n\nour new u.s.-mexico-canada agreement – or usmca – will replace nafta and deliver for american workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding american agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the usa.\n\ntonight, i am also asking you to pass the united states reciprocal trade act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an american product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us.\n\nboth parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of america's crumbling infrastructure.\n\ni know that the congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill – and i am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. this is not an option. this is a necessity.\n\nthe next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs – and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.\n\nalready, as a result of my administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.\n\nbut we must do more. it is unacceptable that americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. this is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.\n\ni am asking the congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for american patients. we should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down.\n\nno force in history has done more to advance the human condition than american freedom. in recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against hiv and aids. scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. my budget will ask democrats and republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the hiv epidemic in the united states within 10 years. together, we will defeat aids in america.\n\ntonight, i am also asking you to join me in another fight that all americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.\n\njoining melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, grace eline. every birthday since she was 4, grace asked her friends to donate to st. jude children's research hospital. she did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. last year, grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. immediately, she began radiation treatment. at the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. when grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: last day of chemo. grace – you are an inspiration to us all.\n\nmany childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. my budget will ask the congress for $500 million over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research.\n\nto help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for america's children. i am also proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave – so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child.\n\nthere could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days. lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. these are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. and then, we had the case of the governor of virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.\n\nto defend the dignity of every person, i am asking the congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb.\n\nlet us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. and let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children – born and unborn – are made in the holy image of god.\n\nthe final part of my agenda is to protect america's national security.\n\nover the last 2 years, we have begun to fully rebuild the united states military – with $700 billion last year and $716 billion this year. we are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. for years, the united states was being treated very unfairly by nato – but now we have secured a $100 billion increase in defense spending from nato allies.\n\nas part of our military build-up, the united states is developing a state-of-the-art missile defense system.\n\nunder my administration, we will never apologize for advancing america's interests.\n\nfor example, decades ago the united states entered into a treaty with russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. while we followed the agreement to the letter, russia repeatedly violated its terms. that is why i announced that the united states is officially withdrawing from the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty, or inf treaty.\n\nperhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding china and others, or perhaps we can't — in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.\n\nas part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the korean peninsula. our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. if i had not been elected president of the united states, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with north korea with potentially millions of people killed. much work remains to be done, but my relationship with kim jong un is a good one. and chairman kim and i will meet again on february 27 and 28 in vietnam.\n\ntwo weeks ago, the united states officially recognized the legitimate government of venezuela, and its new interim president, juan guaido.\n\nwe stand with the venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom – and we condemn the brutality of the maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in south america into a state of abject poverty and despair.\n\nhere, in the united states, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. america was founded on liberty and independence — not government coercion, domination, and control. we are born free, and we will stay free. tonight, we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country.\n\none of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the middle east.\n\nour approach is based on principled realism – not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. for this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of israel – and proudly opened the american embassy in jerusalem.\n\nour brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years. in afghanistan and iraq, nearly 7,000 american heroes have given their lives. more than 52,000 americans have been badly wounded. we have spent more than $7 trillion in the middle east.\n\nas a candidate for president, i pledged a new approach. great nations do not fight endless wars.\n\nwhen i took office, isis controlled more than 20,000 square miles in iraq and syria. today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers.\n\nnow, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of isis, it is time to give our brave warriors in syria a warm welcome home.\n\ni have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in afghanistan. our troops have fought with unmatched valor – and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict.\n\nin afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of afghan groups, including the taliban. as we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter-terrorism. we do not know whether we will achieve an agreement – but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace.\n\nabove all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this nation's power and will to defend our people. eighteen years ago, terrorists attacked the uss cole – and last month american forces killed one of the leaders of the attack.\n\nwe are honored to be joined tonight by tom wibberley, whose son, navy seaman craig wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the uss cole.\n\nmy administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in iran.\n\nto ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, i withdrew the united states from the disastrous iran nuclear deal. and last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.\n\nwe will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to america and threatens genocide against the jewish people. we must never ignore the vile poison of anti-semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. with one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.\n\njust months ago, 11 jewish-americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh. swat officer timothy matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. timothy has just had his 12th surgery – but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. officer matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.\n\ntonight, we are also joined by pittsburgh survivor judah samet. he arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. but not only did judah narrowly escape death last fall – more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the nazi concentration camps. today is judah's 81st birthday. judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. suddenly the train screeched to a halt. a soldier appeared. judah's family braced for the worst. then, his father cried out with joy: it's the americans.\n\na second holocaust survivor who is here tonight, joshua kaufman, was a prisoner at dachau concentration camp. he remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as american soldiers rolled in with tanks. to me, joshua recalls, the american soldiers were proof that god exists, and they came down from the sky.\n\ni began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on d-day in the second world war. one of them was herman zeitchik. but there is more to herman's story. a year after he stormed the beaches of normandy, herman was one of those american soldiers who helped liberate dachau. he was one of the americans who helped rescue joshua from that hell on earth. almost 75 years later, herman and joshua are both together in the gallery tonight – seated side-by-side, here in the home of american freedom. herman and joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire nation.\n\nwhen american soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the english channel in the early hours of d-day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war.\n\nthey did not know if they would survive the hour. they did not know if they would grow old. but they knew that america had to prevail. their cause was this nation, and generations yet unborn.\n\nwhy did they do it? they did it for america – they did it for us.\n\neverything that has come since – our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice – all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the americans who came before.\n\nthink of this capitol – think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire.\n\nhere tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. you have come from the rocky shores of maine and the volcanic peaks of hawaii; from the snowy woods of wisconsin and the red deserts of arizona; from the green farms of kentucky and the golden beaches of california. together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history.\n\nwhat will we do with this moment? how will we be remembered?\n\ni ask the men and women of this congress: look at the opportunities before us! our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. our most exciting journeys still await. our biggest victories are still to come. we have not yet begun to dream.\n\nwe must choose whether we are defined by our differences – or whether we dare to transcend them.\n\nwe must choose whether we will squander our inheritance – or whether we will proudly declare that we are americans. we do the incredible. we defy the impossible. we conquer the unknown.\n\nthis is the time to re-ignite the american imagination. this is the time to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. this is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots.\n\nthis is our future – our fate – and our choice to make. i am asking you to choose greatness.\n\nno matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together.\n\nwe must keep america first in our hearts. we must keep freedom alive in our souls. and we must always keep faith in america's destiny – that one nation, under god, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world!\n\nthank you. god bless you, god bless america, and good night!
(cnn) the future of the nation's health care system now lies in the hands of the supreme court.\n\nthe justices announced monday that they will determine the fate of the affordable care act next term, after lower court rulings found the law's individual mandate unconstitutional. the justices' ruling could uphold, eradicate or greatly change the landmark law that has transformed america's health system in many ways.\n\njust how much of the law could remain in place is a question the justices now must decide. it remains in effect while the case works its way through the legal system.\n\nmeanwhile, the trump administration has recently argued that the entire law should not be invalidated nationwide, reversing a previous stance\n\nwhat the affordable care act does\n\nobamacare has extended coverage to millions of americans, many of whom were uninsured beforehand. more than 10 million people were enrolled in obamacare plans , as of mid-2019, while nearly 12.7 million low-income adults have gained coverage through medicaid expansion , as of fiscal 2017.\n\nthe uninsured rate for non-elderly americans plummeted from 18.2% at the time of the law's passage in 2010 to a low of 10.4% in 2016, according to the most recent data from the centers for disease control and prevention's national health interview survey. the overall share of uninsured americans ticked up in 2018 for the first time in nearly a decade, according to census bureau data.\n\nbut the affordable care act, which is approaching its 10-year anniversary later this month, has done far more than reduce the uninsured rate.\n\namong its most popular provisions are allowing young adults up to age 26 to stay on their parents' policies and protecting those with pre-existing conditions. prior to the affordable care act, americans trying to buy insurance on their own could be turned away or charged more based on their medical histories. in addition, insurers must provide comprehensive benefits on the obamacare exchanges.\n\nin fact, obamacare has affected nearly all americans , many of whom aren't aware of the law's impact. it saves senior citizens money on their medicare coverage and prescription drugs. it lets many people obtain free birth control, annual physicals, mammograms and cholesterol tests. it requires many chain restaurants to post the calorie counts of their menu items.\n\nmillions are still uninsured\n\nwhile the supreme court has upheld the law in the past, it also made a major change to a key provision that has left millions of americans uninsured, experts say. in 2012, the justices ruled the federal government could not threaten to remove existing medicaid funding from states that don't agree to broaden medicaid to low-income adults, essentially making expansion optional.\n\nto date, 36 states, plus the district of columbia, have expanded medicaid to adults who have incomes up to 138% of the poverty guideline, or about $17,600 for an individual in 2020. many republican-led states continue to refuse to expand, although voters in several red states have forced their elected officials to broaden coverage through ballot measures. consumer advocates are working to do the same in missouri and oklahoma this year.

(cnn) president joe biden has promised to make health care more affordable and available. his executive order thursday takes one immediate step in that direction.\n\nas a result of his action, the department of health and human services is set to reopen enrollment on the federal affordable care act exchange between february 15 and may 15.\n\nthis would give americans who missed the most recent sign-up period, which ended december 15, access to obamacare policies -- and to federal assistance to pay for them. roughly 15 million uninsured people could benefit, according to the kaiser family foundation.\n\nnearly 9 million of them could qualify for free or subsidized coverage, according to the kaiser family foundation. individuals making up to about $51,000 and families of four earning up to about $104,800 are eligible for subsidies.\n\nsome 36 states use the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, for enrollment. but most, if not all, of the states that run their own marketplaces are also expected to launch special sign-up periods, according to a white house official.

paul: i can't in good faith look the other way\n\nspeaker of the house paul ryan(l) r-wi listens while senate majority leader senator mitch mcconnell (r-ky) speaks to the press after meetings with us president donald trump at the white house february 27, 2017 in washington, dc. / afp / brendan smialowski (photo credit should read brendan smialowski/afp/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nbudgets released by presidents, unlike those negotiated by congress, are more like political fan fiction than modestly crafted, passable agendas.\n\npresident donald trump's budget takes this art form to another level – really, to another universe. some of the issues and questions stem from the surprise budget resolution last week in congress, which delivered more money but – so far – no clear plan for precisely how it would be spent.\n\nall the same, budget wonks' heads are spinning as they try to parse the dense document for political messages and accounting quirks.\n\nin trump's fiscal year 2019 budget plan, released monday, numbers typically highlighted upfront are shuffled or stuffed away into back sections. the changes from friday's bargain in congress were baked in as an afterthought to the core document, creating even steeper, more implausible cuts. many of the underlying economic assumptions arrive at odds with past congressional budget office reports and the analysis of nonpartisan outsiders.\n\nsome of this is just a result of the erratic relationship between the white house and congress. planning a budget from the executive branch is complicated; it's nigh on impossible when legislators throw an eleventh-hour spending pact at you. despite it all, the budget plan remains a crucially informative and important document – an annual view into the president's priorities and goals.\n\nthe executive budget has always been a messaging document, mick mulvaney, the director of the office of management and budget, said monday. what are the messages this year? there's two primary messages. number one: you don't have to spend all of this money, congress, but if you do, here's how we would prefer to see you spend it. … and the other message is that we do not have to have trillion dollar deficits forever.\n\nhere are some of the things to be on the lookout for when interpreting trump's budget – and his message.\n\n1. it assumes friday's budget agreement can be wished away\n\nin its defense, the administration acknowledges that it had to make last-minute changes to its budget in light of the friday agreement, which funds the government through 2019 at higher levels of discretionary spending. the issue is, trump's budget doesn't change any of its assumptions for the period after 2019, creating a series of fiscal crises.\n\ngiven the current fiscal situation, the administration is not proposing a budget at the new non-defense caps, reads an addendum letter to the budget, written by mulvaney. instead, the budget creates a new non-defense spending baseline, slightly lower than the amount congress authorized friday.\n\ntrump's budget doesn't ratchet down spending cuts any more slowly due to the changes in congress – it just drops them down harder as if the budget increases never happened.\n\nthe budget says we're going to accept the budget deal but we're not going to accept it. after that, no comment, said marc goldwein, senior vice president for the committee for a responsible federal budget, a watchdog group.\n\na series of crises after 2018 are created, with two years of calling for nearly 15% cuts in non-defense discretionary spending. the spending cuts continue from there until they total 42% in 2028.\n\nyou have to assume a massive discretionary spending cliff like nothing we've seen since the korean war, said brian riedl, a budget expert at the conservative manhattan institute.\n\n2. it assumes sustained gdp growth at the highest levels in 50 years\n\nsince world war ii, only one period in american history had sustained annual growth in the gross domestic product of over 2% without a contraction – through the 1960s.\n\nthis part is normal. it's not up to budget writers to assume recessions. but the trump budget swings in the opposite direction, assuming wildly optimistic growth.\n\nthose expectations carry from 2018 through 2028, in spite of a coming surge in baby boomer retirements, meaning that our current expansion rate will have remained, by the time all is said and done, unchanged over two decades. the longest similar stretch on record followed world war ii – and it lasted about 10 years.\n\nusually the president's budget is divorced from reality, but this year it is very divorced from reality, said ben ritz, a former analyst at the bipartisan policy center and incoming director at the progressive policy institute.\n\n3. it pulls out the stops for trump's tax cuts\n\ntrump's budget assumes his tax cuts are extended – not an unusual thing to assume. president barack obama's budgets often made assumptions too, assuming spending cap increases and discretionary spending changes.\n\nbut trump's budget makes assumptions about growth and the effect on the deficit from tax cuts that are at odds with what most economists expect.\n\nthe budget makes growth assumptions nearly 1% year higher than the federal reserve in the first three years, and substantially higher over the rest of the ensuing 10-year window. according to a committee for a responsible federal budget analysis, trump's budget may estimate as much as $3 trillion more in gdp in 2028 than previous congressional budget office estimates.\n\nall this additional growth results in deficit reduction assumptions that analysts say don't square with reality. i love the tax cuts and i think they'll be good for the economy, but they're not going to pay for themselves, riedl said.\n\naccording to him, the budget also changes how these baseline assumptions are outlined in the text. rather than explaining some of its assumptions about extending the tax cuts into the baseline at the bottom of the budget document, they're moved into a supplementary text.\n\n4. it brushes past some complicated capitol hill politics\n\nthis isn't the first presidential budget proposal to crash headlong into unaccommodating political realities. that's why it's important to consider the pitch more as messaging, as mulvaney put it monday, than a slate of carefully manicured policy prescriptions. here are a few controversial issues that got a mention in the budget.\n\nobamacare\n\nthe gop effort to gut the affordable care act stalled last year and, despite ongoing and occasionally successful efforts to undermine it, seems stuck in place. at least through the coming midterms. in the budget, though, the white house calls for a two-part approach to repealing and replacing the law that begins with passing legislation modeled closely after the graham-cassidy-heller-johnson bill – one that, just a few months back, was killed by republicans before it could hit the senate floor.\n\nfor now at least, this is a total dead end.\n\npaid family leave\n\nthis has been one of ivanka trump's political hobbyhorses for some time. recently, she and sen. marco rubio, r-florida, worked together on the outline of a plan that would allow new parents to effectively shift social security money, payable after retirement, to the time following the birth of a child. (democratic sen. kirsten gillibrand of new york panned the idea, saying it was like robbing peter to pay paul.)\n\nmeanwhile, the budget offers a a fully paid-for proposal of its own, one that would provide six weeks of paid family leave to new mothers and fathers, including adoptive parents. … unlike the rubio-ivanka parameters, the white house proposal suggests using not social security but the unemployment insurance system as a base of funding.\n\nremoving air traffic control from government control\n\nlike the others here, this plan, which would create an independent, non-government organization to handle air traffic control work, has been grounded – repeatedly. trump offered something similar in his last budget and in a separate pitch last year. but it's never taken off, mostly because of bipartisan security and cost concerns.\n\nborder security\n\narriving hours before the senate enters into high-wire, public negotiations over a potential immigration deal, the administration's specific ask on new funding for the border is pretty much an afterthought. the white house has spelled out its four pillars for a deal, and border security will feature heavily in any agreement.\n\nfor what it's worth, the budget would allocate $1.6 billion for the wall and $782 million to bolster the ranks of the customs and border protection and immigration and customs enforcement agencies. these numbers are worth watching as congress debates, but they're unlikely to factor heavily in the final deal, should one be reached.

mostrado como líderes estables y maduros que podrían incluso servir de ejemplo para los niños. trump ha actuado frecuentemente como niño, ha vomitado acusaciones y condenas tan impulsivamente que su aptitud para el cargo queda en duda. estas declaraciones son las que ponen en peligro tanto su presidencia como sus esperanzas de reelegirse.\n\npublicidad\n\nlos casos más recientes de retórica autodestructiva de trump incluyen la distorsión intencional de la reacción del alcalde de londres a recientes atentados terroristas en esa ciudad. a lo largo del primer fin de semana de junio y

enojar a los políticos británicos\n\nsolo una persona decidida a explotar cínicamente la situación haría una afirmación como esa e interpretaría tan simplonamente las palabras del alcalde. solo un presidente carente de carácter presidencial lo haría dos veces.\n\nlos ataques de trump contra khan parecen tan innecesarios que pueden ser incomprensibles, pero no son tan autodestructivos como otros de sus arranques.\n\ndesde hace meses, trump ha querido implementar una prohibición a la entrada de personas procedentes de seis países mayoritariamente musulmanes y los jueces federales se lo han impedido porque consideran que es una forma de discriminación por religión.\n\nuno de los puntos principales que los tribunales señalan es que en repetidas ocasiones, él ha hecho referencia a su política con la palabra «prohibición» a los musulmanes. trump sigue hablando de una «prohibición» aunque esta palabra podría perjudicarlo ante los tribunales.\n\npeores fueron los intentos de trump de influir en el exdirector del fbi, james comey, quien estaba investigando los posibles lazos de su equipo de campaña con rusia. trump se arriesgó a despedir a comey y luego les dijo a unos funcionarios rusos en la oficina oval que pensaba que el exdirector estaba «loco» y que era un «orate».\n\nmira: trump habría pedido a comey encarcelar a periodistas\n\nno sorprende que ahora comey esté dispuesto a declarar ante una comisión del senado estadounidense respecto a una controversia que conlleva la posibilidad de que el presidente haya querido obstruir a la justicia, lo que para muchos es una falta que podría castigarse con la destitución. como su partido controla el congreso, es poco probable que lo destituyan, pero dos republicanos de la cámara de representantes ya han estado hablando del tema.\n\nsi llegamos a la destitución, probablemente será por algo que trump dijo o porque simplemente no pudo contenerse. aunque no lleguemos a esa catástrofe constitucional, trump se arriesga a ser presidente por un solo periodo y a echar a perder su oportunidad de implementar su proyecto.\n\na pesar del caos, trump tiene una especie de programa, que ha consistido en la prohibición a los musulmanes, la abrogación y el reemplazo del obamacare, la construcción de un muro en la frontera con méxico y algunos proyectos de infraestructura. es notable que no se haya pretendido comenzar ninguno de estos proyectos con el orden que se esperaría de un presidente y no parece que vayan a hacerse realidad.\n\nla casa blanca y el mundo han estado distraídos con los tuits y los escándalos del presidente. su afirmación falsa de que obama había intervenido sus comunicaciones y su respaldo a varios caudillos, como recep tayyip erdogan, de turquía, o rodrigo duterte, de filipinas, han sido heridas autoinfligidas. sin embargo, parece que nada hace cambiar su conducta a pesar de que se perjudica y de que exaspera a sus partidarios.\n\nlee: trump volvió a ser el populista nacionalista de la campaña presidencial del 2016\n\nhablando de cuestiones políticas, parece que es tan 'boquisuelto' que desafía toda lógica, pero es coherente con su personalidad. durante toda su vida, a trump le ha costado controlar lo que dice. en su vida empresarial, este rasgo le dificultó trabajar bien con los demás, así que se vio privado de la oportunidad de ser mucho más exitoso de lo que fue.\n\nen específico, a la gente le resulta difícil trabajar con él por su incapacidad de mesurarse, especialmente fuera de sus negocios inmobiliarios… y eso le ha costado.\n\nen su vida política, se ha aislado de sus aliados del partido republicano y de sus enemigos. los diputados republicanos justin amash y carlos cubero se han opuesto a él porque no sabe medir sus palabras.\n\nla primera ministra del reino unido, theresa may, defendió este lunes al alcalde de londres y señaló que «sadiq khan está haciendo un buen trabajo» y «está mal decir otra cosa».\n\nel hecho de que el presidente sea tan hablador, además de ser consecuencia de su ego, es una cuestión de agresión. aunque sus palabras extremas perturban, parece que trump está dispuesto a causar dolor a los demás para satisfacer sus propios impulsos.\n\nsu conducta, que puede ser atemorizante, indica que a trump lo mueve el deseo de dominar a los demás y de mostrar su dominio de la forma más vistosa posible. piensen en un luchador profesional que tiene sometido a su contrincante y luego se pone de pie, con los brazos en alto, mientras detiene al otro tipo con un pie sobre el pecho. simplemente tiene que meter el dedo en la llaga.\n\nla necesidad de humillar a los demás provoca que trump insista en que acepten su versión de la realidad aunque se contraponga a lo que ven con sus propios ojos y entienden con su propia mente. sus abogados y asesores tal vez le insisten en que evite arriesgarse hablando demasiado, pero esto le impediría establecer su estilo de dominio.\n\ntrump no sería trump si hiciera caso de sus consejos. nunca ha sido una persona meditabunda ni reflexiva y está dispuesto a sacrificar proyectos y prioridades con tal de ejercer su poder en un momento en particular.\n\nsi le dan a escoger entre ser presidente y ser trump, siempre escogerá lo segundo, aunque sea su perdición.
washington, dc - january 12: speaker of the house paul ryan (r-wi) talks with reporters during his weekly news conference in the capitol visitors center at the u.s. capitol january 12, 2017 in washington, dc. ryan said that congressional republicans are on a rescue mission to repeal and replace the affordable care act and that he and president-elect donald trump are in perfect sync with the process or replacing obamacare.

(bill pugliano/getty images)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nhouse freedom caucus chairman mark meadows issued a blunt warning to house speaker paul ryan on wednesday, suggesting if he fails to address conservatives' concerns on immigration he'll risk his top leadership post.\n\ni can say it is the defining moment for this speaker. if he gets it wrong it will have consequences for him, but it will also have consequences for the rest of the republican party, meadows said at an event with fellow house conservatives on capitol hill on wednesday.\n\nthe north carolina republican stressed, this president was elected largely on an immigration issue that defined him differently than the other candidates and so it is the defining moment, more so than the budget or anything else that we've passed.\n\nryan's office did not provide a response to meadow's comments.\n\nohio gop rep. jim jordan also piled on ryan, a wisconsin republican. he criticized ryan for backing the budget deal that avoided a government shutdown last week, tweaking the speaker, who rose to national prominence for his focus on cutting deficits.\n\njust a few years ago speaker ryan was viewed as the – the – individual in our party, in our country, who was focused on fiscal responsibility, and then you saw what happened last week.\n\njordan also pointed out that ryan's positions on immigration do not sync up with many house conservatives. so all i'm saying is we need legislation in every policy area that is consistent with that we told them we were going to do and what they elected us to do. that did not happen last week, but i certainly hope it happens on immigration, jordan said.\n\nhouse conservatives are demanding a vote on an immigration proposal from house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte, r-virginia, and argued that the republican-controlled house should ignore any deal that could emerge from the current senate debate.\n\nhouse gop whip steve scalise and his team are in the process of determining whether that plan has enough support to pass, according to multiple republican sources. but a bloc of moderate republicans have expressed strong concerns with it, and democrats have indicated it's a non-starter so it's unclear that the plan as drafted could clear the chamber.\n\nryan has been careful to say that house republicans would continue to work on a proposal separate from the senate, and that he would move a proposal that president donald trump backed, and he reiterated that position wednesday morning.\n\nwhat we always want to do in the house is preserve a house republican position. so which we can start from for negotiations, but at the end of the day we want to have a solution, ryan told reporters on capitol hill.\n\nthe speaker made it clear he was more concerned with the white house position than the senate process, we'll see what the senate does this week. frankly i have no idea what the senate is going to produce this week and we'll also have the president engaged to make sure we have something that if it lands on his desk he's going to sign it, and that's very important to us.\n\na new speaker?\n\nmeadows qualified that there weren't any conversations right now about a new speaker but added there are certainly conversations that would involve new leadership. he stressed that the difference was that he was awaiting ryan's next move on immigration, saying, we need leadership to actually lead.\n\nmultiple house gop members did not hide their frustration that the senate is moving forward on an immigration debate while their own leadership team is still figuring out a house strategy.\n\nthis is a watershed moment for all of us, south carolina gop rep. ralph norman said about the immigration debate. this was the 2016 election.\n\nmeadows added, anytime that the senate can take up an immigration bill quicker than the house is a day that should defy history. i mean the senate is notorious for taking naps and not taking votes and yet we somehow are here in situation where the senate is actually beating us to the critical issue of the day on immigration. that shouldn't have happened.\n\nrepublican rep. scott perry of pennsylvania told reporters that his leadership needed to be as invigorated about the conservative house immigration proposal as they were about other items they worked over gop members to vote for such as obamacare repeal, tax reform and the budget proposal.\n\nbut if it's doomed to fail right from the beginning, then we are going to have problems, he said flatly.

and may be updated.\n\n\n\npiers morgan, cnn anchor: an unbelievable day of breaking news in washington as the parties battled inside the capitol, and that's why we're obviously all here tonight, there was panic outside.\n\n\n\ndramatic video. the chase and the gunfire, steps of the hill, with the woman behind the wheel of the car and a child in the back. police opened fire on that vehicle. latest on the driver who was killed by police coming next.\n\n\n\nplus day 3 of america held hostage by politics.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nbarack obama, president of the united states: and there's one way out of this reckless and damaging republican shutdown, congress has to pass a budget that funds our government with no partisan strings attached.\n\n\n\nrep. eric cantor, (r) virginia: the republican position is, we believe we should fund this government, but we also believe that there should not be any special treatment for anyone.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nmorgan: so when will it all end? well, i'll ask top lawmakers. also a tropical storm karen taking aim along the gulf, will it make landfall and why is the shutdown making it tougher to track, we'll have all that later. and my interview with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu and what he says about iran that may surprise you as much as it surprised me.\n\n\n\nwe'll begin though with a breaking news with the deadly chase here in washington, cnn's dana bash and deborah feyerick have the very latest on the investigation and the suspect.\n\n\n\nlet's start with you dana, you're actually on capitol hill that time and was dealing with this huge shutdown news story. what was the first that you heard that made you realize there was a big event happening right outside?\n\n\n\ndana bash, chief congressional correspondent: a huge siren. it was the emergency alert system that was actually installed here in the capitol after 9/11 that went off. now, sometimes it goes off just for drills, but that sitting in the senate majority leader harry reid's office which is where i was because we were just getting ready to do an interview and hearing that loud blaring siren and then it was quickly followed by a person on the speaker saying that we were to be basically in lockdown, shelter in place they said.\n\n\n\ncertainly as you can imagine was very frightening. the good news is that for myself and for our crew, you know, we immediately got information because of the proximity to power were we were. i mean, we really were able to hear what was going on, but there's no question that the people who protect, when i say, the capitol, the people protect us everyday because i'm here everyday were pretty remarkable. i mean they got a standing ovation on the house floor and they deserved that and much, much more. because piers they ran to deal with this in a nanosecond, everybody is here working. the entire police force, nobody is taking off and they're not getting paid right now because of furloughs, because of this government shutdown. they did all of their heroic work today without a paycheck.\n\n\n\nmorgan: i mean, having said that, is anyone raising any eyebrows about the fact that it later emerged this woman was unarmed, didn't have a gun on her and certainly the scenes you see earlier on when the police all surrounded with their raised firearms, you know, there could be questions i guess raised about whether the use of deadly force was completely legitimate here. what are you hearing about that?\n\n\n\nbash: they're absolutely could be, i mean there are always, there's always second guessing in situations like this, but i believe given the route that she took from to very important places of power with very -- with a lot of security and law enforcement protecting people and particularly after what happened in 9/11 and the scare even most recently at the navy yard, i think everybody was, i know everybody was on high alert. of course, they're going to do an investigation to see what exactly happened, but so far there doesn't seem to be any second guessing.\n\n\n\nmorgan: dana just stay with me for a moment and i'll turn this on to bob casey his walking outside the capitol when he heard gunfire, democrat from pennsylvania (inaudible), obviously very -- a scary time for everybody at the capitol hill and not at least because with all the drama surrounding the shutdown, this could've been anything happening, a terror attack, who knew.\n\n\n\nwe're seeing footage there of you running there, what was going through your mind. when did you realize what had happened and what was your first fear?\n\n\n\nbob casey, (d) pennsylvania: well piers, when we're walking outside which usually when i leave that thursday lunch, we -- i usually walk underground, this just happened to be outside but the first thought that i had, the initial thought when i heard all the sirens and the law enforcement, i thought it was a dignitary being escorted then as i got closer to that corner, i knew there was more urgency to it and then i heard about three or four pops of gunfire, of course then, we knew it was very serious.\n\n\n\nwe started to walk back. two other senators, sherrod brown and jeff merkley and i walking back and then the capitol police told us to get down, to get down behind the car, get down behind anything, so then i thought, well this must be some kind of an attack, we have no idea what the facts were at that point but it was, i think everyone -- anywhere near that, i was about a block and a half away. i had great concern that it was some kind of an attack and maybe even a terrorist attack.\n\n\n\nmorgan: a very frightening experience for everyone involved. i will come back to you. if i may, senator, about ...\n\n\n\ncasey: sure.\n\n\n\nmorgan: ... the politics that's being going on which is being very lively as well today. but for now, according to deborah feyerick, who has new details on the driver who's killed in the chase, deborah is outside of the woman's family home in brooklyn, new york which she has new information.\n\n\n\ndeborah, to you.\n\n\n\ndeborah feyerick, cnn national correspondent: well, first of all, piers, we can tell you that according to neighbors who spoke to one of our cnn team members here.\n\n\n\napparently, the woman was at this building picking up here child on tuesday. apparently, the mother who lives here with a younger daughter as well often take care of this child, it's about 18 months old. we can also tell you that the federal agents who came here were actually turned away. they -- the people who were inside did not open the door, did not want to speak to them at all.\n\n\n\nnow, what you're doing is you're looking at the chase there that took place. the woman who tried to sort of move -- maneuver her car and was when she backed in to one of the police cruisers that the police began jumping out of the way and then opening fire, that's an area, piers, where because it is so high valued that any threat to that area, police are authorized to use deadly force.\n\n\n\nnow, we want to talk about another location. that location is in stamford connecticut, that is where the woman was living apparently with the child who she often brought here to brooklyn to stay with her mother. but we're told there that a robot was sent into the condominium complex where she lives just to take a look around. neighbors were evacuated from the scene. again, they wanted to make sure that the area is secured.\n\n\n\nauthorities that are being told by law enforcement source did find an envelope which they deemed suspicious. the envelope was addressed to the woman's boyfriend, they'd had his name on it. that envelope now being taken away for testing about bomb squad that's on scene, you got hazmat teams that are on scene. we've also got federal law enforcement teams who are there waiting to go in, to execute a search warrant. but right now, what they wanted to do it they wanted to take everybody out of that complex to make sure that the area was indeed safe.\n\n\n\nthe woman in that car chase, once she peeled of, she was driving at high speed, she was running through lights and police acted as if this was an active threat from the white house over to capitol hill and they began firing. we're told by a law enforcement source, piers, that in fact no shot were returned from that black vehicle that the woman was driving that all of the bullets were directed at that car. and when police were firing, they didn't even realize that the 18- month-old child was in that car with her mother. and it wasn't until the car came to a stop and the so called threat was neutralized that they realize that child was there, miraculously she was not hurt, she was taken to a local hospital and there she was checked out.\n\n\n\nthis is a woman who has got four sisters and authorities right now operating under the assumption that perhaps she had some sort of mental stress, even possibly postpartum depression. piers.\n\n\n\nmorgan: deborah, it's a fascinating story and the motivation for what her do that obviously led to her tragic death and we'll have to just wait and see how that plays out. but for now, deborah, thank you very much indeed. the capitol hill is at lockdown because of the chase (inaudible) lifted on. dana bash got a hold on senate majority leader harry reid to talk about the shutdown showdown.\n\n\n\nwell, let's just go back to dana. tell you me about your latest confrontation with harry reid.\n\n\n\nbash: it was a conversation not a confrontation this time, piers, you'll be happy to know we were actually invited into his office suite. as i've mentioned, that's where we were when this scare took place.\n\n\n\nbut what we talked about was the fact that things have really gotten personal. not just partisan but really personal with regard to him, to john boehner, he questioned his courage, but also with regard to how harry reid and others talk about the party on the other side and especially their key constituency.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nbash: you have in you some pretty explosive terms to talk about the so called tea party, you called them tea party anarchist, you called them wacky, you called them the weird caucus. i even talked to some liberals who are big supporters of yours who say, you know what, that's going too far. are you sort of stirring the pot with a language like that?\n\n\n\nsen. harry reid (d-nv) house majority leader: ok, anarchist? why in the world wouldn't i use the term anarchy? that's what they are. they are anarchist. they don't believe in government at any level. that's why we have members of congress over there today and yesterday saying, finally, we are able to close the government.\n\n\n\nwhat else did i call them?\n\n\n\nbash: the weird caucus.\n\n\n\nreid: oh, well that's fairly little (ph) over the hill.\n\n\n\nbash: so i mean do you think -- are you pledging to tone down the rhetoric a little bit and maybe that could help?\n\n\n\nreid: i'm not going to give up on the anarchist. i mean, there are people writing columns about this, about -- because that's what it is, they don't believe in government that's why they want the government closed. this is not peter pat beeps (ph) to see how nice you can be to everybody. you have to explain what you're trying to say. and there's no better description i can make than saying they don't believe in government, they're anarchist.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nbash: so, piers, it doesn't sound like he's going to tone down the rhetoric that much. but with regard to actual discussions, you can sort of see there and you've heard all day the main reason why there isn't a lot of trust there. there really is just, frankly a lack of respect with regard to the discourse that is borne out of some really hard feelings that have gone on behind closed doors.\n\n\n\nand last night, just the fact that they had a meeting at the white house at with absolutely nothing, no progress at all, gives you an indication that this sounds like it might last a while. people keep asking, when is this going to end? nobody knows.\n\n\n\nmorgan: i saw warren buffet early today saying that he believe that it would probably run on to the debt ceiling which is still two weeks away and that that would be the extreme point of stupidity, i think was the phrase something like that. and at that point, they would finally not go over the catastrophic cliff of default.\n\n\n\nis that the kind of feeling you're picking up? are the republicans now if they -- well if we can keep it going 'till then we can do some kind of grand recovery plan which can get us off the wrap here?\n\n\n\nbash: you know, the speaker and his leaders aren't talking about obamacare and getting rid of obamacare as far as negotiating is going in public. but in private just down the hall, the speaker had a meeting with some of his closest kitchen cabinet if you will and i'm told that in that meeting today, they discussed exactly that, the debt ceiling, what they can try to ask for with regard to economic issues, entitlement reform things like that. so they are at least privately trying to move forward which does mean this shutdown could last a while.\n\n\n\nmorgan: dana, for now, thank you very much indeed. we'll go back now to senator casey. senator casey, you heard all that and honestly we're all watching. i think with a vague sense of real depression it's like, come on, let's get this done.\n\n\n\nhow do you feel as a democratic senator, do you feel powerless at the moment?\n\n\n\ncasey: well, piers, i think right now, there are two basic facts i think that are operative here. one is that the speaker could put the bill that we passed last friday on the floor to -- it's an amendment really, it's six of us, a little more than 15 and a half pages long. they could put that on the floor. he could vote against it, a lot of republicans can vote against it but he would get all the democrats voting for it. and an increasing number of republicans, several in pennsylvania who said, let's pass a clean bill and get this over with and open the government up.\n\n\n\nnow, once you open them the government, you know, that taken cared of then we can begin to go back. and i would argue this is going to back to negotiation because the original negotiation was we accepted a $70 billion lower number and by doing that, speaker boehner had promised as dana bash reported to pass a clean resolution that was months ago. but when he couldn't pass it then he went in a different direction.\n\n\n\nso i think we can continue to work together on a better budget, a longer term budget. but if this passed, they could do it tomorrow and this would be over, we would have a budget in place to mid november, we could get through this debt ceiling crisis and then have a big debate even from a lot of arguments about what should be in a longer term budget. but we should do that in november at the appropriate time.\n\n\n\nmorgan: tell me this, so it's not helpful is it? if someone like harry reid, such a high ranking person in all this, uses his phrase like they're a bunch of anarchist, they're weirdoes and so on. it's exactly the kind of poisonous rhetoric that is just designed to get their backs off. it's not designed, i don't think, to bring people to a negotiating table.\n\n\n\ncasey: well, there's always a lot of back and forth that we -- if we roll the table of some of the things the other side says about our side or about the president which is even worse than to hear and even for washington is bad. but, look i think most americans can see through that. they know that there are two facts, there's a bill on the floor that could be passed tomorrow, not tonight but tomorrow when they come back and this end -- that would end the crisis.\n\n\n\nand secondly, we've got to make sure, as speaker boehner said today, not to go anywhere near defaulting our obligations. it would be the first time since 1789, we'd have a depression or recession for sure and i think we can get agreement on that. we get passage to a crisis then i think we can move forward and end the year on a positive note.\n\n\n\nmorgan: senator casey, thank you very much indeed for joining me.\n\n\n\ncasey: thanks, piers.\n\n\n\nmorgan: now, let's see from republican james lankford from oklahoma, he's also the chairman of the house of republican policy committee. welcome back to you. let me just -- some of the audience lend the question here. and i want to go to ramiro funez who has a question for you.\n\n\n\nramiro funez: hi, hello. do you believe that growing frustration with the both of democratic and republican parties will bring more attention to third party candidates in the next presidential election?\n\n\n\nrep. james lankford (r), oklahoma: you know what? that's the great unknown. a lot of third party candidates have tried to jump in over the past several years, famously ross perot and others they try to jump in. sometimes they made a -- they've been a difference maker for the republicans or democrats, but they're not actually one. there's not others than a few independents that are even in the house and the senate may end up caucusing either republican or democrats.\n\n\n\ni think there is a continual push to redefine the parties and the best thing that a lot of folks can do that are disgruntled is jump into one or the other either a republican or democrat and try to make a difference there.\n\n\n\nmorgan: did you still feel comfortable though about the amount of slack the republicans are getting and particularly the fact that the slack is because people see you as a divided party. they seem to speak as being unable to contain these renegade tea parties and the whole thing that's bit of a shambles.\n\n\n\nlankford: you know, what's really interesting about that, piers, i do hear that a lot around here to say, look at those republicans aren't they divided? but when you actually look at the vote counts that have happened this week, there are 20 or 30 democrats that are voting with us very often through a lot of the votes even this week and no one's actually looking at the democrat party saying, gosh. they're so divided. they've got 20 or 30 members. they are voting with the republicans. it's all in your perspective and i get a good chance to look at it.\n\n\n\nnow, do all republicans think a like? no. they don't. we're pretty big tea party. we have disagreements within our party as well, but we have a lot of common principles that we're trying to function around, democrats the same way. not all democrats think alike. there's a lot of divisions there as well but they have to get a chance to pull together on some of the ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: who's being in-charge? is it speaker boehner or ted cruz?\n\n\n\nlankford: well, i couldn't tell you where it is in the senate side of things. obviously, i'm not in the same, but i can tell you the speaker's in-charge of the house. decisions don't move forward and try to build coalitions unless the speaker's leading us. so, the speaker is in the lead. and i hear a lot of people push back and say, gosh, there's push and pull that he would normally go this way where there's a faction in the conference that's taking in that way. that doesn't happen unless there's a majority.\n\n\n\nquick story three years ago when i came to the house, the speaker made comments to us at the very beginning to say, previous speakers of the house had run things in a real tight circle and a very few people had inputs. he wanted to open the house up and let the house be the house. the house is supposed to be boisterous. it is the area closest to the people. and so, it's a boisterous place and it is definitely become that. it's all these different voices have to work together to find a coalition.\n\n\n\nmorgan: well, i hope they work a little harder than they're doing right now. congressman, thank you very much indeed for joining me.\n\n\n\nlankford: and, piers, thank you. and thanks for your great coverage tonight and very compassionate coverage of the shooting that happened at hill. that's a very tragic scene and i appreciate the way that you covered it tonight.\n\n\n\nmorgan: well, appreciate that. thank you very much indeed.\n\n\n\nlanksford: thanks.\n\n\n\nmorgan: coming next, putting a face on the shutdown showdown. hear the stories from the people paying the price like a merchant that's struggling to put food on the table and the cancer patient worrying with the delay in obamacare will mean to him. that's coming up next.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\nmorgan: 800,000 federal workers are furloughed because of the shutdown. it's a big number. that's important to put (ph) a face to the suffering. tom penders is an employee at military base. he's also the sole provider of this family of four. and he joins me now.\n\n\n\nwelcome to you, mr. penders. now, to put your story to context, you're a civilian employee at a military base, you're sole provider your family of four, one of your daughter, you have two daughters, she's blind, she has autism, and epilepsy, and you live effectively paycheck to paycheck and you're already behind. you took to take some time off to get your daughter a service dog.\n\n\n\nnow you put all these together and it makes a miserable picture, for you, your daughter, and your whole family. how are you coping with what is happening now. what is your biggest fear going forward?\n\n\n\ntom penders, furloughed employee: well, my greatest fear is getting further and further into debt and not being able to climb out and also not being able to pay the bills, put food on the table, pay for the medications my daughter needs. yeah, things like that.\n\n\n\nmorgaan: normally, in these situations, you will eventually get the money back that you're not being paid now, but in the harsh reality of day to day life? does that help you that knowledge or if this goes on for few weeks, does the pain you suffer in that short- term period just be really very difficult to handle?\n\n\n\npenders: it's going to be difficult to handle. there's no questioning that. you know, telling me they're going to pay me down the road doesn't help me today when i have to pay the power bill. i have to pay the water bill, you know. and i have to pay insurance. i have to go to the pharmacy and buy medications from my daughter. well, how am i supposed to pay for it when i have no money today or when i get paid on my next pay day? you know, promising me something down the road doesn't help me today.\n\n\n\nmorgan: what do you think mr. penders of the way the politicians are behaving over this in washington?\n\n\n\npenders: i think they're behaving like a bunch of spoiled children, like a bunch of five-year-olds throwing temper tantrums especially the republicans. yes. they need to get over it. the affordable care act is law. it was upheld by the supreme court. it's law. it went into effect october 1st. and the republicans just need to deal with it, stop that point shoulder and get us back to work. i feel like i'm being held a hostage by the republicans.\n\n\n\nmorgan: tom penders, thank you very much indeed for joining me and i wish you all the very best. you're dealing also a very difficult situation to you and your family. thank you very much.\n\n\n\nwho is to blame to the shutdown showdown and when will it end? well, here with me now, star jones, the national spokesperson with the national association of professional women, and distributor of a new line of clothing in pvc it's called status by star jones can't think of a better person to be parading around in nice clothes. and so, michael barone, the senior political analyst for the washington examiner and author of shaping our nation: how surges of migration transformed america and its politics. and also joining us is josh barro, the politics editor of business insider.\n\n\n\nso welcome to you all. well, star, it's beautiful to having you back to really talk in general terms about what is going on. what is your view? you hear that guy. it's a classic story isn't where people say all these furlough has don't really hurt people. they damn well hurt people like hell.\n\n\n\nstar jones, national spokes person of national association of professional women: they hurt people all over this country. let me just put it in perspective. do you know how hard it is for people to save money on a regular basis? most people, not only do they live paycheck to paycheck. most people are one paycheck away from homelessness, one paycheck away from not being able to keep the lights on in your home, not being able to pay a phone bill.\n\n\n\nthis gentleman just expressed to you just very passionately what the impact of not getting his pay for just one pay period is. he doesn't get to go to the cbs and get the medicine that his daughter desperately needs. he doesn't get to buy the food, the dog food for the seeing eye (ph) dog who's there to help his daughter. these are real problem, piers ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: michael ...\n\n\n\njones: ... that they own in people's home.\n\n\n\nmorgan: i could see you wanted to jump in. you're not happy what you're hearing, why?\n\n\n\nmichael barone, senior political analyst, washington examiner: no. i'm not. i'm happy with what i'm hearing but i think in some ways, this problem was caused by james madison and 39 other men. i'm sorry there were no women then that signed the constitution in 1787.\n\n\n\nthey set up separate branches of government, the executive branch and the legislative branch. and that creates something in the nature of a constitutional duty to consultation. we had speaker john boehner announced some time ago that he wasn't going to negotiate with the president because he felt the president wasn't a serious negotiator in those negotiations they had in august 2011.\n\n\n\nnow we hear the president saying, i'm not going to negotiate. they either take my position or not. and the president has not been one that for reasons of personal character like smooching with politicians which is helpful, if it comes time to negotiate.\n\n\n\nso it's ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: you see that's the thing that i keep coming back to. bill clinton last week told me in a fascinating interview, how you deal with opponents? you got to get in the room with him.\n\n\n\nbarone: yup.\n\n\n\nmorgan: and when he went to the shutdown in mid '90s two in a month as it turned out, he and gingrich eventually got in a room and they thrash on agreement.\n\n\n\nbarone: not just eventually. they spent a lot of time together and ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: spoke everyday.\n\n\n\nbarone: ... well (inaudible) newt gingrich talking to newt gingrich about that time, one of the things he said to me, he said, one thing you have to understand about bill clinton, he never stops learning. and he learned in those conversations\n\n\n\nmorgan: and never stop talking.\n\n\n\nbarone: and if this is ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: not in a good way. i mean he said to me they would speak every single day, even when to the outside world they were at war.\n\n\n\nbarone: they were at war and i think the other cause of this is that in effect that's related to my book shaping the nation which is about migrations internal and immigrant back from the scotch, irish to the present day. the demographics of the country, why did we elect a democratic president, a republican house of representatives?\n\n\n\nthe republicans have minor -- marginal advantage at redistricting, but it's basically demographics. the democratic vote is clustered. the heavily democratic groups blacks, hispanics, gentry, liberals concentrated in many central cities. they dominate the electoral college by that because they make a lot of states safely democratic. and president obama with 51 percent of the vote got 332 electoral's a big majority. george bush with the same percentage and (inaudible) just got 286.\n\n\n\nequal population districts work for the republicans because the democrats are clustered in relatively few districts. the republicans that were evenly spread around ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: and what is the combined impact?\n\n\n\nbarone: so president obama didn't carry most congressional districts. he carried 209, romney carried 226.\n\n\n\nmorgan: so what is the ...\n\n\n\njones: they carry the ones that weren't important and not to make him the president of the united states.\n\n\n\nbarone: he got the vocabulary.\n\n\n\njones: yeah. so in some point everybody gave the score to like get over the fact the man has been elected twice.\n\n\n\nborne: but i'm letting out that people on both sides that principle, non-crazy reasons for taking the positions ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: they do. remember when barack obama that we elected it was john boehner who said obamacare is now the law of the land, we just lost the election. we've got to deal with it.\n\n\n\nnow it's a very different story from him and that's why we've got a problem with the way he's conducting himself.\n\n\n\njosh barro, you heard that it's a fascinating assessment there that the waddle (ph) breaks down. but what is your impression of the impact that's having right now?\n\n\n\njosh barro, politics editor, business insider: yeah, well i mean that's fine as an explanation for why we have a republican house and a democratic president but it's an excuse for why republicans have decided that they're going to hold hostage the normal operation of government in order to have negotiations.\n\n\n\ni think the pesident's line about this has been basically correct, where he says, i'm happy to negotiate the budget. i want to have a discussion about long-term fiscal reform, but first reopen the government and raise the debt ceilings. so we're not doing this in a hostage situation.\n\n\n\nnow i think michael is right that the president hasn't been very good in those sort of negotiations in the past then i think both republicans and democrats in congress express frustration with his ability to smooch with congress and advocate for his agenda on capitol hill.\n\n\n\nbut in this specific case he's right, that, you know, the kind of negotiation republicans are trying to ask for right now it's not productive and the reasons they're asking for it is because they feel the only way they can impose their agenda is by getting it through this kind of hostage situation.\n\n\n\nso right now ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: i want to just go to a member of the audience and sadly (ph) in different order actually not look question i was going to get, i want to go to michael plais (ph). where is michael? michael, thank you.\n\n\n\ncan we get michael a microphone -- he's got one. and, you know, the question i think is actually very relevant involving america's reputation to the outside world (inaudible). michael, over to you, you're an nyu graduate student in political science.\n\n\n\nmichael plais (ph): yeah, basically we're talking a lot about what's going domestically but i want to know what message are we sending to countries around the world. and especially those that are major creditors the united states.\n\n\n\nmorgan: yeah, i mean star jones if you're in china and you already own, you know, maybe a third of america's debt you're rubbing your hands in glee i think governmental shutdown the economy that was beginning to recover is now stalling and may well suffer irreparable damage if they default on the debt ceiling. you put all this together, this doesn't help america's national interest, they reminded them else (ph).\n\n\n\njones: you don't want to get signal to your creditors that you don't pay your bills. you also don't want to signal to your creditors that you can't pay your bills because your boss is not paying you. and that's where we are at this point.\n\n\n\nwe have the -- it's almost like the mother and a father in a family. we're always taught we don't air our dirty laundry outside of the house, but we have aired our dirty laundry all outside of our house, outside of the boarders of the united states of america.\n\n\n\nwe've conveyed to the world that we can't figure out how to get along and it's detrimental to women and children primarily.\n\n\n\nmorgan: yeah.\n\n\n\njones: this shutdown really does hurt women and children from the poorest of the poor, to the working women, from the small business administration. i mean it really impact on the people that it could not impact them (inaudible)\n\n\n\nmorgan: let's take a short break. i want to have more dirty laundry aired after the break. star jones is definitely the woman to do that. and coming next (inaudible) obamacare is delayed to the uninsured (ph) but with concentration with life by literally hanging in the darkness\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\nmorgan: day three and nothing but all they're saying gridlock (ph) and victory while all real people suffer. joining me now is another american with the real stake and (inaudible) in washington james brady has a rare form of bone cancer and no insurance, and also with us dr. brian van tine, james' oncologist from washington university school of medicine.\n\n\n\nlet me come to you james you're 24 years old. you signed up for obamacare and began chemo three weeks ago. what is your concern about what is going on right now?\n\n\n\njames brady, cancer patient: well, i have to say this is a scary situation for me. right now, i feel like obamacare was the shining light of my dark situation, but now with the -- while the congressmen shutting down everything i feel like my life is in a coin flip right now, if obamacare pass and i get my life, i get my life gets increase, i have a chance of me surviving gets increased or will it turn to tails. it's all a really scary thought.\n\n\n\nmorgan: you pretty heavily in debt, i think you've about $30,000. so, this really is a critical time to you and your life and you're just one of many people in this kind of position. let me turn to you talk to van tine, we spoke the other night with another one of your patients and they must all be going through a form of this kind of anguish because it's the uncertainty, it's the very last thing that people in this position need.\n\n\n\ndr. brian van tine, oncologist, washington state university: so, the rare (ph) tumor clinic at washington university in saint louis, and the siteman cancer center has a lot of young adults who come to see me and my colleagues with rare cancers that are just people haven't heard about, most of them are called sarcomas and this is tragic, most of this people were in the prime in their life, you know, james here had a business and, you know, his life has been turned upside down, you know, we have a foundation called cj's journey that's helping this people here and we do everything we can because i think it's important that i push as fast and as hard and as i can for somebody especially like james who is curable.\n\n\n\nmorgan: tell me this, i spoke to a very eminent doctor, a very famous eminent doctor in america only yesterday about this who didn't want to speak about this publicly, he didn't want to inspire any kind of party's own reaction, but he said that all the doctors that he knows believe that obamacare broadly speaking and there are definite fault lines with the current program but obamacare they genuinely welcomed it, they felt that it will be a force for good in america.\n\n\n\nnow, you know, what we're hearing all the time with all these debates obamacare is horrible, evil, terrible, it must be abandoned. you are a senior oncologist, you are at the sharp end of all this, what is your view?\n\n\n\nvan tine: i think especially for young americans this is an amazing opportunity to make sure that we can treat you right, i mean the liaison (ph) therapy that happened because people don't have insurance it leads to morbidity and mortality and it's not right.\n\n\n\nand i think this is not a third world country, this is united states of america and we need to stand up and say, we need to take care of everyone regardless of their age. and make sure that we are taking care of each other.\n\n\n\nmorgan: yeah, i couldn't agree more with you dr. brian van tine and also to you james grady just wishing you all the very, very best with your treatment and here's to speed your recovery hopefully we may solve out this mess and you can have that uncertainty remove from your current struggles.\n\n\n\nso, thank you for joining me too.\n\n\n\ngrady: thank you very much.\n\n\n\nvan tine: thank you.\n\n\n\nmorgan: we go now to the member of our audience kathleen westerfield and her son lucas who attends the head start program his a birthday coming up. so, happy birthday lucas you're not interested of what i'm saying because you have been all night playing your game and it's quite right too. so, let me get to your mom.\n\n\n\nkathleen -- is it great kathleen (inaudible) we'll be enjoying his company all evening. tell me what you are going through right now, what your particular concern is?\n\n\n\nkathleen westerfield, son attends headstart, put on furlough: as of tomorrow actually the head start program in florida will be shutdown. the head start program, just to give you a little bit information, the head start program is a -- is a service that is provided to children and parents. they not only service the needs of children as far as providing them with good food. some of the students aren't even able to -- they -- the only meals that they get are the meals that they get at school, they teach them how to brush their teeth, they make sure their dental is taking care off. they go above and beyond the call of duty to provide a safe place for these children.\n\n\n\nmorgan: and they shuts down tomorrow.\n\n\n\nwesterfield: and they shuts down tomorrow.\n\n\n\nmorgan: ok.\n\n\n\nwesterfield: and also i just want to say that they also provide for mothers they have -- they make sure that the parents get goals and they help to set them up for success.\n\n\n\nmorgan: so, that's ...\n\n\n\nwesterfield: so, there's a lot going, you know.\n\n\n\nmorgan: so, star, you see, when you hear this it just makes me so bloody angry, right?\n\n\n\njones: right.\n\n\n\nmorgan: because you're like how can you allow this to happen in america? jones: in america.\n\n\n\nmorgan: america, this is the land of opportunity your shutting down program like this because politicians just squabbling.\n\n\n\njones: and what we -- women can get to and i don't know what kathleen is a working mom also but in addition to completely shutting down the kids, their nutrition, that she pointed out the learning that they're getting it also throws the monkey wrench in working mom's lives.\n\n\n\nthis is where she takes lucas every single day. so, if she has to takeoff work and rearrange her schedule, if she does not -- if she does not have a guaranteed salary then that's going to impact on her ability to feed her family.\n\n\n\nmorgan: look if you're ...\n\n\n\njones: it is a huge snowball.\n\n\n\nmorgan: michael you're shaking your head?\n\n\n\nbarone: well, i think, i think -- i don't ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: don't give your answer now. let's have a short break.\n\n\n\nbarone: ok.\n\n\n\nmorgan: and we just fulminate.\n\n\n\nbarone: i'm not going to fulminate. i'm not (inaudible)\n\n\n\nmorgan: ... a way to work yourself into a fearful rage and we'll come back in three minutes.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\nmorgan: welcome back to our live time special on shutdown showdown. so, gentleman michael barone, you know, we can roll out endless stories of woe, of mystery, a cancer patients, and parents like this and it breaks your heart listening to them. what is the practical reality and how we get out of this particular situation?\n\n\n\nbarone: well, i think objectively we use of the terms bickering and squabbling and i think both sides are taking principal position ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: oh come on (inaudible)\n\n\n\nbarone: ... based on ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: sorry...\n\n\n\nbarone: (inaudible) actually serious sort of. well...\n\n\n\nmorgan: when you hear harry reid call them anarchists? barone: yes, that was not ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: that's not caucus ...\n\n\n\nbarone: that's not as -- that's not a serious ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: it's not the language of civilized people in washington, it's not the language of proper ...\n\n\n\nbarone: what i would say is that on both sides, on both sides i think they've made some miscalculations, i think the house ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: you think?\n\n\n\nbarone: ...t he house...\n\n\n\nmorgan: obamacare is a law.\n\n\n\nbarone: the laws -- laws can always be change the point is ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: you shutdown a government because you want to change parts of an established law?\n\n\n\nbarone: well, i think the republicans made a miscalculation by raising the issue of defunding obamacare, it polled poorly voters truly didn't want it, delay obamacare polls better i think that probably would have been a foolish thing for them to go on a ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: do you think what's going on to good principle politics?\n\n\n\nbarone: i think it's miscalculation by people who are principal politicians and i think ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: josh barro ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: ... the president on his part seems to think and harry reid seems to think that the democrats are going to get great advantage. i think they're overestimating that. i think though some of the damage but it's ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: josh barro, it's not about bickering. it's not about, you know, as i see it playground politics. this is about principle people, you know, who may have made a few miscalculations. your reaction.\n\n\n\nbarro: it's a principle position but they're using a hostage negotiation to pursue the principle position. the proper venue ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: hang on, hang on. let me just stop you there. because ...\n\n\n\nbarro: yeah.\n\n\n\nmorgan: ... i don't think it is principle to shut down the american government over the established law like obamacare. it's not principle. barro: the principle is that they don't like the law. i'm not saying that it's a good principle or a good strategy for pursuing the principle but they do have an endgame here. they want obamacare repealed. the problem is they all -- all the republicans know they're not going to repeal that ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: that's not the endgame. the end game is they want to get at barack obama, right? and by the way, it's not just the republicans who is guilty of this. there'd been 17 shutdowns in america each one of them to me is a complete disgrace. the idea that this great superpower simply repeatedly shuts down its government although, i think its petty squabbling, it's pretty shameful.\n\n\n\nbarro: there been lots of shutdowns and most of them have been quite different from this one. for example, we had shutdowns over and over again in the reagan administration but they were almost off three days, two days, one day. and when you do that it doesn't matter that much. like for example, right now, federal workers who are going without pay, they're actually not due to receive a paycheck until october 11th.\n\n\n\nso we fixed this before october 11, and then we agree as we haven't pass shutdowns to pay them for the days they were suppose to work. it will be all kind of ok. now, there's still the disruption where people don't know whether they're going to get paid.\n\n\n\nthe problem here is that the shutdown is likely to go on for a couple more weeks. and be really disruptive to the us economy. you also have other programs like the wic program which helps indigent women get baby formula. that's run in individual states and they have a little bit of money to extend that program for a couple of weeks.\n\n\n\nmorgan: yes.\n\n\n\nbarro: but as it goes on we're going to get ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: ok.\n\n\n\nbarro: ... more and more people actually losing those benefits.\n\n\n\nmorgan: all right. mr. barro ...\n\n\n\nbarro: so this is different in more irresponsible.\n\n\n\nmorgan: yes. josh barro, michael barone, and star jones, hank you all very much indeed. i'm sure we'll keep talking about this tonight, though.\n\n\n\nwe're tracking tropical storm karen forming in the gulf of mexico's of the storm is expected to hit the us coast on saturday and possibly make landfall as a hurricane. cnn severe weather expert chad myers (inaudible).\n\n\n\nchad even this is being affected by the shutdown in terms of the ability to track it. explain to me why. chad myers, severe weather expert: well, because a lot of the people that were working for the hurricane center either they're government contractor, whatever, actually got put on furlough. and now they're getting callback because this is a big deal. and i even i talked to dennis (ph), he is one of my guys, he's my pr guy that works at the hurricane center, he was put off on monday, he was brought back today. so were all kind of back in business. they knew that this was going to happen. they prepared for it.\n\n\n\nlet me talked about karen for a moment because it could be more than a cat 1. right now we're going for 75 miles per hour but the newest computer models are saying 90. 90 in the water right here somewhere south of either new orleans or maybe all the way to panama sea.\n\n\n\na 90-mile-per-hour storm isn't going to like just knock down everything. but the problem, piers, this area is a swamp right now. it has rained all summer long right here. and there will be a million trees that will fall down if the wind is 75 miles per hour right there. that's going to pay just power out everywhere across the southeast. so maybe not a major hurricane cat 2, cat 2, cat 3, but i'll tell you what, it's going to be a lot of damage just with the wind.\n\n\n\nmorgan: chad, thanks very much indeed. coming next, a preview (inaudible) interview with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu. that's next.\n\n\n\n(commerical break)\n\n\n\nmorgan: and we're on. when you've making interview with benjamin netanyahu, the israeli prime minister talked to putin. the shutdown showdown and this surprising comment on iran.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nmorgan: if president rouhani pick the telephone up and called you, would you take that call?\n\n\n\nbenjamin netanyahu, israeli prime minister: yeah, we're not the first to call and it's the question i'll tell you what i'll tell him.\n\n\n\nyou want the sanctions lifted, stop your nuclear program. why do you need underground bunkers? why do you need icbms, the sole purpose of icbms, intercontinental ballistic missiles is to carry nuclear payloads.\n\n\n\nby the way, not to israel, to europe and to the united states.\n\n\n\nmorgan: if you get absolute concrete evidence ...\n\n\n\nnetanyahu: nuclear weapons capability.\n\n\n\nmorgan: right. if you get it the evidence to your satisfaction incontrovertibly that they have got that capability is that your red line. and would you hesitate to take military action? netanyahu: no, i wouldn't. i have to turn it all in that eventuality but i hope it will not come to that because we prefer a peaceful solution.\n\n\n\nmorgan: we're in new york right now. the government in america has shutdown. i don't think you've ever had to put off with this particular eventuality itself. but what do you think of what is going on now. how does it impact israel? are you concerned if it goes on to long when it starts to really ...\n\n\n\nnetanyahu: no, i ...\n\n\n\nmorgan: ... damage the global economy?\n\n\n\nnetanyahu: yes, they'll work it out. you know, they'll work it out, been there down that but i'll tell you, you say we weren't there before, we actually worked. so, some of us introduced to change in israeli system, which by the way, i think is not as good a political system as the one in the united states.\n\n\n\ni think, with all its flaws, the american political system has a lot right important. it's probably the best political system in the world. but we improved on one thing.\n\n\n\nsee, in our case, if you don't get a budget by december 31st, an automatic budget goes in, 1/12 of last year's budge each month. and if you still don't get a budget six months later, we all go to elections.\n\n\n\nyou know, what piers? we always get budget.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nmorgan: and that's frankly was a fantastic idea. wouldn't we be great to see that how thing it works. they wouldn't let concentrate a few miles. it's a fascinating interview with the israeli prime minister, including the remarkable story of his very first meeting with the man who turned out to be the future president barack obama. it's in a tiny little cubby hole and to at an airport in washington. that's all tomorrow night.\n\n\n\nanyway, i recommend that viewing to a very lively encounter with one of most powerful man in the world.\n\n\n\nwe'll be right back.\n\n\n\n(commercial)\n\n\n\nmorgan: that's all for us tonight. i want to thank my studio audience and all my guests for very lively evening tomorrow night as we sit

if lawmakers don't act, social security's trust fund will be tapped out in about 18 years.\n\nthat's one takeaway from the social security and medicare trustees' annual report released wednesday.\n\nthat doesn't mean retirees will get nothing by 2034. it means that at that point the program will only have enough revenue coming in to pay 79% of promised benefits.\n\nso if you're expecting to get $2,000 a month, the program will only be able to pay $1,580.\n\ntechnically, social security is funded by two trust funds -- one for retiree benefits and one for disability benefits.\n\nthe 2034 date is the exhaustion date for both funds when combined. but if considered separately, the old-age fund will be exhausted by 2035, after which it would be able to pay just 77% of benefits. and the disability fund will be tapped out by 2023, at which point it could only pay out 89% of promised benefits.\n\nto make all of social security solvent for the next 75 years would require the equivalent of any of the following: immediately raising the social security payroll tax rate to 14.98% from 12.4% on the first $118,500 of wages; cutting benefits by 16%; or some combination of the two.\n\nmedicare faces insolvency two years earlier than expected\n\nin terms of medicare, the trustees project that the trust fund for part a, which covers hospital costs for seniors, will run dry by 2028. that's two years earlier than they projected last year, due to lower than expected payroll taxes and a slower-than-estimated rate of reduction in inpatient use of hospital services.\n\nbut the exhaustion date is still 11 years later than had been projected before congress passed the affordable care act, now known as obamacare.\n\nby 2028, medicare part a would only be able to pay out 87% of expected benefits -- a figure that would fall to 79% by 2043 before gradually increasing to 86% by 2090.\n\nmedicare part b, meanwhile, which helps seniors pay for doctor's bills and outpatient expenses, is funded by a combination of premium payments and money from general federal revenue. the same is true of part d, which offers prescription drug coverage. both will be financed in full indefinitely, but only because the law requires automatic financing of it.\n\nbut their costs are growing quickly. the trustees estimate that the costs will grow to 3.5% of gdp by 2037 then to 3.8% by 2090, up from 2.1% last year.\n\nsocial security and medicare remain secure in the medium-term, said treasury secretary jacob lew. but reform will be needed, and congress should not wait until the eleventh hour to address the fiscal challenges given that they represent the cornerstone of economic security for seniors in our country.\n\nwhere do the presidential candidates stand?\n\nthe country's long-term debt is very much driven by entitlement program spending, particularly in medicare. that's largely because the costs for both programs are expected to grow faster than the economy for the next two decades and then stay at or near relatively high levels for years after.\n\nso what exactly would the presumed presidential nominees do about that?\n\nas much as he publicly laments the country's debt, donald trump offers nothing in the way of substantive policy proposals to reform either medicare or social security, beyond promising that he will not curb spending on them.\n\ninstead, trump has said he wants to recapture money from other areas of the economy to shore-up social security.\n\nmeanwhile, hillary clinton has specified what she won't do -- e.g., raising the retirement age or cutting middle class benefits -- but she doesn't offer detailed or diverse policy prescriptions of what she would do.\n\nfor instance, she has said she wants to shore up social security, but then says she wants to expand benefits, which increase the program's costs.\n\nher only specific solution is to ask the highest-income americans to pay more, including options to tax some of their income above the current social security cap, and taxing some of their income not currently taken into account by the social security system.\n\nrelated: moody's: trump's plan would cost 3.5 million jobs\n\nadvocates for curing social security's impending shortfall have pushed for changes sooner rather than later, because the longer the country waits the more abrupt and drastic the changes need to be.\n\nthey also often call for a mix of tax increases and spending cuts to reduce how steep either have to be.\n\nas for expanding social security benefits, some propose making them more generous but just for the most vulnerable populations -- such as seniors living at or near the poverty line.\n\non medicare, clinton has said she would build on cost-savings initiatives created by obamacare and allow medicare to negotiate for lower prices with drug and biologic manufacturers; demanding higher rebates.\n\ntrump has said he would repeal obamacare, but he also supports letting medicare negotiate for better drug prices.\n\nthat alone, however, would not save the program much money unless the health and human services secretary is given authority to legally require lower prices, according to the committee for a responsible federal budget.
(cnn) even as the coronavirus pandemic rages, president donald trump and top republicans are pressing forward with efforts to further undermine the nation's already compromised health care system.\n\nthe rapid spread of covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus , has put a new spotlight on the same frailties that democrats successfully seized on in 2018 and are now moving to hammer away at again ahead of this fall's general election.\n\ntrump's continued support for a gop lawsuit to dismantle obamacare, with no replacement proposal in sight, is added fodder for democrats making the case that current crisis is inextricably tied to pre-existing failures. those holes in the system will be felt more acutely by millions of americans over the coming weeks and months, as they lose jobs -- and the coverage attached to them.\n\nmany of them will find that the safety net is fraying or nonexistent -- in large part due to the actions, over a decade, of republican officials. some 14 states, all with either republican governors or gop-controlled state legislatures, have yet to take advantage of the affordable care act provision expanding medicaid to low-income adults, though at least two were reconsidering that stance prior to the pandemic.\n\nthe white house is now scrambling to patch over the most glaring gaps, including with a new plan to use stimulus funds to cover hospital expenses for uninsured coronavirus patients . but efforts along those lines to ease the pain of the current crisis, like the promise of free covid-19 testing, have so far largely ignored the failures and inequities that made them necessary in the first place.\n\nobamacare back in the spotlight\n\nthe administration has also rejected calls to reopen enrollment on the obamacare federal exchanges and allow uninsured americans an opportunity to obtain coverage. the deadline to sign up for a 2020 policy was december 15 in most states. but advocates, insurers, democrats and at least two republican governors were hoping that, with hundreds of thousands already ill and the federal government taking extraordinary steps to aid a spiraling economy, the white house might relent.\n\nat a briefing this week, trump and vice president mike pence were asked to explain the administration's rationale for not creating a special enrollment period.\n\npence spoke for more than two minutes, touting some insurers' decisions to waive co-payments on covid-19 tests and treatment , before pivoting to the government's mitigation efforts and a vague promise to help the afflicted deal with any subsequent financial crunch.\n\ni think it's one of the greatest answers i've ever heard, because mike was able to speak for five minutes and not even touch your question, trump said, applauding pence's evasiveness.\n\nmassachusetts sen. elizabeth warren took a different view. in a video posted online friday, the democrat warned that the current health crisis is quickly creating a concurrent health insurance crisis.\n\nit's time for the federal government to just step up and say, 'we're going to cover everyone who doesn't have health insurance, warren said.\n\ntrump has been clear when questioned about his support for the lawsuit to end obamacare, which the supreme court is expected to take up next term . during a coronavirus task force briefing at the white house on march 22, he rejected any suggestion that he would back off it in light of the growing public health and economic crises.\n\nwe are running the bad health care (system) much better than it was ever run and we're making it better, but it could be much better than it is, trump said of obamacare, though his administration has yet to release a replacement plan. and so what we want to do is terminate it.\n\ndemocrats who organized to defend the law in 2017, and used the gop's attempts to gut the law against it a year later, have already begun to pivot in an effort to connect the issue with the administration's coronavirus response.\n\nit's hard to imagine anything worse during the spread of a virus than taking away health care if people get sick. republicans have never had a way of justifying their plans that take away health care but now that costs are, sadly, more real, jesse ferguson, a democratic strategist, told cnn on friday.\n\nmeanwhile, protect our care, a group founded by a former obama administration health official, has emerged from that fight as a leading liberal watchdog and rapid response group dedicated to tracking republican attacks on obamacare and other public health services. it has rebranded its newsletter as the coronavirus war room.\n\na repeat winner for democrats?\n\npolling continues to show democrats, up and down the ballot, with an advantage over republicans on health care, which is now guaranteed to remain a point of sharp contention, likely at or near the top of voters' concerns, as the general election approaches this fall.\n\nthe intensity of concern over the issue -- and its potential to drive up enthusiasm among democrats later this year -- was evident even before the coronavirus effectively paused the primary campaign.\n\nhealth care was top of mind for voters in the democratic primaries held in february and march, outranking income inequality, race relations and climate by a wide margin in exit polls in most states.\n\nhealth was also the top issue for democratic, independent and swing voters, according to a kaiser family foundation poll from mid-february. for republican voters, health care came lower down the list -- beaten out by the economy, immigration and foreign policy/national security.\n\nfor voters overall, 26% said health care was the most important issue in deciding their vote for president, narrowly beating the economy, at 23%. concerns over the two are likely to overlap as the death toll from the coronavirus rises alongside jobless numbers.\n\nmeanwhile, the affordable care act hit its highest favorability rating in the nearly 10 years that kaiser has tracked opinions. some 55% of the public viewed the law favorably and 37% held unfavorable views, the poll found.\n\nformer vice president joe biden, the likely democratic presidential nominee, hammered trump on thursday over the administration's obamacare policies.\n\nthe president must change course and allow open enrollment in the affordable care act, as even republican governors have called on him to do, biden said in a statement. he should also drop his support for a lawsuit that would undo the aca, because it would cost almost 20 million americans their care — the last thing we should pursue during a public health emergency.\n\nin the absence of federal action to broaden coverage, the initiative has shifted to governors and other local leaders.\n\neleven states that run their own obamacare exchanges, along with the district of columbia, have launched temporary special enrollment periods so their uninsured residents can obtain coverage outside the usual time frame. and while those who lose their job-based coverage are able to sign up for obamacare policies, the president's action would have eliminated some paperwork requirements for those already facing major life changes amid the pandemic.\n\nthe future of the us health care system has dominated the 2020 democratic primary , with moderate candidates pushing for the expansion of obamacare and, in biden's case, the opening of a public option to compete with private insurers, potentially driving down costs to individuals while covering millions more.\n\nbut democrats have been divided about how far to push reforms. the party's left flank, led by sen. bernie sanders, is pushing for medicare for all, a program that would guarantee coverage to every american -- a promise, as sanders' campaign has reminded voters over the last few weeks, that could have helped slow the initial spread of the coronavirus.\n\ndespite their differing scopes of their ambitions, democratic leaders are broadly pushing in the same direction: toward expanding coverage through proactive public policy measures.\n\nthat same pledge was the key to the party's sweeping victories in the 2018 midterms.\n\nnancy pelosi, who has won and lost her house speakerships amid squalls over obamacare, pointed to the issue in the aftermath of that election.\n\nhealth care was on the ballot, she said, and health care won.
new york (cnn business) big health care companies will undoubtedly be political punching bags during the 2020 presidential campaign, as candidates all seem to have their own ideas on how overhaul the industry. and that could be a problem for investors in the stocks of major drugmakers, insurers and hospitals.\n\nprogressive democrats bernie sanders and elizabeth warren have been touting their own medicare for all plans. pete buttigieg espouses a slightly less disruptive medicare for all who want it' proposal. and joe biden is essentially calling for an affordable care act 2.0, a revamped obamacare.\n\nmeanwhile, president trump is targeting high prices for prescription drugs and wants hospitals and insurers to disclose the rates they negotiate with each other for various procedures and medical services. while he said we will never let socialism destroy american healthcare at his state of the union address tuesday, investors have reason to be concerned if he is re-elected.\n\nbecause of these concerns, several prominent health care stocks have lagged the broader market's gains for the past year.\n\npfizer pfe merck mrk pharmaceutical giantwas one of the few dow components to fall in 2019. rivalwas down 3% wednesday after saying that the company may spin off assets in order to streamline operations.\n\nread more

his oxygen levels are constantly monitored; and a pulsating sheath, called a percussion vest, is wrapped around his chest twice a day to keep mucus from building up in his lungs.\n\nthey are able to care for their son, in many ways, because of obamacare. that's not because they purchased insurance on the obamacare market, nor did they qualify for medicaid. they got insured through howard's job. but one part of the affordable care act removed a barrier that could have destroyed any chance of the family's ability to pay for all their son needs to remain alive.\n\nbefore obamacare, families like the claytors faced financial destruction if a loved one developed a serious illness.the affordable care act lifted the lifetime spending limit on care that many insurance policies had. those limits often capped coverage at $1 million or $2 million in job-based plans.\n\nwe make good money, and it's still hard to get by, howard said. if it weren't for obamacare, (cedric would) be dead a long time ago, and we'd be out on the street.\n\nnow, the claytors find themselves steeped in uncertainty; they are unsure whether the terms of their current insurance will continue in the rush to repeal and replace obamacare.\n\na financial lifeline at a crucial time\n\nphoto: courtesy claytor family cedric claytor, pictured with a family friend, was a high school cheerleader and hoped to be an accountant.\n\na decade ago, cedric claytor was healthy and handsome, a gymnast and a cheerleader at saint albans high school near west virginia's capital, charleston. he went on to college and wanted to be an accountant.\n\nat 20, he developed budd-chiari syndrome, a rare liver disease that caused blood clots throughout his body and eventually devastated his liver. he needed a transplant.\n\nhe hadn't even had his liver transplant yet, and (his bills were) at $600,000, $700,000, $800,000, said cedric's mother, mary ann.\n\nyou would hate to see that your child would die, she said, because you were not able to afford to take them to the doctor.\n\nthe family was getting letters from their insurance company that said payments for care would soon cease. obamacare kicked in just as they were reaching the $1 million lifetime limit.\n\nthe claytors are not alone as they wait to see what becomes of the affordable care act and the removal of lifetime limits.\n\nbefore passage of the affordable care act, the majority of insurance policies in the us, regardless of employer, had limits on spending based on the lifetime of the policyholder, annual limits or sometimes both.\n\na 2012 study found that about 105 million americans with employer-provided or individually purchased insurance had some form of lifetime or annual spending limit on their benefits. the study, based on 2009 data, found that 59% of all workers getting their insurance from their employer had some lifetime limit on their benefits. and 89% of those who purchased their insurance individually had a lifetime limit.\n\ntrapped in a body unable to function\n\nphoto: courtesy claytor family cedric claytor's parents now use a manual lift to move him and a feeding tube to take care of him.\n\nfour years after cedric's liver transplant, his mother noticed her son limping. it was the beginning of another cruel descent into illness.\n\ncedric had developed a second rare condition, possibly inherited from the donated liver. it was a neurological disease affecting his motor functions.\n\nthe claytors believe cedric may have neuromyelitis optica, which can cause symptoms similar to multiple sclerosis. the diagnosis has never been confirmed, and they don't have the resources to take to take cedric to several doctors for a firm answer. and he's too delicate to continue moving around, let alone from appointment to appointment, to look for answers. so his family has resigned themselves in some ways, focused on just making cedric comfortable.\n\ntoday, cedric is a full-time job. he has a tracheotomy, a hole in his throat, to assist with breathing. he can move his eyes and mouth.\n\nsometimes, he's able to work on a computer, using his eyes to manipulate the cursor. but more often than not, he's a 29-year-old man trapped in a body that has ceased to function.\n\nfrom before the sun comes up to well after it's down, usually around midnight, the claytors do what that must to keep their son alive. mary ann left her job with the state of west virginia to care for cedric. her husband, howard, still works for the city of charleston, and the family relies on his insurance and paycheck to keep them financially afloat.\n\nwe're not rich, mary ann said. we're in the middle class that keeps getting beat down.\n\nthe claytors worry about any executive orders or new legislation may come next and what that would mean for their son.\n\nwithout obamacare, howard said, you just hate to see what would happen.\n\ncnn's sonia moghe contributed to this report.

coalition of republican-led states will argue in a us district court in texas on wednesday why obamacare should be declared unconstitutional.\n\njudge reed o'connor will hear oral arguments in the case brought by texas and 19 other states, which revolves around congress' reducing the individual mandate penalty to $0, starting in 2019. the states are arguing that this renders the individual mandate – which requires nearly all americans to have health insurance – unconstitutional and that invalidates the entire affordable care act.\n\nthey are asking the judge to block the law immediately and not wait until the case is finally decided.\n\nnotably, the trump administration will not defend several important provisions of obamacare in court. however, it is taking a narrower view of the impact of congress' zeroing out of the penalty, which was included in last year's tax overhaul bill. the justice department agrees that the individual mandate is rendered unconstitutional but argues that invalidates only the law's protections of those with pre-existing conditions.\n\nthe administration's move has left the defense of the affordable care act to a coalition of 17 other attorneys general, led by california democrat xavier becerra. they argue the mandate remains constitutional and that the rest of the law, in any event, would stand without it. also, they say eliminating either the affordable care act or the protections for those with pre-existing conditions would harm millions of americans.\n\nno one wants to backslide to those bad old days, becerra told reporters last week.\n\nconsumer protections, pre-existing conditions\n\nthe consumer protections targeted by the administration are central to obamacare and transformed the health insurance landscape.\n\nguaranteed issue requires insurers to offer coverage to everyone regardless of their medical history. prior to the affordable care act, insurers often rejected applicants who were ill or had pre-existing conditions, or offered them only limited coverage with high rates.\n\nunder the law's community rating provision, insurers are not allowed to set premiums based on a person's health history. and the ban on excluding pre-existing conditions from coverage meant that insurers cannot refuse to pay for treatments because of a policyholder's medical background.\n\nall these provisions, which have proved extremely popular with americans, meant millions of people who are or have been sick could get comprehensive coverage. but they also have pushed up premiums for those who are young and healthy. this group would have likely been able to get less expensive policies prior to obamacare that offered fewer benefits.\n\nthat has put the measures in the crosshairs of republicans seeking to repeal the law and lower premiums.\n\nhowever, their popularity is one of the main reasons gop lawmakers had such difficulty repealing obamacare last year and it has given democrats fodder for attacking republican rivals in the midterm elections.\n\nsome 52 million adults age 18 to 64 – or 27% of this population – have pre-existing conditions that would have led to a denial of coverage in the individual market prior to the affordable care act, according to the kaiser family foundation.\n\ncontinuing these protections tops the list of health issues that registered voters say they'll consider in the 2018 campaigns, kaiser polling found.\n\na new kaiser survey, released wednesday, found that three-quarters of americans say it's very important insurers remain banned from denying coverage based on people's medical histories. nearly as many say insurers should continue to be prohibited from charging more because of pre-existing conditions. this includes majorities of democrats, republicans and independents.\n\nin a sign of the issue's delicacy, a group of gop senators recently introduced legislation that they said would maintain some of the protections for those with pre-existing conditions, primarily banning insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums based on people's medical histories. health care experts, however, were quick to point out that the bill would not require insurers to cover treatment of those conditions, which could greatly limit the usefulness of the policies.\n\nif the entire affordable care act were invalidated, the number of uninsured people would increase by more than 17 million, or 50%, according to an urban institute report. many of those losing coverage would be low-income americans affected by the elimination of the law's medicaid expansion provision.\n\nthe legal arguments\n\nthe republican-led coalition of states is arguing that the obama administration and a majority of us supreme court justices said in prior cases that the mandate is constitutional because its penalty is a tax and the mandate is essential to creating effective health insurance markets.\n\nthe us supreme court already admitted that an individual mandate without a tax penalty is unconstitutional, said texas attorney general ken paxton, when he announced the lawsuit earlier this year. with no remaining legitimate basis for the law, it is time that americans are finally free from the stranglehold of obamacare, once and for all.\n\ndefenders of the law, however, say the court needs only to look at legislators' intent when they voted last year to eliminate the penalty.\n\nit's perfectly clear that when congress zeroed out the penalty in 2017, it didn't mean to get rid of pre-existing conditions protections, said tim jost, emeritus professor at the washington and lee university school of law.
aetna said this week that it was curtailing its presence on the obamacare exchanges to stem mounting financial losses.\n\nlast month, the company told the department of justice that it would probably be forced to withdraw from obamacare altogether if the agency blocks its pending merger with humana (hum) over antitrust concerns.\n\n[w]e believe it is very likely that we would need to leave the public exchange business entirely and plan for additional business efficiencies should our deal ultimately be blocked, aetna (aet) ceo mark bertolini wrote in a july 5 letter.\n\nthe letter was obtained by the huffington post following a freedom of information act request.\n\naetna's announcement that it would withdraw from 11 of 15 states next year amid $430 million in losses heightened concerns about obamacare's financial viability. unitedhealthcare (unh) and humana are also minimizing their presence on the exchanges after recording big losses.\n\nbut the pullbacks also come as two pairs of major insurers are planning to merge. anthem (antx) has offered $54 billion to acquire cigna (ci), while aetna would pay $37 billion to take over humana.\n\nlast month, the justice department filed suit against the companies to block their mergers.\n\nrelated: will obamacare survive as insurers pull out?\n\nsome experts thought it strange that aetna, which had voiced support and optimism about obamacare earlier this year, suddenly canceled its plans to expand into more states and review its participation in its current markets.\n\nsoon after the justice department filed its suit, anthem also tied its continued participation on the exchanges to its merger.\n\nas shared with the doj, our acquisition of cigna will help stabilize pricing in this volatile market, enabling anthem to continue its commitment to the public exchanges, and provide the opportunity to expand our participation to nine additional states, where neither anthem nor cigna currently participate, anthem ceo joseph swedish said last month.\n\nrelated: u.s. sues to block 2 major healthcare mergers\n\naetna's bertolini, meanwhile, wrote the letter in response to the justice department's query into what the likely consequences would be if it blocked the merger. he noted that the acquisition of humana puts aetna in a significantly better position to continue and expand its support.\n\nin the letter to doj, bertolini said aetna has been operating in the exchanges at a substantial loss and said it would be some time before we recoup our investment.\n\nacquiring humana will give it deeper reserves to weather the losses, he said.\n\nour ability to withstand these losses is dependent on our achieving anticipated synergies in the humana acquisition, he wrote. our analysis to date makes clear that if the deal were challenged and/or blocked we would need to take immediate actions to mitigate public exchange and aca small group losses.\n\nthe department of health & human services declined to comment on the letter.\n\nrelated: aetna to pull out of most obamacare exchanges\n\nan aetna spokesman told cnnmoney wednesday that the company wrote the letter in response to a justice department request. since then, aetna found that its performance on the exchanges in the second quarter showed a significant deterioration.\n\nthat deterioration, and not the doj challenge to our humana transaction, is ultimately what drove us to announce the narrowing of our public exchange presence for the 2017 plan year, said aetna spokesman tj crawford.

murphy asked.\n\nted cruz (21 hours)\n\nwhen ted cruz entered the senate in 2013, the texas senator was one of a handful of successful tea partiers who shocked the republican establishment into action after upending then-senate favorite david dewhurst in the 2012 texas primary.\n\nbut in less than a year, cruz laid the groundwork for an insurgent white house run in part by reading green eggs and ham from the senate floor to try and block implementation of the affordable care act. it was not a filibuster – the senate had ended debate earlier, meaning cruz was not actually blocking anything – but cruz still talked for a whopping 21 hours.\n\nby the end of it, cruz was a tea party favorite for the republican nomination, still three years away. cruz supporters across the nation still cite his lengthy debate against obamacare as one of the defining moments for the young senator.\n\nrand paul (13 hours)\n\na half year before cruz cemented his standing in the national conservative movement by reading dr. seuss from the senate floor, paul further elevated his family's standing among libertarian-leaning republicans with his own 13-hour-long filibuster to block confirmation of cia director john brennan.\n\npaul, the son of libertarian favorite ron paul, launched his filibuster amid a massive snowstorm in the nation's capital in march 2013 and locked in the significance with the hashtag #filiblizzard.\n\nthe standoff might not have garnered quite as strong a following among conservatives as cruz would accomplish six months later, but paul laid the tactical groundwork for cruz. and he also burnished his credentials as a leading crusader for civil liberties when weighed against domestic surveillance and national security.\n\nbernie sanders (8 hours)\n\njust one month after president barack obama took, by his words, a shellacking in the tea party wave of 2010, the president finalized a massive package of tax cuts with republicans – solidifying measures he said were needed for consumers still reeling amid the recession. and not long after senate negotiators agreed to vote on the compromise plan, vermont independent sen. bernie sanders took to the senate floor to blast away at the measure.\n\nit was technically a filibuster but did not actually block anything because sanders launched his talk-a-thon on a friday and ended it well before the vote scheduled for that monday. but it won him plaudits among the liberal base in large part because he talked it out as opposed to just stalling. and, not surprisingly, sanders hit on all the economic populist notes in that 2010 filibuster that would line his 2016 primary insurgency against hillary clinton.\n\nharry reid (9 hours)\n\nin the midst of president george w. bush's first term, then-senate minority whip harry reid took to the senate floor for nine hours to protest republican judicial nominees in 2003. as he held the senate floor, reid read from his own book about his nevada hometown, entitled, searchlight: the camp that didn't fail.\n\nreid was already a stalwart democratic leader in the senate by that point and did not appear headed for any presidential contests, but the filibuster and other fights against bush appointees helped cement his image as a scrapper in the trenches along his way to becoming the senate's top democrat.\n\nironically, six years later, reid found himself on the other side of the filibuster debate with republicans using the tool to block nominees sought by the newly-elected obama.

we'll do it a different way, trump told his supporters at a rally in grand rapids, michigan on thursday night. so we're going to get rid of obamacare and i said it the other day: the republican party will become the party of great health care. it's good. it's important.\n\ntrump's decision to support a ruling that would fully dismantle obamacare, even as his administration has no viable alternative, is a risky gamble. if the ruling is upheld by higher courts, about 20 million americans could lose healthcare coverage on trump's watch.\n\nit was that concern – and qualms about the legal justification for the move – that drew objections from health and human services secretary alex azar, attorney general william barr and white house counsel pat cipollone as the white house debated its position on the texas lawsuit, which was brought by a coalition of republican-led states. the texas ruling is being appealed by a coalition of democratic-governed states, because the trump administration declined to defend the law in the first place.\n\npresidential working group\n\nthe president said thursday he had tasked a handful of republican senators with cobbling together an obamacare replacement. no such working group appears to exist, however.\n\ni think the president just listed off the names of people he's spoken to on the phone about health care, one senate republican aide told cnn.\n\nspokesmen for sens. bill cassidy of louisiana and rick scott of florida, two of the republican senators trump listed as being part of the group, said the senators have continued to have conversations with the president and their colleagues about healthcare issues, but made no mention of a working group.\n\nsen. john barrasso of wyoming, the third senator trump name-checked, spoke with trump about health care on wednesday morning, but his staff said they did not have anything to share at the moment when asked about the specific working group.\n\nthe president's comments about the senators amounted to the latest attempt by the white house to reassure the public that it will have a replacement plan ready by the time the courts render a final judgment.\n\njust a day earlier, marc short, vice president mike pence's chief of staff and the former white house legislative affairs director, claimed on cnn that the president will be putting forward plans this year to replace obamacare through congress.\n\nwhite house officials were quick to tell cnn that short had gotten ahead of white house deliberations.\n\nthe white house has yet to decide whether it will take the lead on crafting an obamacare replacement, they said, or whether the president will punt to republican lawmakers.\n\ncnn's tami luhby, sarah westwood and jeff zeleny contributed to this report.
obamacare remained popular with millions of americans in 2018, despite the trump administration's repeated attacks.\n\nnearly 11.8 million people selected coverage for this year on the federal and state-based exchanges during a shortened open enrollment period, according to official data released tuesday by the centers for medicare & medicaid services. that's down only 3.8%, much less than some advocates of the health reform law initially feared.\n\nsome 8.7 million people signed up on the federal exchange, while 3 million picked plans in the 11 states and the district of columbia, which run their own marketplaces. some 27% of consumers were new to obamacare, a somewhat lower share than last year. another 24% were automatically re-enrolled, while 47% were returning customers who picked new plans, slightly higher than last year.\n\nenrollment isn't final until consumers pay their first month's premium, and the tally usually declines after the sign-up period.\n\nobamacare's open enrollment period was in the spotlight this past fall with both supporters and detractors poised to use the numbers to support their arguments. the modest dip in sign-ups allowed advocates to stress the affordable care act's value to consumers.\n\nrelated: 8 ways trump has hurt obamacare\n\nthe administration's final open enrollment report proves, once again, how important the aca marketplaces are for providing people with affordable, quality health care, said josh peck, co-founder of get america covered, an advocacy group. while enrollment remained steady because of high consumer satisfaction and more affordable premiums for those who qualify for tax credits, enrollment would have outpaced previous years if the administration had focused on signing people up instead of on derailing open enrollment efforts.\n\nmeanwhile, cms administrator seema verma said the open enrollment period was the most cost-effective and successful to date.\n\n11.8 million consumers enrolled for 2018 exchange coverage nationwide. great job @cmsgov on the most cost-effective and successful open enrollment to date! — administrator seema verma (@seemacms) april 3, 2018\n\nthe trump administration made many significant changes to the sign-up process for 2018. it cut the open enrollment period in half, slashed advertising by 90% and reduced support for enrollment assistance.\n\nalso, many insurers fled the individual market. those that remained hiked premiums amid the uncertainty in washington, d.c. and president donald trump's elimination of funding for obamacare's cost-sharing subsidies.\n\nrelated: what trump doesn't get about obamacare and health insurers' profits\n\nin a strange twist, richer federal premium subsidies actually made coverage more affordable for many people. many insurers loaded the premium increases into their silver plans, upon which premium subsidies are based. so eligible consumers received larger subsidies to put toward buying silver plans or bronze policies, which have lower premiums.\n\nthese folks are paying an average of $89 a month for 2018 coverage, compared to $106 last year. the federal government, meanwhile, footed more of the bill, with the average subsidy rising to $550 a month, up from $383 a month last year.\n\nthose who don't qualify for subsidies, however, saw their monthly rate spike to $621, up from $476. the share of consumers receiving premium assistance was 83% both this year and in 2017.\n\ndata suggest that more affordable healthcare options are needed - especially for those forgotten women and men who are not eligible to have their premiums reduced by tax credits. — administrator seema verma (@seemacms) april 3, 2018\n\nthough obamacare remained popular this year, 2019 could prove to be a different story.\n\nit will be the first time the individual mandate, which requires nearly all americans to have coverage or pay a penalty, will no longer be in effect. (congress eliminated the penalty as part of the 2017 federal tax overhaul.) advocates fear that even more insurers will exit the exchanges, which could leave some enrollees with no options to choose from -- or only more expensive ones.\n\nabout one-third of individual market enrollees said the mandate was a major reason why they chose to buy insurance, according to a new kaiser family foundation poll. but nine in 10 said they intend to continue their coverage.\n\nrelated: trump administration unveils alternative to obamacare\n\nalso, the trump administration is allowing insurers to offer alternatives to obamacare, which will come with lower premiums but fewer benefits. of particular concern to health policy experts are short-term health insurance plans. the administration plans to make it easier to obtain this coverage by allowing carriers to sell policies that last just under a year, rather than a maximum of 90 days.\n\nmany americans are concerned about their coverage options for next year, the kaiser poll found. some 58% of obamacare enrollees said they were very worried or somewhat worried that there will be no insurers selling plans in their area. some 82% were worried that their premiums will increase so much that they won't be able to afford their current plan, while 80% were worried that co-pays and deductibles will become so high that they won't be able to afford to get the health care they need.\n\nsome 53% of americans -- and 60% of obamacare enrollees -- think the exchanges are collapsing, the poll found. actually, insurers saw their aca divisions stabilize last year.\n\nnew poll: most americans -- including 6 in 10 aca marketplace enrollees -- say the marketplaces are collapsing https://t.co/fo1vdvikfp\n\nreality: insurer financial results as of the third quarter 2017 showed no sign of a market collapse https://t.co/ml1fan3zqj pic.twitter.com/cgydosl09e — cynthia cox (@cynthiaccox) april 3, 2018\n\njust over half of obamacare enrollees said that they were satisfied with their plan choices on the exchanges and that their health insurance was an excellent or good value, kaiser found. most enrollees said their premiums and deductibles were similar or lower in 2018 than in the prior year.

romney's 2012 presidential campaign and was a senior aide at the us department of health and human services during the george w. bush administration. the views expressed in this commentary are his.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nthe recent debate over the future of obamacare has obscured an important, but fundamental, truth: the american health care system is exceptional.\n\nit is entrepreneurial and offers patients more control over their health care decisions than anywhere else in the world. one of the primary problems with obamacare is that it does not prioritize these values. as the trump administration and congressional republicans consider what to do after the repeal of obamacare, they should, as the hippocratic oath states, do no harm to those elements of our health care system that are functioning well. but they should also take steps to promote policies that emphasize choice and innovation.\n\nphoto: lanhee j. chen lanhee j. chen\n\nat the core of our system is america's generally competitive marketplace for health care services. america has the most innovative health care economy in the world. no other country even comes close. this innovation manifests itself in the latest biopharmaceuticals, medical devices and surgical techniques, as well as rapidly evolving health it and quality and outcomes measurements. because our policymakers avoided price controls and tried to create competitive marketplaces for many of these products, we've driven down prices for consumers and expanded options for patients – all while promoting innovation.\n\nwe also have a tradition of valuing choice in our health care system. that means that rather than having health care decisions dictated solely by the government, most americans still have the final say over decisions about the care they receive. while government plays a significant role in our health care system, we have chosen to take a different approach than have many other countries, including democracies in europe and asia. the federal government doesn't impose price controls or engage in direct negotiations over price on most health care products and services. indeed, in the parts of the health care system where competition thrives, the marketplace maximizes choices for consumers while holding down their costs.\n\nfortunately, policymakers in america have examples of successful programs in the health care sector that have been premised on competition and choice to drive value and innovation. two, in particular, are of special note – the medicare prescription drug benefit (part d) and medicare advantage plans.\n\nthe medicare prescription drug benefit was passed in 2003 and has helped beneficiaries of the program get access to medicines at lower cost, which, in turn, has driven down the use of other (often costlier) health care services.\n\nacademic studies have associated part d coverage with decreases in hospital admissions and over $2 billion in savings due to improved drug adherence among patients with congestive heart failure. the government doesn't directly negotiate drug prices in part d of medicare, nor does it set the cost of the benefit. instead, health plans and pbms negotiate prices with drug manufacturers and then compete with one another based on price and quality, for market share. as a result, part d is the rare federal program that has come in under-budget. according to the congressional budget office, total program costs between 2004-2013 were 45 percent less than original projections.\n\nmedicare advantage (ma) plans offer a second example of markets at work to lower costs and drive innovation. these plans offer seniors a holistic solution to their care, combining medical and drug coverage into an integrated private health care plan. and they often include benefits that traditional medicare does not, such as wellness programs, as well as routine vision and dental care. as a result, an increasing number of seniors are choosing ma over traditional medicare and have a variety of choices of competing private plans within ma to choose from.\n\nma plans are able to achieve higher satisfaction and better outcomes for an equal or lower cost because they better manage care and effectively negotiate costs for everything from doctors and hospitals to prescription medicines. the cost-effectiveness of ma plans also has positive, spill-over effects on traditional medicare. a recent study in the journal health affairs found that the greater the penetration of medicare advantage in a particular market, the lower the costs for traditional medicare patients there.\n\nsome have suggested that government needs to play a bigger role in negotiating prices for health care services and goods, such as pharmaceuticals. such action would only stifle innovation, limit choices, and ultimately hurt patients and consumers here in america. many americans don't realize that, with respect to prescription drugs, they already benefit from aggressive negotiations between pharmacy benefit managers (pbms), employers, and health plans to secure the best deal. this preserves choice for consumers while reaping the benefits of scale – namely, lower prices.\n\nthough it is exceptional, america's health care system is not perfect. but its shortcomings are not a function of too much choice and competition but, perhaps, of too little. obamacare's premise was that more money and more federal government involvement could address whatever problems our health care system has. this approach has largely been unsuccessful at dealing with rising health costs.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\nthat's why republicans should build on america's

(cnn) more than 206,000 people signed up for affordable care act policies on the federal exchange in the first two weeks of the special enrollment period ordered by president joe biden, federal data released wednesday shows.\n\nuninsured americans who want to buy 2021 coverage on healthcare.gov could start doing so on february 15, thanks to an executive order biden signed in january. special enrollment runs until may 15. most states that operate their own marketplaces are also extending their enrollment seasons.\n\nthese numbers are an encouraging sign — but we can't slow down until every american has the security and peace of mind that quality, affordable health coverage provides, biden said.\n\ntypically, signing up for coverage outside of the traditional enrollment period in the fall is restricted to those who lose their job-based policies or have a change in status, such as a divorce. last year, only 76,000 people picked obamacare plans during the second half of february, according to the centers for medicare and medicaid services, which runs the federal exchange.\n\nbiden, however, reopened enrollment to give the uninsured another chance to select policies during the coronavirus pandemic, and his administration is pouring $50 million into marketing and outreach to let people know about the opportunity. cms is also providing about $2.3 million to 30 navigator organizations to assist consumers with enrollment, the agency announced this week.\n\nread more

(chip somodevilla/getty images)\n\nwhy is health care in the us so expensive?\n\n(cnn) —\n\nrepublican senators departed washington tuesday with the fate of their last-ditch proposal to overhaul the affordable care act still hanging in the balance.\n\nthe next few days will be critical for graham-cassidy, the latest gop proposal to repeal and replace obamacare. even with members out, leadership, the bill's sponsors and the trump administration are expected to go into overdrive to sell the legislation. centers for medicare and medicaid services administrator seema verma will be available to answer questions and ply undecided members with analysis on how the bill would affect their states.\n\npeople need information and that's why we're trying to provide them reliable information, said senate majority whip john cornyn.\n\nrepublican governors who have signed onto the legislation also are expected to play a role in courting undecideds.\n\nthe conversations continue over the next few days, said south dakota republican sen. john thune, who specifically mentioned that arizona gov. doug ducey would play a role in trying to convince arizona sen. john mccain to come on board. in the end, it's ultimately up to the leader.\n\nthe white house also will weigh in with president donald trump and vice president mike pence making whatever phone calls they need to.\n\nprogress on the bill\n\ngraham-cassidy has come a long way in a week. what began as a futile exercise to give obamacare repeal one more try before the party's vehicle to pass it with 51 votes expires on september 30 has evolved into a serious opportunity for republicans. but the rapid ascent of the bill has also made the last few days frantic for republicans who are still trying to understand what it does. the graham-cassidy bill would eliminate federal funding for medicaid expansion and for obamacare subsidies that lower premiums, deductibles and co-pays in 2020. instead, states would receive a lump sum of money annually through 2026.\n\nalso, like the previous house and senate repeal bills, it would sharply curtail federal support for the overall medicaid program by sending states a fixed amount of funds based on enrollment or a lump sum.\n\nmembers are still trying to understand how the change would affect their states.\n\nwhile members are away from washington, they'll be crunching numbers. the graham-cassidy proposal through block grants would fundamentally reshape how much money each state receives from the federal government for medicaid. there are winners and losers in the new formula – and some members are trying to figure out which side of the equation they are on.\n\non tuesday, republican members met behind closed doors to discuss the latest proposal, which many have acknowledged they didn't even start sifting through until this weekend. sen. john kennedy of louisiana described the lunch as a lively discussion. another republican member, who spoke on background in order to speak freely, described the hour-long meeting as very upbeat, with vice president mike pence encouraging members that if they could pass the proposal, it had a real shot in the house.\n\nthe bill's sponsors, sen. lindsey graham of south carolina and bill cassidy of louisiana, also spoke out and cast their plan as a case for state's rights.\n\npotential no votes\n\nnot everyone's reaction to the lunch was quite so positive, however. it was clear that tuesday did not provide republican leadership with the definitive green light they needed to announce they were bringing the health care bill to the floor.\n\nsen. susan collins of maine, who had already expressed serious concerns about graham-cassidy, went even further tuesday, suggesting that the new proposal may be even more harmful than the previous one.\n\nthe bill, she told cnn, would restructure medicaid in a fundamental way without carefully considering the ramifications, costing her state around $1 billion in funding over a decade. another cause for concern: people with pre-existing conditions would be hurt.\n\ngraham-cassidy seems to have many of the same flaws of the bill we rejected previously, and in fact, it has some additional flaws because there's some language that leads me to believe that people worth preexisting conditions would not be protected in some states, collins said.\n\nit didn't help that there would be no comprehensive analysis from the congressional budget office before next week, she added.\n\nsen. lisa murkowski of alaska also said the gathering did not help alleviate her concerns.\n\nspeaking to reporters moments after the governor of her state, bill walker, came out against graham-cassidy, murkowski made clear that the governor's opposition would weigh on her heavily.\n\ni have reminded him that it is one thing for us here in washington, d.c., to figure out formulas, (but) as a governor, he is the one who implements them, murkowksi said. so i want his input. i have had a couple of different calls with him and i think that's been beneficial.\n\nmccain was less forthcoming with reporters tuesday about his own deliberation about graham-cassidy. but he made clear he was less than pleased that another partisan bill was gaining momentum.\n\nasked about the senate finance committee's decision to hold a last-minute hearing on graham-cassidy next week, mccain sarcastically responded, i'm glad to hear that. that's wonderful news. ta-da! before proceeding to play an imaginary trumpet with his fingers.\n\npressed on whether one hearing counts as regular order, mccain quipped at a cnn reporter: do you think that that's regular order?\n\ni always thought regular order was hearings and debates and amendments and into the floor with debates and discussion and amendments! that's what i thought regular order was, mccain said.\n\nthe bottom line for leadership is they only need 50 votes to finally repeal and replace obamacare, and they are as close as they've ever been to getting there.\n\nbut time away from washington is an unpredictable factor, and it's not clear that the three members on the fence are going to be able to be persuaded in that time.\n\nthe problem for a handful of members is that reversing their no vote from july and voting yes on graham-cassidy would force them to publicly agree to provisions and a process they once decried.

(photo by justin sullivan/getty images)\n\nstory highlights every politician in washington is watching to see what happens in alabama. a moore loss would be yet another mark against the already-struggling trump.\n\n(cnn) —\n\nwhen alabama voters go to the polls tuesday to choose between roy moore and doug jones, they are, ostensibly, picking one out of 100 senators – not to mention someone who will only serve until 2020 before having to run again.\n\nbut this alabama special election matters a whole heck of a lot more than that. there are widespread implications that go well beyond the borders of alabama and could influence not just the 2018 election but the broader images of the two political parties heading into 2020 and beyond.\n\nthe massively high stakes are why you see both president donald trump and former president barack obama – as well as a number of democrats who would like to take on trump in 2020 – getting involved in the race as it reaches its conclusion. anyone who is anyone – or wants to be anyone – is making sure their voice is heard in alabama right about now.\n\nbelow, a list of the very real stakes in tomorrow's special election.\n\n1. trump's policy agenda\n\nrepublicans have a narrow two-seat senate majority. given the vocal anti-trump wing (john mccain, jeff flake, bob corker) and the number of moderate skeptics (lisa murkowski, susan collins) within the republican senate conference, it's already very, very difficult to get legislation passed. (see: obamacare, repeal of.) if jones managed to win – and polling is all over the map on the race – then republicans would be down to a single-seat edge until next november.\n\nfor trump priorities like building a wall along the mexico border or entitlement reform, a one-seat advantage for senate republicans isn't enough. and if past is prologue, democrats feel absolutely no pressure – politically or otherwise – to sign onto any trump agenda item. which means that even a single republican opposing trump forces vice president mike pence to break a senate tie. two republicans opposing a trump priority and that priority is doomed.\n\n2. the 2018 election\n\nevery politician in washington is watching to see what happens in alabama. every. single. one. by any traditional political calculus, moore should lose given the allegations of inappropriate sexual conduct with teenagers while in his 30s leveled against him. (moore denies all the charges.) but we are in extraordinary political times. trump, after all, won while dismissing accusations of sexual misconduct from multiple women during the 2016 campaign.\n\nat issue for republicans is whether the trump base – which views what the president says as gospel truth and believes the media is lying, at all times, for partisan purposes – turns out to vote for moore and whether that turnout is enough to put him over the top. democrats, by contrast, are trying to figure out whether they can come close to approximating the african-american turnout during the two presidential races of obama.\n\nif moore manages to win, expect the rising voices of criticism within the gop to grow quieter – for fear of trump. if moore loses, the opposite will be true: the floodgates of trump criticism from within his own party are likely to break open.\n\n3.the gop brand\n\nthe idea of sen. roy moore terrifies most republicans who have to be on the ballot next year. that sentiment was summed up nicely by the ever-quotable sen. lindsey graham on cnn on monday:\n\nroy moore will be the gift that keeps on giving for democrats and define the 2018 election, at least 2018, and to think you can elect roy moore without getting the baggage of roy moore is pretty naive.\n\nwhile the immediate concern – as graham rightly notes – is the 2018 election, the prospect of moore in the senate potentially has much longer tentacles. democrats can – and will – portray republicans as the party of trump (more than a dozen women accusing him of sexual misconduct) and moore (a series of allegations about inappropriate behavior toward teenage girls) at every chance they get.\n\nyes, both men have denied the allegations – fully. but those denials – particularly given the number and credibility of the accusers – won't satisfy lots and lots of voters.\n\ndemocrats, sensing opportunity, have worked to purge alleged sexual harassers from their ranks with the resignations of sen. al franken of minnesota and rep. john conyers of michigan in recent days. such moves are clearly designed to regain the moral high ground when it comes to men behaving badly with women.\n\n4. the #metoo movement\n\nin the last week, the #metoo movement has come to capitol hill – after becoming a driving cultural force in entertainment and media in the months since allegations about harvey weinstein's behavior went public.\n\nrumors are swirling – in the wake of the planned resignations of franken, conyers and former arizona republican rep. trent franks – that more members of congress may be swept up in all of this soon.\n\na moore loss would suggest that the shift in the culture has come to politics – even in a state as traditionally red as alabama. a moore win, on the other hand, might well serve as a sort of silencing mechanism for women in politics who are weighing whether or not to come forward with their own allegations of sexual misconduct. if moore succeeds in spite of all of the women who have come forward, all telling very similar stories about how he approached them and what he wanted, there could well be a sense among women weighing whether to go public that it's simply not worth it given the potential fallout.\n\n5. donald john trump\n\nthe president spent a few weeks playing coy about his support for moore – citing the fact that he was in asia when all of this news broke. he is playing coy no longer. not only has trump endorsed the controversial former judge, but he held a de facto get out the vote rally for moore on friday night in pensacola, florida and has recorded robo-calls in the state for the republican nominee.\n\nfor all of the white house's talk that they want to let alabama voters decide on their senator, trump has put a major thumb on the scale for moore in the last 10 days. which means trump has skin in the game. which means he has to own a loss by moore – if that happens. (you can be sure trump will claim credit for pulling moore over the line if the gop nominee wins.)\n\nfor a president sitting at 32% approval, a moore loss would be yet another mark against the already-struggling trump.
nota del editor: timothy stanley es historiador y columnista para el diario británico daily telegraph. él es el autor del nuevo libro «citizen hollywood: how the collaboration between l.a. and d.c. revolutionized american politics». las opiniones expresadas en este comentario son exclusivamente las del autor.\n\n(cnn) — aún lo aman. este sábado, donald trump pronunció un discurso durante un mitin en florida que fue tan grande y lleno de adulaciones como cualquier otro de los que hubo durante la campaña. atacó a los jueces federales que desafiaron su decreto inmigratorio y atacó a los periodistas que hacían preguntas difíciles. «ellos tienen su propia agenda y su agenda no es la de ustedes», afirmó. esta multitud era «nuestra gente», aseguró el presidente.\n\nesas personas no han perdido nada de su fe y no esperes que lo hagan.\n\nsu fidelidad es impresionante dados los acontecimientos del mes pasado. trump ha tenido que aceptar la renuncia de su consejero de seguridad nacional, le bloquearon su decreto de prohibición de viajes desde siete países de mayoría musulmana, y terminó la semana pasada con una extraña conferencia de prensa contra la periodistas que, a juicio de muchos de ellos, no sólo fue inapropiada sino aterradora.\n\npero los periodistas tenemos que recordar que no todo el mundo es periodista. fuera de la burbuja de los medios de comunicación, la opinión de estos está filtrada por el prejuicio partidista y a menudo es de un nivel bastante bajo. trump ha identificado a un enemigo que, según muchos conservadores, necesita ser desafiado.\n\npublicidad\n\nexplicación completa: no fui al acto en florida, pero he estado en muchos, muchos mítines de trump, y como he intentado hacerle entrevistas a la audiencia, he notado que los creyentes de trump tienen dos cosas en común. una es una sospecha en contra de los periodistas. siempre quieren saber qué medio represento y qué preguntas probablemente haría. una vez que la entrevista ha terminado, por lo general dicen lo mismo: «¿por qué los medios de comunicación odian tanto a donald trump?». respondo que estamos haciendo nuestro trabajo haciendo preguntas de la misma manera que lo hacemos con todos los políticos. pero no hay forma de escapar a la idea de que los medios de comunicación tienen una inclinación institucional.\n\nmis políticas conservadoras son inusuales dentro del periodismo. el creyente de trump promedio pensaría que soy un rojo. pero el editor promedio probablemente piensa que estoy a la derecha de chuck norris. y aunque ese liberalismo institucional no es universal (a fin de cuentas, fox y breitbart son también parte de los medios de comunicación) y no se traduce rutinariamente en prejuicios, el escepticismo sobre nuestros motivos es comprensible. si los medios mantienen enfocados a los políticos, los activistas políticos tienen la libertad de mantenernos enfocados a nosotros también.\n\nen los últimos años (especialmente desde sarah palin), enfrentar a la prensa se ha convertido en parte del programa de la derecha, así como asegurar la frontera o recortar impuestos.\n\nconsideran que una prensa liberal es perjudicial para la democracia y un bloqueo para el gobierno conservador.\n\ncuando vieron esa loca conferencia de prensa del pasado jueves, no compartieron la alarma mediática. vieron a trump luchando por sobrevivir, tratando de romper lo que ellos consideran el monopolio perjudicial de los medios sobre la verdad. se preguntan: «¿por qué los medios no permiten a donald seguir adelante con el trabajo que fue elegido para hacer?».\n\naparte del odio a la prensa, la otra cosa que he encontrado que une a los creyentes de trump es un miedo a la decadencia. a menudo se observa que los partidarios de trump son más ricos que la clase trabajadora que dicen representar, pero eso no tiene sentido. se trata de ciudadanos preocupados que tienen una antipatía patriótica por el desempleo o el terrorismo islamista. ellos votaron por trump porque prometió restaurar la grandeza de la nación, construyendo un muro y reteniendo en estados unidos los puestos de trabajo.\n\ndesde este punto de vista, los conservadores mantienen la fe en trump porque él hace lo mismo en ellos. su serie de decretos es una lista de deseos para la derecha: revertir los costos del obamacare, comenzar a planear una muro en la frontera, reducir las regulaciones, etc. su elección para miembro de la corte suprema es un antonin scalia joven. la blancura, la masculinidad y el conservadurismo de su gabinete demuestran que no está haciendo concesiones a la corrección política.\n\nsi trump hubiera hecho lo que tantos de los medios de comunicación esperaban que hiciera y se llegara al poder prometiendo unidad, compasión y piruletas, habría sido una traición a su base.\n\nlo sorprendente (casi impresionante) sobre donald trump es la consistencia entre el candidato y el presidente.\n\ny he aquí el ingenio de su estrategia antimediática: aún si fracasa, no es su culpa. trump y su base creen que la conspiración contra ellos es enorme y casi imbatible. al atacar a los medios con tanta fuerza como lo ha hecho trump, ha impulsado a sus partidarios para la derrota. es por eso que muchos perdonarán los errores que ha cometido en el último mes. los considerarán inevitables. donald, dirán, está haciendo todo lo posible.\n\ndonald trump necesita de los medios de comunicación. atacar a los medios es parte de la razón por la que ganó. el odio a los medios de comunicación es una de las cosas que reunirá a sus tropas a su alrededor mientras intenta hacer su trabajo. irónicamente, los medios también necesitan de trump. como el presidente ha dicho muchas veces, él es bueno para el rating.

(holly figueroa o'reilly countered on twitter with a highlight reel of the president's expletives.)\n\nfour billion miles away, a nasa robotic probe was taking new years' day pictures of the most distant celestial body any man-made object has ever reached.\n\nhappy new year!\n\npelosi's opportunity and challenge\n\nphoto: courtesy christopher weyant, courtesy cagle cartoons\n\ndavid gergen and james piltch wrote that there's no denying pelosi's central role in an unfolding drama that turns on one big question: whether the flood of new women into congress this year can begin the renewal of the badly broken political system that is increasingly holding back the country.\n\none problem facing pelosi, warned russell berman and elaine godfrey in the atlantic: the shutdown could sap much of the spotlight from the democrats' policy agenda, muddling their opportunity to drive the national debate, at least on their own terms.\n\neven after that, pelosi won't exactly be able to skate, wrote scott jennings. he recalled how the gop's just-powerful-enough freedom caucus tormented her predecessors john boehner and paul ryan, denying the ruling party the votes to pass a farm bill, raise the debt limit or fund the homeland security department. pelosi has it worse with her three-way split among a dwindling conservative wing, new democrats…and progressives, who smell impeachment. and if that happens, it could easily backfire and cost her party dearly in 2020, jennings said.\n\nocasio-cortez's clap-back\n\nnew york's freshman representative alexandria ocasio-cortez continues to drive her critics on the right crazy. how crazy? someone tweeted out a dance video she made in college eight years ago, apparently hoping to humiliate her (here is america's favorite commie know-it-all…). it went viral wednesday, and tons of people found it … delightful. well, @aoc is officially done. she'll never recover from the world seeing her… (watches video) …dancing adorably and having fun with her friends…? tweeted patton oswalt. then ocasio-cortez clapped back with a cheerful video of her dancing outside her new congressional office. i hear the gop thinks women dancing are scandalous, she tweeted.\n\nvirginia heffernan, in the los angeles times, welcomed the new dynamic that has women like ocasio-cortez using social media to run rings around terrified men. by turning up the volume on the republicans' terrified sexism, as a digital native does best, she's made quick work of her haters.\n\nrepublicans are making a mistake here, argued julian zelizer. by vilifying ocasio-cortez, the gop is helping to turn her into one of the political superstars of 2019. they are giving her more time in the spotlight and unifying democrats around someone who does come from a left-of-center perspective, and is pushing, for example, a green new deal.\n\nhere comes elizabeth warren\n\nphoto: scott eisen/getty images north america/getty images\n\nthe democratic senator from massachusetts announced via video that she was forming an exploratory committee for the presidency. a brilliant beginning, jill filipovic cheered. warren has done us all an immense favor by setting up the race and insisting it focuses on class and race, economic inequality and gender inequality.\n\nin the washington post, jennifer rubin warned that warren is a less formidable candidate than she was a year ago. she at times hectors rather than inspires, sounding more like an activist/law professor than a compelling leader, and flubbed her dna-test response to trump's pocahantas jabs, offending democrats and others, rubin wrote.\n\nget our free weekly newsletter sign up for cnn opinion's new newsletter.\n\njoin us on twitter and facebook\n\ndavid axelrod served in the white house when warren, as a house counsel, was pummeling treasury officials over treatment of wall street executives who were culpable in the financial crisis. some may find her edgy and dogmatic vision of capitalism off-putting, he wrote. but the cause of the embattled middle class is a natural one for her, a janitor's daughter lifted by her intelligence and tenacity from modest beginnings to this moment. these are indispensable qualities any winning candidate for president of the united states must own.\n\nmeanwhile, bernie sanders, faced allegations that there was sexism and harassment in his 2016 campaign. sally kohn found his apology on anderson cooper's show, in which he cited his campaign's gold standard for principles, defensive and totally inadequate. the gold standard is taking responsibility for the culture you as a leader create and doing everything in your power, rhetorically and otherwise, to root out toxicity within it.\n\ni'm a brit, and america, your health care system is torturing me.\n\nphoto: paul bradbury/ojo images rf/getty images\n\nhow do you stand it? asked rob crilly, who recently tried to get his bum knee fixed in america and found dealing with insurers and doctors' offices and new york's obamacare exchange like entering a maze from kafka. what no one had briefed me on was the sheer bewildering complexity of it all, he wrote. so, what is the solution? medicare for all, which progressives are pushing, sounds like a possibility. maybe it could work, like it does in britain.\n\nthe nixon letter he couldn't forget\n\nmemory is a slippery thing. cnn's michael smerconish thought he recalled vividly seeing a 1987 letter from richard nixon to philadelphia mayor frank rizzo right after rizzo lost re-election. nixon wrote: dear frank: i have learned that when you win you hear from everybody; when you lose you hear from your friends. count me in the latter category. or did he? smerconish tried to get the letter as a memento after rizzo's widow died. what he learned took him down a rabbit hole of recollection — and nixonian etiquette. it's a good yarn.\n\nwhat the navy kiss backlash is really about.\n\nphoto: wjxt\n\na tv station in jacksonville, florida, drew complaints after it aired video of a returning sailor kissing his husband at dockside — a re-enactment of alfred eisenstaedt's times square photo from v-j day in 1945. the reaction troubled danielle campoamor, who lamented our collective ability to overlook the facts. she noted that the eisenstaedt photo might well have documented a sexual assault (the nurse in the photo, according to some reports, did not know the sailor who grabbed her). if only people were outraged over a picture of a man forcibly kissing a woman and not a husband lovingly kissing his husband.\n\na snowman in space\n\njust 33 minutes after puny earthlings cheered the dawning of a new year (et) this week, something actually incredible happened deep in outer space: nasa's new horizon probe zoomed at 32,000 mph by ultima thule, a big frozen, snowman-shaped object left over from the primordial solar system, snapping pictures the whole time. it is the most distant astronomical body ever investigated, marveled don lincoln, a senior physicist at fermilab. brian may — the guitarist for queen and an astrophysicist – even wrote a song about it.\n\ncall it a triumph of robotics, which have let humans slip the shackles of the inner solar system and, as the famed television show said, gone where no one has gone before, said lincoln. the impulse to explore seems to be hardwired in what it means to be human…with space, we're just getting started.\n\ngilbert gottfried: bob einstein viciously insulted me…and i never laughed so hard.\n\nphoto: paul drinkwater/nbcu photo bank/getty images\n\nhe was super dave, the deadpan and hilarious fake stuntman who would show up in his jumpsuit on letterman or conan every so often, and he was marty funkhouser on curb your enthusiasm. and to comedian gilbert gottfried, bob einstein — who died wednesday — was one of the funniest guys he'd ever hosted on his podcast. einstein, whose tv-writing roots went back to the smothers brothers show, was a complete cynic and a total wiseass…totally certain and completely confused at the same time. even at his most forceful and energetic, he came across looking and sounding like a guy you woke up at three o'clock in the morning, wrote gottfried. i'm sad to say farewell.

i mean, how did we get to the point where i'm feeling like i have to use these words in a tweet as a candidate for president of the united states?\n\n\n\nbush: i don't know. i don't think about it that much in reflection because we're in the heat of battle right now. and we're all big boys. we all can take it. i get a lot of incoming from donald trump. i don't know if you've seen it.\n\n\n\nbash: yes, you do.\n\n\n\nbush: i get more than my fair share and i'm the only one taking him on. everybody else runs away from the bully.\n\n\n\nbash: why do you think that is?\n\n\n\nbush: because they don't want to be attacked by the bully. and there's no other explanation. if someone is trying to hijack your party, believes, until recently, that higher taxes is better than reforming the tax code, believes a single-payer system works well in other countries, believes in -- you know, is pro-choice, is anti- second amendment -- this is not that far in his past, all of those things. and now, he's on the vanguard of, you know, conservative cause. as a conservative, i find that offensive.\n\n\n\nbash: on the stump, he has been talking a little bit more about defense spending.\n\n\n\nbush: yes.\n\n\n\nbash: said that he doesn't want to increase spending but he does want to save money by cutting waste, fraud and abuse.\n\n\n\nbush: oh, sure. i mean, there is waste, fraud and abuse in the government. and we've laid out a detailed plan how to fix procurement, how to have fewer civilians in the department of defense. but you've got to increase spending if you're serious about restoring america's presence in the world.\n\n\n\n[13:05:01] we have gutted the military by the sequester. and as president, i would -- i would -- i would do the opposite of what donald trump is talking about.\n\n\n\nand, frankly, john kasich also has this belief that you can, you know, save money so much that you can't -- you know, that, on a net basis, you don't have to increase defense spending. it's not -- i don't think that's an honest evaluation of the needs of the military right now.\n\n\n\nbash: he's obviously got a populist message in trying to strike a chord with populists out there who think that --\n\n\n\nbush: donald trump?\n\n\n\nbash: -- yes, yes, who think that -- you know, that the government is just spending too much money needlessly and perhaps the defense department and the military is what the --\n\n\n\nbush: yes, and i agree. and we've laid out a detailed plan on how to reform it or the veterans' administration with outrageous management that doesn't provide care for the veterans even though there's been massive increases in spending.\n\n\n\ni've done this, though. unlike donald trump, i've actually reduced the government when i was governor of the state of florida. i reduced the work force, reduced spending, as it related to people's income.\n\n\n\nbash: let's talk about marco rubio.\n\n\n\nbush: yes.\n\n\n\nbash: how do you just feel about kind of how things have been going over the 20 -- past 24 or 48 hours? you know, kind of watching him, he's taking a lot of incoming now. bush: he is. he is. and i --\n\n\n\nbash: do you think it's deserved?\n\n\n\nbush: well, when you --\n\n\n\nbash: was his --\n\n\n\nbush: -- when you -- when you repeat something over and over again that's basically a canned phrase and it validates a belief that you're not ready to be president. this started, remember, when they -- he, himself, struggle about what his accomplishments have been.\n\n\n\nand the accomplishments that his campaign offered up, supporting a bill that became law where he didn't vote for it, taking credit for the elimination of a risk corridor inside of obamacare that he didn't sponsor. and the passage of one law with jeanne shaheen as a sponsor that i think i'm sure is a good bill, that's it. that's all that you can point to.\n\n\n\nwhereas, in my case, i can say, hey, i was governor of a state when we had eight hurricanes and four tropical storms. no one -- no one blamed the state of florida for its response. that we created the most ambitious school choice programs. that we took on lifetime employment protections for government workers. i've got a story to tell and he doesn't. and that's the difference.\n\n\n\nso, he kind of validated the weakness of his campaign. now, having said that, what i feel uncomfortable about is that he's a great guy. and he's my friend. and i admire him. and he can speak --\n\n\n\nbash: you just don't think he's ready to be president?\n\n\n\nbush: i think i'm more ready to be president. part of this is comparing and contrasting. i don't feel good when a friend is getting beaten up. i don't feel good about it at all.\n\n\n\nbash: speaking of that, christ christie, just moments ago, said of marco rubio, he said the lights are bright on you. and when that happens, you either shine or you melt. and you can't afford to have somebody melting who's president of the united states. do you think that that is possible? that -- i mean, what he's saying is that marco rubio isn't ready for primetime. do you agree?\n\n\n\nbush: i do when you compare him to governors that had to make tough decisions. that's the point. it's not that he's a bad person, to the contrary. look, one of the -- one of the evidence in florida of this is that every speaker before him and every speaker after him is supporting my campaign.\n\n\n\n(end videotape)\n\n\n\nbush (live): so, wolf, you can see there that jeb bush obviously knows that he has to bring marco rubio back down to political earth if he wants to get ahead and do reasonably well here in new hampshire tomorrow. but he clearly is not that comfortable with it, given the fact that the two of them have historically been friends. he still calls marco rubio his friend.\n\n\n\nand this, if you kind of rewind time, it all goes back to the fact that the jeb bush campaign and jeb bush, himself, were shocked that rubio even decided to run after bush announced his candidacy. so, there are so many plots and subplots going on here in this very, very intense last 24 hours before the primary -- wolf.\n\n\n\nblitzer: it certainly is getting intense with only a few hours left to go.\n\n\n\nall right, dana, good work. thanks very much.\n\n\n\ndonald trump and jeb bush, as you heard, they have been trading insults at an increasing rate. joining us now on the phone to respond to what we just heard from jeb bush is donald trump.\n\n\n\nmr. trump, thanks very much for joining us. so, let me get your immediate reaction to what we just heard from jeb bush and then we'll go into some specifics. go ahead.\n\n\n\ndonald trump (r), presidential candidate (via telephone): well, i did hear part of it, wolf. and, frankly, you know, well, he's a stiff. he's not a guy that can be president. he doesn't have what it takes. and just in listening to the last part of the conversation, he talks about marco rubio and says, he's my friend. he's my friend. he's lying about that. he can't stand him because marco rubio's making him look bad.\n\n\n\nhe's doing much better than, frankly, jeb bush is doing. and they're not friends. why does he have to say, he's my friend? he goes around saying about me, he's a gifted politician, a highly-gifted politician, about me. and then, he goes, he's a great entertainer. but then, he goes hostile because he sees how well i'm doing.\n\n\n\nand i hear him lying. you know, number one, i'm pro-life. he says i'm not. he says i'm not on the second amendment. nobody's stronger on the second amendment. i guess you can hear me ok, wolf, can't you?\n\n\n\n[13:10:09] i hear you fine. but let me just --\n\n\n\ntrump: ok, good.\n\n\n\nblitzer: -- read to you the tweet that he put out just a little while ago, and he was addressing it to you at real (ph) donald trump. he says this. he says, you aren't just a loser. you are a liar and a whiner. john mccain is a hero. over and out. that's the tweet that jeb bush put out a just a little while ago. i want to get your reaction, specifically --\n\n\n\ntrump: well, he's a desperate person.\n\n\n\nblitzer: -- on those are very tough words.\n\n\n\ntrump: look, wolf, he's a desperate person. he's a sad and, you know, he's a pathetic person. he doesn't even use his last name in his ads. he's a sad person who has gone absolutely crazy. i mean, this guy is a -- he's a nervous wreck. i've never seen anything like it. and he's saying things like that.\n\n\n\ni get along very well with john mccain. you know, i was on john mccain's committee for his election to try and help him get elected. it didn't work out for him but that's ok. he was -- you know, john mccain, he's fine. i like john mccain.\n\n\n\ni know he says that i called john mccain all sorts of names. i call everybody names. actually, the person i called the names is jeb because jeb isn't in favor of common core. in other words, your children have to be taken care of from washington. he's weak on immigration. i mean, just look at these things. remember, he said -- it was on your show, i saw it. they come as an act of love, immigration, on -- you remember the thing on -- let's see, i just wrote down one other thing here. the texas stadium, when he talks about the taking of land. well, they used -- the bush family used the taking of land privately, eminent domain, on texas stadium. so, you look at this guy and this stuff, it's absolutely amazing.\n\n\n\nblitzer: but he says -- he says specifically that --\n\n\n\ntrump: he didn't know that they used -- no, wolf, he didn't know that they used private -- they used -- they privatized it. he didn't know that. but they used it on the texas stadium, having to do with eminent domain. and he didn't even know that. and on top of it, wolf, he spent over $100 million and he's a failed candidate. i mean, he's a laughingstock.\n\n\n\nblitzer: well, he says you're -- he says -- he says you aren't just -- he --\n\n\n\n(crosstalk)\n\n\n\n-- says you aren't just a loser. he says you aren't just a loser, you are a liar and a whiner. i mean, those are tough pretty tough words he's saying about you.\n\n\n\ntrump: no, i'm not a whiner. i get things done. you know, i get things done. look, jeb is the kind of a guy if he weren't in government, nobody would give him a job. couldn't get a job. you look at what he says, i mean, he lies so much. i'm very strong on second amendment. you know that. you've been at my speeches. i'm very strong on low taxes. i've got a huge tax cut for everybody. he says i want to raise taxes on everybody. i mean, you know, how do you do that? a guy goes out, he says he wants to raise taxes. the guy is -- you know, he's got a failed campaign. he's a nervous wreck. he's probably going to be the last of the governors, i would say. you know, certainly he's the least talented of the governors.\n\n\n\nand, you know, he's done very poorly in the debates over the period of time. and what he does is he goes around saying, i'm the only one to have courage to go after trump. i (inaudible) trump and i'm the only one. what courage is it? he says nasty things. i always put him down on the dais and he goes away like a little sheep. you know, the guy is just not a majesty (ph) -- he shouldn't be doing what he -- he should speech much more positively. but i just heard the last part where he -- you know, he talked about second amendment. who's better with the second amendment than me?\n\n\n\nand for low taxes, i have a tax bill. and according to larry kudlow, i have the biggest tax cut of any candidate. i mean, i have a massive tax cut because, right now, we're the highest taxed country in the world. so, jeb is having some kind of breakdown i think. and, you know, look, he's an embarrassment to his family. he has to bring his mother out and lug his mother around at 90 years old. i think it's a very sad situation that's taking place. but he lies.\n\n\n\nand then, i hear him -- wolf, i hear him saying that marco rubio, he's my friend. he's my friend. why does he say he's a friend? they're not friends. he hates marco rubio so much, he can't even stand the sight of him because, frankly, marco rubio did something where he said he's better than jeb. he probably is, by the way. but he's better than jeb and he violated the relationship.\n\n\n\nbut why would jeb go and say, he's my friend? you know that's not true. that's called political speak. and you make a living off political speak. but that's called political speak. he's my friend. he shouldn't say he's my friend because it's a lie just like the things that he says about me are a lie.\n\n\n\nblitzer: he's not just attacking you. he's attacking, as you point out, marco rubio as well. and at that republican presidential --\n\n\n\ntrump: i know but --\n\n\n\nblitzer: -- debate --\n\n\n\ntrump: -- why would he say that marco rubio is his friend? he just said -- i heard it on your show. i'm just waiting --\n\n\n\nblitzer: i think that -- at one point, they were friends when --\n\n\n\ntrump: no, no, no. but he's not saying that. he said marco rubio is his friend. not past tense. he says, currently,\n\n\n\n[13:15:00] marco rubio is -- they're not friends. they can't stand each other. and that's the problem with politicians. and maybe why i'm doing so well.\n\n\n\nblitzer: well, what did you -- what was your reaction --\n\n\n\ntrump: and (inaudible) like this -- i just told you -- wolf, excuse me.\n\n\n\nblitzer: yes\n\n\n\ntrump: i just told you about eminent domain. he's talking about eminent domain. he used it on texas stadium. he didn't use it because he's not smart enough to use it, but it was used by the (inaudible) --\n\n\n\nblitzer: well, his family, his brother -- his brother and other members of the family were directly involved in the texas rangers --\n\n\n\ntrump: i know but how -- how he criticized --\n\n\n\nblitzer: apparently he wasn't directly involved.\n\n\n\ntrump: you're right, wolf, but how can he criticize me for using eminent domain when his own family used it?\n\n\n\nblitzer: well, that's a -- that's a fair point.\n\n\n\nlet's talk about marco rubio for a moment. what was your reaction? he clearly seemed to stumble at that republican debate the other night going back two or three or four times with the same line -- i think it was four times. he basically -- instead of answering the question, he switched the subject talking about president obama, how he's doing a lot of damage to the country. how much damage do you think that did to marco rubio on the eve of the new hampshire primary?\n\n\n\ntrump: well, i hope it didn't do too much. i mean i just can't answer the question. i was standing there when it happened and i sort of heard it once, and that was fine. and then i heard it twice, and that was sort of ok because, you know, some people repeat themselves. and then i heard it at least two more times, maybe three more times, and i said, that's a little bit strange. i didn't know what was going on because i'm standing right next to him and i keep hearing the same language. so i really don't know if it hurt him. maybe it didn't hurt him at all. maybe it hurt him a lot. you will see that probably tomorrow.\n\n\n\nblitzer: who is your biggest competition on the republican side?\n\n\n\ntrump: well, i sort of thought it was going to be marco, actually. i thought marco rubio would be maybe the biggest just based on, you know, the way it was working out. i can't tell you. you never know -- you never know. it's the world of politics. you and i know it pretty well and you never really know the answer to a question like that. i just worry about myself. i'm thinking only in terms of the people of new hampshire. we have a great relationship. i'm going to have strong borders. we're going to stop the heroin from pouring in. it's the biggest question i get in new hampshire, wolf, is the heroin and the drugs that are pouring into new hampshire.\n\n\n\nblitzer: yes.\n\n\n\ntrump: and it's -- it's, literally, you know, it's so unusual because it's such an incredible place. it's so beautiful. and yet their number one question is always about the heroin and drugs that are pouring in. and i'll stop that cold at the border. and guys like marco and jeb probably even more so, they don't have a clue. they can't -- they can't stop it.\n\n\n\nblitzer: what about ted cruz?\n\n\n\ntrump: well, i thought that he was, you know, doing really well. i mean he was doing really well, but he doesn't seem to be doing so well up here.\n\n\n\nblitzer: you think he cheated in iowa? trump: say it, wolf?\n\n\n\nblitzer: i said, do you think he cheated in iowa?\n\n\n\ntrump: well, i think it was a sad situation for dr. carson. dr. carson is a wonderful guy. and, frankly, a lot of votes were taken. and if those votes weren't taken, it probably would have been a different result. so i was sort of affected by that, too. not that i mind. in that case, it was the first time i've ever done it. i came in a very strong second. a very -- you know, pretty close. and, frankly, a lot of votes were taken from carson.\n\n\n\nso -- but i don't even think about that now. i only think about new hampshire. we want to have a great victory in new hampshire. and we're going to lower taxes and we're going do all of the thanks that i know that i can do that these politicians can't do. because the politicians, they're all talk, no action. nobody knows them better than i do, wolf. and, you know, i deal with them. i was on the other side of the ledger from them, don't forget, wolf, my whole life until seven months ago. and many of these people i contributed to. many of the people i'm running against i contributed to.\n\n\n\nblitzer: quick -- quick -- a quick question about ted cruz, who won in iowa, at least officially according to the republicans. before the republican debate over the weekend, he had said you do not have -- his words -- the temperament to be president of the united states. he was asked about that at the debate. he refused to say that in front of you. he wouldn't say in front of you what he said earlier. what does that say to you about him?\n\n\n\ntrump: it says -- it say that he respects me and he respects me a lot. and a lot of these guys will talk big, but in front of you they won't talk. so what that says is he respects me. and i respected him for not saying it because, you know, it really shows that he had -- you know, he has a great deal of respect for me. i respect the fact that he didn't say it, frankly.\n\n\n\ni was a little surprised, actually, because politicians will say anything.\n\n\n\nblitzer: will you -- will you win in new hampshire tomorrow?\n\n\n\ntrump: (inaudible) actually play nice.\n\n\n\nblitzer: will you win in new hampshire tomorrow?\n\n\n\ntrump: i hope so. i mean it's snow, and i hope the snow doesn't affect it. but i certainly have the biggest crowds and we have a great turnout. and it's all about making america great again and that's what we're going to do. and the politicians will never be able to do it. nobody knows them better than me. you don't even know them as good as i know them. and i will tell you, they don't have it. they're not going to be able to make america great again. not going to happen.\n\n\n\nblitzer: let me -- let me wrap it up with a question because it's a cnn report that we're just getting in from our paul cruickshank, our terrorism analyst, and it's an important story, cnn now reporting that there was evidence that there were 60 isis fighters on the ground in europe to carry out attacks on five cities in europe, including paris, london, berlin, and in belgium. and that presumably that they're still there right now. if you were president of the united states, what would you do about that?\n\n\n\n[13:20:20] trump: i would knock the hell out of isis, wolf. i would knock them out and they would be gone so fast. and i'd use the full force. we would take care of them. it's a -- it's a cancer on the world. and this whole migration, letting these people in, and they may be isis, is insane. look at what's happening in germany. look at what's happening in europe. and you've just seen the beginning. we have no idea what these people come from. you've got to knock them out and you've got to knock them out fast.\n\n\n\nblitzer: you want to give us details how you would do that?\n\n\n\ntrump: i don't want to do that now, no. the last thing i want to do is that. you have to have a little bit of surprise every once in a while without telling our plans.\n\n\n\nblitzer: donald trump joining us on the phone from new hampshire.\n\n\n\nmr. trump, thanks very much.\n\n\n\ntrump: ok, thank you very much, wolf. an honor.\n\n\n\nblitzer: thank you.\n\n\n\ncoming up, bill clinton goes on the attack against his wife's opponent, calling some of bernie sanders' supporters sexist. we have the center's campaign here to respond live.\n\n\n\nand why are hillary clinton's surrogates calling out young women for not supporting her? we have the clinton campaign as well. they will explain.\n\n\n\n(commercial break)\n\n\n\n[13:25:12] blitzer: hillary clinton speaking at a rally, an event, a town hall in new hampshire right now, manchester. let's listen in briefly.\n\n\n\nhillary clinton (d), presidential candidate: obamacare all those years ago. and we tried really hard, and we weren't successful. the drug companies, insurance companies really spent a lot of money, as they seem to do wherever i'm around, trying to prevent good things from happening.\n\n\n\nand it was disappointing. i sure felt, after having talked to so many americans, that the direction we were trying to head was exactly right because look what was going on back then. some of us remember. the insurance companies called all the shots. if you had pre-existing conditions, you were out of luck. if you're a woman, you paid more than a man. if you were a young person, there was no way you could get insurance. and there were lifetime limits that prevented people from getting the health care they need.\n\n\n\nso after we were unsuccessful, i thought hard about, what can i do. and there were a lot of stories that i had heard during the course of my work. but i just want to tell you one.\n\n\n\ni was at the children's hospital in cleveland. and i went there because i was meeting with parents of very ill children who could not get insurance. and i listened to their stories, and, you know, as a mom, they were hard to hear. and then one man said, you know, here's what i don't understand, he told me. he said, i'm successful. i have my own business. i provide health insurance for my employees and their families. i have two daughters with cystic fibrosis. nobody will sell me an insurance policy no matter what i offer. i said, what do they say to you? he said, well, the last conversation that i had, i asked, i told them i could afford something, anything that would help me. and the man just looked at me and he said, you don't understand, we don't insure burning houses. and this father, with tears in his eyes, just said, they called my little girls burning houses.\n\n\n\nso that's why i went to work on the children's health insurance program. and we got a bipartisan coalition in the senate and the house, and we passed it. and eight million kids at least had insurance. was it everything we wanted? no.\n\n\n\nblitzer: all right, so hillary clinton is telling a moving story out there in manchester, new hampshire, right now. we'll continue to monitor what else she's saying.\n\n\n\nonly moments ago, by the way, bill clinton told the crowd, and i'm quoting him now, he said, i have to be careful what i say. listen to this.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nbill clinton, former u.s. president: the hotter this election gets, the more i wish i were just a former president and just for a few month not the spouse of the next one because, you know, i have to be careful what i say.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nblitzer: he was alluding to remarks over the weekend when he lashed out at some of bernie sanders' backers. he accused them of sexist and even profane attacks against hillary clinton supporters.\n\n\n\n(begin video clip)\n\n\n\nbill clinton, former u.s. president: people who have gone online to defend hillary and explain, just explain why they supported her, have been subject to vicious trolling and attacks that are literally too profane often, not to mention sexist, to repeat.\n\n\n\n(end video clip)\n\n\n\nblitzer: our senior washington correspondent, jeff zeleny, is joining us now live from manchester, where the clintons, as you see, have been campaigning.\n\n\n\nexplain exactly what bill clinton was talking about then, what he's saying today.\n\n\n\njeff zeleny, cnn senior washington correspondent: hey, wolf.\n\n\n\nwell, this was yesterday when bill clinton was out on the campaign trail by himself. he was trying to rally these new hampshire voters. and he was trying to get people to draw a bit more attention and more scrutiny to bernie sanders' campaign and his record. and that particular moment, he was talking about a group of sanders supporters, sometimes called bernie bros, generally male supporters online who have been very critical and made sexist comments about people who support hillary clinton.\n\n\n\nnow, bernie sanders has disavowed all of these comments. he told jake tapper on cnn yesterday that he does not condone any of that. that was bill clinton trying to draw attention to some of the negative attacks that they believe that they're up against. then he did several negative attacks of his own. he said that senator sanders has not been as pure as he said on fundraising.\n\n\n\nbut, wolf, it's a different picture today. bill clinton was introducing his wife, secretary hillary clinton, as you saw just a second ago, and he said he has to be careful of what he says. now, he is one of the best advocates for her. he is one of the best people who make the case for her election. but he also tried to put some context into this whole discussion of the anti-establishment or the establishment. let's listen to what he said.\n\n\n\n[13:29:56] (begin video clip)\n\n\n\nbill clinton, former u.s. president: but it bothers me to be in an election where debate is impossible because, if you disagree, you're just part of the establishment. you'll have to forgive me, but i don't think your governor and your senator, i don't think of them as establishment politicians wedded (ph) to the old ways.

and as long as there's a market for them, they should be used by the government to improve society.\n\nif that sounds a bit socialist, it is, but so are the self-described democratic socialists like sanders and ocasio-cortez.\n\nthe liberal krugman, for the record, while approving of the higher taxes, has been less friendly to mmt, as its known.\n\nwhile it may literally be true that a government with its own currency can't go bankrupt, it can destroy that currency if it loses fiscal credibility, he wrote back in 2011.\n\nbut people like stephanie kelton, sanders' economist in 2016, a professor at stony brook university, and a proselytizer for this view toward currencies and national economies, argues that the government essentially prints money each time it authorizes new unpaid for programs and that it hasn't hurt the economy by causing runaway inflation.\n\nwe asked her for her her thoughts on the national debt as it approaches $22 trillion. that exchange is below:\n\ncnn: we've spent years and years in us politics worrying about the national debt, which is going to hit $22 trillion any day. $22 trillion sounds like so much money and the rate at which the debt has been increasing seems to be speeding up. why is this not such a big deal?\n\nkelton: few people understand what the national debt is, and most people tend to conflate government deficits with the national debt. so let's start by clarifying these terms. the national debt is nothing more than a historical record of all the dollars that were spent by government but not taxed back. when the government spends more than it collects in the form of taxes (and other payments), we label it deficit spending. but that's only part of the story. to complete the picture, suppose the government spends $100 into the economy but only taxes $90 back out. the result is a surplus equal to $10 that shows up somewhere in the non-government part of the economy. in other words, the government's red ink becomes our black ink. their deficits are our financial surpluses. so where does the debt come into play? whenever the government runs a deficit, it sells government bonds called u.s. treasuries. this is usually referred to as borrowing, but that's actually misleading. what's really happening is that the government is allowing people to trade in their dollars for a bond that pays some interest. a pretty good deal if you happen to be lucky enough to hold some of that $22 trillion.\n\ncnn: what size annual deficit would worry you and why?\n\nkelton: inflation is the relevant risk, not the size of the annual deficit. in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, budget deficits rose to more than 10 percent of gdp. they were big, by historic standards, but they were nothing to worry about. in fact, most economists seem to agree that bigger (and better targeted) deficits would have helped the economy recover much more quickly. today, the government is running annual budget deficits that are expected to reach $1 trillion. that's a lot of zeros, but so what? remember, their red ink is our black ink. what worries me about the deficits we're running today is not their size but their nature. a big part of the reason the government is running bigger deficits right now is because republicans voted for tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the richest americans and large corporations. income and wealth inequality—already at alarming levels—will only widen. so i worry about the way these deficits are being used to funnel resources to the people who least need the help.\n\ncnn: if republicans can slash tax rates and democrats should pass massive benefits programs like medicare for all and free college without regard to debt, what's the brake? what keeps politicians in check with what they can promise to voters. or should there be a brake?\n\nkelton: the brake is inflation. if policymakers run wild, cutting taxes and pumping money into the economy with reckless abandon, inflation will spike and voters will (presumably) check those politicians at the ballot box. so, in a sense, democracy is the thing that keeps politicians in check. but that doesn't mean we can't pass medicare-for-all or make public colleges and universities tuition-free, even with the tax cuts in place. the debt is not the constraining factor (except, perhaps, politically). the point is this: the economic constraint is inflation.\n\ncnn: part of what you argue is that if inflation gets out of hand, that's a good time for congress to raise taxes. but the political momentum is in the opposite direction, as we saw last year with the tax cuts. what's your thinking on where political reality runs into economic theory?\n\nkelton: i believe the government should use the federal budgeting process to maintain a balanced economy. that means balancing the risks of inflation against the benefits of full employment. it means embarking on new spending programs only if those programs can be implemented without causing excessive inflation. it might be necessary to raise taxes in order to prevent, say, a massive infrastructure program from pushing the economy beyond its limit. but taxes aren't the only way to curb inflation. the most important thing is to understand what's actually driving the inflation. historically, the big drivers of inflation have been: energy, housing, and health care. so even if the political reality means you can't raise taxes, you can still fight inflation with policies that increase the supply of available housing units, promote energy efficiency, and lower health care costs. i also wouldn't discount the possibility that our political realities might evolve rather quickly with an mmt-informed congress.\n\ncnn: is mmt a socialist idea or is it a free market idea? explain.\n\nkelton: neither. mmt is mostly a descriptive project. it provides a lens that can be used to understand how a modern, capitalist economy works. based on that understanding, mmt also offers a prescriptive side, which shows how fiscal/monetary/regulatory policies can be used to constrain inflation while maintaining full employment.\n\ncnn: if the national debt shouldn't scare americans, what should?\n\nkelton: the national debt is nothing to fear. what should scare americans is allowing misunderstandings and fear-mongering about the national debt to prevent us from taking bold action to deal with the urgent threat of climate change.

(photo by aaron p. bernstein/getty images)\n\nstory highlights cruz typically asks audiences to distinguish between campaign conservatives and consistent conservatives but cruz's remarks saturday were essentially a dare to those gathered here to look finely at opponents' histories on seven key battles\n\n(cnn) —\n\nted cruz implored a tea party audience here on saturday to examine closely the record of candidates like donald trump and marco rubio, warning a crowd not to get burned by fake brothers in arms even as he declined to utter his rivals' names.\n\nthe texas senator typically asks audiences to distinguish between campaign conservatives and consistent conservatives, but cruz's remarks saturday were essentially a dare to those gathered here to look finely at opponents' histories on seven key battles. in a retooled stump speech flush with trump overtones and delivered right before trump took the stage himself, cruz offered a checklist of fights that he had led that his opponents – like trump – hadn't.\n\nrelated: cruz, trump feud escalates as candidates lash into each other\n\nhow many people here have been burned by politicians? cruz asked the crowd, hours after cruz bashed trump's record as more liberal than conservative. the stakes in 2016 have never been higher. our country is hanging in the balance. so i've got a very simple question for the folks here: how do we not get burned again?\n\ncruz then listed off seven fights he had led, describing each as a time for choosing, a reference to ronald reagan's iconic 1964 speech: fighting for gun rights, traditional marriage, defunding planned parenthood, fighting against obamacare, a nuclear iran, amnesty for undocumented immigrants and government intervention for wall street and other favored industries.\n\nif someone tells you they're tea party, you can't be tea party and at the same time have supported tarp, cruz said, using an acronym for the troubled asset relief program, a controversial wall street bailout program. you can't be tea party and at the same time have supported barack obama's stimulus. you cant be tea party and at the same time support the ethanol mandate because it's good politics in iowa and support the sugar subsidies because it's good politics in florida.\n\ntrump is one of several candidates who support the iowa ethanol mandate, and rubio has advocated for his home state's subsidies. cruz made sure to knock republican candidates like rubio who cruz sees as insufficiently tough on immigration – which is also one of trump's signature issues.\n\nanybody who was awol from the battle on the gang of eight has no standing as a candidate now to say they will enforce the border, cruz said of the comprehensive immigration bill pushed by rubio in 2013.\n\ntrump, for his part, backed off from his criticisms of cruz that he had broadcast loudly all day on saturday. during a 45-minute speech here, trump left cruz unscathed until the very end, when he mentioned the loans that cruz received as a senate candidate in 2012 but did not properly report to election authorities.\n\nrelated: mark levin to trump over cruz feud: 'cut the crap'\n\nand when trump did finally mention cruz's name, he appeared rattled after the tea party crowd loudly booed him.\n\nyou give a campaign contribution to ted cruz, you get whatever the hell you want, he said, the boos beginning. he's got bank loans from goldman sachs, he's got bank loans from citibank – and then he acts like robin hood?\n\ncruz, who suddenly has started criticizing trump after seven months of refusing to do so, essentially offered south carolina voters a roadmap to vet him.\n\nwhen someone announces as a republican candidate for president, suddenly they agree with the values of everyone in this room, cruz said. if they haven't been willing to stand and lead, you can know to an absolute fact they wouldn't do so as president either.
washington (cnn) president donald trump made 31 false claims last week and 55 the week before, including 22 at a campaign rally in des moines, iowa, in late january and 13 in an official speech at a community college in charlotte, north carolina, in early february.\n\ntrump spread the dishonesty around a variety of subjects. over this period stretching from january 27 to february 9, he made 17 false claims about health care, 15 about the economy, 15 about democrats, and five or more about each of six additional topics: trade, energy, impeachment, china, immigration, and the military.\n\nwe counted five blatant false claims in trump's state of the union address . other claims in that speech were misleading, lacking in key context, or questionable predictions. we don't include such claims in this false-claims-only tally, but you can read fact checks on them here\n\ntrump is now averaging about 59 false claims per week for the 31 weeks we have checked at cnn since july 8 , so both of these two weeks were better than his usual. they were still, of course, highly dishonest by any non-trump standard.\n\ntrump is now up to 1,816 false claims since july 8.\n\nthe most egregious false claim: saving social security\n\ntrump is a dishonesty maximalist: he often seems to prefer an egregious lie, told confidently, to spin that might be more accurate but might also make him seem defensive or evasive.\n\nasked in a fox news interview on january 30 about allegations that he plans to take away people's social security -- he had vaguely mused in a cnbc interview about tackling entitlement programs at some point -- trump could have responded in any number of factual or semi-factual ways.\n\ninstead, he offered up this fiction: i'm the one that saved it. the democrats wanted to do it last time.\n\nthe democrats did not want to take away or even cut social security in 2016. trump did not save it.\n\nthere was no follow-up question.\n\nthe most revealing false claim: pelosi and the speech\n\ntrump is not only a relentless fabricator of his own nonsense but a gleeful purveyor of nonsense he has heard from others.\n\nthe white house made a fair argument about house speaker nancy pelosi's decision to publicly rip up her copy of trump's state of the union address, saying she was disrespecting the heroes, victims and other citizens trump had mentioned in the speech. but trump allies like florida rep. matt gaetz and charlie kirk, the executive director of conservative group turning point usa, went further -- suggesting pelosi may have broken a federal law prohibiting the destruction of government records.\n\nlegal experts said this claim was nonsense, since pelosi's copy of the speech never qualified as an official government record. that did not stop the president from telling reporters: first of all, it's an official document. you're not allowed -- it's illegal what she did. she broke the law.\n\nthe most absurd false claim: bloomberg and the box\n\nwhen trump tweeted on february 2 that democratic presidential candidate michael bloomberg was negotiating to have the right to stand on boxes, or a lift, during the debates, it seemed like a mocking joke that wasn't worth fact checking.\n\nbut then we watched trump's super bowl interview with fox news' sean hannity later that day -- in which the president made clear, in tone, manner and content, that his allegation about bloomberg trying to obtain a height aid was absolutely serious.\n\nso we had to do our solemn duty and look into it. and, as so often, we found no evidence for it whatsoever.\n\nhere is the full list of false claims for these two weeks, starting with the ones we haven't previously fact checked in one of these weekly roundups:\n\ndemocrats and the 2020 election\n\nmichael bloomberg and the debates\n\nmini mike is now negotiating both to get on the democrat primary debate stage, and to have the right to stand on boxes, or a lift, during the debates. this is sometimes done, but really not fair! -- february 2 tweet\n\nyou know, now he wants a box for the debates, to stand on. okay, it's okay, there's nothing wrong -- you can be short. why should he get a box to stand on, okay? he wants a box for the debates. why should he be entitled to that?...really. does that mean everyone else gets a box? -- february 2 super bowl interview with fox news' sean hannity\n\nfacts first: there is no evidence bloomberg has requested a box to stand on to make him seem taller during debates. bloomberg campaign spokesperson julie wood told cnn that trump is lying; she called trump a pathological liar. a democratic national committee official said on condition of anonymity that no, there have been no discussions about bloomberg getting any height aid for a debate.\n\ntrump's polling against democrats\n\ntrump said of bloomberg: michael's doing very poorly. you look at his poll numbers, he's spending a lot of money. and what can i say? he's doing poorly. i think they're all doing poorly because according to every poll, i'm leading every one of them by a lot. -- january 30 interview with fox news' peter doocy\n\nfacts first: it's not true that every poll on potential election matchups shows trump leading every democratic candidate, let alone leading them by a lot.\n\nsome recent polls show trump leading some democrats. but some other polls in late january and early february have shown trump trailing multiple democratic candidates, including bloomberg, both nationally and in key states. you can see a list of recent polls here\n\nthe emoluments lawsuit\n\ntrump hailed a federal appeals court's decision to toss out a lawsuit filed against him by democratic members of congress, then said, this was brought by 230 democrats in congress on emoluments. -- february 7 exchange with reporters before marine one departure\n\nfacts first: the lawsuit was brought by : the lawsuit was brought by 215 democratic members of congress, not 230.\n\nthe numbers matter here. the lawsuit, which alleged that trump violated the constitution by obtaining financial benefits from foreign government officials who stay at his properties, was tossed out by the three-judge panel precisely because the lawsuit had not been brought by a sufficient number of members of the house or the senate.\n\nthe judges wrote: our conclusion is straightforward because the members -- 29 senators and 186 members of the house of representatives -- do not constitute a majority of either body and are, therefore, powerless to approve or deny the president's acceptance of foreign emoluments.\n\ntwo-hundred thirty democrats would be a majority. two-hundred fifteen is not.\n\npelosi ripping up the state of the union\n\nwell, i thought it was a terrible thing when she ripped up the speech. first of all, it's an official document. you're not allowed -- it's illegal what she did. she broke the law. and: that was on display the other night when she ripped up the speech. that was terrible. it was a terrible -- so disrespectful to our country. and actually very illegal, what she did. -- february 7 exchange with reporters before marine one departure\n\nfacts first: it was not illegal under government records laws for pelosi to rip a copy of trump's address, since pelosi's copy of the speech does not qualify as a government record, experts have : it was not illegal under government records laws for pelosi to rip a copy of trump's address, since pelosi's copy of the speech does not qualify as a government record, experts have told various news and fact checking outlets.\n\ntrump did not invent this claim himself. charlie kirk , executive director of conservative group turning point usa, and republican rep. matt gaetz , among others, said pelosi may have broken the law, and donald trump jr. amplified the claim. still, the president was wrong when he repeated it himself.\n\ndemocrats and social security\n\nasked about allegations he wants to take away social security -- trump vaguely told cnbc the week prior that entitlement programs will be on his plate at some point -- he said, i'm the one that saved it. the democrats wanted to do it last time. -- january 30 interview with fox news' peter doocy\n\nfacts first: trump wasn't clear what he meant by do it, but prominent democrats did not want to cut social security, much less take it away, when trump was running in 2016; democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton : trump wasn't clear what he meant by do it, but prominent democrats did not want to cut social security, much less take it away, when trump was running in 2016; democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton proposed to increase social security benefits.\n\nobama and aids\n\nwe will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic in america in less than 10 years, we've already started. it should have been started in the last administration. incredible, it should have been started earlier, but we started -- in less than 10 years, the aids epidemic will be eradicated, will be gone. -- january 30 campaign rally in des moines, iowa\n\nwe will achieve new breakthroughs in science and medicine, finding new cures for childhood cancer and ending the aids epidemic, can you believe this, in america, in 10 years or less. we've already started the process, and it could have been started sooner by the past administration. they chose not to do it. i chose to do it. -- january 28 campaign rally in wildwood, new jersey\n\nfacts first: it's not even close to true that the obama administration did not try to stop hiv/aids in the united states, experts say and budget data proves. the obama administration spent more than $5.5 billion per year on the three primary domestic programs to combat hiv/aids, according to figures provided by the kaiser family foundation, which closely tracks health care spending. (that's in addition to : it's not even close to true that the obama administration did not try to stop hiv/aids in the united states, experts say and budget data proves. the obama administration spent more than $5.5 billion per year on the three primary domestic programs to combat hiv/aids, according to figures provided by the kaiser family foundation, which closely tracks health care spending. (that's in addition to billions in spending on international anti-hiv/aids initiatives.) obama also introduced a comprehensive national strategy on combating hiv/aids. and experts note that the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, helped people with hiv gain health insurance coverage.\n\nit's outrageous to say that president (barack) obama did nothing on hiv, said jesse milan jr., president and ceo of aids united, a non-profit dedicating to ending the epidemic.\n\nin 2019, trump issued a plan called ending the hiv epidemic: a plan for america, which aimed to reduce the number of new hiv infections in the us by 75% within five years and by at least 90% within 10 years. experts said trump's plan builds on obama's 2010 national hiv/aids strategy and a 2015 update to that strategy.\n\nin fact, trump's administration itself had said , prior to trump issuing his own plan, that it was being guided by the obama-era strategy: the domestic policies and programs of the federal government continue to be guided by the national hiv/aids strategy, and we are focused on working toward achieving the strategy goals for 2020.\n\njen kates, senior vice president and director of global health and hiv policy at the kaiser family foundation, said trump deserves credit for his bold 2019 plan and for proposing a funding increase for the 2020 fiscal year (after proposing cuts in previous years) -- though she said trump's attempts to eradicate obamacare, including its protections for people with pre-existing conditions, would hurt the effort. but president obama also did much on hiv, kates said, bringing domestic hiv back into the spotlight, launching the first ever comprehensive national strategy, upon which the ending the hiv epidemic initiative builds, and supporting programs that led to an increase in coverage and access, particularly the aca.\n\nthe crowd outside trump's rally in wildwood, new jersey\n\ntrump said rep. jeff van drew had told him there were 175,000 people outside his rally venue in wildwood, new jersey, and he asked van drew if this was a fact. van drew, standing beside him on stage, responded that it was a fact. trump soon added, we have tens of thousands of people outside. -- january 28 campaign rally in wildwood, new jersey\n\nfacts first: trump was relying on van drew's figures, so this is perhaps less egregious than when trump makes his own inflated claims about crowds, but nonetheless, both men were way off. ben rose, director of marketing and public relations for the greater wildwoods tourism improvement and development authority, told cnn that the authority estimates there were between 3,000 and 3,500 people in the parking lot outside trump's rally venue and between 2,000 and 2,500 people at a park across the street. wildwood mayor pete byron told cnn that, after speaking with the city's fire chief and police chief, he estimated there were 14,000 or 15,000 people in town for the rally, including people inside the venue.\n\nrose said there were 7,725 people inside the venue for the rally. he said trump was correct that this was an all-time record for the wildwoods convention center.\n\ntrump has repeatedly exaggerated the size of the overflow crowd outside his rallies.\n\nhunter biden's career\n\ntrump said hunter biden, the son of democratic presidential candidate and former vice president joe biden, made millions of dollars from foreign countries after he went from having no job, no income -- he had nothing. -- february 2 super bowl interview with fox news' sean hannity\n\nfacts first: trump didn't specify when precisely he was alleging hunter biden was unemployed and without income, but it's not true that hunter biden did not have a job or income either in the years before joe biden ran for vice president or before hunter biden was appointed to the board of directors of ukrainian natural gas company burisma holdings.\n\nbefore joe biden became vice president in 2009, hunter biden, a lawyer who graduated from yale law school, worked as a lobbyist; he became a partner at a law and lobbying firm in 2001. (he stopped lobbying late in the 2008 election .) before that, he had worked for financial services company mbna, rising to senior vice president, and for the us commerce department.\n\nhunter biden was appointed to the board of burisma in 2014 . at the time, he was a lawyer at the firm boies schiller flexner, an adjunct professor at georgetown university's foreign service program, chairman of the board of world food program usa, and chief executive officer and chairman of rosemont seneca advisors, an investment advisory firm. he also served on other boards.\n\nthis is not to say that hunter biden's name was not a major factor in his getting the role at burisma. hunter biden has acknowledged that he would probably not have been asked to be on the board if he were not a biden. but trump's portrayal of him as a desperate unemployed man making no money without foreign income is inaccurate.\n\nwe don't know exactly how much money hunter biden, a private citizen, earned from his work in ukraine and with other countries. he was paid up to $50,000 per month for his burisma role, according to the new york times\n\nthe johnson amendment\n\nour great faith leaders. so many great people i've met. you know, we got rid of the johnson amendment so they can speak their will. right? right? -- february 7 speech at north carolina opportunity now summit\n\ntrump has sometimes seemed to acknowledge, at least implicitly, that he has not permanently eliminated the amendment. in a january campaign speech to evangelicals, he said, we're going to get rid of the johnson amendment, and we did. it's no longer effective. and we're going to put it through and make it permanent, too.\n\na fourth-grader in philadelphia\n\ntrump told a story in his state of the union address about philadelphia fourth-grader janiyah davis, using davis as an example of a child trapped in failing government schools. (he announced she would be receiving a scholarship to the school of her choice.) he repeated a version of the story at the north carolina opportunity now summit, suggesting davis had been trapped in a poorly performing school.\n\nfacts first: janiyah davis had not been stuck in a failing school. she was attending fourth grade at a new, highly-sought-after charter school, the philadelphia inquirer : janiyah davis had not been stuck in a failing school. she was attending fourth grade at a new, highly-sought-after charter school, the philadelphia inquirer reported , after attending a private christian school from first grade through third grade.\n\nthough davis did transfer out of the private school because tuition was too expensive for her family even with a partial scholarship, according to the inquirer, her mother, stephanie davis, said they do not view the charter school (an independently run school paid for by the public) as a failing entity they want to flee: i don't view mast as a school you want to get out of at all. i view it as a great opportunity.\n\nit is likely that trump's staff, not trump himself, was primarily responsible for this error, but nonetheless, what he told the country was not true.\n\nnet farm income\n\nin the eight years before my election, net farm income plummeted by 20%. you know that. i got here. if you look at a chart for 15 years, actually, not eight -- for 15 years. it's like a roller coaster ride down for the farmer. trump drew a line downward with his hand. -- january 30 campaign rally in des moines, iowa\n\nfacts first: trump is half-right, half-wrong. he's correct, even conservative, when he says net farm income was 20% lower in 2016 than it was eight years prior: in inflation-adjusted 2020 dollars, net farm income : trump is half-right, half-wrong. he's correct, even conservative, when he says net farm income was 20% lower in 2016 than it was eight years prior: in inflation-adjusted 2020 dollars, net farm income fell from $94.6 million in 2008 to $67.3 million in 2016, a decline of about 29%. but he's wrong when he suggests 2016 net farm income was lower than net farm income 15 years prior -- it was about 23% higher in 2016 than it was in 2001 -- and when he suggests net farm income fell for 15 straight years.\n\nin fact, net farm income was higher in 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014 than it was in 2008, peaking at an inflation-adjusted $139.1 million in 2013. that was the best performance since 1973\n\nthe congressional research service reported in february 2018: u.s. farm income experienced a golden period during 2011 through 2014 due to strong commodity prices and robust agricultural exports.\n\n401(k)s before trump\n\nfor years you've been losing your ass with 401(k)s, now you're making a fortune, right? right? now you're making a fortune. -- january 28 campaign rally in wildwood, new jersey\n\nfacts first: trump didn't precisely define losing your ass, and can't speak about every individual 401(k) retirement plan, but there is no evidence most people were suffering major losses in their 401(k)s before trump came along.\n\nworkers' 401(k) plans can include a mix of stocks and other assets. us stock markets rose significantly under obama. the dow jones industrial average, for example, increased 148% from the day after obama's inauguration in 2009 to his last full day in office in 2016.\n\nfidelity investments issues a quarterly report on the balances of 401(k)s in fidelity accounts, of which there are now about 30 million. in the first quarter of 2009, when obama took office, the average 401(k) balance was $46,300. by the fourth quarter of 2016, obama's last full quarter, it had increased 100% to $92,500. the average balance has increased an additional 14% under trump, to $105,200 in the third quarter of 2019.\n\nthe relative size of trump's electoral college margin\n\nbut we had a tremendous, landslide electoral college victory, like people haven't seen in a long time. -- january 30 speech on the usmca in warren, michigan\n\nfacts first: aside from trump's dubious characterization of his 306 to 232 electoral college margin (304 to 227 after defections from faithless electors) as a landslide -- the winning candidate has earned a larger share of electoral votes in 45 of 58 presidential elections, the new york times has : aside from trump's dubious characterization of his 306 to 232 electoral college margin (304 to 227 after defections from faithless electors) as a landslide -- the winning candidate has earned a larger share of electoral votes in 45 of 58 presidential elections, the new york times has noted -- it's not true that people haven't seen such a margin of victory in a long time. obama had a bigger margin in both of the two previous elections.\n\nthe obamacare website\n\nthe democrat caucus is an unmitigated disaster. nothing works, just like they ran the country. remember the 5 billion dollar obamacare website, that should have cost 2% of that. -- february 4 tweet\n\nremember the obamacare, right?... remember? it was going to cost $5 million. it cost $15 -- no, $5 billion, right? five billion. it still didn't work. it still didn't work. -- february 7 speech at north carolina opportunity now summit\n\nfacts first: the obamacare website, healthcare.gov, did have : the obamacare website, healthcare.gov, did have major problems when it was unveiled in 2013, and it was expensive, but $5 billion is an exaggeration.\n\nin may 2014, the obama administration said the website cost $834 million. a september 2014 analysis by the information service bloomberg government, which looked at contracts related to the website, put the total at $2.1 billion.\n\n(the fact check website politifact reported in july 2015: we asked the bloomberg government study's author, peter gosselin, whether he thought the number could have more than doubled to $5 billion since the study was released 10 months ago. he was skeptical, saying that even if you add on a five-year follow-up contract with the firm accenture, it should 'only get you about halfway to $5 billion.')\n\nthe steele dossier\n\ntrump complained about a controversial research dossier compiled by former british spy christopher steele, calling it the fake dossier, then added, and now christopher steele admits that it's a fake because he got sued by rich people. i should have sued him too. -- february 6 speech on senate impeachment acquittal\n\nfacts first: steele has not admitted that his dossier is fake. in a court : steele has not admitted that his dossier is fake. in a court filing for a defamation lawsuit against him and in a deposition , steele acknowledged that some of the information in the dossier is raw intelligence he had not verified. but that is not the same as acknowledging that the dossier is fake.\n\nsteele's company, orbis business intelligence, said on twitter that trump's claim was false: contrary to his claims we have never stated any of our reporting is 'fake.' we stand by the integrity of our research on kremlin interference in the 2016 election and support for trump.\n\nthe chinese and american economies\n\nyou know, if you remember, it goes all the way back -- for years, i heard that china will take over as the largest economy in the world in 2019. i kept hearing that. i hated it because i said, 'if i run, 2019 is not so far away.' we are so far ahead. we are so far ahead now. we became a rocket ship... -- february 7 speech at north carolina opportunity now summit\n\nfacts first: the us economy remains much bigger than china's economy in terms of total output, but china has continued to close the gap even though its own growth has slowed. in other words, it's not true the us is only now so far ahead because of growth during trump's time in office. in fact, the us lead has continued to shrink under trump.\n\nchina reported 6.1% gdp growth in 2019, its slowest rate since 1990. the us reported 2.3% growth in 2019 and 2.9% growth in 2018 -- both up from 1.6% in 2016 during president barack obama's last full year in office, but the highest trump-era growth tying the 2.9% in 2015 . while china's official figures are widely seen as unreliable, there is no doubt china has still grown faster than the us during trump's tenure.\n\nnonetheless, china is still nowhere near the total size of the us economy in terms of raw output. china says its 2019 gdp was about $14.4 trillion. the us says its 2019 gdp was about $21.4 trillion.\n\nit's not clear where trump heard china would pass the us as the largest economy in 2019. derek scissors, a resident scholar at the conservative american enterprise institute and an expert on the chinese economy, told cnn in 2019 that there were some predictions at the beginning of that decade that china would pass the us around 2019, but that experts were not saying this when trump took office -- contrary to a trump claim in october 2019.\n\nrepeats\n\nhere are the repeat false claims we have previously fact checked in a weekly roundup:\n\nukraine and impeachment\n\nbolton and democrats\n\nthe democrat controlled house never even asked john bolton to testify. it is up to them, not up to the senate! -- january 27 tweet\n\nfacts first: it's not true that house democrats never even asked bolton to testify: democrats asked bolton on october 30 to testify voluntarily on november 7. he declined to appear -- because trump's white house directed current and former administration officials not to participate in the inquiry. democrats decided against issuing a subpoena because they were concerned about the possibility of a lengthy court battle.\n\nyou can read a full fact check here\n\nimpeachment votes\n\nand it's a ridiculous horrible partisan situation. we won 196 to nothing in the house. this was not supposed to happen. -- january 30 interview with fox news' peter doocy\n\nand with us also, we have some of our people that have been just incredible. they're warriors. i call them warriors. we won 196 to nothing on a little vote a couple of weeks ago. -- january 30 speech on the usmca in warren, michigan\n\nyou know, it helped when we won 197 to nothing. -- february 6 speech on senate impeachment acquittal\n\nit was a fix. except, when it got up to congress, we had 197 to nothing. -- february 7 speech at north carolina opportunity now summit\n\nfacts first: trump did not win any house of representatives vote related to impeachment, let alone win 197 to nothing or 196 to nothing. in fact, he had decisively lost a key process vote and then the two votes to actually impeach him. he appeared to be referring to the fact that no republican voted against him on these three occasions, but he wasn't clear at all that this is what he meant.\n\nthe democratic-controlled house voted 232-196 in october in favor of the democrats' proposed rules for the impeachment inquiry. the house voted 230-197 and 229-198 in december on the two articles of impeachment.\n\nthe timeline of military aid to ukraine\n\nadditionally, i met with president zelensky at the united nations (democrats said i never met) and released the military aid to ukraine without any conditions or investigations - and far ahead of schedule. -- january 27 tweet\n\nfacts first: the aid : the aid did not arrive far ahead of schedule. while trump did lift his freeze on the aid on september 11 , more than two weeks before a september 30 legal deadline, the delay caused by trump's freeze meant that $35 million of the $391 million in aid could not make it out the door in time to meet the deadline, according to impeachment testimony from mark sandy, deputy associate director for national security in the office of management and budget . to deal with this problem, congress had to pass an extension of the deadline. had that provision not been included, then any unobligated funds as of september 30th would have expired, sandy testified.\n\nthe government accountability office, a nonpartisan watchdog agency that works for congress, concluded that the aid freeze broke a law, the impoundment control act. you can read a full story here\n\nvindman and the rough transcript\n\nfortunately, for all of us here today and for our country, we had transcripts. we had transcribers -- professional transcribers. then they said, 'oh, well, maybe the transcription is not correct.' but lieutenant colonel vindman and his twin brother -- right? -- we had some people that -- really amazing. but we did everything. we said, 'what's wrong with it?' 'well, they didn't add this word or that one.' it didn't matter. i said, 'add it. they're probably wrong, but add it.' so now everyone agrees that they were perfectly accurate. -- february 6 speech on senate impeachment acquittal\n\nfacts first: in fact, army lt. col. alexander vindman, the national security council's top ukraine expert, testified in the house impeachment inquiry that two substantive changes he suggested to the rough transcript of trump's call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky were not made. as we have noted : in fact, army lt. col. alexander vindman, the national security council's top ukraine expert, testified in the house impeachment inquiry that two substantive changes he suggested to the rough transcript of trump's call with ukrainian president volodymyr zelensky were not made. as we have noted before , the document trump released explicitly says on its first page that it is not a verbatim transcript.\n\nvindman testified that he had wanted to change the words the company to burisma, the company name he said zelensky had used on his call with trump. and vindman testified that he had wanted to add in trump saying there are recordings related to former vice president joe biden and a ukrainian prosecutor biden had pushed ukrainian leaders to fire. (trump was vague about what he meant; in public comments last fall, trump brought up a video of biden at a 2018 event telling the story of his effort to get the prosecutor ousted.)\n\nvindman testified that the transcript was substantively correct even without the changes he had proposed. when i first saw the transcript without the two substantive items that i had attempted to include, i didn't see that as nefarious. i just saw it as, ok, no big deal. you know, these might be meaningful, but it's not that big a deal, he told the house intelligence committee in november.\n\neuropean countries and aid to ukraine\n\nbut i told mike (pence). i said, 'mike, we're giving them money, and, you know, you're always torn about that because we have our country to build, we have our cities to build and our roads to fix. but we're giving them money. tell me, why isn't germany paying money? why isn't france? why isn't united kingdom paying money? why aren't they paying money? why are we paying them money? is that a correct statement, mike? i say, 'find out what the hell is going on.' and i told that to all of my people, omb. i said -- i asked that question: 'how much is germany paying? why isn't germany paying?' why is the united states always the sucker? -- february 6 speech on senate impeachment acquittal\n\nfacts first: european countries, including france and germany, have provided hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of assistance to ukraine since russia's invasion in 2014.\n\nukrainian president volodymyr zelensky acknowledged european help during his meeting with trump at the united nations in september, though he said the world's efforts had been inadequate so far: and, i'm sorry, but we don't need help; we need support. real support. and we thank -- thank everybody, thank all of the european countries; they each help us. but we also want to have more -- more.\n\nyou can read a full fact check here\n\neconomy\n\nivanka trump and jobs\n\nivanka has been a champion for administrative and legislative actions to combat human trafficking...and she has now created over 15 million jobs for the people of our country...15 million...fifteen million jobs. it was going to be 500,000.

(that's if you ignore the 3.4% in september and april.)\n\nthe estate tax\n\ntrump claimed three times to have eliminated the estate tax, suggesting all three times that this would be beneficial to small farmers and small businesspeople.\n\nfacts first: trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. his 2017 tax law : trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. his 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but did not get rid of the tax entirely. it's also misleading to suggest that the estate tax had been a particular burden on farms and small businesses; very few of them were paying the tax even before trump's changes came into effect.\n\naccording to the tax policy center, a mere 50 farms and closely held businesses were among the 5,190 estates to pay the estate tax in 2017, before trump's tax law. the center wrote on its website: the tax policy center estimates that small farms and businesses will pay $20 million in estate tax in 2017, one-tenth of 1 percentage of the total estate tax revenue.\n\nmedian household income\n\ntrump claimed four times that real median household income has increased by $10,000 or almost $10,000 during his presidency.\n\nfacts first: it's not true that household income gains under trump have already hit $10,000 or close in less than three years. a firm called sentier research says real median household income, pre-tax, was $66,043 in november 2019 -- up from $61,342 in january 2017, a difference of $4,701. trump says he is adding an additional $5,000-plus on account of his loosening of regulations and supposed energy savings, but these explanations do not make sense mathematically. you can read a longer fact check : it's not true that household income gains under trump have already hit $10,000 or close in less than three years. a firm called sentier research says real median household income, pre-tax, was $66,043 in november 2019 -- up from $61,342 in january 2017, a difference of $4,701. trump says he is adding an additional $5,000-plus on account of his loosening of regulations and supposed energy savings, but these explanations do not make sense mathematically. you can read a longer fact check here\n\nenergy production\n\nwe've ended the war in american energy. the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth, by far. -- january 30 campaign rally in des moines, iowa\n\nand we have ended, so importantly for you, the war on american energy. the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. -- january 28 campaign rally in wildwood, new jersey\n\nthanks to our bold regulatory reduction campaign, the united states has become the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world, by far. -- february 4 state of the union address\n\nfacts first: the us has not just now become the world's top energy producer or become the top producer because of trump's actions: it took the top spot : the us has not just now become the world's top energy producer or become the top producer because of trump's actions: it took the top spot in 2012 , according to the us government's energy information administration -- under the very obama administration trump is accusing of perpetrating a war on the industry.\n\nthe us became the top producer of crude oil in particular during trump's tenure. the united states has been the world's top producer of natural gas since 2009, when us natural gas production surpassed that of russia, and it has been the world's top producer of petroleum hydrocarbons since 2013, when its production exceeded saudi arabia's, the energy information administration says\n\ntrade\n\nwho's paying for the tariffs on china\n\nwe've taken in billions and billions of dollars from china. billions and billions of dollars from china. and then they agreed to sign the agreement. -- january 30 speech on the usmca in warren, michigan\n\nfacts first: study after study has shown that americans are bearing the cost of trump's tariffs on imported chinese products. and it is americans who make the actual tariff payments.\n\nthe history of tariffs on china\n\nwe have plenty left over because we never got 10 cents from china. china took from us. we didn't take from china, right? -- january 30 campaign rally in des moines, iowa\n\nfacts first: aside from the question of who is paying the cost of the tariffs, it's not true that the treasury has never received 10 cents from tariffs on china. the us has had tariffs on china for more than two centuries; factcheck.org : aside from the question of who is paying the cost of the tariffs, it's not true that the treasury has never received 10 cents from tariffs on china. the us has had tariffs on china for more than two centuries; factcheck.org reported that the us generated an average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the u.s. international trade commission dataweb.\n\ntrump's claim also ignores china's hundreds of billions of dollars in purchases of us goods -- more than $300 billion during trump's presidency alone.\n\nchina's agricultural spending\n\ntrump claimed twice that the record for chinese agricultural purchases is $16 billion.\n\nfacts first: sixteen billion in chinese agriculture purchases is not the record: china spent $25.9 billion on american agricultural products in 2012, according to figures from the department of agriculture.\n\nin 2017, the year before the trade war began, china spent $19.5 billion. in 2016, it was $21.4 billion. chinese purchases plummeted to $9.1 billion in 2018.\n\nthe trade deficit with china\n\nand, honestly, i think, as tough as this negotiation was, i think our relationship with china now might be the best it's been in a long, long time. and now it's reciprocal. before, we were being ripped off badly. now we have a reciprocal relationship, maybe even better than reciprocal for us. because we have a long way to go before we get back some of the $500 billion a year that we were losing for year after year to china. -- january 29 speech at usmca signing ceremony\n\nfacts first: through 2018, there has never been a $500 billion trade deficit with china. (trump describes trade deficits as losing, though many economists : through 2018, there has never been a $500 billion trade deficit with china. (trump describes trade deficits as losing, though many economists dispute that characterization.) the 2018 deficit was $381 billion when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone.\n\nhillary clinton and trade with south korea\n\nshe said it's going to produce 250,000 jobs and she was right, 250,000. do you know who it was for? for south korea, not for us. it was for south korea. so, we renegotiated the deal. i have your permission. we renegotiated the deal and now we have a good deal with south korea, ok? 'this deal is going to produce two' -- remember? 'this deal is going to produce 250,000 jobs for south korea.' she didn't lie, can't say she lied. -- january 30 campaign rally in des moines, iowa\n\nshe said, '250,000 jobs this will produce. it's

summit\n\nfacts first: there is no record of hillary clinton projecting an increase of 250,000 jobs because of the united states-korea free trade agreement (korus). obama said the deal would support at least 70,000 american jobs.\n\nobama said in 2009 that increasing the us share of trade with asia from 9% to 10% could mean 250,000, 300,000 jobs, but he was not specifically attributing that estimate to the potential effects of a trade deal with south korea. republican rep. kevin brady later used an estimate of about 250,000 new jobs from trade agreements with south korea, colombia and panama combined, not just the one with south korea.\n\nthe size of the usmca\n\nthe usmca is the largest, fairest, most balanced, and modern trade agreement ever achieved. -- january 29 speech at usmca signing ceremony\n\nbiggest trade deal ever made, the usmca, was signed yesterday and the fake news media barely mentioned it. -- january 30 tweet\n\nfacts first: biggest can be defined in different ways, but trade experts say neither the usmca or trump's trade deal with china is the biggest trade deal in us history. since 'biggest trade deal' has no standard meaning, it may be possible to justify his statements by constructing a measure that fits it and by limiting the number of trade agreements that one compares to. but by any sensible interpretation, he's wrong, said alan deardorff, a university of michigan professor of international economics who focuses on trade. deardorff said: both deals, measured in terms of the volume of trade that they cover, are smaller than the trans-pacific partnership that obama negotiated, and much smaller than the uruguay round that created the world trade organization.\n\nthe usmca includes the us, canada and mexico. the trans-pacific partnership, from which trump withdrew the us, included all three of those countries but also nine others . also, the usmca is a modification to the north american free trade agreement (nafta) rather than a deal created from scratch; many of its changes are small.\n\nthe 2016 election\n\nelectoral votes in 2016\n\nbut we got 306 to 223 -- 306 to 223. -- january 30 campaign rally in

michigan\n\ntrump boasted of the size of his crowd at his final campaign rally in 2016, in grand rapids, michigan, and said, and hillary -- crooked hillary, as i call her -- she had a small gathering of about 400 people. i said, 'so...' -- in a location that was an easier location. so i said, 'explain to me, why are we going to lose?' and we didn't. we won. -- january 30 speech on the usmca in

than 4,000 people for her rally at grand valley state university, according to local media reports at the time. grand rapids' wood tv8 reported : in addition to the about 4,600 inside the fieldhouse for clinton's speech, there was an overflow crowd of several hundred more outside. people lined up hours beforehand to attend clinton's 4 p.m. rally.\n\npopularity and accomplishments\n\nveterans choice\n\ntrump claimed four times to have gotten the veterans choice health care program approved. on two of these occasions, at campaign rallies in new jersey and iowa, he claimed that others had

veterans choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators bernie sanders and the late john mccain, was signed into law by obama in 2014. in 2018, trump signed the va mission act, which expanded and changed the program.\n\nmichigan's man of the year\n\nin fact, i was honored, believe it or not. about 10 years ago, i came to michigan. i was honored by a wonderful group. i was the 'man of the year.' and i made a speech and it was a little bit controversial. -- january 30 speech on the usmca in warren, michigan\n\nfacts first: cnn and other news outlets have found no evidence trump was ever

full fact check on this claim here\n\nthe new military agreement with south korea\n\nit's like in south korea. i went to them and said, 'listen, your deal is no good. we have to make a new deal.' south korea, we're protecting them with all these different things. i said, 'number one, you got to pay us more.' they agreed to. they gave us $500 million a year more. they said, 'but nobody has ever asked.' they gave us $500 million. that's nothing compared to what they have to do. that's ok, that's ok, they'll pay more. -- january 30 campaign rally in des moines, iowa\n\nfacts first: trump was exaggerating the increase in south korea's military payments to the us. as the new york times : trump was exaggerating the increase in south korea's military payments to the us. as the new york times reported in february when debunking an earlier version of trump's $500 million claim: under the one-year deal, this year south korea will pay 1.04 trillion won, or $925 million, an increase of $70 million from last year's $855 million.\n\ntrump has tried to get south korea to agree to a much larger increase for 2020. negotiations broke off in november.\n\ndrug overdose deaths\n\ndrug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years. -- january 30 campaign rally in des moines, iowa\n\nfacts first: this was another of trump's : this was another of trump's regular exaggerations of numbers that are already impressive. the decline in overdose deaths in 2018 was the first since 1990 , or 28 years ago, not nearly 31 years ago.\n\nif trump had said nearly 30 years, we'd let it go as reasonable rounding. but nearly 31 years clearly suggests the number is more than 30 years.\n\nthe individual mandate and obamacare\n\nwe got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing, which essentially killed obamacare. -- january 30 campaign rally in des moines, iowa\n\nfacts first: the individual mandate, which required americans to obtain health insurance, was indeed a key part of obamacare -- but trump hasn't killed obamacare, essentially or otherwise. he has not eliminated obamacare's expansion of the medicaid insurance program for low-income people, the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage, or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases.\n\nfederal judges\n\nto uphold the rule of law, we have confirmed 191 federal judges, a record...and two great supreme court justices, by the way. -- january 30 campaign rally in des moines, iowa\n\nworking with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell -- thank you, mitch -- and his colleagues in the senate, we have confirmed a record number of 187 new federal judges to uphold our constitution as written. this includes two brilliant new supreme court justices, neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh. -- february 4 state of the union address\n\nfacts first: trump had not set a record for total judges appointed as of this point in a first presidential term. jimmy carter had appointed 197 judges by late january of his fourth year in office, according to data from : trump had not set a record for total judges appointed as of this point in a first presidential term. jimmy carter had appointed 197 judges by late january of his fourth year in office, according to data from russell wheeler , a visiting fellow at the brookings institution who tracks judicial appointments.\n\nwheeler said trump has appointed 187 judges by traditional counting methods -- two supreme court justices, 50 appeals court judges and 135 district court judges -- but that it's possible to get to a total of 191 judges by adding trump's three appointments to the court of federal claims and his designation of a sitting judge on that court as chief judge.\n\nprescription drug prices\n\nand i was pleased to announce last year that, for the first time in 51 years, the cost of prescription drugs actually went down. -- february 4 state of the union address\n\nthis year -- meaning last year's numbers just came in. first time in 51 years where drug prices, prescription drugs went down. first time in 51 years. -- february 7 speech at north carolina opportunity now summit\n\n...prescription drugs. you know, we had -- secretary azar is here and i want to thank him for this, but we had -- first time in 51 years, where drug prices actually came down last year. first time in 51 years. -- february 6 speech on senate impeachment acquittal\n\nfacts first: trump was both exaggerating how recent the decline in prescription drug prices was and how many years it had been since there had been such a decline.\n\nthe consumer price index for prescription drugs showed a 0.6% decline between december 2017 and december 2018, which was the first calendar-year decline since 1972 -- the first decline in 46 years , not the first time in 51 years.\n\nin addition, it's not true that the decline was this year or in last year's numbers that just came in. consumer price index data for the period between december 2018 and december 2019 shows an increase of about 3% , not another decrease.\n\nthe consumer price index has limitations as a way to measure what is really happening with drug prices; it does not capture rebates paid by drug manufacturers. other sources of data have shown an increase both years.\n\nfor example, the iqvia institute for human data science, which studies drug prices, found that net drug prices in the united states increased at an estimated 1.5% in 2018. the list price of brand name drugs rose 3.2%, on average, over the 12 months ending in september 2019, after adjusting for inflation, according to ssr health, a consulting firm that captures about 90% of these medications sold in the us.\n\nimmigration\n\nmexican soldiers\n\nright now, we have a love affair with mexico because the democrats, the democrats, wouldn't give us what we needed and i got mexico. they're great. they put up 27,000 soldiers on our southern border.-- january 30 campaign rally in des moines, iowa\n\nfacts first: mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the us border in particular. cnn : mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the us border in particular. cnn reported on november 2: nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to mexico's northern border, where they've set up 20 checkpoints, mexican defense minister luis cresencio sandoval said last week at a press briefing on the country's security strategy. at the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints.\n\nacting us customs and border protection commissioner mark morgan has offered similar numbers, telling reporters in september that 10,000 of approximately 25,000 troops were on mexico's southern border.\n\nmexico and the wall\n\nit's a tough situation, but mexico is in fact, you will soon find out -- paying for the wall, ok? you know they'd hit you with that. no, the wall is ultimately and very nicely being paid for by mexico, and it's an advantage for mexico too, when you think about it. -- january 28 campaign rally in wildwood, new jersey\n\nfacts first: there is still no evidence mexico is paying for trump's border wall, which his administration is seeking to fund in part with taxpayer money appropriated by congress and in part with taxpayer money : there is still no evidence mexico is paying for trump's border wall, which his administration is seeking to fund in part with taxpayer money appropriated by congress and in part with taxpayer money taken from the military\n\nmexico is spending a significant amount of money to help the us on migration issues, deploying thousands of troops to both its guatemala border and its us border to thwart would-be asylum seekers. it's possible to argue that this is like mexico paying for a kind of human wall . but trump's wall is an actual, physical project that mexico is not funding.\n\ndemocrats\n\na joe biden crowd\n\ni mean, joe had a crowd that was so small the other day that they set up a roundtable, right? no, it's true. no, they were in a gymnasium. they were in a gymnasium and they set up a roundtable, and people that went there to hear his speech are now being asked, 'what do you think of socialism?' they just said, 'i just want to be here to watch a speech.' they set up a roundtable because the crowd was so small. -- january 30 campaign rally in des moines, iowa\n\nfacts first: we could not find any cases in which biden was supposed to make a campaign speech but drew so few attendees that his campaign roped the people who did come into having a roundtable discussion with him instead. the biden campaign told us this did not happen; the trump campaign did not respond to a request to identify the event trump was talking about.\n\nsen. mazie hirono and the green new deal\n\nthey said, what do you think of the green new deal? i said, well, it should be studied carefully. we should look at it. look at it closely. i don't want to talk about it until about two months before the election. and then, i'll tell you how totally insane it is. how about this crazy senator -- how about this crazy, crazy senator from hawaii? they said 'i'm totally in favor' -- not the smartest. she said, 'i'm totally in favor of the green new deal.' well, you know, that would mean there's no more airplanes. 'oh.' so they started screaming at her in hawaii. they said how the hell are we going to get to hawaii? they said we're going to build a railroad. she said, 'the world's longest track, it's the world's longest.' she doesn't know that they don't want airplanes anymore,. -- january 30 campaign rally in des moines, iowa\n\nfacts first: it is not true that hawaii sen. mazie hirono decided to support the green new deal and then was informed afterward that the proposal would mean there's no more airplanes, nor that she later started talking about building a train to hawaii. trump was mischaracterizing an exchange hirono had with a reporter in february 2019. you can read a full fact check : it is not true that hawaii sen. mazie hirono decided to support the green new deal and then was informed afterward that the proposal would mean there's no more airplanes, nor that she later started talking about building a train to hawaii. trump was mischaracterizing an exchange hirono had with a reporter in february 2019. you can read a full fact check here\n\ndemocrats, immigrants and the rolls-royce\n\ntrump said the media humorlessly accused him of lying when he had told a joke that california gov. gavin newsom wanted to give undocumented immigrants a free rolls-royce: one of the newscasters said, 'donald trump said that the governor of california promised a rolls-royce to illegal immigrants. he didn't promise them. this was a lie and a misrepresentation by president trump. 'they can't take a little humor, they can't take it. these people are sick, they're sick. -- january 30 campaign rally in des moines, iowa\n\nfacts first: that is not exactly what happened. trump did make a joke at a 2018 campaign rally in arizona about democrats wanting to give undocumented immigrants a free rolls-royce -- but then, at a rally the next day in nevada, he made a non-joking claim that democrats want to give them cars. he continued to joke about a rolls-royce in particular, but he was challenged on the assertion of fact.\n\nhe said in nevada: they want to open your borders, let people in, illegally. and then they want to pay for those people for health care, for education. they want to give them cars, they want to give them driver's licenses. i said last night, we did a great -- we did a great, great rally in arizona last night, and i said -- i said last night, what kind of car will they supply them? will it be a rolls-royce?\n\ndemocrats and borders\n\ntrump claimed three times that the democratic party supports open borders.\n\nfacts first: even prominent democrats who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as trump suggests.\n\nthe russia investigation\n\nsen. chuck grassley's exchange with james comey\n\nbut i'll tell you, chuck grassley -- he's looking at comey: 'well, you tell me, what did you say?' now, he wasn't being rough. that was just the way he talked. and that was when comey -- i think that was when comey announced that he was leaking, lying, and everything else, right?

'i want to thank the reverend al sharpton.' al sharpton? i didn't even know he was involved. 'i want to thank...' -- people that i never even heard of. he was thanking people -- he never mentioned my name. so i had somebody call him and say, just -- 'you don't have to do that, but -- if it's so tough. not fair. but, you know, you should do it.' he apologized. he said he made a mistake. -- february 7 speech at north carolina opportunity now summit\n\nfacts first: jones said in october 2019, when trump first uttered a version of this claim, that he has never made any such apology. he said it again this week: never happened, he told us.\n\njones has habitually given trump credit for the first step act criminal justice reform law -- including in a cnn appearance three weeks before trump made the october claim, in which jones said, i think trump has gotten too little credit for what he did on criminal justice reform.\n\njones told us in october : i literally do not know what he's talking about. he added: i have not apologized for not mentioning trump because i've never not mentioned trump. why would i apologize for not doing something that i did?\n\nit's worth noting that, in october, trump said jones' offending comments had occurred three weeks ago. in the new version of the story, trump put jones' comments much earlier -- about a week after he signed the bill in december 2018.\n\nyou can read a full fact check of this claim here\n\nspecial elections in north carolina\n\nexpectations\n\nwe just won two seats in north carolina -- two wonderful seats in north carolina that were not supposed to be won. but i went and i made speeches, and we had rallies, and we did a great job and we won. we took two seats. nobody writes about that. if we lost them, it would have been the biggest story of the year. -- february 6 speech on senate impeachment acquittal\n\nfacts first: it's not true that both seats were not supposed to be won. while the race in north carolina's 9th district was considered competitive by pollsters and pundits, the race in north carolina's 3rd district was widely expected to be won easily by the republican candidate, greg murphy.\n\nmurphy was running in a district formerly held by the late republican rep. walter jones, who ran unopposed by the democrats in the 2018 election. trump had won the district by about 24 points in 2016.\n\ndan bishop's margin of victory\n\nwe did a little bit of a rally for two guys that are very special. one of them is dan bishop...he campaigned and he didn't choke. there was no choke. he had a lot of pressure, but he ended up -- won by like five or six points. wasn't -- it was like boring that evening. you were winning by too much. i thought it was going to be a lot closer than that, right?

(photo by cindy ord/getty images for we stand united)\n\n(cnn) —\n\nprimaries in deep blue new york state don't typically tell us much about where the democratic party, as a national operation, is headed. but this year's gubernatorial contest, pitting incumbent gov. andrew cuomo against cynthia nixon, the progressive activist and actress, is no typical campaign.\n\nthe race got off to a flying start last week, with nixon blitzing cuomo from the left, assailing the state's handling of new york city's ailing subway system and pledging on her website to deliver government for the many, not just the few – a nod to leftist political language gaining traction with american progressives.\n\ncuomo, meanwhile, has been mostly quiet as he works to hammer out an on-time budget in albany, the state capital, and navigates the aftermath of a longtime ally's recent conviction on corruption charges. the latter hasn't done much to hurt his standing, at least in the city, where a quinnipiac survey released on wednesday showed him with a strong approval rating among gotham democrats.\n\nhistory says the early polling, which also gives cuomo a significant lead over nixon, should tighten over the course of the campaign. but more interesting – and consequential – than the horse race is the animating clash over policy, governing style and more existential questions about the party's core purpose.\n\nparallels with that broader debate haven't gone unnoticed, at least in more locally focused media. the cut, a popular blog on new york magazine's website, asked readers last week to meet the 'bernie bros' who love cynthia nixon. one of the 20-somethings quoted in the post praised nixon's early broadsides against cuomo's democratic credentials, saying, this immediately shifts the frame of the conversation and attempts to take control of the party platform.\n\nwhether it works is an open question. what's more settled is that the 2020 primary contest will feature attempts, both by the candidates and their supporters, to take advantage of the current leadership vacuum and define the future of democratic politics on their preferred terms.\n\nfor the warren and sanders wing of the party, this means a dedicated effort to decommodify american life – that is, to take the market and its profit motives out, as much as possible, of things like health care and infrastructure. when it comes to regulating private industry, worker and consumer rights take priority over the promise of economic growth. across this increasingly blurry divide are moderates like former vice president joe biden, who don't view the public interest and business as natural rivals – and would point to a program like obamacare, which until recently mandated americans purchase private insurance, as a notable success.\n\nto voters, these might seem like academic disputes. after all, sanders and warren, along with their progressive allies, fought tooth-and-nail to protect obamacare from gop repeal efforts. but rhetoric and ideology are important, especially for democrats rebuilding – and, in many cases, trying to reimagine – the party after its 2016 wipeout.\n\nnixon, a native new yorker whose activism stretches back nearly two decades, and cuomo, son of three-term former new york gov. mario cuomo, are steeped in liberal politics. but they represent, in 2018, those largely opposing ideas about how democrats should sort their agenda and, as importantly, go forward and pursue it.\n\nin a february speech to the human rights campaign, nixon called for the election of bluer and better democrats. she has since questioned whether cuomo himself is a real democrat and laid the blame for statewide economic imbalance at his feet.\n\nthis is not something that just happens by mistake, nixon said at her campaign kick-off event. it comes from a choice. it comes from a choice to slash taxes for corporations and the super-rich and slash services on everybody else. and it's a choice we're used (to seeing) being made by republicans like donald trump. but for the past eight years, it is a choice that's been made by our governor, andrew cuomo.\n\nnixon's policy argument is actually pretty simple. she believes government would be more efficient, credible and progressive if it grew revenue by embracing higher taxes on the wealthy and big business and ditched credits and subsidies to private businesses – like those in the film industry.\n\ni don't think there's any real truth that that enormous expenditure of money is making a significant enough different in production to justify it, nixon told the buffalo news. she has also made a point of touting her refusal to accept corporate donations and success early on in raising money from small donors, with whom cuomo has struggled. all strike at the nerve sanders exposed in 2016 – the recognition that even liberal policy gains had failed to offset growing economic inequality.\n\nrecently, a pair of 2020 prospects from the region, sens. kirsten gillibrand of new york (who has endorsed cuomo) and cory booker of new jersey, announced that they would forswear corporate cash, decisions widely viewed as yet another sign of their national ambitions.\n\nlike any executive pursuing a third term in office, cuomo's record, at least to left-leaning democrats, is a mixed bag. he's scuffled with unions, pursued spending and tax cuts and positioned himself successfully as an economic moderate, all the while enjoying a buffer created by a convoluted coalition deal in albany that gives republicans control of the state senate.\n\ncuomo's ability to negotiate – or orchestrate, depending on your view of him – that odd arrangement signals different things to different people. some progressives view it as akin to political treachery. there is a campaign, its efforts amplified on thursday by nixon, to unseat the crossover democrats. cuomo allies, however, dismiss the process and point to the results.\n\ni defy anybody to cite a better progressive record as chief executive than he has, ken sunshine, the public relations guru and cuomo friend, told the new republic in july 2017. from the toughest gun law in the country– which was very difficult to do – to gay marriage, to a host of social programs, what are they going to campaign for?\n\ncuomo's also delivered paid family leave, a $15 minimum wage deal and tuition-free college – none going as far some progressive proponents would have liked, especially given the political make-up of the state, but significant achievements all the same. expect that dynamic to persist into 2020. support for the policies signed by cuomo will be among the lowest barriers of entry to the presidential primary field – a sign, if nothing else, of democrats' broad-based progressive shift.\n\nthe exchanges that expose the divisions among the 2020 candidates, and separate out the eventual winner, might sound a lot like what's coming from the cuomo and nixon camps. velocity, or the pace of reforms (see: single-payer health care), and vision, the ability to articulate a coherent plan, will be the undercurrents that drive those debates.\n\nfor now, though, the smart hopefuls will be taking notes on what works – and what doesn't – in new york.
(cnn) george washington is said to have told thomas jefferson that they should create the senate to cool house legislation -- like a saucer cools hot tea.\n\nbut using that notion of cooling what the house passes to outright kill a bill by filibuster is not in the us constitution, and likely not what washington had in mind.\n\nin fact, early in american history senators did not use endless debate very much to obstruct legislation they didn't like.\n\nit wasn't until the mid 1800s that more and more senators began to talk legislation to death that they opposed.\n\naccording to the official senate.gov website , it started happening so much in the mid 19th century the term filibuster was born -- derived from the dutch word freebooter and the spanish word filibustros, who were pirates raiding a caribbean island at the time.\n\nbut there was no mechanism at all to overcome filibusters for the first century and a quarter of the us senate.\n\nit wasn't until 1917 that a frustrated president woodrow wilson convinced the senate to adopt a rule -- known as rule 22 -- that allowed senators to vote to break a filibuster. it was, and still is, known as invoking cloture. (fun fact: the first time the new rule was used was to try to overcome a filibuster of the treaty of versailles in 1919).\n\nat first, the vote threshold to break a filibuster was a supermajority -- 67 votes. but that was always hard to reach and became harder as the years went on, so in 1975 it was changed to 60 votes, which is where it stands today.\n\n'relic of jim crow'\n\nsouthern senators took advantage of the filibuster for years to block civil rights legislation -- including anti-lynching bills.\n\nsen. strom thurmond of south carolina spoke for 24 hours and 18 minutes against the civil rights act of 1957 in the longest uninterrupted filibuster in senate history, according to senate.gov.\n\nit wasn't until 1964 that senators finally overcame a filibuster to pass the landmark civil rights bill when former senate majority leader lyndon johnson was president.\n\nin 2013, then senate majority leader harry reid got so fed up with gop obstruction on then-president barack obama's judicial nominees, he led a major change so that presidential nominations only need a simple majority to be confirmed, which helped get more obama judges on the bench. when republicans took control of the senate, they used the same 51-vote threshold to confirm a record number of conservative judges appointed by then-president donald trump.\n\nwhat does 'talking filibuster' mean?\n\nin recent years senators used the filibuster so much that the expectation is that most legislation will need 60 votes to pass, rather than a simple majority of 51 out of 100 senators.\n\nit is now so baked in that senate majority leaders tend to schedule so-called cloture votes to overcome the 60-vote threshold right away.\n\nthe talking filibuster that president joe biden said this week he could get behind would actually be more of a change in practice than senate rules. it would force senators who oppose any given legislation to stand up and talk about it.\n\nthe idea is to make it more painful to wage a filibuster against a bill -- to have more events like when republican sen. ted cruz of texas talked for hours opposing obamacare, in part by reading green eggs and ham, or when sen. rand paul, a kentucky republican, talked for 13 hours against the use of military drones.\n\nbut experts like former senate parliamentarian alan frumin say the talking filibuster probably wouldn't do much to stop obstruction.\n\nthe reason: let's say republicans are filibustering hr1, the voting rights legislation that passed the house. if enough gop senators are willing to talk they could take turns and go all through the night for days and days.\n\nplus, rather than act as a deterrent, the filibustering senators may see it as politically advantageous to make a show of their opposition to a bill. so, the process would change, but the result -- legislation getting bogged down in the senate with no end in sight -- may not.
washington (cnn) the trump administration doesn't want the supreme court to act quickly on a case that could determine the future of the affordable care act, the justice department said in a court filing friday.\n\nthere is no urgency to consider the case, the justice department said, since the key issue -- how much of the law should remain in effect -- is still being litigated. the administration is siding with texas and several gop-led states in arguing the law should be struck down.\n\nlast month, the 5th us circuit court of appeals ruled obamacare's individual mandate was unconstitutional, but had sent the case down to a texas federal court to decide the fate of other provisions of the sprawling law.\n\nlawyers for the democratic-led house of representatives, as well as california and other democratic-led states, seeking to keep the law intact, immediately appealed to the supreme court, saying the justices need to step in immediately given potential for the profound destabilization of the health care system, as california's brief put it.\n\nthe justice department on friday said there's no rush.\n\nread more
washington (cnn) known for his golden resume and powers of persuasion, john roberts was named chief justice of the united states at the age of 50. in the 15 years since, he's hewed to his conservative roots but moved warily on some cases to shield the reputation of the supreme court.\n\nbut that often happens behind the scenes and at a court where no cameras are allowed. now roberts will be in the national spotlight as never before, presiding over the senate trial of president donald trump before an audience of millions.\n\nroberts, who turns 65 later this month, has played multiple roles in washington but kept the same face: reserved, practiced, steady. since he was a prep school student in northern indiana and through his early years at harvard, he has striven to be top-notch. he oversees a conservative majority on a tightly divided supreme court, yet he constantly touts the impartiality of the federal judiciary. he has sparred publicly with trump on that score.\n\nroberts is also a devotee of bob dylan , an avid reader of history, and the father of two children, etched in a public tableau from his 2005 confirmation, who will turn 20 this year. he and his wife, jane, a lawyer and legal recruiter, spend their summers on an island in maine, a fitting refuge for a man who holds the nation's highest judicial post and covets a low personal profile.\n\nas much as roberts publicly rejects the politics of washington, as the top judicial figure in the nation he cannot escape it. in 2012, he negotiated to save the barack obama-sponsored affordable care act, but more in keeping with his conservative record, he has limited the reach of voting rights act's protections, curbed campaign-finance regulations and closed the doors of federal courthouses to lawsuits over intense partisan gerrymanders.\n\nthe highly visible venue of the impeachment trial will challenge roberts, whose work across the street from the capitol at the marble-columned court proceeds in a camera-free zone , mainly in closed chambers.\n\nroberts is also keenly aware that his bench -- five republican-nominated conservatives and four democratic-nominated liberals -- faces criticism for deciding cases in favor of political conservatives. as he undertakes a role that is distinctly separate from his leadership at the high court, he will try to preserve the integrity of the court and his own reputation.\n\nhe will likely try to avoid appearing a pawn of the senate republican majority or, alternatively, the sudden savior to house democrats pressing their case against trump. it is an uphill climb for the house, not merely because of fights over whether witnesses will be called, but because a conviction would require a two-thirds vote of senators.\n\nnever in american history has the senate met the threshold to remove a president from office.\n\n'i've always wanted to stay ahead of the crowd'\n\nroberts was born in buffalo, new york, and grew up in northern indiana, where his father was an executive at bethlehem steel. a new boarding school had opened a few years before he was finishing eighth grade, and as a 13-year-old he wrote a letter to the la lumiere headmaster seeking admission to the high school.\n\ni've always wanted to stay ahead of the crowd, roberts wrote, adding. i won't be content to get a good job by getting a good education, i want to get the best job by getting the best education.\n\nroberts was such a serious child that an aunt said he was sometimes known, fondly, as sober puss.\n\nhe was accepted to the la lumiere school, graduated first in his class, sped through harvard college in three years and entered harvard law school, where he was managing editor of the law review. after his 1979 graduation, roberts earned two prestigious judicial clerkships, for judge henry friendly, on the new york-based 2nd circuit, and for then-associate justice william rehnquist.\n\nrehnquist, who was elevated to chief justice in 1986, presided over the impeachment trial of president bill clinton in 1999, and will be a model for roberts.\n\nroberts worked in republican president ronald reagan's justice department, first with ken starr, the attorney general's chief of staff, and then in the white house counsel's office, under fred fielding. roberts was a loyal soldier in the reagan conservative social agenda, against affirmative action and other racial remedies and in favor of school prayer and religious displays.\n\nhe later described hearing a call to action from reagan. i felt he was speaking directly to me.\n\nin the george h.w. bush administration, roberts was a deputy solicitor general, chosen again by starr, who was then us solicitor general and who later as an independent counsel investigated president clinton and steered that impeachment.\n\nroberts, in his role as deputy solicitor general and in private practice, argued 39 cases before the supreme court.\n\nno one presented better arguments on a more consistent basis, retired justice sandra day o'connor once wrote of roberts' style as an appellate advocate standing before the nine justices.\n\nduring the 2000 presidential election ordeal, he joined fellow conservatives from the reagan-bush years to help former texas gov. george w. bush, son of the first president bush, claim the disputed florida electoral votes.\n\nthat same year of the supreme court's bush v. gore case, roberts and his wife adopted two infant children, separated in age by about five months. adoption had been a long-held hope of the couple who had married in 1996, both 41 years old at the time, and jane has spoken openly about the adoptions in the years since.\n\nthe children were in the public eye after the new president bush nominated roberts to the dc circuit in 2001 (roberts was confirmed in 2003) and then in 2005 when bush elevated roberts to the supreme court.\n\nduring the latter episode, as bush was announcing roberts' name on national television, 4 ½ year old jack broke away from his mother and began dancing, just out of sight of the cameras airing the live event. we later learned he was imitating spider-man, bush wrote in his 2010 memoir. i saw him out of the corner of my eye, and it took all my concentration to continue my remarks.\n\nroberts himself said in a 2006 speech, it was, in retrospect, endearing. i assure you, only in retrospect.\n\nfederal appeals court judge john g. roberts jr.'s (l) son john (3rd r) dances as us president george w. bush (c) announces roberts as his first supreme court nominee during a prime-time speech 18 july 2005 from the white house in washington as roberts wife jane (2nd r), duaghter josephine (r) look on.\n\nat that july white house announcement, roberts had been nominated for an associate justice post, to succeed the retiring justice sandra day o'connor. bush selected him over other short list candidates who had more judicial experience.\n\ni believed roberts would be a natural leader, bush later wrote. i didn't worry about him drifting away from his principles over time. roberts' famed metaphor of judge-as-umpire, merely calling balls and strikes, also resonated with bush.\n\nwithin weeks of that nomination, a series of events propelled roberts to the top spot.\n\nbefore the senate could hold its confirmation hearings, chief justice rehnquist, battling thyroid cancer, died. that september 3 death occurred in the middle of hurricane katrina tragedy, when the category 5 storm overwhelmed new orleans levees and flooded the city. more than a thousand people died. bush was under intense criticism because of the federal government's bungled response. people were stranded, dead bodies were left in the streets.\n\nhearing of rehnquist's death, bush immediately decided to elevate roberts, who had received initial praise from senators, and wait to fill the o'connor position. at age 50, roberts would be the youngest chief justice in more than two centuries.\n\nduring his senate confirmation hearing, roberts skillfully parried questions and was confirmed 78-22. tapes of his hearings have since been circulated among judicial nominees as a model. with a smooth manner and a dry wit, robert expressed general principles, avoiding any legal stand.\n\nsen. chuck schumer, now the senate's top democrat and then a member of the senate judiciary committee, complained to the nominee about his evasive answers.\n\nit's as if i asked you: 'what kind of movies do you like? tell me two or three good movies. and you say, 'i like movies with good acting. i like movies with good directing. i like movies with good cinematography.' and i ask you, 'no, give me an example of a good movie.' you don't name one.\n\nthe committee chairman cut off schumer. roberts, however, decided to jump in: i'll be very succinct. first 'doctor zhivago' and 'north by northwest.'\n\nnow, how about the more important subject... schumer began, but the chairman said schumer was out of time.\n\nroberts's active role leading the court\n\nin the past two years, since the retirement of centrist conservative justice anthony kennedy, roberts has crept ever so slightly to the center on the sharply divided bench, perhaps to prevent more 5-4 ideological outcomes.\n\nfor years, his surprise move to uphold obamacare stood out. the chief switched his vote to save the law, over the howls of republicans, including trump, who blasted roberts both at the time and during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nlast june, after another behind-the-scenes negotiation, roberts joined with the four liberal justices to block the addition of a citizenship question on the 2020 census.\n\nstill, roberts has remained largely nestled on the right-wing and, in a signature set of cases, has been consistent on fighting the use of affirmative action and racial remedies. it is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race, he wrote in a 2006 voting rights case. the following year, as he rejected school integration plans in louisville and seattle, he wrote, the way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\n\nroberts believes that the government remedies tied to race are counterproductive and outdated. he made that clear as he has narrowly interpreted the landmark 1965 voting rights act.\n\nroberts wrote the majority opinion in the 2013 shelby county v. holder striking down a provision that required certain states and localities, mainly in the south, to obtain federal approval before instituting new election rules.\n\nour country has changed, he said, rejecting the provision tied to a 1960s formula, and while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\n\njustice ruth bader ginsburg took the lead in a dissent, writing an opinion that first gave rise to the notorious rbg meme on social media.\n\nthe sad irony of today's decision lies in its utter failure to grasp why the vra has proven effective, she wrote, adding that throwing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\n\nroberts' dissents on the high court have been rare but often notable, such as on same-sex marriage.\n\nthe chief justice dissented in 2015 when kennedy joined the four liberals to declare a right to same-sex marriage. he compared the court's decision to the infamous dred scott v. sandford that said blacks could not be citizens, as he asserted that the current majority had preempted the political process in the states and undermined the constitutional order.\n\njust who do we think we are? roberts asked, adding that the justices form a court, not a legislature.\n\nwhen kennedy, who wrote the majority opinion in obergefell v. hodges , retired in 2018, roberts moved to the center of the ideological spectrum. that was simply by virtue of kennedy's replacement, brett kavanaugh, who holds a more conservative record. but roberts is unlikely to offer a variable vote in the mode of kennedy. roberts has simply laid down more conservative markers over the years.\n\nyet, roberts is concerned about the court's reputation in polarized washington. in 2018, when the president derided a federal judge who had ruled against his administration as an obama judge, roberts issued a statement that said, we do not have obama judges or trump judges, bush judges or clinton judges. what we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.\n\nroberts is also mindful of his own institutional reputation. before he turned to law at harvard, roberts considered getting a phd in history and he has remained a student of history, especially judicial history.\n\nas he mulled the reputations of past chief justices, he said at one public appearance, you wonder if you're going to be john marshall or you're going to be roger taney, referring to the nation's great chief justice and the author of dred scott. the answer is, of course, you are certainly not going to be john marshall. but you want to avoid the danger of being roger taney.
