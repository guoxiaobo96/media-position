bernie sanders is on a roll. after a strong showing in iowa and new hampshire, and berning through nevada, the socialist senator from vermont is without a doubt the democrat front-runner.\n\nodds-makers are giving bernie a 55 percent chance of becoming the democrat nominee.\n\nwhich raises a legitimate question: do democrats actually want to win the white house in november?\n\npaul batura: ronald reagan warned us about bernie sanders – over 40 years ago\n\ni ask because it is generally agreed that ousting president trump will require winning back those blue-collar workers in swing states who crossed party lines to vote republican in 2016. sanders is most definitely not the most likely candidate to do that.\n\nthere's a reason that left-wing commentator chris mathews compared sanders' win in nevada to france falling to the nazis in 1940. for democrats, it's almost that dire.\n\nbut really, bernie is not alone. no candidate seems to be tailoring his or her message to those traditional democrats who rejected hillary clinton.\n\nremember them?\n\nfolks: this is simple. there are a great many longtime democrats living in toss-up states who didn't like the direction that president obama took the country. those voters, many of them union members, decided to take a flyer on neophyte candidate donald trump. why? because he talked about things that mattered to them – like jobs and manufacturing and trade deals. he also appealed to their patriotism and common sense, like putting america first.\n\nin the end, better job opportunities and higher wages were more important to them than climate change or gender neutrality or a whole bunch of politically correct drivel that democrats want to ram down the country's throat.\n\nthese are people who love their country, and don't buy bernie sanders and joe biden's claim that it is essentially racist. these are people who go to church and abhor the democrats' enthusiasm for legalizing full-term abortion. these are people who work hard, pay their taxes, and believe others should do the same.\n\nthese are not nutty people; they are the backbone of our country. and right now, they are looking at sanders and the other candidates who want to represent the democratic party – the party of their parents and grandparents – and saying: these folks do not care about me.\n\nthey would be right.\n\nfrom the outset of the campaign, sanders and elizabeth warren jumped on medicare-for-all, dragging others along with them, convinced that health care was the issue that would topple republicans. ironically, they might have been right. the gop has made a total hash of overhauling obamacare and proposing a better alternative, in part thanks to the late sen. john mccain, who single-handedly undermined the party's health-care initiative.\n\nsanders has led a marvelously fact-free campaign. when asked how he will fund his programs, he dismisses the question and acts as though trillion-dollar price tags are insignificant details.\n\nbut the approach taken by bernie and other progressives was so extreme – demanding the end of private insurance – that, rather than galvanizing support for democrats, it fractured the party. astonishingly, the candidates who jumped aboard single-payer health care never stopped to think about how their plan would impact union workers, who would be the group most opposed to ending private insurance.\n\nfor decades organized labor fought for the best insurance programs money could buy, and they got them. companies preferred giving out lavish health-care and pension benefits to increasing wages, which would have a more immediate impact on their bottom line.\n\nthese days, the costs of those health-care plans are enormous, and the coverage is excellent – far better than would be available under bernie's nationwide government-run system. union workers are not stupid; they know this would be a loss for them, and they will resist it.\n\nremember that obamacare was to be paid for in part by a 40 percent tax on so-called cadillac plans – the high-end plans that unions enjoy. that tax was delayed twice by congress and finally repealed, so intense was the opposition from big labor.\n\nthat resistance hasn't changed. sanders found that out when the culinary workers in nevada failed to endorse him, even as he was the obvious front-runner in their state.\n\nit isn't just on health care that democrats have gone off the reservation. consider the candidates – bernie among them – vowing to ban fracking, and promising the end of fossil fuels. are they not aware that in critical swing states like pennsylvania and ohio thousands of workers are making lots of money working in the oilfields? that those states have hauled in hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenues courtesy of oil and petrochemical development?\n\nclick here to get the opinion newsletter\n\nthese realities do not impress sanders. he has a fantastical vision of what the united states should look like. he wants to give everyone free health care and free college and, like the ideologue he is, doesn't know or care where the money will come from.\n\nsanders has led a marvelously fact-free campaign. when asked how he will fund his programs, he dismisses the question and acts as though trillion-dollar price tags are insignificant details.\n\nhis approach to solving illegal immigration is to rebuild honduras, guatemala and el salvador so people do not have to flee their own countries. he is a co-sponsor of the green new deal, which is a fable that only an aging socialist could love. he vows to eliminate the profits in the health-care industry, but hasn't explained how companies will invest billions in new drugs if there is no reward for doing so.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nduring the campaign to date, the media has treated sanders as an entertaining oddity, and has rarely challenged him. count on that to change in coming months, as his rivals fight his ascent and president trump goes after him. film clips of sanders defending communist countries, or defending his campaign against sexism, will become more prevalent. he may still succeed in winning the nomination, but the bernie bubble will burst.\n\nvoters will inevitably come to see him for the demagogue that he is, and president trump will beat him in november.\n\nclick here to read more from liz peek
new york city mayor bill de blasio said that moderate democrats never learned the lessons of 2016, calling for the party to embrace a bold liberal agenda in the run-up to the 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nde blasio, during an interview on sunday, suggested that moderate voices in the democratic party are holding their colleagues back.\n\ngrowing number of 2020 democrats supporting 'green new deal'\n\nthere is still a lot of moderate voices in the party that did not learn the lessons of 2016 and are not listening to what people need in this country, de blasio told cnn's jake tapper on state of the union. so i want to push this whole party, and i want to inform this debate in this country about the fact that we could go a lot further, we could be a lot bolder than what we're doing now.\n\nde blasio's comments come as democrats already have been trending further left in policy proposals and as recent polling suggests they're responding to the wishes of the democratic base.\n\naccording to a new gallup study, based on polling data, the percentage of democrats identifying as liberal averaged 51 percent in 2018. that was up from 50 percent in 2017, but underscored a steady increase over the years. among americans overall, conservatives outnumbered liberals by 9 points, although that is down from 19 points in gallup's first poll in 1992.\n\nthe study provided further evidence that the democratic party is swinging to the left, adopting positions in its mainstream that were once on the fringes of party debate—particularly on health care, economics, and immigration.\n\nmost democrats identify as liberals for first time, underscoring leftward tilt of party\n\nlast week, de blasio announced plans to launch the largest, most comprehensive plan in the nation to guarantee health care for all in the city – including illegal immigrants.\n\nbill de blasio announces guaranteed health care for all new yorkers, including illegal immigrants\n\nde blasio's announcement last week came after california's new democratic gov. gavin newsom outlined a similar health care agenda for his state, offering more benefits to illegal immigrants while protecting obamacare.\n\nmeanwhile, the new class of freshman democratic lawmakers includes many offering their own liberal proposals.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y., has embraced 'medicare-for-all' and pitched a 70 percent tax on top earners to fund an expansive green new deal -- which aims to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expand energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable resources.\n\nthe plan also aims to eliminate poverty in the united states, and includes a job guarantee program that offers a living wage job to every person who wants one, according to a draft text of the plan that circulated around congress this month.\n\nthat plan has garnered support from at least eight declared or potential 2020 democratic candidates: rep. eric swalwell, d-calif.; sens. elizabeth warren, d-mass., cory booker, d-n.j., bernie sanders, i-vt., and jeff merkley, d-ore.; obama hud secretary julian castro; rep. tulsi gabbard, d-hawaii; and former texas rep. beto o'rourke.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nmeanwhile, de blasio on sunday said he wouldn't rule out running for president in 2020.\n\ni never rule things out because you never know what life brings, he told cnn. but i'm focused on the work i'm doing now and getting this message out.\n\nfox news' adam shaw contributed to this report.
this is a rush transcript from the kelly file, november 14, 2014. this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nmegyn kelly, host: constitutional lawyer jonathan turley who is a liberal has been warning against the dangers of executive overreach for over a year now even testifying before congress. watch.\n\n(begin video clips)\n\njonathan turley, constitutional attorney, dec. 3, 2013: you have the rise of an uber presidency. there could be no greater danger for individual liberty. and i really think that the framers would be horrified.\n\nturley, feb. 26: i believe we are now in a constitutional tipping point in our system. it's a dangerous point for our system to be in.\n\nturley, july 16: he has said that he's going to resolve the deadlock in congress, the division with congress, by ordering changes on his own terms as a majority of one. that's what makes it dangerous.\n\n(end video clips)\n\nkelly: joining me now, jonathan turley, constitutional attorney and professor at george washington university. good to see you again, professor.\n\nand so, you have spoken out about this through president bush's years and now through president obama's years and talked about the rise of an uber presidency. is the president in your view about to violate the separation of powers if he goes ahead and does this?\n\nturley: well, megyn, we're waiting for the details, but what i'm hearing certainly causes great concern that he will again violate separation of powers. supreme court has already ruled that this president has violated the separation of powers. they just took another case a week ago in the aca obamacare area about whether he had another violation in that area.\n\nand this certainly raises the same profile. the president's expressing frustration that congress is not doing what he thinks congress has to do. but of course he's a different branch. and we have three branches in this system. and no president can take on the powers of all three branches. and that's what he seems to be doing. he certainly seems to be taking on legislative authority. he isn't being particularly coy about this. you know, he says this is what i wanted to get out of legislation. and i'm going to do it on my own. and that does become a government of one.\n\nkelly: right. i mean, he had control, the democrats of the house and senate, he didn't prioritize this. he didn't push for it. and when the democrats lost the house, years after he decided to push for it and he couldn't get it through. it's not like he's never believed that this is within congress' authority. he tried. congress said, no. and who are these congressmen? not just some random people who i don't know how they wound up in washington. they're the people's representatives. they get a vote. their vote was no. and now he's just so irritated, he said, well, too bad. i'm going to do it on my own. how can that be? how can that be allowed?\n\nturley: well, it's a very sad moment. but it's becoming a particularly dangerous moment if the president is going to go forward particularly after this election to defy the will of congress yet again. i can understand the frustration. these are obviously two parties that are not getting along. but as you said we do have a democratic process. we have a congress that is coming in with the full voice of the american people behind them. that's what an election is. now, you may disagree with the outcome, but you have to respect the outcome.\n\nwhat the president's suggesting is tearing at the very fabric of the constitution. we have a separation of powers that gives us balance. and that doesn't protect the branches. it's not there to protect the executive branch or legislative branch. it's to protect liberty. it's to keep any branch from assuming so much control that they become a threat to liberty. and i'm afraid -- go ahead. i'm sorry.\n\nkelly: right. this isn't about how you feel about what should be done about the 11 million illegal immigrants living in this country. you can very much want a path to legalization for them. you could be behind the president's, you know, original plan submitted to congress that was passed by the senate. what this is about is what a president gets to do when an elected branch says, no to his agenda. and the framers decided that a long time ago.\n\nturley: well, i think that's right. and i think what i tell a lot of my friends on the democratic side is that we will rule the day that you help create this uber presidency. it's been developing a long time. but is reaching a very dangerous point. this will not be our last president. and you may not agree with the next one. but what the democrats are creating is something very, very dangerous. they're creating a president who can go it alone. and to go it alone is something that is a very danger that the framers sought to avoid in our constitution.\n\nkelly: yes. i said last night to charles krauthammer, how will they like it if they get a republican president in there who says, you know what, i don't like these laws that prevent protests outside of abortion clinics, so i'm just going to use my discretion not to pursue any prosecutions against those people. and protest against abortion clinics grow so loud and so big that nobody can go into these clinics and get an abortion, well, so be it because that's a matter of my discretion.\n\ni mean, you have to be very careful what you wish for when empowering the executive.\n\ni want to ask you one other thing which is, what should republicans, or democrats for that matter, who object to what he is likely about to do, do in response?\n\nturley: well, it does sound like congress is going to aggressively assert its authority through legislation and other means. what congress and what the american people have to insist on from this president is a limiting principle. what the president is saying lacks a limiting principle. he's basically saying if these reports are correct that he can claim discretion to simply not enforce a federal law. well, that comes very close if doesn't cross the line of legislation. if a president can do that, as you've said, he can do that with environmental laws or anti-discrimination laws. the american people have got to force this issue and say, look, we may agree with you on what you're trying to do. but we don't agree how you're trying to do it.\n\nkelly: right. that's not the point. agreement on the underlying principle.\n\nand so, you know, if he goes ahead and does it, i mean, obviously the next president could undo it. that might cause all sorts of logistical problems. but, what, i mean, right now senator jeff sessions, who is going to take over as the budget committee chief, says, i'm going to try to deny the funding. i'm going to try to sort of take away his ability to issue temporary worker cards to anybody. but there's been some questions about whether that could work. there's a lawsuit already pending against him. there's a question whether that is feckless. some people have talked about impeaching the president. the republicans seem to feel that's too politically dangerous. so as a practical matter, is he just probably going to get away with it?\n\nturley: well, i hope that he does not get away with it if what we're talking about is a circumvention of the separation of powers. because that is the very thumping heart of our constitutional system.\n\nas for what congress can do, they have to use every resource available. you know, the president has made a mockery of the power of the purse. you can't just rely on that. it's like running a nuclear reactor with an on/off switch. it doesn't really do what people think it does. it's very hard to use appropriations to control a president who is engaging an overreach.\n\nbut you have a great array of option. and the congress appears to be exploring that. i think impeachment is the one that i would caution people not to look to in favor of some of these other options. i testified in the clinton impeachment, i represented the last judge impeached, it's not a road you want to go down unless there's any other option.\n\nkelly: i'm almost out of time. i've got to get this in quickly. to those who say many presidents have issued executive orders on immigration, none near this sweeping, what say you?\n\nturley: oh, this would be unprecedented and i think it would be an unprecedented threat to the balance of powers within our system.\n\nkelly: jonathan turley, great to see you, sir.\n\nturley: thank you, megyn.\n\nkelly: all the best, professor.\n\ncontent and programming copyright 2014 fox news network, llc. all rights reserved. copyright 2014 cq-roll call, inc. all materials herein are

school closures due to the coronavirus pandemic are going to set an entire generation back, former michigan u.s. senate candidate john james warned on fox news primetime thursday.\n\ni believe that right now this is not a matter of democrat or republican, james told host katie pavlich. it's a matter of policies that work and policies that don't. it's a matter of what is best for our children and what is not.\n\nthe republican insisted that what is best for our children, according to the cdc and according to science, is in-person education.\n\nright now, we are in a situation where truancy is at an all-time high, the achievement is at an all-time low. and if you can't read, you can't work, james added.\n\ncalifornia board member compares reopening schools to 'white supremacist ideology' and 'slavery'\n\nwhat makes the closures even more harmful, james argued, is the fact that poor, disabled and minority children are most affected by them.\n\nsome of the people making these decisions still have black lives matter yard signs on their lawn, and they're perpetuating the most racially divided educational system since the jim crow era all over the country, he said. this is something that is is a basic civil right that's being violated, not just of black children, of all children, but black children are disproportionately negatively affected.\n\nmake no mistake, our education system was far from perfect before the pandemic in places like detroit, he added. the literacy level was far below, far below the national average. in fact, our state had to settle with former students who believe and i agree, that literacy is a basic civil right. i believe that a quality education means a basic civil right and anyone who stands in the way of that should be held accountable.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\njames argued that safely and sensibly opening is the democrat version of 'repeal and replace [obamacare]'.\n\nwhen you hear that from officials, they have no plan, and they have no plan because they're afraid of being wrong and they're afraid of being wrong because they care more about getting re-elected than they care about our children's futures, he explained. that's wrong. they should be accountable.

'understanding the assumption many could make in hindsight however, i spoke this morning with the chairman of the senate ethics committee and asked him to open a complete review of the matter with full transparency,' burr said in a statement. the sales included stocks in hotels and restaurants, shipping, drug manufacturing and health care, records show. in his statement, burr said he had relied specifically on 'cnbc's daily health and science reporting out of its asia bureaus.'\n\n\n\nsenate newbie kelly loeffler also sold off stocks - daily beast: the senate's newest member sold off seven figures' worth of stock holdings in the days and weeks after a private, all-senators meeting on the novel coronavirus that subsequently hammered u.s. equities. sen. kelly loeffler (r-ga) reported the first sale of stock jointly owned by her and her husband on jan. 24, the very day that her committee, the senate health committee, hosted a private, all-senators briefing from administration officials, including the cdc director and anthony fauci, the head of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases, on the coronavirus. … that first transaction was a sale of stock in the company resideo technologies valued at between $50,001 and $100,000. the company's stock price has fallen by more than half since then… it was the first of 29 stock transactions that loeffler and her husband made through mid-february, all but two of which were sales.\n\n\n\ninhofe and feinstein, too - ny post: two more senators made hefty stock sales before the coronavirus pandemic tanked global markets, records revealed as two other lawmakers who dumped millions in shares faced mounting calls to resign. sens. dianne feinstein and jim inhofe sold as much as $6.4 million worth of stock in the weeks before panic about the coronavirus sparked a worldwide selloff, according to disclosure filings… feinstein, a california democrat, sold $500,001 to $1 million worth of stock in a company called allogene therapeutics on jan. 31, less than a month before panic about the virus caused markets to plunge, senate records show. her husband sold $1,000,001 to $5 million worth of allogene shares on feb. 18, according to financial disclosures. and inhofe, an oklahoma republican, dumped as much as $400,000 worth of stock on jan. 27, records show. he sold shares in five different companies including apple, paypal and brookfield asset management, according to a disclosure report.\n\n\n\nadministration seeks to keep economic bad news under wraps - wsj: the trump administration asked states to abstain from releasing unemployment claims fig­ures prior to the publication of a national compilation of weekly u.s. jobless claims, according to a state labor department official. the official cited an email sent on wednesday from gay gilbert, an administrator at the u.s. labor department. ... the emailed message asked states to keep the numbers embargoed until the national claims figures are released each thursday, the state official said. the number of americans applying for first time unemployment benefits jumped last week in a spike tied to the coronavirus pandemic, increasing by 70,000 to 281,000, the fourth biggest weekly increase on record go­ing back to 1967. state level anecdotes suggest jobless claims could hit more than 2 million in next thursday's report, an unprecedented level, according to a note from goldman sachs.\n\n\n\nthe rulebook: rock solid\n\na firm union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of the states, as a barrier against domestic faction and insurrection. – alexander hamilton, federalist no. 9\n\n\n\ntime out: best political books list\n\nso it's been a week, and you're starting to get a little bit of ranch fever. okay, maybe a lot. you're following the good advice to keep some structure in your day, especially if there are younger ones around. you're attending to your intellectual, physical and spiritual needs, getting plenty of fresh air and going to bed before 11 o'clock. but you still feel the strains of isolation and loss of routine. so read a book! not just any book, but a world-class book that will hold your attention, expand your mind and transport you to someplace else entirely. there are lots of lists of great books out there for generalists. but what about political books? glad you asked... here is the halftime report's latest and greatest list of the best political books to read:\n\n\n\nshelley's heart by charles mccarry (1995) - this remains, by our lights, the best novel about washington and american politics ever written. when you realize how much of what mccarry wrote about politics was prophetic, it gets even better. it would be an engrossing thriller even without its political insights, but with them it's just… *italian chef kissing fingers emoji*\n\n\n\nall the king's men by robert penn warren (1946) - you know the king in this novel, willie stark, better as his real-world inspiration, louisiana's dictatorial governor of the 1930s, huey long. warren's writing is so good and his characters so real that you will practically smell the acrid cigar smoke and whiskey in the back room of slade's pool hall. if you never read it -- or never gave it a chance as required reading in school -- you owe it to yourself.\n\n\n\nbrave new world by aldus huxley (1931) - huxley's vision of a 26th century world free from want and dedicated to the pursuit of personal happiness fueled by prescription drugs must have seemed utterly bizarre to his contemporaries. but with each passing decade, his vision of a rigidly enforced social code and the dangers of a mob mentality have come to seem more and more prescient.\n\n\n\nthe gay place by billy lee brammer (1962) - brammer was a texas newspaperman who joined the staff of then-sen. lyndon johnson as he was reaching the pinnacle of his power in the senate. the book is a collection of three novellas that beautifully, achingly capture the world of hacks and flacks in post-wwii texas with all their human frailty. it was the only work brammer, a tragic figure himself, ever completed.\n\n\n\nbonfire of the vanities by tom wolfe (1987) - we know this isn't a political book, per se. but boy is it a great insight on the way the world of politics functions. wolfe's masterwork, set in the heady days of mid-1980s manhattan, provides amazing insight on the way racial politics, media muckraking, politicians' opportunism and cultural trends shape the way we are governed.\n\n\n\nflag on the play?

'these provisions will be enforced,' the governor said at a briefing in albany. 'these are not helpful hints.' they will take effect sunday night. even as he told new yorkers to stay indoors, mr. cuomo added that if they did go out — whether to do essential shopping or to exercise — they must stay six feet away from each other.\n\n\n\nnewsom orders california's nearly 40 millions residents to stay home - sacramento bee: all californians need to stay at home and avoid nonessential social contact to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus pandemic, gov. gavin newsom ordered thursday. 'it's time for all of us to recognize as individuals and as a community we need to do more to meet this moment,' he said at an evening press conference. newsom said he hopes not to have to enforce the order, instead encouraging californians to influence one another to do the right thing. 'i don't believe the people of california need to be told through law enforcement to home isolate, protect themselves,' he said. more than a quarter of the state's residents were already under some type of shelter in place or stay at home orders, including in sacramento county.\n\n\n\nfederal travel ban expands - usa today: the u.s.-mexico border will be closed to nonessential travel to further help stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, president donald trump announced friday. 'as we did with canada, we're also working with mexico to implement new rules at our ports of entry to suspend non-essential travel,' trump said. 'these new rules and procedures will not impede lawful trade and commerce.' trump said that mexico is also suspending air travel from europe. secretary of state mike pompeo said the u.s. has taken 'two important steps' this week to curb the spread of the virus. he noted the border closure with canada, announced wednesday, would go into effect at midnight. he said the closure would last 30 days and reiterated the news trump shared that the border with mexico would also close.\n\n\n\ngovernors clamor for more federal controls - fox news: despite pleas from governors, members of congress and presidential candidates, president trump so far has resisted using his powers under the defense production act as officials look to ramp up the american medical system's capacity in anticipation of a spike in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. on wednesday, trump invoked the defense production act… but as of friday morning, he has not actually taken action under the law, tweeting wednesday that he only signed the act 'should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. hopefully there will be no need....' that has concerned officials across the political spectrum who see an immediate need for things like personal protective equipment (ppe) for medical professionals who will be treating patients sick with the novel coronavirus. a potential shortage has concerned medical professionals and even led multiple tv medical dramas to donate the masks they use in their wardrobe to hospitals.\n\n\n\nmcconnell sets monday deadline on stimulus deal - bloomberg: senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said he wants the chamber to finish and pass a massive stimulus bill to bolster the economy by monday -- lightning speed for legislation expected to top $1 trillion. mcconnell, senate democratic leader chuck schumer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin arrived at the capitol friday morning for a blitz of bipartisan negotiations, with all sides stressing the need to act fast. 'i've tasked the bipartisan team to reach an agreement by the end of the day today,' mcconnell said at the capitol. getting a deal done friday would give bill drafters saturday to write up the text, with mcconnell planning to start the process for teeing up votes on monday. eric ueland, the white house legislative liaison, also stressed the need for speed. … he noted that mnuchin said he wants congress to complete action on the bill by monday 'to ensure that aid swiftly gets to the american people as well as to provide confidence with the american economy, and american markets.'\n\n\n\nplan has payments of $1,200 per person for middle class and poor - fox news: saying lawmakers 'need to take bold and swift action as soon as possible,' senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on thursday introduced legislation to provide as much as $1,200 per person and $2,400 per couple in the u.s. amid the coronavirus outbreak and skyrocketing jobless claims. the draft legislation, obtained by fox news, would provide minimum payments of $600, and aid would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. the rebate amount is slated to then be reduced by $5 for each $100 a taxpayer's income exceeds the legislation's threshold. the amount is therefore reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers. the irs would determine income based on taxpayers' 2018 tax returns, or 2019 tax returns in cases where there is no 2018 return...\n\n\n\ncontinetti: coronavirus tests america's social capacity - free beacon: a few months after september 11, 2001, david brooks went back and looked at coverage of pearl harbor for an article in the weekly standard ('after pearl harbor,' december 10, 2001). … i revisited brooks's article this week while thinking about the differences between america during the spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919 and america during the wuhan coronavirus pandemic today. … what changed is the american ethos. expressive individualism replaced self-restraint. narcissism and the therapeutic sensibility triumphed over the reticence and sense of tragedy that comes from living in places and times where there is no safety net and death is a constant presence. the culture of debunking, revisionism, and repudiation informs education, entertainment, art, and occasionally sport.\n\n\n\ndem women under microscope as running mates\n\nnyt: [former vice president joe biden] has shown his hand in a big and unusual way for a front-runner, saying he would pick a woman as a running mate. that has opened the path for democratic officials to start picking favorites — from a socially safe distance. in discussions with the times since mr. biden's big primary victories on tuesday, 60 democratic national committee members and congressional and party leaders most frequently proposed three former rivals of mr. biden as his running mate — senator kamala harris of california, senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts and senator amy klobuchar of minnesota. next up was stacey abrams, a former state house leader whose defeat in 2018 georgia governor's race remains disputed by many in the party. other popular suggestions included senator catherine cortez masto of nevada and representative val demings of florida. the democrats interviewed also proposed seven other women, including govs. gretchen whitmer of michigan and michelle lujan grisham of new mexico.\n\n\n\nbloomy transfers $18 million from campaign to dnc - politico: mike bloomberg is sending $18 million from his defunct presidential campaign to the democratic national committee, a dramatic investment in the national party that appears to push the boundaries of campaign finance law. the money will support the dnc's 'battleground build-up 2020' program, the dnc's initiative in 12 swing states across the country. the money could fund potentially hundreds of organizers in those swing states. 'this will help us invest in more organizers across the country to elect the next president and help democrats win up and down the ballot,' dnc chairman tom perez said in a statement. 'the dnc has made early, historic investments in our battleground and general election programs, and the additional organizers we're putting on the ground will significantly bolster those efforts and help make sure donald trump is a one-term president.' the massive transfer signals a change of plans for bloomberg, who is nixing an earlier idea to form his own super pac to take on president donald trump in 2020.\n\n\n\nreally going out on a limb… gillibrand backs biden - wapo: sen. kirsten gillibrand (d-n.y.) threw her support behind former vice president joe biden on thursday, joining a dozen other former competitors to back his bid to become the democratic nominee for president. 'he's the absolute best candidate to defeat president trump, and i think he is the person who has gained the trust and the respect of the american people in a way that no one else has,' gillibrand said in an interview with the washington post.

senators on both sides of the aisle rallied to the defense of the late sen. john mccain, r-ariz., on wednesday, after president trump launched a fresh round of attacks against the senator's legacy this week.\n\ntoday and every day i miss my good friend john mccain, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., tweeted. it was a blessing to serve alongside a rare patriot and genuine american hero in the senate. his memory continues to remind me every day that our nation is sustained by the sacrifices of heroes.\n\nromney 'can't understand' why trump would bash mccain\n\nmccain was highly regarded by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for both his bipartisan approach to negotiation, his six-term service in congress and his military service -- where he served in vietnam and was held prisoner and tortured for more than five years.\n\nbut trump and mccain repeatedly sparred with one another. in 2015, after mccain had said trump's platform had fired up the crazies, trump had mocked mccain's imprisonment in the vietnam war, saying: i like people that weren't captured.\n\nbut since mccain's death last year of brain cancer, trump has not abandoned the feud.\n\ndonald trump's feud with mccain family escalates: 'i was never a fan'\n\ni was never a fan of john mccain, and i never will be, trump told reporters in the oval office on tuesday, citing in particular mccain's vote against the repeal of obamacare in 2017.\n\nhe campaigned on repealing and replacing obamacare for years and then it got to a vote and he said thumbs down, trump said.\n\nover the weekend, he blasted mccain for giving to the fbi an uncorroborated dossier alleging that moscow held compromising information on trump.\n\nhe quoted former independent counsel ken starr as saying this was unfortunately a very dark stain against john mccain.\n\nhe had far worse 'stains' than this, including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years of campaigning to repeal and replace! he tweeted.\n\nthat caused sen. mitt romney, r-utah, to say he can't understand why trump would go after mccain, whom he called heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and god.\n\non tuesday, sen. johnny isakson, r-ga., told conservative outlet the bulwark that america deserves better and that nobody is above common decency and respect for people that risk their life for your life.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\ni just want to lay it on the line, that the country deserves better, the mccain family deserves better, i don't care if he's president of united states, owns all the real estate in new york, or is building the greatest immigration system in the world. nothing is more important than the integrity of the country and those who fought and risked their lives for all of us, he said.\n\nmeanwhile, democrats joined in pushing back against trump's comments, with senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y. announcing wednesday that he intends to introduce a resolution re-naming the russell senate building after mccain -- calling him an american hero.\n\nfox news' liam quinn and the associated press contributed to this report.
call me a skeptic, but i'm quite certain that house speaker nancy pelosi's recent claim to the washington post that i'm not for impeachment of president trump doesn't match her actual position on the issue.\n\nthe california congresswoman is a crafty career politician who specializes in telling the american people one thing and doing the exact opposite. in fact, she's risen to the top of the liberal pyramid because she is an extremely gifted manipulator.\n\nin january, pelosi's own daughter alexandra described her mother as a political leader who could cut your head off and you won't even know you're bleeding.\n\npelosi says she's opposed to impeaching trump: 'he's just not worth it'\n\nin the case of the trump impeachment question, pelosi has it all gamed out in advance and this most recent misleading statement is just part one.\n\ntake a look at the manner in which pelosi disclosed her phony not for impeachment stance to her political allies at the post: i'm not for impeachment. this is news. i'm going to give you some news right now because i haven't said this to any press person before.\n\nfirst, telling journalists that you're about to bless them with news – so please pay attention – tells you all you need to know about how pelosi games the mainstream media.\n\nsecond, with her coaching tip, pelosi was essentially instructing the anti-trump washington post to blow the statement up and make sure everyone talked about it. it's a lovely example of a liberal politician colluding with the liberal media.\n\nbut make no mistake about it. part one of pelosi's plan has been a success because everyone is talking about her claim to not want to impeach the president.\n\nit was important for pelosi to get her anti-impeachment claim out. she wants to be viewed as someone who isn't an overzealous supporter of the left's crazed march to impeachment.\n\npelosi knows she can't be seen as following the lead of the unhinged rep. rashida tlaib, d-mich., in her quest to impeach the president, who tlaib described with an obscene term.\n\nthe democrats on these committees hate president trump more than they love our country and are abusing their powerful positions in congress to try and damage the president's 2020 re-election chances.\n\nrather, the speaker of the house wants to be perceived as someone who is measured and comes around to support the witch hunt against the president after reviewing what she deems are facts.\n\nso while everyone is talking about pelosi's manufactured head fake, her investigative committee chairmen are loading their subpoena cannons and aiming them at anything or anyone close to president trump.\n\nlook no further than the house judiciary committee, which would hold impeachment hearings if they take place. chairman jerrold nadler, d-n.y., has issued 81 horribly overreaching document requests.\n\nmeanwhile, intelligence committee chairman adam schiff, d-calif., has hired a former federal prosecutor to aid his desperate scattershot probe of the president.\n\nand oversight committee member rep. gerry connolly, d-va., makes wild witness comparisons to president nixon's aide alexander butterfield in the watergate scandal without one iota of evidence to back them up.\n\nthe democrats on these committees hate president trump more than they love our country and are abusing their powerful positions in congress to try and damage the president's 2020 re-election chances.\n\npartisan investigations such as these should not be treated as legitimate exercises of congressional oversight. no one should participate in these taxpayer-funded witch hunts because the final report by special counsel robert mueller will put to rest many of the questions that democrats and their associates in the mainstream media have been hyperventilating over for two years – and its answers will not fit with their false narrative.\n\neveryone knows that pelosi – who was first elected to the house in 1987 – is an old-school machine democrat who rules from the top down with an iron fist. she recently warned vulnerable freshmen in her caucus who were voting with republicans that this is not a day at the beach. this is the congress of the united states.\n\nso does anyone think that pelosi would allow her committee chairs to go on these insanely partisan fishing expeditions without approval from the speaker's office?\n\npelosi went on to say in her interview with the post that she doesn't support impeachment because it divides the country. that's a topic pelosi knows a lot about. this is the same person who told the american people in 2017 that if the republican plan to repeal and replace obamacare passed, hundreds of thousands of people will die.\n\nrest assured, coming from pelosi, her comment on impeachment was a calculated political statement all the way. pelosi was simply getting out in front of what she knows will be a horribly divisive road to impeachment – one that she will be leading.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nwhen the time comes, pelosi will be able to say that she didn't want to move forward, but the so-called facts forced her hand. it's this type of political gamesmanship that the american people have come to loathe.\n\nlet's face it; pelosi couldn't even stand up to radical rep. ilhan omar, d-minn., over omar's anti-semitic comments. does anyone really think pelosi will stand up to the angry socialist mob over impeachment? who's she trying to kid?\n\nclick here to read more by david bossie
president trump, speaking at a fox news town hall in joe biden's hometown of scranton, pa., on thursday evening, openly suggested that the new democratic front-runner's repeated gaffes could be a sign of a competency issue -- honing a line of attack that republicans are expected to repeatedly deploy if biden becomes his party's nominee.\n\ntrump also wasted little time in criticizing ex-rival elizabeth warren's decision to drop out of the race only after super tuesday, saying she may have sabotaged bernie sanders' struggling presidential bid by siphoning the progressive vote.\n\nthe setting was more casual and conversational than trump's boisterous rallies, and afforded the commander-in-chief an opportunity to connect directly with voters on camera.\n\nnext image 1 of 15\n\nprev

won five, six, seven states, trump remarked. when you look at it, she did him no favors. that was not a good friendship. we started to see that during the debates, by the way. it became unhinged.\n\ntrump went on to argue that biden was damaged by the impeachment process that implicated his son hunter in apparent overseas corruption while biden was vice president. they aimed at trump and they took biden down, the president said.\n\nhere's a guy, who didn't have a job, unfortunately sadly the military was a very sad experience for him -- he goes out and gets $3 million plus $183,000 a month to be a board member of a company that a lot of people said was corrupt, he continued. just as bad, china -- i just made a great china deal ... his son walks out a china for a billion-and-a-half dollars for a fund.\n\nthe super tuesday results, trump said, had come as a surprise -- especially given what he suggested were biden's possible cognitive impairments.\n\ni'm all set for bernie, communist, trump began. and then we have this crazy thing that happened on tuesday, which he thought was thursday. but he also said 150 million people were killed with guns, and that he was running for the u.s. senate -- there's something going on there.\n\nhunter biden scandals explained: ukraine, cocaine and more\n\nthe president noted that he hadn't spoken to former president obama since the 2018 funeral for president george h.w. bush, in part because of lingering animosity about that administration.\n\ni sat next to him, i said, 'hello,' trump said, describing the funeral. then i said, 'goodbye' that's about it. i didn't like the job he did. i didn't like the job he and biden did. i didn't like the position he put us in. i didn't like what he did to our military. ... right now we have more ammunition than ever before.\n\nconcerning health care, trump said he was most disappointed that he hasn't been able to sell what a great job we've done. the president touted his administration's termination of the obamacare individual mandate, and said plans were now less expensive -- but that the carcass of obamacare remains a problem.\n\nwithout the whole thing with the individual mandate, it's a whole different ball game, trump said. he promised that the gop would come up with an alternative, but didn't offer specifics other than that pre-existing conditions would be covered.\n\nanchor bret baier noted that trump, when campaigning, had promised to erase the national debt within eight years -- but nevertheless had approved $4.6 trillion in new debt already.\n\ni'll always talk about it, because to me it's very important, trump said. the good thing about the debt is we're paying almost no interest. he added that more cuts would be coming but that it was crucially important to fund the military in the meantime.\n\nthey aimed at trump and they took biden down. — president trump, referring to the impeachment process\n\nthe town hall covered an array of other topics, including stock market turbulence and deregulation. out of the gate, trump defended his administration's response to the coronavirus outbreak, saying his decision to limit travel from china had averted a broader domestic crisis.\n\ni think people are viewing us as doing a very good job, trump told a questioner. this started in china. how it started, is a question. ... it's gonna all work out. everyone has to be calm.\n\nthe president pointed to something of a silver lining in the episode: people are now staying in the united states, spending their money in the united states, and i like that. you know, i've been after that for a long time. i've been saying, let's stay in the u.s., spend your money here. it's sort of enforced doing that.\n\ntrump later noted that he has always disliked the concept of shaking hands: if there was ever a time you could convince people not to shake hands, this could be it, he mused, before lamenting that politicians unfortunately are required to shake some hands.\n\nresponding to the threatening statements directed at associate justices brett kavanaugh and neil gorsuch on wednesday by sen. chuck schumer, d-n.y., trump said the comments amounted to a call for physical violence.\n\nif a republican did what schumer did, they'd be in jail right now, trump said to applause.\n\nthe media, trump argued, was a part of the democrat party to a large extent -- and we have to fight back.\n\nhe gave a similar answer when asked by a voter how he would bring us together. the voter noted that a relative had banished trump supporters from the family.\n\nsuccess as a country is the solution, trump said, suggesting that democrats would come to the bargaining table, if not the dinner table, if he won reelection.\n\nat the same time, trump said, when they hit us, we have to hit back.\n\nhours before the town hall, trump took his trademarked parting shots at warren and mike bloomberg, whom trump likened to an incompetent, undersized darth vader-style character from the 1987 parody spaceballs.\n\nbloomberg had compared trump to vader with a video from the movie star wars.\n\nelizabeth 'pocahontas' warren, who was going nowhere except into mini mike's head, just dropped out of the democrat primary...three days too late, trump wrote, referring to warren's previous claims of native american ancestry. she cost crazy bernie, at least, massachusetts, minnesota and texas. probably cost him the nomination! came in third in mass.\n\nthe fox news town hall was trump's first town hall of the campaign season. it was also trump's first discussion with baier and martha maccallum since interviews in june 2018 and april 2017.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nfox

a report that another provision of obamacare -- one that would cap out-of-pocket health care costs -- was being delayed brought a defiant challenge tuesday from a top senate republican, accusing the president of illegal and unconstitutional acts in changing laws without congressional approval.\n\nthe president doesn't get to write legislation, and it's illegal and unconstitutional for him to try and change legislation by himself, sen. rand paul, r-ky., told fox news.\n\nthe new york times first reported on tuesday that the administration is giving some insurers and employers a one-year grace period to adhere to the limit, which otherwise would have capped individual costs at $6,350 a year. the full requirement will go into effect in 2015, rather than 2014. the change means some employers -- namely, those with more than one benefit provider -- could use plans with higher limits or no limit at all on out-of-pocket costs during that period.\n\nthe grace period apparently was granted earlier this year, though was buried in reams of regulatory material and was not publicly reported until now. department of labor guidelines published in february had addressed the delay.\n\nthe confirmation comes weeks after the administration announced it was delaying a key insurance mandate -- the requirement on mid-sized and large businesses to provide coverage to full-time workers. the mandate, and the cap on costs, were both delayed for one year, in a move officials claimed was meant to give businesses more time to prepare.\n\naccording to the times, the decision to delay the cap on costs was made because many employers said they needed to upgrade their computer systems. the issue was they used different systems to administer both medical coverage and drug coverage, and they were not set up to aggregate all the money an individual spends out of pocket.\n\nas a consequence of the delay, some health plans in 2014 will be able to keep separate caps for both medical care and drug plans, or have no cap at all on drug costs.\n\nin response to the report, an obama administration official stressed that the cap on individual spending for major medical coverage will still be in place in 2014, on time. it will then be expanded to cover other benefits the following year.\n\nfor the first time, new historic consumer protections under the affordable care act will protect consumers from the worst insurance company abuses, by banning discrimination based on a pre-existing health conditions, ending lifetime and annual limits on what an insurance company will cover, and capping out-of pocket spending to protect americans and their families, the official said.\n\nthe decision raises concerns that, at least for next year, the health care law will not save people as much money as president obama claimed. on the campaign trail, obama has touted caps on out-of-pocket costs as a selling point.\n\ninsurance companies could still raise premiums to offset some of the lost revenue from caps on out-of-pocket costs. the law, though, does aim to keep premium increases in check, and barring any other delays would still prevent health insurers from denying coverage or charging more based on pre-existing conditions.\n\nthe delay opened the door to more criticism from republicans who say the law is not ready for prime-time -- and ultimately want it repealed anyway.\n\nsen. john barrasso, r-wyo., pointed to the delay in reviving his call to start over on the law.\n\nthe reason this law keeps getting delayed is because it doesn't work like the president promised it would work, he said in a statement.\n\nthe administration maintains it is able to make adjustments to the implementation of any law.\n\nobama defended the law, and its implementation, during a press conference last friday. he blasted republicans for their sustained campaign against the law, saying there's not even a pretense now that they're going to replace it with something better.\n\nit's just become an ideological fixation, obama said, adding: there is no doubt that in implementing the affordable care act, a program of this significance, there are going to be some glitches. ... that's true, by the way, of a car company rolling out a new car. it's true of apple rolling out the new ipad.
here are my 10 takeaways from the new hampshire democratic primary, which sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., narrowly won with almost 26 percent of the vote, followed closely by former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg in second-place with just over 24 percent, with 87 percent of precincts reporting.\n\nsen. amy klobuchar of minnesota came in a strong third with almost 20 percent, while sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts trailed at a distant fourth with just over 9 percent. former vice president joe biden was in fifth place with just over 8 percent. no other candidate managed to reach even 4 percent of the vote.\n\none: polls can be reliable\n\nmost polls – especially the most recent polls – showed sanders leading or winning in new hampshire. the polls were accurate, though buttigieg came close to scoring an upset.\n\nnew hampshire gives klobuchar major boost, puts biden and warren on 2020 life support\n\ntwo: the fat lady hasn't sung yet\n\nentrepreneur andrew yang and sen. michael bennet of colorado dropped out of the race for the democratic presidential nomination, but nine candidates remain in a field that once had over two dozen presidential hopefuls.\n\nwhile some candidates at the back of the pack have virtually no chance of winning their party's nomination, i wouldn't count out warren and biden. i agree with their decision to stay in the race.\n\nas biden said: it ain't over man, we're just getting started.\n\nthe iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary are important because they are the first two nominating contests. but the two states have small populations with few african-american and hispanic voters. the next two nominating contests – in nevada feb. 22 and south carolina feb. 29 – are in states with much more diverse populations, where biden, in particular, has enjoyed strong support.\n\nthen comes super tuesday on march 3, when voters in alabama, american samoa, arkansas, california, colorado, maine, massachusetts, minnesota, north carolina, oklahoma, tennessee, texas, vermont and virginia cast ballots for their choice for the democratic presidential nominee.\n\nthe results in all these states won't necessarily mirror the results in iowa and new hampshire.\n\nbut just because biden is carrying on doesn't mean he should carry on this campaign the same way. something has to change.\n\nbiden has to step up his game in the debates and reevaluate why he once topped the polls in iowa and new hampshire but then fell flat when voting was held.\n\nthe former vice president needs to change it up to get more people to come out and vote for him by getting them more excited about his candidacy. he can't just count on states like south carolina with large minority populations.\n\nsignificantly, new polling shows former new york city mayor mike bloomberg's is picking up support among african-americans – a constituency that has been strongly supportive of biden in earlier polls.\n\nthree: endorsements matter\n\ni have always maintained that endorsements don't really do much for campaigns, but boy, was i wrong this time around in new hampshire. i'm specifically referring to the endorsements sanders received from democratic reps. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york, ilhan omar of minnesota and rashida tlaib of michigan.\n\nthe endorsement of the three progressive freshmen congresswomen gave sanders an important boost that contributed to his new hampshire victory.\n\nfour: the democratic party is divided\n\namong the top five candidates in the new hampshire democratic primary, sanders and warren competed in the progressive lane, together getting just over 35 percent of the vote.\n\nbuttigieg, klobuchar and biden competed for the more moderate vote, and together captured almost 53 percent of the vote.\n\nthe remaining vote was split between candidates in the back of the pack.\n\nbloomberg – spending record amounts of his multibillion-dollar fortune on his campaign – wasn't on the ballot in iowa and new hampshire but is campaigning and advertising heavily in super tuesday states.\n\nfive: old school low-tech voting is best\n\nnew hampshire used paper ballots. the primary went off without a hitch and results came in early – quite a contrast to the failure of new technology used to tabulate votes in the iowa caucuses.\n\napps and computers can be hacked and break down. that can't happen with good old-fashioned paper ballots.\n\nsix: warren made a mistake picking a fight with sanders\n\nwarren was leading in polls in new hampshire just a few weeks ago. then she started a feud with sanders, claiming he had told her in private that a female candidate couldn't defeat president trump in the november election – a claim sanders strongly denied.\n\nthe feud appears to have cost warren votes – exactly the opposite effect she likely expected.\n\nwarren's poor showing in new hampshire is especially embarrassing for her because her home state of massachusetts borders new hampshire and that should have given her a geographical advantage. sanders is also from a neighboring state – vermont.\n\nseven: delegates count\n\nin the new hampshire primary, sanders and buttigieg each picked up nine delegates to the democratic national convention, while klobuchar picked up six. no other democratic picked up a single delegate. so while sanders won slightly more popular votes, the contest was a draw between him and buttigieg in the delegate count.\n\neight: there was no surge in voter turnout\n\npolling showed that new hampshire democratic voters are angry and want the democratic party to nominate a candidate who can defeat president trump in november.\n\nbut in iowa and new hampshire we didn't see the record turnout for the democratic caucuses and primaries that some had forecast.\n\ndemocrats will need a strong turnout of anti-trump voters to have a chance of defeating him in the general election.\n\nnine: candidate debates matter\n\nwith the exception of bloomberg, who hasn't yet qualified for a presidential candidate debate and wasn't on the ballot in iowa and new hampshire, candidates kept off the debate stage have fared poorly and many dropped out before voting in nominating contests began.\n\nclick here to sign up for our opinion newsletter\n\nthe televised debates give the candidates valuable exposure and boost their status as serious contenders.\n\nklobuchar had a breakout performance at the democratic debate last week and that seems to have been a big factor that helped her vault past biden and warren in the new hampshire primary.\n\nten: health care wins again\n\nhealth care is a winning issue for democrats. as president trump and republicans seek to constantly undo obamacare and have no alternative plan, this is an issue that still is strongly resonating with voters.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\npolling shows that health care, followed by climate change, followed by the desire for a president who can unite our country are the three big concerns of many voters.\n\nin new hampshire, polls show 6 in 10 voters concerned about health care support a government-sponsored program like medicare-for-all.\n\nclick here to read more by leslie marshall
in his state of the union address tuesday night, president trump tried to make it sound like everything's coming up roses for the united states – and of course, he said all the credit belongs to him. but as a democrat, i believe the state of the union is not good – our nation is divided, and there is too much hatred and too little forgiveness.\n\nand there is no chance of improving things as long as trump remains president.\n\ntrump made a mistake in attacking something most voters care about. the president attacked the democrats on health care – but that issue helped democrats win elections in 2018, especially moderate democrats in red districts that trump won in 2016.\n\nnancy pelosi rips trump's state of the union address, sparking huge reactions\n\npolling in iowa, where democrats held their caucuses monday, showed that health care is the no. 1 issue among democratic voters – and polls show that health care is also a major concern for independents and republicans.\n\nby threatening (again) to dismantle obamacare – which millions of americans, including trump supporters, rely on it – trump could lose votes he needs to get reelected. this is not a smart move.\n\nboth the president's rhetoric and the democratic reaction shows we are more divided than ever.\n\nsome democratic senators and house members boycotted trump's state of the union address. some – like rep tim ryan, d-ohio, walked out. he tweeted: 'i just walked out of the state of the union. i've had enough. it's like watching professional wrestling. it's all fake.\n\nrep. bill pascrell, d-n.j., tweeted: i just walked out of the state of the union, i can't stand a liar. this man's presidency is a national tragedy.\n\non the other side of the aisle, republicans used social media to champion the president as a destroyer of democrats.\n\nwhile president trump promised to unite the nation, the truth is that he has only made america's divisions worse with his attacks on politicians, individuals and entire groups of people.\n\nthis was quite apparent tuesday night with the president's hateful rhetoric criminalizing immigrants and further inciting hatred and fear against them. yet the truth is that a majority of hispanic immigrants in the united states are law-abiding citizens.\n\ntrump singled out one person killed by one immigrant. but in fact, many more americans are killed by people born in the u.s.\n\ntrump also seeks to divide us by religion.\n\nin america, we celebrate faith. we cherish religion. we lift our voices in prayer. and we raise our sights to the glory of god, the president said. those are beautiful words, but trump's actions speak louder.\n\nmany of us on the left don't believe he embraces religious tolerance, due to his blatant attacks on muslims and his travel ban – which we call his muslim ban.\n\nevery child is a precious and sacred gift from god, trump said from one side of his mouth, while demonizing democrats and undocumented immigrants out of the other.\n\ntrump's immigration policies have resulted in sacred immigrant children being put in cages and separated from their parents. he is now keeping many pregnant women from entering the u.s. from abroad, to prevent their babies from being born as u.s. citizens.\n\ntrump also claims to believe in the first amendment, yet demonizes the media on an almost daily basis as enemies of the people, calls any media report that do not make him look good fake news, and has halted white house daily press briefings.\n\nclick here to sign up for our opinion newsletter\n\nthe level of democratic vs. republican hostility in the house chamber, where the speech was delivered, was palpable.\n\ncoming off his impeachment by house democrats, trump refused to shake the extended hand of house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., before he began his speech. pelosi ripped up the text of the president's speech right after he delivered it.\n\npelosi told fox news she destroyed the speech because it was the courteous thing to do considering the alternatives and said she was trying to find one page with truth on it but couldn't.\n\n\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nin addition, trump's state of the union address felt more like a campaign speech for someone running for reelection than a speech to democrats as well as republicans in congress. it lacked the formality, decorum and graciousness that a state of the union normally has.\n\nthis is the new normal under the trump presidency.\n\nclick here to read more by leslie marshall
in a significant defeat for former president donald trump, the supreme court on monday declined to step in to halt the turnover of his tax records to a new york prosecutor.\n\nthe court's action is the apparent culmination of a lengthy legal battle that had already reached the high court once before.\n\ntrump's tax records are not supposed to become public as part of prosecutor's criminal investigation, but the high court's action is a blow to trump because he has for so long fought on so many fronts to keep his tax records shielded from view. the ongoing investigation the records are part of could also become an issue for trump in his life after the presidency. trump has called it a fishing expedition and a continuation of the witch hunt — the greatest witch hunt in history.\n\nnj judge says lawyer who killed her son also tracked supreme court justice sotomayor\n\nthe supreme court waited months to act in the case. the last of the written briefs in the case was filed oct. 19. but a court that includes three trump appointees waited through the election, trump's challenge to his defeat and a month after trump left office before issuing its order.\n\nthe court offered no explanation for the delay, and the legal issue before the justices did not involve whether trump was due any special deference because he was president.\n\nthe court's order is a win for manhattan district attorney cyrus vance jr., who has been seeking trump's tax records since 2019 as part of an investigation. vance, a democrat, had subpoenaed the records from the mazars accounting firm that has long done work for trump and his businesses. mazars has said it would comply with the subpoena, but trump, a republican, sued to block the records' release.\n\nbiden to get another judicial appointment to a key federal appeals court\n\nvance's office had said it would be free to enforce the subpoena and obtain the records in the event the supreme court declined to step in and halt the records' turnover, but it was unclear when that might happen.\n\nthe case the high court ruled in involves a grand jury subpoena for more than eight years of trump's personal and corporate tax records. vance has disclosed little about what prompted him to request the records. in one court filing last year, however, prosecutors said they were justified in demanding the records because of public reports of possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the trump organization.\n\npart of the probe involves payments to two women — porn actress stormy daniels and model karen mcdougal — to keep them quiet during the 2016 presidential campaign about alleged extramarital affairs with trump. trump has denied the affairs.\n\nin july, the justices in a 7-2 ruling rejected trump's argument that the president is immune from investigation while he holds office or that a prosecutor must show a greater need than normal to obtain the tax records.\n\nbiden admin tells supreme court obamacare is constitutional, a reversal of trump's doj stance in pending case\n\njustices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh, whom trump nominated to the high court, joined that decision. it was issued before trump's third nominee, justice amy coney barrett, replaced the late justice ruth bader ginsburg on the court.\n\nas part of its july decision, the high court returned the vance case and a similar case involving records sought by congress to lower courts. and the court prevented the records from being turned over while the cases proceeded.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nsince the high court's ruling, in the vance case, trump's attorneys made additional arguments that his tax records should not be turned over, but they lost again in federal court in new york and on appeal. it was those rulings that trump had sought to put on hold.
rep. daniel lipinski, d-ill., a rare anti-abortion house democrat, has lost his party's primary race to challenger marie newman, a small business owner endorsed by far-left rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y.\n\nnewman challenged lipinski in 2018 and was edged out in a close primary race, but this time she managed to narrowly defeat the incumbent congressman, who has represented illinois' third district since 2005.\n\njussie smollett prosecutor wins primary\n\nthis is a democratic district. let's have a real democrat fighting for us, newman tweeted monday, including infographics showing how lipinski's past votes against obamacare and for restricting access to women's reproductive healthcare are at odds with her own support for universal healthcare and greater access to abortions.\n\nthe win all but assures that newman, 55, will take over the seat that lipinski's father held for nearly three decades before he retired after the 2004 primary and local democrats chose his son to replace him on the general election ballot.\n\nnewman, a former management consultant who started and led an anti-bullying nonprofit, argued lipinski no longer reflected the views of the district, which backed sen. bernie sanders, a democratic socialist, over hillary clinton in the 2016 presidential primary.\n\nrep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y., endorsed newman back in september. she told the new york times that newman is a textbook example of one of the ways that we could be better as a party — to come from a deep blue seat and to be championing all the issues we need to be championing.\n\nlipinski, 53, opposes abortion rights and voted against the affordable care act, president barack obama's 2010 health care overhaul.\n\nget the fox news app\n\nwhat a journey, newman said in a statement her campaign released tuesday night. i am bursting with pride and gratitude for the amazing coalition who helped bring about much needed change in our district. we are going to work together to lower healthcare costs, to fight climate change, and to continue building a hospitable community for everyone, no matter where you come from.\n\nthe associated press contributed to this report
this is a rush transcript from life, liberty & levin, january 20, 2019. this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.\n\nmark levin, host: hello, america. i'm mark levin. this is life, liberty & levin. great guest again, curt schilling, how are you, my friend?\n\ncurt schilling, former baseball pitcher: i'm good. how are you?\n\nlevin: it's a pleasure.\n\nschilling: thank you.\n\nlevin: we've met in the past.\n\nschilling: yes.\n\nlevin: but now we get to talk to each other and i'll tell you why i wanted you here because you fascinate me. a great athlete. you know, i'm from philadelphia. you played for the phillies for some time. you played for the diamondbacks. you played for boston, and a tremendous record. and also you're an outspoken conservative.\n\nnow first things first, 1993, you pitched in the world series with the phillies, they lost; 2001 arizona diamondbacks, 2004, 2007 boston red sox championships. you are an 11 and 2 post season record. i just want the nation to understand how phenomenal that is. that is the greatest postseason record of any pitcher who's pitched 10 or more games in the postseason and 8.846 winning percentage.\n\nand i'm doing this for a reason. so you have the major league record when it comes to that. you also struck out over 3,000 batters. one behind gibson. you're tied for third or one behind.\n\nschilling: one behind.\n\nlevin: one behind on third and you routinely and it's not that long ago you routinely pitch past six and seven innings which really isn't done anymore. this is a tremendous record.\n\nschilling: thank you.\n\nlevin: and you're not in the hall of fame. you're not in the hall of fame. is that because of your views? you think it's political?\n\nschilling: part of it is. i mean, it's not a guess. the people that have not voted for me specifically because of the things i've said or did, they've said it. they've about come out and said i can't vote for him because of what he said or what he did and --\n\nlevin: isn't that pretty outrageous? i mean, aren't they supposed to be voting based on your career as a baseball player? as an athlete? not whether they agree with your conservative views or not?\n\nschilling: well, the two words come up -- the character clause. and there's a couple of issues with that. first of all, i'm putting -- i'm now -- i've seen recently, i've been put in the in the clemens and bonds category. you know, character issues this and that, which kills me because roger clemens was such a big influence on my career, but i don't doubt for a second that i -- he cheated.\n\nthey are equating me and something they think i've done or said with guys who willingly did -- lance armstrong, in a sense destroyed other people's lives to preserve their legacy. we're on the same moral turf somehow.\n\nso my dad told me, don't ever live your life trying to please people you don't know and that's -- but you know, i've lived. you know, you can go back and look at 22 years of my career and you know, every -- i've never had an incident with a teammate. i meant, not a serious incident. every day, you have so fans, clubhouse guys --\n\nlevin: isn't this what they do to conservatives generally? look what they've done to the president of the united states.\n\nschilling: yes.\n\nlevin: before he became a republican, before he decided to run, before he was the nominee, before he was president of the united states, the liberals loved them. the media loved him. hollywood loved him and they couldn't say enough good things about him. they took his money. they took his donations. they made money off of his program. all of that was well and good\n\nthen he decides to run for president the united states. the next thing you know, he's a reprobate. he's hitler. he's stalin. he's a thousand things that they say. isn't that what we all come up against? he came up against it. you came up against it. guys like me, we come up against it every single day. isn't it the effort to just destroy your reputation and your character if they can, rather than engage?\n\nschilling: i would argue, it's probably the same reason you have a hard time getting a liberal sit in this chair because the second you -- i'll converse and debate anybody. i am open -- one of the things i was when i played, i was coachable. i would listen to anybody about anything because it would help make me better.\n\nmy thirst for knowledge after i get done playing is the same. i'll debate, i'll talk to anybody about anything because military history is my passion outside of sports. and i read probably -- my mom taught me how to speed read when i was young, so i've got a stack of books about 15 high next to my bed. i read about a book at night.\n\ni find something i don't know and then i'll read it -- because a book is just someone else's interpretation of something that i can look up myself, but i want different perspectives and viewpoints because especially where we are now. you know, you look at where this country is now and --\n\nlevin: where is this country now?\n\nschilling: as conservatives, we're up against a group of people who don't have any forethought, who don't think ahead. you can't, in any realistic scenario in the real world play out this socialist dream and come to a conclusion that benefits the people. it's never worked anywhere ever.\n\nthere's no example where you can say -- they love the point --\n\nlevin: scandinavia.\n\nschilling: scandinavia and all the other things and they don't realize first of all, it doesn't scale. there's six or ten million people in those countries combined. we're over 300 million people and how many tens of millions of those people aren't even in the system, taking billions of dollars. it doesn't work.\n\nand so you know, you look at a generation. my kids are between 16 and 22, so they're in college and they're pretty conservative and they're listening to liberal professors say things and they'll text me and the only -- my son has one professor who said, i don't want you to take what i say at face value. i want you to challenge me. which is the first time you ever heard anybody left-of-center say that.\n\nlevin: so you think the country is moving in the wrong direction because of this socialist pressure that's in place in our schools, in our society, in the media even though there's a push back. the president the united states and other conservatives and so forth?\n\nschilling: here's the thing. i gamed this out, right? i mean, you know where we are right now. you're kind of in the eye of the storm in a sense given your influence on people on the right and the hatred that comes from the left for you, which means you're on target doing something right.\n\nbut you game this out. trump is going win in 2020. there is just no feasible way unless the russians and democrats get together again and try and rig another election, but he wins in 2020. they're not going to suddenly scale back. they'll be apoplectic, more so than they are now.\n\nlevin: you don't think this ends well?\n\nschilling: no, it doesn't. it can't end well because the left has proven that they won't let it end until they get their way.\n\nlevin: and that's an example on the wall.\n\nschilling: the wall is a great example. you were mentioning how much the left love trump. back when they were loving trump, they were also approving $25 billion and $40 billion to fund a wall because you can go back and look at the sound bytes of obama and clinton and everybody saying, we need this. we need border security.\n\nand all of a sudden, they hate it and they only hate it because president trump wants it. period.\n\nbut i'm -- i feel good about the thing. he's not going to give in. he is not going to end this shutdown until he gets his money.\n\nlevin: now, you're describing a political party that puts power before a country because why in the world would they change their position, everybody knows a nation needs to secure its border. everybody knows it's a bad thing for drugs and drug runners to come into the country. everybody knows that we need to know who's coming into this country.\n\nschilling: those are all common sense.\n\nlevin: all common sense, but they reject it. they don't reject it because it's irrational or bad policy or bad for the country. they reject it because it's bad for their own political fortunes and yet they have a propaganda machine at cnn and msnbc and in the new york times day-in day- out, you were talking about your kids. they have academia in their back pocket with tenured professors who are mostly hardcore left-wing and much like you in sports.\n\nleftist in sports can do pretty much whatever they want to do. they can take knees. they can do this. they can do that. conservatives in sports had to be very careful because even the sports media is quite left-wing.\n\nschilling: look, there's no better example in the last nine years. two athletes have been pretty much persona non grata. tim thomas carried the bruins to the stanley cup in 2011, did not go to the white house.\n\nlevin: for obama.\n\nschilling: he's like voldemort, he-who-must-not-be-named in -- i mean, he carried the bruins to a stanley cup and he was the greatest thing ever until then me, i said vote bush in 2004. it blew up. the patriots refused to go to the white house. they are icons. they are people to follow it's just and so --\n\nlike i said, you can't, like the hall of fame vote stuff. i can't live my life for those people to -- because they are never going to like you. there's a certain part of the world that just doesn't like you for whatever reason. the reasons they don't like me have to do with, i think character and integrity and morals and ethics and honor and all the things that my dad taught me to believe and we were talking earlier, i said -- one of the most powerful lessons in my life was roger clemens pulling me aside and talking about --\n\nmy dad passed away about eight months before i made my major league debut.\n\nlevin: he never saw any of this?\n\nschilling: no.\n\nlevin: no.\n\nschilling: no from ground level, anyway, but roger told me when you walk out in the field, the name on the back of your jersey, that's not your name, that's your father's name and i never forgot that.\n\ni left a ticket for my dad every game i ever played.\n\nlevin: really?\n\nschilling: i left a ticket -- there's an empty -- because i wanted an empty seat in the stadium during the world series, so he knew, next time i get a chance to talk to him, he's going to know i never forgot about him.\n\nlevin: you have flirted with running for office. massachusetts would be a tough place to run.\n\nschilling: i would -- yes, but that's -- i mean, that's why i chose boston over new york to play.\n\nlevin: really?\n\nschilling: oh, sure.\n\nlevin: why?\n\nschilling: because if i went to new york and helped them win the 28th and 29th world series, ho-hum. if i go to boston and break -- and help break the curse or whatever they call it, there's something no one's ever seen in there.\n\ni want the challenge. i wanted out -- you know, and it turned out to be partially a great thing, but i got i got what i asked for.\n\nlevin: do you think you'll run?\n\nschilling: no, not now. after i watched -- you know, when you look at what the left has done to people that they don't like especially politicians, when i watch the kavanagh hearing and realized that conservative wives, spouses and children are now in play for the media, my family doesn't deserve that. and they're not -- they spent 20 years following me around baseball. i'm not going to subject them to that.\n\nlevin: i want to talk more about that, the kavanagh hearings, your philosophy, your view of sports because sports to me seems to be following the democratic party, pretty much.\n\nschilling: yes.\n\nlevin: folks don't forget to join us almost every weeknight on levin tv. go to blazetv.com/mark where you can sign up blazetv.com/mark or give us a call at 844-levin-tv, 844-levin-tv. a lot of conservatives are there. we would like you to join us. we'll be right back\n\n(commercial break)\n\nlevin: curt schilling, was there an event, a book, a person your upbringing that caused you to be a conservative and a republican?\n\nschilling: no, my father was -- i grew up an army brat and i grew very lower middle class and i was fortunate enough to have a father who taught me the pride in ownership and what it feels like to work for something and i played sports. i was always about the winners and losers.\n\nlevin: competition.\n\nschilling: right. i mean, which is capitalism. i mean capitalism is -- i mean and i've been a victim of it, too with the studio that i opened, it ended up failing after i put over $50 million of my own money into it, but that's what happens.\n\nthe capitalism weeds out the weak and it's why we are where we are, but i think i entrenched my stance as a conservative when i when i was old enough to read and understand the constitution. i think i was like 11 and --\n\nlevin you're far ahead of nancy pelosi.\n\nschilling: right. she still doesn't, but that's fine. but i read it and it's a pretty cool document and then when you think about -- we were talking about foresight. the amount of foresight these men had to put this document together knowing full well that we are a horribly flawed species and that somebody somewhere was going to try and do many, many bad things to get it -- it's just mind-boggling to me that they were all that smart and we've gone through some changes as a country.\n\nwe've had to live through some of the worst things, but we fought a civil war to end slavery. nobody else did that. almost a million we're killed in a conflict to eliminate slavery. we have scars of the past, but those scars of the past, that's why we are where we are and there's -- i've been -- i've got to tell you, i've been wanting to get in front of you and ask you this question for the longest time.\n\nlevin: you ask me. go ahead.\n\nschilling: so when you talk about, you know, racist is the word everybody's throwing around. everybody's a racist. if you don't agree with us, you're a racist this and that, but i look at the civil war, all right and you know the three amendments that were passed post-civil war -- 13, 14, and 15 -- what they meant and what they did.\n\ni want to know why we had to have a civil rights movement in 1960 to give minorities the rights that they were given in 1870?\n\nlevin: i'll tell you why. and it's interesting you bring this up. those amendments had to be adopted by what? the states. and it's often said, while quote-unquote states rights, i call it federalism is a problem because you look at it pre-civil war, well, it's the states that fought the states.\n\nand i know it's the union, but then in the end it was states fighting states and it were states that passed the post-civil war amendments, abolishing slavery, conferring equal rights formally and due process on former slaves.\n\nand when you look at the declaration of independence, there's no reference there to religion, race, sex or anything --\n\nschilling: again, intentional.\n\nlevin: intentional. they were embracing not just the enlightenment, but aristotelian logic. the logic that came from cicero, who was murdered and all these people -- john locke -- who's on the wall there, montesquieu -- these were the great thinkers, the great minds of humanity and only in america when they set up the government did they embrace these things not marx who would come later.\n\nschilling: yes.\n\nlevin: not hegel, who would come a little later, but was somewhat of a contemporary and rousseau, who was followed by the french and then they had 10 years of terrorism and the french revolution. the reason why there had to be a civil rights movement is because there was resistance, that word, particularly in the south among the old democrats and the democratic party.\n\nyou have to remember that as recently as 1924, at the democratic convention at madison square garden in new york, the klan controlled the convention.\n\nschilling: yes, i know.\n\nlevin: people don't know that franklin roosevelt's first appointment to the supreme court --\n\nschilling: was a member of klan.\n\nlevin: was a member of the klan in alabama who'd been a lawyer for the klan and his excuse was, i didn't know right.\n\nschilling: right, and i asked you that question because i wanted that answer but i also -- there's been -- our kids are miss-taught or are not taught the true history of this country and it's just -- i think it's damning to the education system, but the kkk was borne out of the end of the civil war because it was a way for the democrats to -- even those amendments were in play, we can make them fear us enough to keep them away from the polls and all the other stuff.\n\nlevin: while they hanged people. they raped people.\n\nschilling: they were. yes.\n\nlevin: they were terrorists even then.\n\nschilling: they were the terrorism arm of the democratic party. period. and you know, you have these people talking about the big switch in the sixties. there was one person that's switched and then you talk about what -- everybody that followed goldwater. goldwater --\n\nlevin: you're talking about strom thurmond.\n\nschilling: right, and everybody that voted against the civil rights with goldwater, well goldwater wasn't voting against civil rights, he was voting against giving the federal government more power.\n\nlevin: well, here's what i want to add to this. the first civil rights amendments were the post-civil war amendments. the first civil rights law was proposed by eisenhower in 1956. the '64 civil rights act, the '65 civil rights voting rights acts, the vast majority of republicans voted for both. i happen to disagree with goldwater on this.\n\ni understood his philosophy. he had no animus whatsoever. his was a constitutional argument. that's fine. the problem i have is that the democratic party and their mouthpieces in the media keep accusing republicans of what they were.\n\nwell, i think they have lurched in a completely different direction, a radical left direction.\n\nschilling: there's no doubt about that.\n\nlevin: and that's a very bleak place to take the country. very dangerous. we'll be right back.\n\n(commercial break)\n\nmarianne rafferty, correspondent, fox news: live from america's news headquarters, i'm marianne rafferty. a location is being narrowed down for president trump's second summit with north korean leader, kim jong-un. bloomberg news reporting the meetings is expected to be held in the vietnamese capital of hanoi. two other cities in vietnam are also being considered. the white house on friday said the president will meet with kim in late february. the leaders will continue talks on north korea's nuclear program.\n\nand u.s. skier lindsey vonn may have skied her last race. the olympic gold-medalist competed in a world cup super g event this weekend in italy. she failed to finish the last race of the weekend. this is her first event back after recovering from her latest knee injury. after the race, vonn said immediate retirement was a possibility that her injuries might get the best of her. i'm marianne rafferty. now back to life, liberty & levin.\n\nlevin: curt schilling, were you always a republican?\n\nschilling: i think i was. i registered and when i registered in 18, i registered as an independent and i think i was -- and i think to this day, i'm probably more an independent republican because i think socially, i'm very progressive, but fiscally i'm not.\n\nlevin: socially your view is be and let be.\n\nschilling: i don't care who you sleep with. i don't care about any of the other things that i have might -- i have a son on the spectrum and he is one of the greatest human beings you're ever going to meet and he formed the lgbtq club in high school.\n\nand now as far as i know, he's straight. i don't know, i don't really care, but i've had kids coming into my house for eight years that are gay, that our transgender, that are making the change from boy to girl, girl boy. i don't use pronouns around grant's friend just because i don't want get in trouble with them but --\n\nlevin: i use pronouns because i don't know what else to say.\n\nschilling: and they're the greatest kids in the world, and i keep telling them who you are dating? that's absolutely nothing to do with --\n\nlevin: but you're not a republican because of that.\n\nschilling: right.\n\nlevin: you're a republican why?\n\nschilling: i'm a republican because i love competition. i think competition brings out the best in human beings. i think --\n\nlevin: so this whole notion of centralized government, of uniformity, of redistributing wealth, kind of destroys all those motivations and principles.\n\nschilling: well, here's the thing. i'm -- the second you say you're against obamacare, you're hoping people die according to the media. i want everybody to have healthcare. first of all, let's be clear.\n\nno one can -- you can't be denied healthcare.\n\nlevin: right, you go into -- that's federal law.\n\nschilling: you can't be denied -- you keep walking in it -- you cannot be -- you can be denied health insurance, but you can't be denied healthcare. the fact that of the matter is, in capitalism, if we force people to -- under a single-payer government-run healthcare system, then we are going to be telling people who go to medical school to become doctors just how much money they're allowed to make every year and that's that slippery slope.\n\nand when has our government ever proven to us that they are fiscally competent?\n\nlevin: and i have this question for you. when bernie sanders talks about government, when elizabeth warren talks about government, when all of these people talk about government, can they give us some names? in other words, exactly who's going to the healthcare system? and exactly where do these experts come from? they're not experts. they're people who are in the bureaucracy. they are civil servants. they're members of unions in some cases, some of them have seniority. do they have expert tests?\n\nso basically what these leftists are telling us is that the people in the bureaucracy are smarter, more experienced, more noble than all the plebes out there.\n\nschilling: but isn't that the message they've been telling us?\n\nlevin: yes, but how is that the case?\n\nschilling: right, no but they've been making it clear to us as conservatives that we're deplorable. you're just stupid rednecks and we know better than you so just shut up and let us do what we do.\n\nlevin: but we pay most of the bills.\n\nschilling: with no background of success in doing anything. the government is never -- that's why capitalism -- private sector has kicked the crap out of the government forever because of the competition.\n\nlevin: are you happy -- you're republican. are you happy with how the republicans generally conduct themselves in congress?\n\nschilling: no.\n\nlevin: why not?\n\nschilling: no, because i think the republic -- most of the republicans in congress stopped representing me about seven or eight years ago and started representing themselves and running for office the day they got into office.\n\nlevin: is it because they don't stand for conservative principles? is it because they don't fight?\n\nschilling: yes.\n\nlevin: they drive up the debt? what is it?\n\nschilling: yes.\n\nlevin: all of these things?\n\nschilling: yes. the democrats, when they want something, they don't care. they'll go -- they'll ruin your life. they'll ruin lives. they'll do whatever they need to do to get what they want. we've always been, excuse me. may i, please. i'm sorry. in the sense that you know, we don't want to play dirty pool because we don't believe that dirty pool is a way to play.\n\nbut when two groups are competing on a playing field and they're playing by separate rules, it's not a fair game and that's exactly what's happened. the republican party -- the freedom caucus has more my speed now -- jim jordan and the guys --\n\nlevin: who are conservative elements.\n\nschilling: yes, they're -- that's what a conservative is. a conservative looks at the constitution as an ironclad document. it's easy, it's simple, it makes sense and it's perfect.\n\nlevin: what do you of this battle over the budget and the wall and the state of the union? what do you make of all that?\n\nschilling: well, i find it ironic. i don't know if irony is the right word, but a couple years ago, i remember before the election, weren't we all screaming for something different? we don't want a career politician. we want somebody to break the mold.\n\nyou couldn't break the mold any more than we broke it with the guy we put in there. he's not a politician. this is what it looks like when you put someone who isn't a politician in the oval office, which is -- he's a pragmatist. he's a problem solver and that's what he's done. he's put up --\n\nlevin: yes, he's very conservative.\n\nschilling: he is very conservative, but he's the first politician in our lifetime that kept his work. that's why i believe -- and mr. president, if you're watching this show, do not give in. the american people are behind you. don't give in until the democrats give you what they were giving each other ten years ago, that $40 million or $50 million for the wall, a billion dollars for the wall.\n\nhe's standing on principle. he's standing on things that we've never -- we watched eight years. i mean, i suffered in eight years watching the obama administration do things that are going to take us decades to get out of, but president trump, i do find it -- i don't know what the word that the media treats -- they hate his guts, obviously. they can't stand him.\n\nbut they never call him president trump. you ever notice that? they always call him donald trump. you never heard them say barack obama. it was president obama and it's just the little things. i don't get caught up in them, but it's just kind of funny how they do that.\n\nlevin: all right, ladies and gentlemen, don't forget, you can join us most weeknights on levin tv. give us a call at 844- levin-tv, 844-levin-tv or go to blazetv.com/mark, that's blazetv.com/mark. we'll be right back.\n\n(commercial break)\n\nlevin: curt schilling, as a broadcaster -- radio, tv, digital tv -- i actually find sports broadcasters to be even more liberal than the so- called mainstream media and they like to talk about politics all the time.\n\nfirst of all, why is that and why do they like to talk about politics all the time?\n\nschilling: i don't have an answer for why. i do know and i believe the number is 86, but it might be 88% -- they did a poll on sports writers and 88% of the people in the media -- in sports media are liberal.\n\nlevin: why is that?\n\nschilling: well, i think that it's a byproduct of our education system, first off. most of them have gone to college and got a degree in gender studies or whatever they get degrees in these days and that's what they do.\n\ni've got to tell you when i got -- when i realized that, when i was done playing and i looked back on that, i think about these guys that are -- they've got four-year degree from bu and they've got a journalism degree and they're standing in front of a kid who's 21 years old, doesn't speak english from the dominican and he's making $15 million a year and they're taking home, you know, $1,500.00 a month after tax or whatever and there was some bitterness. you can always see in the writing.\n\nlevin: so you think they're bitter because they see athletes making all this money and they make chump change -- many of them.\n\nschilling: i don't think that's the sole reason. i think that that's part of it. i've seen that dynamic at work, but i do know that -- i was surprised by that by what you said. there were a lot more liberals in the booth and espn was -- i mean, i had people literally come up to me. it's almost like being a member of the underground railway, i guess.\n\nthey would come up and say hey, listen i agree with your political views, so keep it up. like, no one can hear them say that and it turned out to be true. there were no -- almost no outwardly concert -- except for me at espn and they made that end pretty quickly, so ...\n\nlevin: could it also be in part, you see a lot of the athletes taking the knee, not all of them, a lot of them taking the knee. you see like at the nfl at the highest levels, they cave to the left and also conservatives don't use sports to make statements. you know, you just said, you're competitive, you're an athlete. you do your thing. you go home or you do your commercials or whatever you do.\n\ncould the problem be that for progressivism, witting or unwitting, whatever the format is, whatever the forum is. sports -- we're going to devour it with our ideology. that's my sense of this. whatever is out there, we have got to superimpose and project our ideology.\n\nschilling: and isn't that what they kind of do is as an -- they chew something up, spit it out move to the next thing. i'll give you a great example. christine blasey ford. when was the last time you heard her name?\n\nlevin: you're right. i haven't heard --\n\nschilling: i mean that -- but that was -- she was the linchpin of the trump administration's nomination of judge kavanaugh and it turned out she had nothing and it turned out that all the people involved including michael avenatti and the lady in newark, they were lying about this man.\n\nthey say they -- and lindsey graham was right. i think lindsey graham justified his political life in the statement he made at the end of that.\n\nlevin: that was his great ...\n\nschilling: that was.\n\nlevin: you know that was his great sort of welch speech.\n\nschilling: yes.\n\nlevin: have you no decency?\n\nschilling: and i try to tell people, and i tell my kids, listen if the left will destroy a man like that to get what they want, nobody's off- limits. look at what they did to general flynn. this man served his country honorably for how long. he didn't know -- there was -- it wasn't a misleading --\n\nlevin: setup.\n\nschilling: right, he was set up and we're going to find out when the mueller stuff is all done that that -- if we can get the truth, it's going to be stunning.\n\nlevin: well one of the things we'll be able to get is in that chair, i hope general flynn, who will for once be able to tell his side of the story. people don't understand that when a prosecutor is holding a legal gun to your head, you're not allowed to speak ...\n\nschilling: and threatening your family.\n\nlevin: and threatening your son, threatening your family. they have enormous power and in this case, there's really no check and balance.\n\nschilling: insider power, yes.\n\nlevin: and as a matter of fact, congress, even republicans keep saying we need to protect the prosecutor. no, you need to protect his targets because there's no check and balance right now, he's got enormous power beyond any u.s. attorney.\n\nschilling: and when you think about the nsa and you think about google and all of the social media companies and their invasiveness into our lives, you know, they could go tomorrow and plant whatever they wanted on your computer.\n\nlevin: what do you make of the unmasking of general flynn, the unmasking of these individuals during the obama administration? why aren't we getting to the bottom of that? why aren't we getting to the bottom of that whole russia collusion?\n\nschilling: that's half the challenge. we ask questions we already know the answers to. we are talking about -- we know for a fact the president didn't collude in any fashion with russia, but hillary clinton gave somebody -- that is tied to a russian, you know, companies access the 20% of our uranium?\n\nlevin: she gave -- that's right, a state-controlled company and also it is she and the dnc that funneled money through a law firm and so forth to a foreign ex-spy who worked with the russians.\n\nschilling: and how is that not the story?\n\nlevin: isn't that amazing to you?\n\nschilling: it's more scary than amazing because it's again -- you know, in many -- i've told you this in many ways, the media can do whatever they want to if they don't like you. they can do whatever they want to if they do like you. they've managed to marginalize me in many ways for things i've never done, but when i think about it, like i said, if general flynn is not off-limits, if hillary clinton can give access to our uranium to the russians and not be held accountable, then the justice system is broken horribly.\n\nlevin: all right, we'll be right back.\n\n(commercial break)\n\nlevin: curt schilling, you read a lot of history you said. military history, in particular. you see what the president of the united states is trying to do with north korea. it's very, very difficult. he was handed a real bad hand there. he's accused of going soft on russia, yet he's tougher on russia than obama has ever been.\n\ni really like what he's doing with china, which has been stealing our technology and is expanding militarily in so many ways. i wish our media would focus on some of that and he's reversed the obama administration's policy vis a vis iran, which is a terrorist state that has killed american soldiers, which obviously is building icbms not for tel aviv, but for los angeles.\n\nbut they're grave threat is -- they are on a grave threat to us, too and yet he's not given a lot of credit for what he's doing in foreign policy, which is essentially reaganism and they attack reagan, too and reagan was very, very successful. what do you make of that?\n\nschilling: well the first thing, i think the most obvious issue for me is, i find it stunning that when the president of the united states says america first, people get offended. that's a dog whistle. now, when the left says dog whistle, america first. americans are black, white, yellow, brown, green -- i don't -- they're all colors, all races, all religions. america -- that's what makes us so great.\n\nbut that seems to offend everybody when he says america first. he is the first president --\n\nlevin: why does that offend the left?\n\nschilling: well i think because --\n\nlevin: do they view us as part of a global community?\n\nschilling: oh sure they do. well, you heard them. i mean, hillary wanted hemispherical borders.\n\nlevin: well is this why they don't, at this point now, they want open borders. they don't even talk about national sovereignty. would they actually have us surrender our form of representation to international organizations?\n\nschilling: yes, i think they would. first of all, you can't be a sovereign nation without borders. i mean that's just a simple fact. but i've got to tell you, on the foreign policy side, i think, i was struck by a couple of things.\n\nwhen he was running and he -- when he was interviewing people for his cabinet, he was talking about people for his joint chiefs and i can't remember the general's name. i want to say it was flynn, but it wasn't. it was somebody else. he said that he came away with an impression of president trump that he didn't go in with. he said, a lot of times i view people and their intelligence by the questions they ask rather than the questions they answer, and the questions he asked me were just brilliant, and you know, i'll take his word that they were that.\n\ni think he's getting advice from the people in -- his inner circle is smaller than any president in our lifetime.\n\nlevin: but i'll tell you, it's so solid with bolton and pompeo, and folks like that. if you don't believe in america first, what do you believe in? america second?\n\nschilling: if your foreign policy is not america first, what is it? china first? i mean, part of the reason i was so distraught over the eight years of obama is -- whoever was president this time, hopefully it was a conservative, he was going to have to unravel the kowtowing and the bending and the kissing of butt globally that the administration did, apologizing.\n\ni mean, our soldiers are buried on foreign territory all over the world and i don't know of any foreign soldiers that are buried on our ground that helped us get what we got now.\n\nlevin: some french --\n\nschilling: there are some french -- yes, there are some french, absolutely. absolutely, but when you go to the graveyard above normandy beach above utah beach and you look at the rows and the rows and the rows and you watch french citizens react to world war ii veterans which is one of the greatest things i've ever seen in my life, you realize that the media doesn't represent not just american interests but the common man.\n\nlevin: all right, we'll be right back\n\n(commercial break)\n\nlevin: i want to circle back to where we began the program -- the hall of fame. for people who don't know, who decides who gets into the hall of fame?\n\nschilling: so there's a baseball writers association, a sports writers association, once you get ten years in, you're qualified to get a hall of fame ballot.\n\nlevin: so ten years in as a writer?\n\nschilling: yes, as a member of the association, so -- and you don't have to be a baseball writer.\n\nlevin: so you can be an expert on boxing.\n\nschilling: you could be an expert on anything, but baseball and some of the people that are on there have never watched baseball.\n\nlevin: how many of them are there in this group?\n\nschilling: i think there's a little over 400 now, this year.\n\nlevin: is that typical or is it normally 400?\n\nschilling: yes, it fluctuates. you lose -- if you don't vote, you lose your ballot and there's rules.\n\nlevin: so how does somebody get on the ballot?\n\nschilling: you have to play ten or more years in the big leagues and once you get that threshold, five years after you retire, you go on the ballot.\n\nlevin: but that means -- so you go on automatically?\n\nschilling: yes.\n\nlevin: how do you qualify to go on there?\n\nschilling: you have to play ten years in --\n\nlevin: just by seniority?\n\nschilling: yes, by playing a specific amount of time, yes.\n\nlevin: so every baseball player who's played a certain period of time is on a ballot?\n\nschilling: yes, and what happens, if you get less than 5% votes, you're off the next year, which is what happens to the ballots.\n\nlevin: what's the highest percentage you ever got?\n\nschilling: fifty-something.\n\nlevin: you know when?\n\nschilling: i think two years ago because it went down last year.\n\nlevin: so you're like perennial. you keep popping up on their ballot.\n\nschilling: i do wonder how my percentage is. i haven't won a game or struck out a hitter in ten years and i apparently, i'm getting better and worse.\n\nlevin: do people tell you, writers tell you what's going on? they must talk to each other?\n\nschilling: so -- but i don't know, 15 years ago, i was in tampa bay and the hall of fame voting had come out and i think -- i want to say nolan ryan had gotten elected and a writer walked into the clubhouse and said -- and this guy was -- he was an ass. he was a pompous guy. he was the 500- pound guy who tells everybody he was the greatest athlete in the world when he wasn't 500 pounds.\n\nhe turned out to be a horrible human being. he came in and said, i didn't vote for a nolan ryan. proud and i said, what do you mean you didn't vote for nolan ryan? he said, no, if don sutton didn't get in unanimously, nolan ryan doesn't deserve. and he wrote a huge article on it.\n\nand i said, so you didn't vote for nolan ryan so you could get content because you're too lazy to go out and get it yourself. and you realized that this is -- you're being asked to pass judgment on a career you have no business giving comment on, but anyway.\n\ni realized that it was a good lesson because i learned early in my life that they don't vote their conscience. they vote a --\n\nlevin: there are a lot of other reasons.\n\nschilling: right, but for a lot of other thing.\n\nlevin: i want to ask you this, i don't want the public to know this. you haven't complained about this to me at all. i'm the one who keeps bringing it up.\n\nschilling: i never will.\n\nlevin: let me ask you this. in your mind, who are the three greatest pitchers in modern baseball history?\n\nschilling: greg maddux is the best pitcher in the history of the game.\n\nlevin: why?\n\nschilling: because what he did when he did it belies logic. i think randy johnson, probably the greatest --\n\nlevin: and you played with him?\n\nschilling: yes. probably the greatest power pitcher.\n\nlevin: let me tell you, if i were standing at the plate and this guy's up there, what was he? six nine or something? and his arm's speed, i mean he's like 30 feet --\n\nschilling: he basically almost brushes your nose when he lets go of the baseball.\n\nlevin: i'd be scared to death.\n\nschilling: you should be because he flexes --\n\nlevin: quasi sidearm, i go, whoa, whoa, whoa.\n\nschilling: yes, he's throwing a hundred miles an hour.\n\nlevin: i know and that's a big dude.\n\nschilling: i got to watch that.\n\nlevin: yes.\n\nschilling: honored to watch that and i think pedro martinez had one of the greatest runs ever. what he did before that three-year period was -- but i would say maddux and johnson and there's clemens before he did the stuff he did.\n\nlevin: what about ryan?\n\nschilling: i think nolan ryan was one of the greatest strikeout pitchers of all time. nolan ryan was a guy -- his last pitch was 95 miles an hour.\n\nlevin: i mean, that's unbelievable.\n\nschilling: he was like 79 years old when he threw that.\n\nlevin: yes, i mean -- i would consider him one of the greats.\n\nschilling: yes, i -- yes, okay, that's fair.\n\nlevin: i also consider you one of the greatest.\n\nschilling: well, i appreciate that.\n\nlevin: i mean, there's nobody better in the postseason -- nobody.\n\nschilling: i had two goals when i said -- i'll never and -- i honest to god, my wife and i were laying in bed in 1992, right after my first season in the big leagues and she said to me, you know, what do you want to happen? i said, i want two things. i want to win the roberto clemente award, which is -- because roberto clemente is my dad's favorite player and i want to retire having all of the teammates that wore my jersey say, if i had a game to pitch, win or lose, life or death, i would want him on the mound.\n\nin 2001, i won the roberto clemente award which is still the highlight of my career. a quick story, my dad, i went to one game as a fan in my lifetime -- in my lifetime. it was roberto clemente's final game in 1972. he doubled off john madden like for his 3,000th hit and he died in the plane crash not long after.\n\nthe first time i ever saw my dad cry, but that -- that he meant the world to my dad, so he meant the world to me and i got to meet the clemente family, which was the greatest thrill of my life.\n\nlevin: you're fascinating.\n\nschilling: thank you.\n\nlevin: and i want to thank you for coming on the program.\n\nschilling: it's a pleasure. it's always a pleasure.\n\nlevin: god bless you.\n\nschilling: god bless you.\n\nlevin: all right, ladies and gentlemen see you next time on life, liberty & levin.\n\ncontent and programming copyright 2019 fox news network, llc. all rights

president biden told reporters thursday that coronavirus relief will be passed with or without the support of congressional republicans.\n\nwhen asked if the president supports democrats' calls to use a legislative process known as budget reconciliation to get another stimulus package expedited through congress, biden said, i support passing it with support from republicans if we can get it.\n\nbut the relief has to pass, he added. no ifs and or buts.\n\nspeaker of the house nancy pelosi, d-calif., announced thursday, that the house will bring a budget resolution to the floor next week for biden's $1.9 trillion relief package – the first step in advancing a bill through the reconciliation process.\n\nthe senate will then vote to adopt the resolution. budget reconciliations require only a simple majority to pass, as opposed to the 60 votes needed for most legislation. democrats hold a majoriy in the house. the senate is even, but democrats have an effective majority because vice president kamala harris has the tie-breaking vote.\n\nbut the $1.9 trillion resolution is unlikely to garner much republican support, as several gop lawmakers have already voiced concern over the large price tag and ardently opposed increasing the previous amount allotted to individual stimulus checks -- even after president trump called on them to do so.\n\ni hope we don't need it, but if needed we will have it, pelosi told reporters thursday. we want it to be bipartisan always, but we can't surrender.\n\nbiden urged by house dems to extend obamacare benefits to daca recipients\n\nsenate majority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., reiterated pelosi's calls for a bipartisan bill but said it will be passed without republican lawmakers if they oppose the legislation.\n\nour preference is to make this important work bipartisan, to include input, ideas, and revisions from our republican colleagues or bipartisan efforts to do the same. but if our republican colleagues decide to oppose this urgent and necessary legislation, we will have to move forward without them, schumer said on the senate floor thursday.
self-described socialist sen. bernie sanders of vermont, who says he will launch a political revolution if elected president in november, has made his radical medicare-for-all proposal the centerpiece of his campaign.\n\nformer vice president joe biden, who is challenging sanders for the democratic presidential nomination, argues correctly that medicare-for-all is unaffordable.\n\nbiden wants you to think he's a moderate who favors a much less costly plan that would build on obamacare. but the former vice president's plan still features its fair share of tax increases that would hamstring our economy and take a bite out of the average family's wallet.\n\nbetsy mccaughey: sanders gets it wrong on 'medicare-for-all'\n\nin truth, biden and sanders are both calling for the same thing – a government takeover of health insurance. they just differ on how to deliver that outcome.\n\nonce one of these men wins the democratic nomination to run against president trump, the president will call attention to the fatal flaws in his opponent's plans. as a result, that could mean that health care will become a losing issue for democrats, unlike in the 2018 midterm elections.\n\nthe coronavirus was on voters' minds as they headed to the polls on super tuesday. over half of voters in five states, including california and texas, said the illness caused by the virus was an important factor shaping their vote, according to exit polls.\n\nlikely because of their fears about the virus, voters in every super tuesday state listed health care as their most important issue. but they appeared to trust biden's pitch for incremental reform more than sanders' promise to burn down the status quo.\n\nnearly 40 percent of voters who said health care was their top issue voted for biden, while just 30 percent of those voters went to sanders.\n\nand yet, medicare-for-all remains popular with voters. exit polls from super tuesday found that half of all voters supported replacing private health insurance with a government-run system. around 70 percent of voters in maine and vermont supported this plan.\n\nthis public support for medicare-for-all might be a function of their fuzziness on how it would work. some 47 percent of americans erroneously think they'd be able to keep their employer-sponsored insurance under medicare-for-all.\n\nnearly six in 10 americans say they oppose medicare-for-all if it leads to the elimination of private insurance – which it most certainly does.\n\nmedicare-for-all may play well in the democratic primaries. but it will be disastrous in a general election.\n\nsanders' medicare-for-all plan will require back-breaking tax hikes that will pick the pockets of every american to cover its $46 trillion cost over 10 years. by way of comparison, president trump has proposed a budget of $4.829 trillion for the entire federal government in the 2021 fiscal year.\n\nevidence from single-payer systems abroad indicates that all the gigantic tax increases needed to pay for medicare-for-all would simply buy us all places on waiting lists for health care.\n\nbiden promises to preserve private insurance and create a public option as a means of stoking competition in the insurance market. that may seem like a safer political bet for democrats who need the votes of suburban moderates to retake the white house.\n\nclick here to sign up for our opinion newsletter\n\nbut the public option is just single-payer in slow motion. it envisions paying doctors and hospitals rates similar to medicare's, which are about 40 percent less than those for private insurance.\n\nprivate insurers don't have the power to dictate what they'll pay providers. consequently, the public option will have a much lower cost structure – and will thus be able to set premiums that are far lower than those for private insurers.\n\nconsumers are sure to flock to the cheaper public plan. health care providers will respond by raising their rates for private insurers, who will have to pass those cost increases along to their customers in the form of higher premiums. that will drive still more people to the public option. the cycle would repeat, until the public option was the only insurance option left.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\njust two years ago, democrats chalked their victories in the 2018 midterm elections up to their promise to protect obamacare. now they're going to run on a plan for health care reform that results in the end of private insurance.\n\nthat's unlikely to play well at the polls in november, when there are more than democratic primary voters casting their ballots.\n\nclick here to read more by sally pipes
despite mountains of historical evidence revealing the dangers associated with socialism, support for karl marx's collectivist ideas is steadily increasing.\n\nin an august 2018 gallup poll, 51 percent of young people aged 18-29 said they have a favorable opinion of socialism, compared to just 45 percent who said they view capitalism positively. compare that to 2010, when 68 percent of young people said they view capitalism favorably. that's a remarkable 33 percent decline in just eight years.\n\nmany parents who support the traditional american values of self-responsibility, individual liberty and free markets, have been left to wonder how they can teach their children the truth about collectivism and resist the rise of socialism.\n\nbelow are strategies for talking to young people about the dangers of communism, socialism and other progressive ideas.\n\ndemocrats now pushing many of the same socialist policies that destroyed venezuela\n\nexplain the meaning of socialism and why it's immoral\n\nevery conversation about socialism should begin with a discussion about what it actually entails. survey data show most americans have no clue what socialism is, despite the fact that it's regularly discussed in the media.\n\nsocialism is the collective ownership and management of property. in a purely socialist society – an idea karl marx called communism – all or nearly all property is owned and managed by the collective.\n\nunder such a scheme, people have very little power over their own lives. even their homes are owned collectively. in the case of democratic socialism, this means that people are forced to live according to the desires of the majority. in many situations, a small group of people is given power by the majority, and that group typically ends up becoming tyrannical, as we've seen in china, north korea and venezuela.\n\nwith this model in place, minorities don't really have any rights. if the majority thinks people should live or work in a certain way, everyone is required to obey, even if it violates their deeply held beliefs. for example, in a socialist country, vegetarians would be required to be part owners in a slaughterhouse.\n\nin socialism, individual rights are mere illusions. even free-speech rights are limited if they are deemed harmful to the rest of society – which means these rights don't really exist at all. this is why human rights abuses are so common in countries that try to enact socialism.\n\nemphasize charity, not government coercion\n\nfor most young americans, socialist ideas are appealing because they genuinely want to help those who are suffering. they believe single-payer health care, a green new deal, and other similar policies are compassionate. conservatives have a tendency to dismiss these ideas without providing alternatives. this leaves younger people feeling frustrated.\n\ngovernment social programs might not be perfect, young liberals and socialists often tell me, but at least liberals and socialists are trying to fix difficult problems like poverty. conservatives and libertarians don't care what happens to people who are suffering.\n\nwhenever parents discuss socialism, they should always explain that it's important to engage in charitable activities. advocates of freedom do support helping others, they just don't believe the government is best equipped to do it.\n\nthis idea is best reinforced when families engage in charitable activities together. parents must show their kids that motivated, compassionate conservatives care for those most in need and make the world a better place.\n\nthis conversation allows parents to make a very important moral argument: charity is morally positive, because it means people are voluntarily helping those in need, but government welfare programs – however well-intentioned they might be – are not forms of charity. they require the government to use force and coercion. those who don't want to pay for a government program because they think it isn't helpful – or perhaps believe it's harmful – are forced to pay their taxes and participate anyway. those who refuse can end up in prison.\n\nor, put simply, conservatives support people freely helping others, while those on the left advocate for forcing, manipulating and controlling people to accomplish their goals.\n\nexplain that there's never been a successful socialist nation in world history\n\nhere's a startling fact about socialism that every child should hear: during the past century, tens of millions of people have been killed, exiled or imprisoned by socialist and communist parties, and no country has ever successfully enacted a system that matches marx's vision for the world – a reality even the staunchest marxist will admit.\n\nkids often respond to this fact by saying that there are many examples of socialism working successfully. like sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., and rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y., they point to denmark, norway and sweden.\n\nthe idea that nordic nations are little socialist utopias is a gigantic myth. denmark, norway and sweden are absolutely not socialist nations. some parts of their economies have been socialized, like health care and higher education, but they are still market-based economies, and in many respects, their citizens are freer than americans.\n\nfor example, in the heritage foundation's 2019 index of economic freedom, denmark, norway and sweden all score higher than the united states in numerous categories, including property rights and business freedom.\n\nfurthermore, history has repeatedly shown that government can't fix many of our most complex societal issues, even when it socializes just one part of the economy. for example, since the obamacare health insurance exchanges first opened, insurance premiums have doubled and deductibles have skyrocketed.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\ntalking about the dangers of socialism with kids isn't easy. children are constantly being bombarded with pro-socialist messages from hollywood, the music industry, professional sports and, most importantly, their teachers and professors.\n\nbut if parents aren't willing to put in the time to address these important ideas, who will?\n\nclick here to read more by justin haskins
now that the obamacare exchange websites are largely up and running, federal health officials are finding themselves swamped as they fact-check a flood of paperwork from applicants seeking taxpayer subsidies.\n\nthe department of health and human services seems to be caught between critics on both sides as it confronts the task.\n\nthe department, which oversees the implementation of the affordable care act, has gotten hit by audits showing it hasn't done enough to crack down on fraudsters trying to scam the system. at the same time, some frustrated applicants say they have played by the rules -- signed up on time and submitted the necessary paperwork -- only to be caught up in bureaucratic red tape.\n\nwe are working with consumers every day to make sure individuals and families get the tax credits and coverage they deserve and that no one received a benefit they shouldn't, hhs spokesman ben wakana told foxnews.com.\n\nhhs has been busy tracking down hundreds of thousands of americans who bought subsidized coverage through the aca's insurance exchanges.\n\nin most cases, hhs wants applicants to prove their citizenship, employer and income. those who are found ineligible could end up paying for their premiums without subsidy support, and those who already benefited from subsidies may be forced to repay some or all of the money.\n\nabout 8 million people signed up for a health plan through the aca exchanges -- according to hhs, that meant officials had to verify more than 160 million individual pieces of information. in the end, they found 1.2 million people had inconsistencies in their applications.\n\nthe agency, gradually, is getting through the pile. hhs tells foxnews.com that as of mid-july, they've processed 650,000 cases – and have about 550,000 left to go.\n\naccording to the kaiser family foundation, 85 percent of those who applied were considered eligible for some type of financial aid, which comes out to about $10 billion in subsidies in the first year.\n\nthe scramble to verify eligibility comes on the heels of a government accountability office report that raised fresh doubt about the ability of the health care program to prevent or intercept costly fraud schemes.\n\ngovernment investigators posing as fake applicants were able to go online, purchase health plans using fake documents and set themselves up to receive undeserved federal subsidies.\n\neleven of the 12 fictitious applicants were able to dupe the system using invalid social security numbers as well as inaccurate citizenship information, according to the report. the 11 were given the go-ahead to receive $30,000-a-year in health care credits and subsidies.\n\nfor its part, hhs says it is working to identify additional strategies to strengthen its verification process while getting credits to those who qualify.\n\nbut there's also the risk of putting in so many checks that applicants, like luis martinez of hialeah, fla, get caught in bureaucratic red tape.\n\nmartinez, who has heart problems, says he's been trying for more than a month to work out his document drama.\n\nhe bought a bronze-level health plan with coventry and was asked to provide additional information to verify his income and his wife's citizenship. his monthly $457 subsidy was at risk if he didn't comply.\n\nmartinez told the miami herald he tried multiple times to contact the government. he reportedly has receipts showing he mailed five identical packets of information to the hhs that contained copies of his u.s. passport, his wife's residency card, their joint 2013 income tax statement and his florida driver's license, the paper reported.\n\nfour weeks after he mailed his first packet, he received a letter asking for even more documents to verify his wife's immigration status.\n\nmartinez, who was hospitalized while waiting for the insurance issues to sort out, fears he could be stuck with a $12,000 medical bill for his stay.\n\nbut experts say that's unlikely. under the aca, consumers who have discrepancies with their application have 90 days to resolve the issue with documents that establish their eligibility.\n\nto qualify for a subsidized health plan under the affordable care act, government officials must verify a consumer's: social security number, citizen or immigration status, incarceration status, annual income, household size, medicaid eligibility, availability of employer-sponsored coverage and membership in a federally-recognized tribe.\n\nconsumers need to work with us in good faith to provide additional information that supports their application for coverage and we are working through these cases expeditiously, wakana said.
somersworth, n.h. -- former vice president joe biden cranked up the volume wednesday in his attacks against two of his top rivals for the democratic presidential nomination – sen. bernie sanders of vermont and former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg.\n\nspeaking to an audience in this small southeastern new hampshire city the morning after delayed partial returns from the iowa caucuses showed biden in fourth place -- trailing buttigieg, sanders and sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts -- the former vice president admitted, i'm not going to sugarcoat it. we took a gut punch in iowa.\n\npick your poll: sanders is up in new hampshire or he's tied with biden\n\nbiden acknowledged that this is not the first time in my life i've been knocked down.\n\nbut he vowed that we are going to come back and pledged that i'm going to fight for this nomination. i'm going to fight for it here in new hampshire, and in nevada and then in south carolina and beyond.\n\nbiden's lackluster performance in the iowa caucuses makes a strong finish in next week's primary in new hampshire even more imperative.\n\nwith that in mind, biden then unloaded on sanders, warning that if senator sanders is the nominee for the party, every democrat in america up and down the ballot – blue states, red states, purple states, easy districts competitive ones – every democrat will have to carry the label that senator sanders has chosen for himself.\n\nhe then stressed that sanders calls himself a democratic socialist.\n\nthe former vice president then emphasized that president trump is champing at the bit to label the democrats as socialists. and he pointed to his own efforts in the 2018 midterms in helping the democrats win back the majority of the house of representatives.\n\nwhen sanders attacks me for having baggage, i have to tell you the 60-plus candidates that i campaigned for, the toughest districts in the country just two years ago, don't see me as baggage and they wanted me in their districts, he said.\n\nand biden said he doubted such candidates would want bernie sanders to come in and campaign for them.\n\nbiden then used some of his most muscular language to date to criticize buttigieg, who's narrowly leading sanders in iowa as the results trickle in.\n\nbiden said: mayor pete likes to attack me as well and he's a good man. he calls me part of the old failed washington. really. was it a failure that i went to congress to get obamacare passed?\n\nbiden then highlighted numerous other accomplishments during the obama years and asked is he really saying that the obama-biden administration was a failure? pete, just say it out loud.\n\nbiden's campaign quickly blasted his comments on twitter.\n\nthe former vice president then took another shot, saying i've great respect for mayor pete and his service to this nation but i believe it's a risk – to be straight up with you – for this party to nominate someone who's never held office higher than mayor of a town of 100,000 in indiana. i do believe it's a risk.\n\nrep. annie kuster (nh02) - who endorsed buttigieg last month - pushed back.\n\nthe only lawmaker in new hampshire's four-member all democratic congressional delegation said have tremendous respect for the vice president. but i've got to tell you, it's a risk to go after this campaign with the same message, the same ideas, the same issues that we've been litigating. i think we need new energy, i think we need a new approach ... bringing people together the way pete does.\n\nat the event in somersworth, biden was interrupted twice by climate change demonstrators.\n\nthese guys are ok, biden said as the protesters chanted. they want to do the same thing i want to do. they want to phase out fossil fuels and we're going to phase out fossil fuels.\n\nwhen one of them continued to interupt biden, he responded saying don't act like the trumpers, ok.\n\nmoments later another of the protesters - a young woman - asked what biden would do to close a coal fired plan in new hampshire.\n\nthe former vice president touted his past efforts and added we can't do it all at one. we're working on it kid. we're working on it.
with wednesday's presidential primary debate in nevada fast approaching, mike bloomberg remains one poll shy of making the state.\n\nbut, his campaign on monday confirmed to fox news that if he were to qualify, the former new york city mayor and billionaire business and media mogul will take part in the primetime showdown.\n\nbloomberg's reached 10 percent or higher in three national polls that the democratic national committee has approved. he would need one more to make the stage, and would have until 11:59 p.m. et tuesday night to get that poll.\n\na new national poll by the marist institute for public opinion for npr and pbs newshour is scheduled to be released at 5 a.m. et on tuesday. the survey is one of the dnc's qualifying polls.\n\nthe two other ways to make the stage – reaching 12 percent or higher in two nevada caucus or south carolina primary-approved polls, or winning a delegate to the national convention in the feb. 3 iowa caucuses or last week's new hampshire primary – have been out of picture for bloomberg, since he's not on the ballot in any of the early-voting states.\n\nso far, sens. bernie sanders of vermont, amy klobuchar of minnesota and elizabeth warren of massachusetts, former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg and former vice president joe biden have made the stage.\n\nbut, the other billionaire in the race – environmental and progressive advocate tom steyer – has failed to qualify. he has remained three national polls shy – or two nevada or south carolina polls short – of making the stage. and, rep. tulsi gabbard of hawaii has been even further from meeting the thresholds.\n\nearlier this month, the dnc scrapped the individual donor threshold for candidates to qualify for the debate. since bloomberg has been self-funding his white house bid, he essentially had been shutout from making the stage. the move by the dnc – which opened the door to bloomberg – sparked criticism from many of his rivals.\n\nbloomberg decided even before he launched his bid in late november to skip the early voting states of iowa, new hampshire, nevada and south carolina and instead invest hundreds of millions of his own money to compete in the delegate-rich super tuesday states holding contests on march 3 – and beyond.\n\neven though he's not on the ballot in nevada, being on the debate stage could benefit bloomberg – with super tuesday less than two weeks away.\n\nas he's risen in national polls the past couple of weeks and as onetime-unrivaled front-runner biden has slipped – bloomberg's come under increased fire from his rivals as well as president trump's re-campaign over past controversial comments in support of the stop-and-frisk policing he once oversaw during his tenure as new york city mayor. and, he's also taken hits as more and more past remarks deemed sexist have been unearthed.\n\nthat's led some political pundits to surmise that bloomberg would be better off if he failed to qualify for wednesday's debate – thus avoiding direct contact with his rivals.\n\none longtime consultant for the democrats, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, also pointed to bloomberg's lack of charisma.\n\nbloomberg would be best served if he didn't appear on the debate stage before super tuesday, because voters won't see his bland personality and slow-to-respond debate reflexes, the strategist noted.\n\nbloomberg - regardless of whether he qualifies for the debate or not - is scheduled to in neighboring utah on thursday evening - to hold a rally in salt lake city.\n\nno letup in the bloomberg-sanders war of words\n\nsanders – in front of a crowd his campaign estimated was over 10,000 people at the rosie the riveter wwii home front national historical park in richmond, calif., once again blasted bloomberg.\n\nmr. bloomberg, like anybody else, has a right to run for president, sanders said. but, the populist senator who's making his second straight white house run emphasized, he does not have a right to buy the presidency, especially after being mayor of new york and having a racist stop-and-frisk policy.\n\nhours earlier, bloomberg's campaign touted a new digital ad hitting sanders supporters over some of their recent controversial rhetoric. the spot featured texts, tweets, and memes from people who appeared to be sanders supporters attacking rivals for the nomination.\n\nbloomberg – in a tweet spotlighting the ad – wrote, we need to unite to defeat trump in november. this type of 'energy' is not going to get us there.\n\nbilingual campaigning\n\nspanish-speaking voters have played an extremely influential role in nevada's presidential caucuses, and the democrats' campaigns have been stepping up their efforts to reach the electorate, with early caucus voting underway since saturday.\n\none of the latest examples: warren's campaign on monday announced latinas fight, latinas win – or latinas en la lucha – to highlight the senator's commitment to reach out to the community.\n\nand, the klobuchar campaign joined rivals in going up over the weekend with spanish-language tv and radio ads.\n\npro-biden super pac plants flag in nevada\n\nthe pro-joe biden super pac unite the country told fox news it will spend $750,000 to run ads this week in nevada in support of the former vice president.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\nthe group said the spots will focus on obamacare and gun control, and will run thru saturday's caucuses.\n\nunite the country spent heavily in iowa (approx. $5 million) and new hampshire (where the group spent roughly $900,000 to run ads) on behalf of biden.\n\nfox news' kelly phares, tara prindiville, alex rego and andrew craft contributed to this report.
the u.s. supreme court announced monday that it will review a challenge to the affordable care act's constitutionality after a group of states led by texas claimed that there is no longer a legal justification for it.\n\nthe law, commonly known as obamacare, was first upheld by the supreme court under the justification that by tying the individual mandate -- the requirement to buy health insurance -- to a financial penalty it fell under congress' taxation power. when president trump eliminated the penalty, republican-led states claimed there was no longer a legal basis for the mandate.\n\nobamacare under fire: lawsuit, tax repeals and 'medicare-for-all' push leave aca fate unclear\n\nthe fifth circuit court of appeals ruled in december that part of the law is now unconstitutional and their decision cast a cloud over the rest.\n\nthe individual mandate is unconstitutional because it can no longer be read as a tax, and there is no other constitutional provision that justifies this exercise of congressional power, the ruling said. the court sent the case back down to a lower court to decide on whether the mandate is severable from the rest of the law, which would allow other parts of obamacare to survive.\n\nclick here to get the fox news app\n\na group of 20 democratic states appealed. defenders of the affordable care act argued that the issues raised by the case are too important to let the litigation drag on for months or years in lower courts.\n\na decision from the supreme court is not expected until after the 2020 election.\n\nthe associated press contributed to this report.
