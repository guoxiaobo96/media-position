{"original": "perhaps five years ago, and certainly 10, the idea of a full-blown socialist sitting in the oval office was a non-starter, even among democrats. the fact that the tables have turned so completely reflects at least three factors:"}
{"original": "first, the sanders effect. democratic socialist sen. bernie sanders of vermont performed surprisingly well against hillary clinton in the 2016 democratic presidential primaries. sanders might have fared even better if america's biggest grifter had not climbed to the nomination with her heels in his back. while sanders wasn't the democrats' 2016 standard bearer, he can luxuriate in the fact that sending a socialist to the white house no longer terrifies democrats."}
{"original": "second, the obama effect. the oval office's previous occupant massively swelled the scope, reach and cost of government – from obamacare to food stamp expansion to ice-hardness regulations. the result was eight years of stagnation and misery. but some people love free stuff and making the evil 1 percent pay for it. for them, voting socialist is their favorite indoor activity."}
{"original": "third, the trump effect. most democrats hate president trump with a trembling rage. aoc is the un-trump: a 20-something, female bartender turned left-wing heroine confronting a 70-something, male billionaire turned right-wing hero. democrats can't stand him, so they root for her."}
{"original": "aoc shares one trait with trump: an impressive ability to keep the news cameras pointed her way. she is the most visible house freshman in memory – and sustainably so. alas, her ability to generate nonstop coverage highlights some of her more jaw-dropping positions."}
{"original": "observers were amazed to hear her declare at a martin luther king day event: the world is gonna end in 12 years, if we don't address climate change."}
{"original": "so if aoc becomes president after trump is re-elected, it would be curtains for this planet before she would complete her second term. if that's so, one wonders, why bother to run?"}

{"original": "the fifth circuit court of appeals last month ruled that the individual mandate, a key funding mechanism for the law, was unconstitutional now that congress eliminated a financial penalty for not having health insurance — making it impossible to say the individual mandate is a tax. it sent the case to a lower court, asking it to rule on whether the rest of the aca, also known as obamacare, could stand without the individual mandate."}

{"original": "the coalition led by california and its attorney general xavier becerra was trying to get the supreme court to circumvent the lower courts and rule on the case directly – and immediately – because the lower courts' actions have created uncertainty about the future of the entire affordable care act, and that uncertainty threatens adverse consequences on our nation's healthcare system, including for patients, doctors, insurers, and state and local governments."}

{"original": "tuesday's ruling was simply on the motion for expedited consideration of the petition, not on the petition itself, which means the supreme court could still hear the case as the blue states are asking it to. it just means that if the court agrees to hear the case, it most likely won't be until october at the earliest."}

{"original": "but it turns out that arguing over issues doesn't generate quite the same passion as the trump drama, with its hour-by-hour, hand-to-hand combat, including the aforementioned tweets."}
{"original": "it's funny, that's what we used to do in this country. the pols and the pundits spent a year and a half fighting over the passage of obamacare, and plenty of time in the last administration on the war over its repeal. barack obama's stance on immigration, gun control, terrorism, and foreign hot spots such as syria and ukraine consumed enormous amounts of political oxygen. sure there were lots of side battles over scandals from the irs to fast and furious, racial issues, and obama himself, but the big debates were over the big stuff."}

{"original": "so, that's what i think the last several years should teach republicans, is that we are tired of politicians and people that stand up and give speeches and never take action. that's what the last administration did, is they took action and people realized that they liked that and they liked the benefits of people who actually were public servants."}

{"original": "and then tomorrow, we will do this all over again where they will actually take the articles of impeachment plus the impeachment managers, the seven prosecutors who were announced today by house speaker nancy pelosi. they will present them to the senate and they will actually, you know, read the articles aloud before the senate. now, i'm told that that probably won't happen tomorrow before about 12:45, 1 o'clock. and they will also probably bring over the u.s. chief justice john roberts. he'll come across the street. he will be -- administer the oath of office, and then they will swear in the senators as jurors, bret."}
{"original": "baier: chad, you know, the president obviously has called all of this a hoax. republicans say there really is not a case here. democrats say they will make that case. the announcement of seven house managers today by the speaker, and she also hit tones of the constitution, pointing back to the founding fathers, making this a big moment, she said, for all of our children."}
{"original": "pergram: right. and this is where democrats have tried to make this case and say this is about the future. this is about future presidents. she often invokes the children, whether she's talking about healthcare or the constitution. and the chair of the judiciary committee, jerry nadler, who will be one of those managers, you know, he talked about that the senate is actually on trial here too, bret."}

{"original": "martha maccallum, fox news anchor: there is. and i think, you know, the formality of this moment is sort of what nancy pelosi has control over at this point to make sure that this is -- has the kind of momentum and has the kind of weight that she wants to give to all of this in the face of the fact that it has turned out to be a very partisan exercise, which is something that she said from the very beginning she didn't want to see. she said that impeachment was too divisive, an effort should take up unless there was an overwhelming case and bipartisan buy in and commitment to agreement on it. and she never did get that. we will always look back and wonder whether or not she was pushed into this. i think she will always consider whether or not she made the right decision here to move this forward. when it gets to the senate, obviously she's going to meet with the -- senators but the big question now is this issue of witnesses, which is also being nudged a bit by the new evidence that has come forward and these very sort of, you know, ominous notes from -- and discussions about packages being delivered and surveillance of the ambassador marie yovanovitch to ukraine. there is a lot here in terms of fodder for the president's opponents to dig into right now."}

{"original": "maccallum: i can't imagine that there isn't. we -- they obviously had a big day today signing the first phase of this china trade agreement. the president was feeling obviously very confident about all of that. the usmca is also on deck to be passed as well. and that is a very big achievement for this president. there's no doubt about that. but he has said very clearly that he thinks impeachment is an ugly word, that he didn't want to be impeached, and nancy pelosi has tried to kind of, you know, hammer that nail in by saying that no matter what happens with this process the house of representatives has impeached the president. and that is a forever sort of, you know, sign around his neck or an asterisk to his presidency. so i -- my guess is that there has to be some consternation about whether or not you're going to see a moment when john bolton primarily sits down at that table and gives his take on all of this."}
{"original": "baier: martha, stand by if you would. let's talk now with harold ford jr., former democratic congressman from tennessee. harold, your thoughts on this day, republicans will say they are concerned that this opens the door to more partisan impeachments for other presidents down the road. democrats say they are making a case that they think is open and shut."}
{"original": "harold ford jr. fox news political contributor: i remember 20 years ago, bret. i was in the congress. i voted against impeaching president clinton. and i remember the pageantry that we're about to watch or we're anticipating here in the next few minutes with speaker pelosi. it was a different speaker and different congress. the senate now has a responsibility. you have to hope that both democrats and republicans will take their pledge to be impartial in a very serious way. although there is a foregone conclusion that he will be acquitted, i think all of the jurors have to be willing to listen. but if you are on the political team with president trump this evening, you think how big of a moment this is from a positive standpoint, the jobs numbers, the economic numbers, the phase 1 of the china deal, the usmca agreement, the incredible effort in iran, the killing of this general. any other person would be riding so high. but all of this news does put a damper here. as it goes to the senate, bret, i hope democrats do one thing, that they focus solely on the national security implications of the president's actions. whether he is convicted or not, i think going forward -- if we take anything from this in terms of a history lesson, it would be that no president should take any actions that would undermine national security in an effort to advance their own political interest."}
{"original": "now, whether this president has done that or not, he's almost admitted to some of that. so whatever democrats do, whatever the managers do, and i think speaker pelosi did a really good job at some of these choices for managers, including this young guy, jason crow and hakim jeffries. these two young men, jeffries and crow, crow a former army ranger and intelligence analyst. they are uniquely equipped to do this. so this is an interesting -- historic in a lot of ways, unfortunate for the country, but all these parties involved, house members -- senate now has a role to play. and i hope they -- all democrats and republicans take it seriously."}
{"original": "baier: seven house managers, 13 house managers last time for the clinton impeachment. stand by if you would. andy mccarthy, former u.s. attorney to the southern district of new york. andy, we spent a lot of time -- the gavel to gavel coverage of the house as they built the case. that's how it is supposed to go. democrats said that they had to rush through that urgently because the president was a threat to the election in 2020 by his actions. now there was this pause for 27 days. and we are waiting for the formal move over for the articles of impeachment, your thought?"}
{"original": "andy mccarthy, fox news contributor: well, bret, i think the delay obviously undermines the alleged urgency that was behind the effort in the first place. but my main concern, if i were leader mcconnell and the republicans in the senate would be that this is not an open and shut case in the sense that the democrats are saying it is shut. in fact, they are continuing their investigation. and as we have been discussing, they are throwing, not only this new evidence, but the prospect of perhaps more impeachment articles. perhaps more witnesses who are just emerging coming forward. and my beef is that no federal judge would put up a situation -- a trial judge where he was being asked to try a defendant in a case, and at the same the prosecutors were continuing in the grand jury to investigate the defendant on the same charges and broadcasting whatever evidence they find to the media which, of course, would prejudice the trial. so i would certainly hope that mcconnell will at least -- and the republicans will at least entertain the thought of suspending this without prejudice and telling the house we're only going to try this case once. let's try it when it's ready. it doesn't appear to be ready."}
{"original": "baier: andy, what about this new evidence the democrats, the house intelligence committee sent over. it includes documents from lev parnas, the indicted associate of rudy giuliani, the president's lawyer, some communications, text messages. it seems like there is evidence that the ambassador yovanovitch followed, tracked by some of these men. how does that factor in now? obviously, it was not part of the case the house democrats built in these various hearings, but it now heads over to the senate."}
{"original": "mccarthy: well, it's always obviously been a problem, bret, though, because there's clear factual overlap between the indicted charges in the southern district of new york and the facts that were uncovered and the information that was uncovered in the house proceedings. to the point where a big part of the southern district case is what happened with marie yovanovitch, the ambassador to ukraine, and her removal at the behest of rudy giuliani and some of his associates. that was a big part of the house proceedings. it's a big part of the southern district trial. the other wildcard here is i think it's pretty clear that parnas is trying to leverage his potential importance as a witness in the impeachment trial in whatever plea negotiations he must be having with the southern district of new york. he obviously wants immunity, because if he testified in the impeachment case that would convict him more than likely in the criminal proceeding. i worked in the southern district of new york for 20 years. they don't give immunity. what they generally demand is that you plead guilty to the chargers and give full cooperation. so that may take some time to work out."}
{"original": "baier: you're looking live there, the articles of impeachment on the table. we're waiting for house speaker nancy pelosi. andy, stand by, cast of the five standing by in new york. this is their hour on fox news channel. it's here from dana perino and juan williams, dana, your thoughts first."}
{"original": "dana perino, fox news anchor: well, i think that after this initial pomp and circumstance everybody should just settle in, because it could be possibly a long time. we're talking about possibly two weeks. there won't be a lot of new information. i see that the speaker is probably getting ready here to appear. the senators can't really engage, and america feels like it's already heard all this. they heard it a month ago. public opinion did not change either way. and i think that when either side gets frustrated, that the american people don't see it their way. they are missing the fact that if there was some big obvious case against the president, we would all know it. it would be really obvious. the fact that it's this muddled at this point and people are dug in, i think that means that you won't see a lot of movement. plus, i would also add this. you have not yet seen the president's lawyers have a chance to layout their case. it's an impressive group of people. and they will be up against many of the people in the house that we know, some that we don't. and so that might be worth tuning into."}
{"original": "baier: yeah. you're looking live at the rayburn room, by the way. and the house and all the reporters getting up to take a look at the articles of impeachment, they're on the table. they will be signed and then walked over, as we've mentioned, from the house to the senate through the rotunda. juan williams, republicans will say that the process in the house was faulty. they didn't have a chance to make a defense, a legitimate defense, as dana points out. the president's attorneys and his team will in the senate, your thoughts today?"}
{"original": "juan williams, fox news anchor: well, they are going to have an extensive opportunity. and i think they have got quite a team there. pat cipollone, jay sekulow, i think sekulow will be on tv most nights. i think he's tv able. and on the other side, i think when you look at people like jerry nadler, i think nadler knows it, has the command of the case. but i think the star there is going to be adam schiff. and schiff, again, i think, you know, sort of tv ready. and i think part of this is public sentiment and building public support. and on that point, bret, i think it's important to note that people are who critical of nancy pelosi for the 27 day delay are now going to have to deal with the fact that there is, as you've mentioned, new information continuing to come in as well as the possibility of the former national security adviser, john bolton, agreeing or responding to a subpoena to testify. so all of that means that we have a changing dynamic, and it puts pressure on this political process. this is not a criminal trial. this is a political process. and from pelosi's point of view, it puts pressure on a lot of the sort of moderate republicans who are in some political peril to come along and support the idea of witnesses and documents."}
{"original": "and this is an ongoing effort, not something that is to be viewed as static and having been already settled and discussed in terms of the existing articles of impeachment."}
{"original": "baier: chad pergram, again, our congressional correspondent, announced today house speaker pelosi saying that she is appointing seven house managers. as we look at those seven, some are familiar names from the process, and the committee hearing process, including adam schiff and jerry nadler. but what about the others on here, and any surprises as far as who has been named to make this case in the senate?"}
{"original": "pergram: it's not a surprise that they picked a couple of freshmen. sylvia garcia of texas and also jason crow of colorado, you know, house speaker nancy pelosi is very aware of this big freshman class. the majority makers, those that, you know, you know, propelled the democrats to the majority. so she wants to respect that. it did not have older members. that's one criticism of the democratic leadership had faced. and of the criticisms about her leadership, you know, she had a bit of a rocky, you know, time last foul. some people thought she not have the votes to be the speaker of the house. so this is going to be a very different group in that sense. i think it isn't going to be jerry nadler, the chair of the judiciary committee, who will be the lead manager here. in 1999, it was henry hyde of illinois who was the chair of the judiciary committee, who led the effort against president clinton. it's going to be adam schiff. and i should note that this is not adam schiff's first rodeo. he was the impeachment leader that nancy pelosi appointed him for a lower profile impeachment trial before the senate in 2010. thomas porteous was a federal judge who was impeached. and that effort impressed house speaker nancy pelosi. and that's why, you know, she put him in charge of the intelligence committee and now has asked him to lead the charge today."}
{"original": "one other thing i should say, bret, here is that the impeachment managers were all just told about 24 hours ago. they have been meeting in the basement of the capitol kind of plotting strategy, trying to figure out how they're going to go about this. if there's going to be 24 hours of debate and 7 managers, that's a lot of time that each of these manager would have, as you subdivide their time, presenting to the senate."}
{"original": "baier: yeah. martha maccallum, there is also the factor of the timing in the senate trial. as these articles of impeachment move over there, it starts this process. but we don't know how long this could go. dana mentioned it could go a long time. and if witnesses are in fact called -- and there you see nancy pelosi making her way to the rayburn room, it could be a big, big moment here especially for some of those candidates who are on the campaign trail."}
{"original": "maccallum: absolutely. you know, there's -- those senators who are running for the nomination have a lot at stake here in terms of the time frame and how much of that time gets eaten up by being in this trial. then the other senators that we talked about before -- republican senators who are in precarious electoral positions going into 2020. you know it's been said, but it's worth reiterating that if democrats sort of lose this round on impeaching the president, there is another big round here for them. and that is the potential of flipping the senate. having it turn to a democrat majority senate, which would essentially -- if the president does win re-election tie his hands in the second term, bret."}
{"original": "baier: yeah. as we look live at the rayburn room in the house, nancy pelosi surrounded by her committee chairs making their way into the room packed with press. again, the formal signing of the articles of impeachment, the house clerk will do that formally. there you see adam schiff, jerry nadler and others, the speaker of the house nancy pelosi."}
{"original": "nancy pelosi, house speaker: good afternoon. as you know, on december 18th, the house of representatives upheld its constitutional duty and voted articles of impeachment against the president of the united states, donald trump. he said in the course of the debate that he did not uphold his oath of office to defend the constitution of the united states. the president takes a special oath, a little different from the congressional oath. in fact, he takes an oath that was taken by president george washington, the patriarch of our country, in front of whose picture we stand here. it's so sad, so tragic for our country that the actions taken the president to undermine our national security, to violate his oath of office, and to jeopardize the security of our elections, the integrity of our elections has taken us to this place. so today, we will make history. when we walk down -- when the managers walk down the hall -- across the threshold in history, delivering articles of impeachment against the president of the united states for abuse of power and obstruction of the house. making that history we are making progress for the american people, progress in support of our constitution, progress in honor of the sacrifice and divisions of our founders. progress and honor of the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform, and progress for the future of our children, make it be very clear that this president will be held accountable."}
{"original": "that no one is above the law, and that no future president should ever entertain the idea that article one -- article 2 says that he can do whatever he wants. and so with that, i will sign the resolution transmitting the articles of impeachment to the senate, which will be delivered by our managers, of whom i'm very proud. when they bring this over, it will set in motion a process on the senate side. probably tomorrow, i don't know their schedule. but it may be as soon as tomorrow. the senators will take an oath of office. they will take a special oath of office to do impartial judges and to impartial justice according to the constitution and the laws. let's hope that they uphold that oath that they take tomorrow. and so now, i'm very honored to be here with our 6th chairman who worked so hard to help us uphold the constitution with their legislating, their investigating, their litigating. you know the chairman of the judiciary committee is part of the managers, jerry nadler, mr. schiff, the distinguished chairman of the intelligence -- house select committee on intelligence. congresswoman maxine waters, the chair of national services committee, congresswoman -- madam chair of the oversight committee. congressman -- mr. chairman eliot engel of the foreign affairs committee and -- chairman of the ways and means committee, we thank them for all of their difficult work."}
{"original": "and we honor our darling, elijah cummings, who said one day when we are dancing with the angels, what we will say about what we did at this difficult time in our country's history? and then i am very proud that mr. nadler and mr. schiff are part of our managers. but i want to acknowledge other managers who are with us. a freshman member but i shouldn't say freshman. they have been here one year, accomplished great things. congressman jason crow from colorado, congresswoman val demings of the state of florida. congresswoman garcia of texas -- are we all here? where is hakim jeffries of new york? is that everybody? and -- this is who served the impeachment. she was -- the nixon impeachment, she was a staffer for the judiciary committee member don edwards of california. she was member of the judiciary committee in the clinton impeachment, and her own right a member of the judiciary committee and now member of the judiciary chair -- house administration which oversees elections and a manager. and with that, i thank them all for their leadership and their service. and i am now going to proceed to sign the articles."}
{"original": "baier: speaker nancy pelosi surrounded by seven house impeachment managers that will make the case in the u.s. senate in the trial and six committee chairs who dealt with the committee's hearings that led to the articles of impeachment, abuse of power of president trump, and obstruction of the house, speaker pelosi now signing these articles of impeachment as they will make their way over formally. bring back dana perino and juan williams. dana, the house speaker today said this is not political. this is not partisan. this is about patriotism. but frankly, it is political and it is partisan. and it's just the process that we have witnessed over the past weeks."}
{"original": "perino: i think one of the most partisan comments that she had was -- happened over the weekend when she was on the sunday show on abc, in which she said that regardless of what happens in the senate and being faced with the fact that we already read the end of the book, we know that the president will be acquitted. and so now, we are being forced to go back and read single every word for our punishment, for having skipped ahead and read the end of the book. but she said the president has already impeached, and he will have that for the rest of history, as if that was the goal. and i think right now what you're seeing is this ceremony. and it seems very sombre, but that's very different from the house process which was quite chaotic. and i think when it goes over to the senate, people will see that mitchell mcconnell will run a process, a trial that will be very senatorial. it will be calmer and more sterile. and it will be more slow than anybody wants. and we will have to go through this because this got going back in september, or if you look at what president has said they have talked about impeaching him from the very beginning."}
{"original": "the other thing i would say is that senators collins and murkowski, the two republican women who senator schumer basically is doing is polling in their states to see if they are vulnerable in 2020. i do not think that those two women will be bullied into voting for witnesses unless they really think it's meritorious. but you'll start to see a lot more 2020 activity, including you'll see three of the senators who are on the debate stage last night for the democrats. they will be in the senate having to be jurors in this trial and they're not allowed to say anything during that time. so it will be interesting. but i do think it will be a much calmer process than what you saw in the house."}
{"original": "baier: juan, what about that prospect? there is also democrats up for re- election like doug jones in deep red alabama -- will have to make a decision as well."}
{"original": "williams: i do. i think that this is a political process. i mean, i don't think there is any getting away from that, bret. and the difference is the way that we frame it as republicans and democrats. republicans clearly are intent on saying this is a partisan act. the president has said as much."}
{"original": "baier: let me break in here for a second, juan. sorry. ok, passing out the pens, getting it ready to walk over to the senate side. sorry to interrupt. go ahead."}
{"original": "williams: not at all. i think while republicans have sought to frame this as a partisan act, i think from -- what you just saw from nancy pelosi is her on emphasis on the idea that there are people of conviction and principle standing up as patriots. i think that's why she spoke about the idea that this doesn't happen everyday, that you have the constitution, the founding fathers, the people serving in our military, and our children all looking over our shoulder. that's a very different way to look at this. and i think that what she is saying is -- and again, this comes back to what dana was saying that -- to both sides we both know that this does not happen to every president. this is a real mark against a president, even if he or she is to be acquitted, and acquittal is likely. and finally, when she spoke of the senate, she spoke of them taking an oath to do impartial justice. and she said she hoped they would uphold that oath. i think that's very strong language. and again, framing it in the sense of putting the pressure, the onus on republicans, to look at the evidence, to hear from witnesses -- even the new evidence as we've been discussing here on fox that's came out in the last 24 hours."}
{"original": "baier: all right. juan and dana, thank you. we will head your way after this ceremony is completed. we will toss it over to the five. thank you. andy mccarthy, both sides, republicans and democrats, pointing to the founders and what they said about the impeachment today, house speaker pelosi saying that the founders did not want a ruler, a king, and noted that -- republicans pointing to federalist 65 and hamilton what he wrote about partisanship and concern that this could be a process that happens again and again and again if it is just on a partisan basis. thoughts on that as we watch this walkover from the house to the senate."}
{"original": "mccarthy: i think what's to be very concerned about with that, bret, is that impeachment is a vital part of the constitution. madison thought it was indispensable, as he said during the debates over the constitution, because it was necessary as kind of a final measure to wrestle or grapple on the -- on the congressional side with potential presidential excess or misconduct. and the problem with impeachment becoming politicized is not just the spectacle that we're seeing but also the fact that it cheapens the impeachment remedy. so we may be heading into an era where we see impeachment much more regularly because it's now going to be used as a political weapon, but that also degrades it because no one will take it as seriously anymore as it's really meant to be taken. it's supposed to be really the nuclear option in our constitution."}
{"original": "baier: all right, andy, standby. you're looking live right here from the capitol rotunda looking towards the house chamber, those the doors to the house chamber. and what you're going to see this engrossment ceremony, it's not the best name for this. we'll bring in chad pergram. but it is the ceremony to take the actual articles of impeachment and walk them physically which is part of the deal over to the u.s. senate. and chad pergram, we are going to see this pomp and circumstance from chamber to chamber here."}
{"original": "pergram: that's right. we're going to see it twice in the next couple of days. so what's going on right now behind the scenes by the democratic cloakroom, which is kind of the dugout for the house floor, between the rayburn room where they were actually conducting this ceremony, is cheryl johnson who is the clerk of house. she is actually putting pen to paper here. you might have seen how speaker nancy pelosi signing her name, signing this message to the senate with a series of pens that so all the committee chairs and also all the impeachment managers kind of have a souvenir that they would take with them. they do that when they enroll a bill and send it to the president, all the main sponsors get a pen. well, the same case here. and you're looking toward the house doors. this is what we call the will rogers era. you often see us doing live shots or live interviews on our network and others with members of congress. they will then walk that into statuary hall. statuary hall is the old house chamber. then they will go past the speaker's office, paul irving, the house sergeant at arms. he's in charge of security at the capitol."}
{"original": "he will escort cheryl johnson, the clerk of the house, with those -- that message in blue folders through the capitol rotunda, that's the middle of the building, actually then passed the old senate chamber and then pass the office of senate majority leader mitch mcconnell. on the senate side of the capitol, they'll be met by mike stenger. he is the senate sergeant at arms and they will actually take the articles of impeachment -- or excuse me, take this message alerting the senate what the house is done into the chamber. and i'm looking right now at the senate floor, they are kind of in a posture, a holding pattern right now waiting for the house to bring those over. chuck grassley is the president pro tem, the most senior member of the majority party and he is presiding, waiting for this message to be received in the senate. and then again, tomorrow is when we do this all again and the actual articles of impeachment plus the manager show up in the senate in a very similar fashion, brett."}
{"original": "baier: ok, getting ready to see this movement. people at home may say why is this important? well, it's only happened three times in the history of our country. let's listen in, not that there's much to hear, but let's listen in. that's clerk of the house cheryl johnson and house sergeant at arms, paul irving leading the way. martha mccallum, your thoughts?"}
{"original": "maccallum: well, you know, i'm just watching them walk through the rotunda here, bret, and thinking about the fact that, you know, regardless of the fact that this is a really purely partisan exercise here, just based on the votes that we saw. in fact, it's bipartisan only in the fact that you had a couple of republicans vote against what we're seeing play out here. but the rotunda is a place where, you know, you see so many important ceremonies over the course of history take place. it's statuary hall, it's where all of the statues of the founding fathers and other prominent americans are. it's where we see funerals at times as we see people lie in state. so you know, there is a lot of ceremony here and a lot of weight to what we're seeing -- what we're witnessing. and i was also struck by the fact that nancy pelosi said, we will make history and progress for the american people, which i think is an interesting choice of words in terms of progress. i think that democrats look at this period and wonder if in the election process, you know, people wonder what they accomplished in their time as a majority in the house. and she's characterizing this as progress and we'll see if the american people agree as we enter this really, you know, sort of busy period heading into the primaries here of how the american public will really receive all of this."}
{"original": "baier: speaking of the american public, you can come up to capitol hill and make the same walk from the house to the senate. there's places you can't go but for the walk, they're making with the sergeant at arms you can do, and also the impeachment managers falling behind adam schiff and jerry nadler leading the way of the impeachment managers. let's bring in harold ford again, former tennessee congressman. politically, harold, how do you think this falls as some of these polls are kind of upside down in swing states about how impeachment is going, how it's -- how it's working for democrats?"}
{"original": "harold ford jr., former congressman of tennessee: it doesn't look on the surface as you look at some of the battleground state polling, that anything move during the hearings before the committee, before the schiff committee and then before the nadler committee. so, it will be interesting to see that now that this has moved as dana and juan commented to a different process, probably more sterile and predictable and stale process when you consider how chaotic things were in the house. but i would remind everyone, there's no doubt this is a political exercise because impeachment is, but the facts here are ones that are very serious ones. the allegations are very, very serious. the accusations that the president of the united states called a foreign leader and ask that foreign leader for help in a political contest by investigating someone that he might -- that might be running against him this year."}
{"original": "baier: let me interrupt you here, harold. hold on one second."}
{"original": "cheryl johnson, clerk, united states house of representatives: -- of donald trump, president of the united states."}
{"original": "sen. chuck grassley (r-ia): the message will be received."}

{"original": "dana perino, fox news channel anchor: we're going to take it from here, fox news alert. thank you so much, bret. welcome to the five. breaking news on capitol hill. moments ago, speaker nancy pelosi signing the articles of impeachment against president trump. that move clearing the way for a trial that could start next tuesday. we're also learning who the house impeachment managers will be. pelosi breaking house intelligence chairman adam schiff, and house judiciary chairman jerry nadler to lead the team prosecuting the president. we know you want to hear from the five so i'm just going to turn it over to greg. he's got a few things on his mind."}
{"original": "greg gutfeld, fox news channel host: yes. i'm trying to control myself from swearing. that was a fricking ceremony. you have ceremonies to award medals. you have ceremonies at weddings and funerals. this was like a baptism at the addams family. did you notice they had a silver platter for the pens? everybody got a special party favorite, a little pen to take home. we are paying for those fricking pens and for that platter. and then you see the media taking pictures of the pens. oh look how special the pens are. that -- what that -- what you saw with that ceremony, they were spackling a turd with gold paint, right? and we're all suckers. we're all suckers for believing this is serious. we know it's a sham. it's -- they say it's historical or it's historic. that's b.s. all right. we know this was an emotional tantrum directed a daddy who won the election and they're mad at daddy. so we have to go through this phony procession. oh, let's show pictures of the cloakroom. oh, let's watch them walk down the halls. oh, this is breaking news. let's repeat it 25 times over and over again until i want to blow my brains out. look --"}
{"original": "perino: you're going to have a great time in the next two weeks."}
{"original": "gutfeld: if you're a viewer, ok, and you're watching this coverage, here's four things you got to remember. the media controls the narrative ok. look what happened to the five, right? you know, we -- they put the money in the jukebox, we got to dance. number two, the dems have been -- in the media been working on this for three years. so this isn't a moral cause. this was a political vocation meant to unseat an election. number three, they don't hate trump, they hate you. he's a proxy for you because you voted for him. they think you're a bunch of rubs because you didn't listen to the media. this is their revenge. and last but not least, you got to store all that anger. and when this is over, and when they lose, because they will, you got to rub their noses in their loss to the day they retire. thank you."}
{"original": "perino: we have 14 minutes left. jesse?"}
{"original": "watters: greg, here's a pen for you."}
{"original": "gutfeld: thank you. you don't know where i'm going to put this."}
{"original": "juan williams, fox news channel contributor: all right."}
{"original": "watters: this is all payback by hillary rodham clinton. she was supposed to win the election and donald trump ruined it. so this is revenge. it started with the insurance policy, trump sniffed it out, fires comey, mueller knows the whole time there's no collusion but he lets it hang over the midterms so the democrats win so they can sort up the impeachment. bill barr challenges mueller to show his cards. he's got nothing so the democrats panicked. they fired up this fake whistleblower deal, rig a very unfair trial against the president, but they rushed it. if they had gone to court and gotten the testimony they needed and gotten the evidence they needed, that would have been one thing. but they had to get it under the wire before christmas so nancy gets this half-baked impeachment, only two articles, no criminal violations. and then she runs into a brick wall in the senate. and mcconnell is like, you know, the teacher where it's like, time's up, everybody. pencils down. nancy is still scribbling. she ran out of time."}
{"original": "perino: look at all those pens."}
{"original": "watters: put the pencils -- put the pen down, nancy. she's got nothing. this is all designed to discredit donald trump for political revenge and because he was a businessman and came in and did a better job than a regular politician, and because the trump doctrine of america first poses a mortal threat to the democratic party. it busted down the blue wall, he outflanks them on trade, on everything else. and at this point, it looks like he's going to restrict immigration. so you have someone who comes in former democrat, a dealmaker, lives in manhattan his whole life, ready to make a deal. he agrees with them on infrastructure, on drug prices, on everything. you could have a golden age of bipartisanship, signing ceremonies instead of engrossment ceremonies, pens for everybody, but they don't do that. they spit in the president's face. so you know what he does instead? he goes, i'll do it myself. usmca papers china deal phase one, kills isis baghdadi. he starts running the table. he's like a guy at the casino. he's got a hot hand and everybody else is winning, because they're all at the roulette table, having drinks having a party, everyone's getting rich, but the democrats --"}
{"original": "gutfeld: they're playing (inaudible). they're in the (inaudible) room and they're losing."}
{"original": "watters: they want to arrest of the guy with a hot hand instead of joining the party, and having everybody get rich and happy. and that's why they're so pathetic."}
{"original": "perino: emily, i don't know how you're going to follow that, but i'll let you do it."}
{"original": "emily compagno, fox news channel contributor: i will not try to follow it - - no, i just want to -- i want to point out that it seems that when it suits the democrats, this is a trial. and when it doesn't, then oh, no, no, this isn't like anything that we have in the court of law. it's totally separate. it's just politics. and to take this out for a second, and just to illustrate perspective. if we did, in fact, have a trial in normal court of law, and an ongoing, simultaneous trial at the same time was a grand jury proceeding, and there were still evidence been gathered, and you could still add it into the trial, it would be preposterous. that would never happen. and i bring that up to say that as we speak, nadler says with complete finality and confidence that oh, of course, the senate will accept this new evidence, this bombshell testimony, everything that has to do with lev parnas and more as if it will change the game. and yet with all of the fact-finding mission that the house went through, the urgency, the import, the matter of national security, apparently it wasn't enough for them to get it in a timely fashion, nor was it enough for the four weeks that nancy pelosi hung on to these articles for her to have it and tidy it up."}
{"original": "so, at any point, this defendant, which is also the president of the united states, might be slammed with an additional article of impeachment, apparently, or more evidence that the senate is just supposed to take. i find that patently against the constitution because what we usually stand for and constitutionally is one of due process and a fair procedure that we can depend on. and to me, that's the largest mockery, that's it that's in place right now. and one more quick thing. you know, everyone acts that -- just a reminder that it's chief justice roberts who's in charge moving forward, and that this is his show moving forward."}
{"original": "perino: it's supposed to be ceremonial though for him."}
{"original": "compagno: but he still has -- he has final say over the rules. and the senate has a short amount of time to get their act together, but it's he who can make game-changing decisions. so it looks -- i mean, we'll see whether he optimizes that role."}
{"original": "perino: what do you think about -- you know, so here's the thing. as much as it might annoy everybody, it is happening. so given that it is happening, what do you think about what i was saying with bret baier that mitch mcconnell, he's just a creature of the senate. he loves the senate. so he's going to make this boring, calm, sterile, and i think about -- what about that tactic rather than making it firing?"}
{"original": "gutfeld: i think -- well, i think it's a great tactic, but i always go back to i'm like a viewer. i'm sitting here just like going -- if it's boring, i'm going to go crazy, if it's exciting, i don't want to watch this. why is this happening? the answer was last night when you saw the debates. the democrats and the media realized they can't win with that selection that they had from last night. this is their election replacement supplement. it's their testosterone patch. and the worst part about it is we are paying these people. they're on the clock. and they're indulging this emotional revenge on our dime. shouldn't that mean that we have a right to save super awful things about them? aren't we allowed because we're paying them to get something out of it by making fun of them every day and ridiculing them and mocking them, because they deserve it, because they're taking our money and they're spending on this undermining our country?"}
{"original": "compagno: can we talk about --"}
{"original": "williams: when people say these nasty things about republicans, you guys go through the roof?"}
{"original": "williams: but i'm just going to say this. i think that it's important that we have just witnessed here on the five the rage from the right over this impeachment process. but what about the reality that the president tried to use his office to get political dirt on an opponent, and we continue to see evidence coming in that this was taking place in terms of even surveillance of the u.s. ambassador that potentially was threatening to her life."}
{"original": "gutfeld: it's part of the job."}
{"original": "williams: so to me -- part of the job, that's right. the president of the united states is involved in threatening an american ambassador."}
{"original": "williams: so you can't say -- you can't say the evidence is weak especially with the track record of trump obstruction, one of the articles of impeachment."}
{"original": "williams: and the fact that he was saying people don't testify -- don't testify, don't send the documents over. if he's so innocent, aren't you curious? why not just have people testify? why not put it on the table?"}
{"original": "gutfeld: if he's guilty, why is he acting like an innocent person?"}
{"original": "williams: innocent person? an innocent person says let everyone testify. here's the proof."}
{"original": "gutfeld: that certainly helped in this process."}
{"original": "watters: juan, if you're accused of a crime, you're not taking the stand. you know what i mean?"}
{"original": "watters: you put up a good defense. and in this country, you're innocent until proven guilty."}
{"original": "williams: i think bill clinton --"}
{"original": "watters: even the president of the united states."}
{"original": "williams: did bill clinton take the stand? bill clinton testified."}
{"original": "watters: bill clinton was actually convicted of felonies, felonies."}
{"original": "watters: not donald trump, not donald."}
{"original": "watters: those were agreed upon crime."}
{"original": "watters: felonies. he was actually disbarred practicing law, juan."}
{"original": "williams: excuse me. you must missed the history. bill clinton was not convicted by the senate."}
{"original": "watters: bill clinton was convicted and accused felonies by the special counsel."}
{"original": "williams: you know, this is the --"}
{"original": "watters: and that was the truth of what happened in the 1990."}
{"original": "williams: this is how people start marching in trump lockstep."}
{"original": "watters: this president hasn't even been accused of a felony."}
{"original": "williams: oh stop. obstruction -- abuse of power in terms of bribery --"}
{"original": "watters: it's not a criminal charge, juan. and they didn't even float the bribery article --"}
{"original": "watters: the guys couldn't hack it."}
{"original": "watters: they couldn't hack it. they didn't have the goods and they failed. and that's why you've been sitting around this desk for the last couple weeks, pouting and moaning. because if you are in a good mood, because you know what justice would be done."}
{"original": "williams: no, it's because you are here. i couldn't listen. i could listen to all this flack."}
{"original": "watters: but our viewers is smiling because they know the end to the story. we know he's acquitted and we know he's reelected."}
{"original": "williams: here's why i was pounding. it's january and i was waiting for your snow job. i was waiting for you to come in with this nonsense."}
{"original": "watters: well, there's global warming, williams, and were not getting any snow."}
{"original": "williams: well, i just think if he's so innocent, why don't you say bring it on, bring all the evidence. instead, you're up here, stonewall."}
{"original": "watters: you do the investigation in the house and then you try it in the senate. you had your shot in the house. you failed. let the senate adjudicate."}
{"original": "williams: because we have a president who's acting like a monarch --"}
{"original": "watters: you can change the rules, juan."}
{"original": "gutfeld: that is an opinion, it is not fact."}
{"original": "williams: it is. it's an opinion that he obstructed justice?"}
{"original": "gutfeld: all of this is based on opinion. every problem that you have with trump is based on i don't like his personality. he's mean, he's obnoxious."}
{"original": "williams: he's told people don't testify, don't present --"}
{"original": "perino: can i play a sound bite just for a moment."}
{"original": "perino: so, this is jerry nadler, this is the c block intro soundbite number one. control room, if you can find that for me. so this is -- this whole issue like should there be witnesses or should there not. this is chairman nadler's position on hunter biden."}
{"original": "rep. jerry nadler (d-ny): any witness who has information about whether that is true or not true is irrelevant witness. anybody like hunter biden who was no information about any of that, is not a relevant witness."}
{"original": "perino: so there you go. and they keep -- the position on the democrats will be that they don't -- they might want certain witnesses but they don't want hunter biden."}
{"original": "williams: but there's a difference between material and imitate."}
{"original": "perino: i know. i'm asking the lawyer."}
{"original": "compagno: right. and that's partly why -- first of all, this hasn't changed. this position hasn't changed this entire time. the democrats wanted to neuter the gop's presentation in defense of calling witnesses. and to this entire time, they argue it's immaterial and the gop argues it is material. so ultimately, it seems to me that their strategy would be yes, let's get - - let's get everyone in here. let's get everyone in here. everyone should be committed to the highest level of transparency because both sides are arguing the information and the facts should be construed in their favor. but we're going to see. i mean, the whole bottom line is --"}
{"original": "perino: i don't think -- i don't think that collins and murkowski will be bullied into saying that there should be witnesses because collins already signaled today that the house did an incomplete job. i do want to ask you about this, greg."}
{"original": "perino: you had this great monologue set up for the debate last night."}
{"original": "gutfeld: yes, but we're going to use it tomorrow because i never throw anything away."}
{"original": "perino: so in the meantime, klobuchar --"}
{"original": "perino: -- sanders, and warren, all three senators are like they're going to have to come off the campaign trail right 10 days before iowa, sit there in the senate, not being able to say anything. is that a good idea?"}
{"original": "gutfeld: well, it doesn't help them but it might help -- it might help biden. that's what --"}
{"original": "gutfeld: look, the good news here is you've never seen a wider disconnect between reality and media. in reality, you have probably the most prosperous peaceful time in recent history. in decades, you have 29,000 stock market that's going to go higher. meanwhile, the media is pushing impeachment as though the apocalypse is coming. and i think that america is smart enough that they're seeing this chasm. it can't be covered up anymore. it's too wide. and that's what you see in the -- in the list of things that are being trusted, hollywood is the least trusted, slightly above that is the media. and i would actually think i trust hollywood over the media at this point."}
{"original": "perino: what do you think about the debate last night? did you have a chance to watch?"}
{"original": "watters: i did. i missed the (inaudible). i want to go back. i was completely bored by it. i thought it was flat. i guess bernie had a good night. he's the only one with a little charisma. but i mean, he makes absolutely no sense when he talks about anything to do with money. biden, for someone that's been in politics for 30 or 40 years, he seems befuddled by the basic elements of policy like health care, which should be his signature deal, obamacare. he could just drop the hammer on these socialists on the stage and say, let's just expand obamacare. medicare for all is crazy. let's move on, but he doesn't, because he doesn't have the skills and he's not sharp enough. and then the liz warren thing, man, she was so weak she had to play the gender card. i don't think it came off well. it's all she's got. she's fallen in the polls so she had to throw that out there."}
{"original": "perino: what do you think about bernie sanders?"}
{"original": "watters: it made her look small. and the moderators --"}
{"original": "watters: the moderators, in a he said she said, the moderators just side with she without even knowing what happens."}
{"original": "williams: well, this is interesting because this place to what greg talks about in terms of media because i think cnn in terms of its reporting said, we know that bernie said this to elizabeth warren, even though bernie said i didn't say it. and in terms of me as the audience, wants to hear her have to argue with bernie about his flat denial. i think that was unfair to bernie. but it's telling -- it's telling that you are able to see at this table that republicans have taken bernie side in this argument."}
{"original": "gutfeld: oh, yes, because i think --"}
{"original": "watters: you know when someone is getting (inaudible) by the press, juan."}
{"original": "williams: no, because you know, like president trump knows, he thinks anyway, not knows. but he thinks bernie is more easily defeated than joe biden. and even elizabeth warren who said, can a woman win, and she says, yes, look at the women on this stage. they are the ones who beat a republican."}
{"original": "perino: it was just a matter of fairness. and i think that you even saw liberals say that bernie was treated unfairly."}
{"original": "williams: that's what i just said. i just think you got to treat the guy at his word. give him --"}
{"original": "perino: well, it was pretty obvious, like the senator was saying. all right, so, that was a lot of fun."}
{"original": "perino: and it's -- it really was. that's it for us. you're going to set your dvrs because you're never going to miss an episode of the five. special --"}

{"original": "a federal judge in washington blocked specific medicaid work requirements in arkansas and kentucky on wednesday, though he stopped short of deciding whether any work requirements are incompatible with the program's mission to provide health care to underprivileged people."}
{"original": "u.s. district judge james e. boasberg ruled that the department of health and human services' approval of the arkansas work requirement was arbitrary and capricious because it did not address ... whether and how the project would implicate the 'core' objective of medicaid: the provision of medical coverage to the needy. the obama-appointed judge invoked similar language in his ruling on the kentucky requirement."}
{"original": "work requirements are already in effect in arkansas, but kentucky's program has been on hold because of lawsuits. both states want able-bodied adults who get health insurance through obamacare's medicaid expansion to work, study, volunteer or participate in community engagement activities."}
{"original": "kentucky republican gov. matt bevin said his state would appeal. bevin has threatened to end kentucky's medicaid expansion covering more than 400,000 people if work requirements are ultimately struck down."}
{"original": "congressional republicans rattled by trump's pivot to obamacare fight"}
{"original": "we have one guy in washington who thinks he owns kentucky, said bevin, apparently referring to the judge. we're right, and we'll be right in the end. and one guy can gum up the works if he wants, for a while, but this, too, shall pass."}
{"original": "arkansas gov. asa hutchinson, also a republican, said he was disappointed by the decision and would publicly address it on thursday."}
{"original": "the gop leader of the arkansas senate said he doesn't believe the ruling jeopardizes the future of medicaid expansion, which covers more than 200,000 residents. about 18,000 have lost coverage as a result of the work requirements."}
{"original": "i don't think there's any reason for the state to panic, said senate president jim hendren, who's also the governor's nephew. this is another obstacle in our path to try to do the best we can in arkansas with the chips the federal government and the judiciary gives us."}
{"original": "states are traditionally allowed broad leeway to set medicaid benefits and eligibility. overall, medicaid is the government's largest health insurance program, covering about one in five americans, ranging from many pregnant women and infants to severely disabled people and elderly nursing home residents."}
{"original": "advocates for the poor say that medicaid is a health care program and that work requirements have no place in it."}
{"original": "it is nonsensical and illegal to add obstacles to medicaid for large groups of individuals who are already working, or full-time health care providers for family members, or suffering chronic health matters, said jane perkins, legal director of the national health law program, a nonprofit that sued the government."}
{"original": "work should not be a key to health care access."}
{"original": "the trump administration isn't giving up, said the head of the centers for medicare and medicaid services."}
{"original": "we will continue to defend our efforts to give states greater flexibility to help low-income americans rise out of poverty, seema verma said in a statement. we believe, as have numerous past administrations, that states are the laboratories of democracy and we will vigorously support their innovative, state-driven efforts to develop and test reforms that will advance the objectives of the medicaid program."}
{"original": "president trump supports work requirements for public programs across the government. last year, he signed an executive order directing cabinet agencies to add or strengthen work requirements for programs including subsidized housing, food stamps and cash welfare."}
{"original": "hhs had already acted. early in the administration, top officials invited states to apply for waivers that would allow medicaid work requirements. verma says she believes work is important to improving the health and well-being of medicaid recipients."}

{"original": "and yesterday, reports are, an even larger caravan is staging in honduras about to cause an even greater burden on our border patrol and the system at large. the president has shown he is capable of negotiating."}
{"original": "he has gone from a concrete wall to a steel slat barrier, willing to go with any barrier, any physical barrier that you cannot climb, over crawl under, rappel or shoot yourself out of a cannon over. he's made concessions from $25 billion to $5 billion, from a concrete barrier to a steel one promising more personnel, detention beds, using technology and electronics to buttress the security and money to address the humanitarian needs."}

{"original": "pirro: i have a solution. there is no question that president trump has the authority to declare a national emergency. the controlling case is youngstown sheet and tube versus sawyer; 343u.s. 579. the critical operational issue is that only money already authorized and appropriated by congress can be spent. the only serious source of funds are in the military construction bill."}
{"original": "this week, there was some debate whether that money would come from a line item of $13.1 billion covering housing in afghanistan and iraq or a $13.9 billion line for disaster relief."}
{"original": "now clearly, the $13.1 billion should be the line used since i doubt we need to build homes in afghanistan and iraq, but now expect the democrats to go forum-shopping if that happens in california where the appeal goes directly to the liberal 9th circus circuit if the president declares an emergency using the military construction funds."}
{"original": "assume they will win, but not on appeal to the supreme court of the united states, they will lose under youngstown, so the only question now is whether or not this is a national emergency and if you don't think another caravan of thousands moving in a highly organized fashion similar to military convoys with an advanced party, a main body in a rear party that has exhibited violence along the way with migrants in addition to those from central america from africa, pakistan, yemen, afghanistan, india, bangladesh, nepal and more is a national emergency, then you're out and out crazy."}
{"original": "the president has been sitting in the oval office since christmas eve. he is ready. if the democrats aren't coming to the table, the time to declare a national emergency is now and that's my open. if you like my opening statements, you'll love my new book, new york times number one bestseller liars, leakers and liberals: the case against the anti-trump conspiracy."}

{"original": "pirro: thank you so much for joining us tonight. is there an emergency at the southern border? should we not now use the emergency funds and the powers that you have in your possession?"}
{"original": "trump: so we have a humanitarian crisis to put it mildly. people are trying to get in by the tens of thousands. they're rushing the border. there's right now in honduras, a country we pay a lot of money to, i think foolishly because they don't help us, but right now, you have another caravan forming and it's going to be the biggest one yet."}
{"original": "we stopped the last one. you see what's going on in tijuana. they couldn't get through because we have a wall there. we've got a wall up. the military has been fantastic. border patrol has been incredible and ice is you know, these are brave people that do a great job and we stopped them."}
{"original": "but there's another big one forming, we need a wall very simple, whether you call it a steel barrier or wall, it doesn't matter, but we need a very strong structure."}
{"original": "pirro: but by waiting to build a wall or using those funds that are available to you in a national emergency, aren't you negating the point of the emergency itself?"}
{"original": "trump: well, i have the absolute right to call a national emergency. other presidents have called many national emergencies for things of lesser importance, frankly than this and i have the right to do it."}
{"original": "i'd rather see that democrats come back from their vacation and act. they're not acting and they're the ones that are holding it up. it would take me 15 minutes to get a deal done and everybody could go back to work, but i'd like to see them act responsibly and they're not acting responsibly and that's it. we could be - i'm in the white house and most of them are in different locations."}
{"original": "they're watching a certain musical in a very nice location."}
{"original": "pirro: of course, in puerto rico, watching hamilton."}
{"original": "trump: frankly, it's ridiculous. the whole thing is ridiculous. we have a very important thing to do. we have to have border security and we have to get people getting paid again very quickly."}
{"original": "pirro: but what about as this happens, look you were in the white house during the christmas holidays and over new year's and you've been there ever since. nancy pelosi is in hawaii over the holidays, and now she's in puerto rico with a bunch of democrats and lobbyists, you know, enjoying the sun and partying down there."}
{"original": "but what makes you think that these people are willing to cut a deal if you have shown your ability to negotiate by changing to a slat, agreeing to all of their demands as it relates to you know, technology, electronic, fencing and all of the other things, the humanitarian aid. they sit there. they don't even look you in the eye. what makes you think that they're going - in any way cave because if these people said 13 and again, six years ago, we need a wall, we need a wall, but now you're the president, they don't want a wall? what makes you think they're coming back?"}
{"original": "trump: well, they might not. i mean you know, frankly i was willing to do something and we're asking for $5.6 billion which is way less than what other presidents have been talking about."}
{"original": "you know, if you look back, this should have been done 30 years ago, 20 years ago, 10 years ago. this should have been done by others just like if you look at jerusalem, if you look at the embassy moving to jerusalem, every president promised that, they never did it. i did it. you look at so many other things that i've done, we're doing well with a lot of - you know, we're doing well with china, we're doing well with north korea. you know, i was left a very tough hand, but this was one of the problems, it's our southern border."}
{"original": "and it's you know, thousands and thousands of people are coming in and we have human smugglers. we have traffickers. we have people - the biggest drug dealers in the world and they're pouring through the parts of the border. they don't go through your areas where you have a port of entry."}
{"original": "trump: jeanine, they go through areas where you don't have any protection whatsoever and it's really very sad and very, very dangerous and very bad for our country. a lot of crime comes from that location."}
{"original": "pirro: you know, i interviewed ron vitiello, the acting director of ice and he said that there was enough fentanyl seized by them last year that could kill every american in this country. we know that 90 percent of the heroin comes through the southern border and you know what we also know is that there are 800,000 federal employees who didn't get a check yesterday."}
{"original": "you're sitting there waiting for a deal, the democrats are not sitting with you. if this isn't an emergency, i don't know what is."}
{"original": "trump: well, i haven't actually left the white house in months and in all fairness, i'm doing a lot of other work. it's not just that, but that's a very important element of what i'm doing because we have to get the southern border done and i've been here virtually every night."}
{"original": "i guess every night other than one day, i flew to iraq and then to germany to see our troops and it was great to see them. it was great. the level of love they have for this country is incredible, so i flew and then came back. i'm not even sure i actually missed a night per se, but basically i've been here for many months in the white house and you know, i'm a worker. i am like you. i am a worker."}
{"original": "pirro: i know. you are a worker."}
{"original": "trump: and frankly, i'm ready, willing and able to get a deal done, but they don't say - they think it's politics. i think it's bad politics. this country wants to have protection at the border."}
{"original": "many of our crimes, much of ms-13 comes through the border, drugs - a big proportion of the drugs from that we have from this country, in this country come through the border. the human trafficking where they tie women up, they put duct tape over their mouths, electrical tape and they bring them in. they traffic in women and children, and they come through the border."}
{"original": "the areas that i'm talking about, putting a wall, we do that, it can't happen anymore. it's unbelievable. it's only politics, that's the game they're playing. i actually think it's bad politics for them."}
{"original": "pirro: so then, you know, when nancy pelosi won, you very warmly in november congratulated her and are you still confident you can get a deal done with her or has that ship sailed?"}
{"original": "trump: no idea. no idea. well, we won also. you know, we won the senate."}
{"original": "trump: and you know, there are those that would say that the senate is more important and for the most part, i campaigned for the senate. and we got very little credit for that like even you, you just said they won, we won the senate. we actually picked up additional seats. we beat incumbents - democrats - and almost everywhere i went, we won."}
{"original": "but you know, i'm one person and the house had many races and yet, we won some great races where i went. but we won the senate, jeanine, we picked up two additional seats. it's 53-47. it was 51-49."}
{"original": "pirro: all right, so for the last time, given that they don't seem to want to come to the table that you have done all the negotiating, why not declare --"}
{"original": "trump: well, that might happen, but i want to give them a chance to see if they can act responsibly. they should act responsibly. we're talking about the border and i have to say, a lot of the people that aren't getting their checks, are letting us know we don't care. you've got to solve the crisis at the border. it's a humanitarian crisis and it's national security. it's very important."}
{"original": "pirro: okay and it's interesting, that's what i heard yesterday from some of the border patrol agents. now, i want to move on to another subject. new york times reported that the fbi opened a counterintelligence investigation the day after you fired james comey in may of '17, and the investigation was whether you were actively working for russia or unwittingly, so i'm going to ask you, are you now or have you ever worked for russia, mr. president?"}
{"original": "trump: i think it's the most insulting thing i've ever been asked. i think it's the most insulting article i've ever had written and if you read the article, you'd see that they found absolutely nothing, but the headline of that article, it's called the failing new york times for a reason. they've gotten me wrong for three years. they've actually gotten me wrong for many years before that."}
{"original": "but you look at what's going on, you know, i fired james comey, i call him lying james comey because he was a terrible liar and he did a terrible job as the fbi director. look at what happened with hillary clinton and the e-mails and the hillary clinton investigation. one of the biggest screw-ups that anybody's ever seen as an investigation."}
{"original": "and what happened after i fired him, andrew mccabe, peter strzok his lover, lisa page, they did it and you know, they're all gone. most of those people, many, many people from the top ranks of the fbi, they've all been fired or they had to leave and they are all gone."}
{"original": "this is what they were talking about and obviously, nothing was found and i can tell you this, if you ask the folks in russia, i've been tougher on russia than anybody else, any other - probably any of the president period. but certainly the last three or four presidents, modern-day presidents, nobody's been as tough as i have from any standpoint including the fact that we're doing oil like we've never done it. we're setting records in our country with oil and exporting oil and many other things."}
{"original": "so which is obviously not great for them because that's what they - that's where they their money for the most part, but many other things, so i think it was a great insult and the new york times is a disaster as a paper. it's a very horrible thing they said and they've gone so far than people that were necessary believers are now big believers because they said that was a step too far. they really are a disaster of a newspaper."}
{"original": "pirro: well you know when you think about it, the people that were involved in that or all of the people have since been fired are gone whether it's strzoik, page mccabe and also the steele dossier."}
{"original": "but the washington post i should say is following up reporting that you went to unusual lengths to keep your conversations with president putin under wraps. why not release the conversation that you had with president putin in helsinki along with some other stuff that might involve the fisa, bruce ohr and the whole lot of them?"}
{"original": "trump: well, jeannine i would. i don't care. i mean i had a conversation like every president does. you sit with the president of various countries. i do it with all countries. we had a great conversation. we were talking about israel and securing israel and lots of other things and it was a great conversation. i'm not keeping anything under wraps. i couldn't care less."}
{"original": "i mean it's so ridiculous. these people make it up. washington post that's basically the lobbyists for amazon you know. he uses that. bezos, who's got the bigger problems than anybody right now, but bezos uses that as his lobbyists, okay as far as i'm concerned and the washington post is almost as bad, they're probably as bad as the new york times."}
{"original": "think of it, i have a one-on-one meeting with putin like i do with every other leader. i have many one-on-one, nobody ever says anything about it. but with putin, they say oh, what did they talk about? we talked about very positive things because look, we are beating everybody. our economy is the strongest in the world right now, jeanine. nobody even close."}
{"original": "china is down 38 percent. russia is not doing well with its economy. most countries are not doing well. we're doing phenomenally even though we're paying interest rates because we're normalizing, you know, obama had zero interest. anybody can do that and our economy is now better than ever. we're almost at our high with the stock market again, so it's really - can you imagine where they say that i met with putin. i met with every leader end of - just about individually."}
{"original": "i meet with modi. i meet with - in japan, i meet with abe. i meet with all of them, but nobody says i did, but i mean with putin, and they make a big deal. anybody could have listened to that meeting. that meeting is open for grabs."}
{"original": "you know, the whole russia thing, it's a hoax. it's a terrible hoax. you know it probably better than -- you, gregg jarrett, dan bongino -- people that look at it, it's a total hoax. everybody knows it and it's really a shame because it takes time and it takes effort. everybody knows there was no collusion whatsoever. they have found no collusion and they won't find collusion because i had nothing to do - i was a better candidate than hillary clinton. she was a terrible candidate and the fact is, i was obviously a good candidate."}
{"original": "i won every debate. i won everything i did and i won and i won easily, 306 to 223, i believe and that's a big difference in the college - in the electoral college, but it's really - it's really a shame, jeanine. it really is a shame. it's such a waste of time."}
{"original": "pirro: it is a shame. it is a waste of time. it's a waste of energy, and you know, some people have to say to themselves, how can you deal with all of this? this new york times article to be absolutely truthful with you just seems to be another rehash of the same players and the same arguments and the same dossier, you know, just to keep it going and they'll keep it going as long as they can. what keeps you going?"}
{"original": "i mean, you've got such fight in you, it is unbelievable."}
{"original": "trump: well, i guess i have good genes because you know, somebody said the other day, no president should have to go through what you're going through mr. president because i'm going through all of this nonsense. it's all nonsense. but i have to be careful because these are dirty players. they're no good and you got the mueller investigation, you've got all this nonsense. there's no collusion, no nothing."}
{"original": "and you know, they say this should never happen again, never again should this happen and that's the story, but despite that, we've done more than any other administration by far in the first two years."}
{"original": "pirro: all right, and now of course a little added shift as you call them is going to be dragging in and -- jerry nadler, going be dragging in michael cohen, an already proven liar to congress convicted of it, you know, are you worried that he is going to --"}
{"original": "trump: no, look, i was a client of his and you know, he's supposed to have lawyer to client privilege, but it doesn't matter because i'm a very honest person, frankly, but he's in trouble on some loans and fraud and taxicabs and stuff ..."}
{"original": "trump: ... that i know nothing about, and in order to get a sentence reduced, he says, i have an idea, i'll tell - i'll give you some information on the president. well there is no information, but he should give information maybe on his father-in-law, because that's the one that people want to look at because where does that money - that's the money in the family."}
{"original": "and i guess he didn't want to talk about his father-in-law. he's trying to get his sentence reduced so it's pretty sad, you know, he's weak and it's very sad to watch a thing like that. i couldn't care less."}
{"original": "pirro: what is his father-in-law's name?"}
{"original": "trump: i don't know, but you'll find out and you'll look into it because nobody knows what's going on over there. again, i was a client. i was a client. he has a law firm. they broke into his law firm sometime early in the morning, i guess, and they took - this couldn't happen to anybody, except you're dealing with mccabe, you're dealing with the remnants of comey and wait until you see how it all ends up. you watch -- mccabe, lisa page, strzok -- you wait until you see how that all ends up, including some others that i could name, but i better not, we'll make front-page your news if i do."}
{"original": "pirro: i can't wait to read it. will you release the fisa? we're all waiting for the fisa. that will give us --"}
{"original": "trump: well, at the right time, we will probably do that. if that's necessary, we'll do that. you know, that's very, very important stuff."}
{"original": "trump: and you know, as you know a lot of bad things happened when a lot of elements of what we're talking about and at the right time, we will probably do that. that's right."}
{"original": "pirro: all right and my - are your lawyers working to keep the muller report from being made public?"}
{"original": "trump: well, i can't tell you because i don't devote too much time. here's the bottom line. there was no collusion. there was no obstruction. there was no anything. so you know, no calls to russia. no nothing. so you know, it's all nonsense, jeanine. it's all nonsense. it's a hoax. it's called the russian hoax or - you know, it's a witch hunt and it's a shame and you know, despite that, what we're doing is amazing."}
{"original": "but actually what we're doing in this, too, because we're exposing people that are corrupt. people are being exposed by this that are totally corrupt. a lot of the people that don't get mentioned even in that article today, the phony article in the new york times there's a lot of corruption and we're exposing it."}
{"original": "and i'm going to put that down someday as one of my greatest achievements."}
{"original": "pirro: well, i look forward to hearing that and i guess, one last question, mr. president, when are you going to get out of the white house. i mean, washington after while gets very depressing."}
{"original": "trump: well, i love it and i love this building and i do a lot work in the building and if you look at what we're doing on the deal with china, which nobody was able to take on and we're taking it on great, we're doing an incredible deal for our country. you look at iran, when i ended the iran nuclear deal, look at what happened to iran. it's a different country than it was when i came here two years ago."}
{"original": "trump: and all of the trade deals we're making with mexico and by the way, mexico is paying for the wall because the trade deal is billions and billions of dollars better than the old nafta trade deal and i call that -- mexico is absolutely paying for the wall."}
{"original": "so i mean, we're doing a great job and i like doing it and then we get involved with the russian hoax or you know, whatever you call it."}
{"original": "trump: you know, it's one of those things, but i love doing it, the whole thing. but this will turn out to be very important because people are going to be exposed that nobody ever thought possible."}
{"original": "pirro: well, i look forward to that and i have to ask you another post last question, you're hearing about all these people looking to run against you in 2020, your thoughts?"}
{"original": "trump: i'm not worried. so far i love the competition. i love what i see. i love what i say, you know, a couple of them aren't running that i was hoping we're going to run. they just announced yesterday that they weren't running. i was sort of looking forward to that, but you're going to have probably 30 people, close to 30 people maybe more. i heard as many as 32 and i see nobody in fact i, guess bruce springsteen, moore, all these guys are saying we're not going to beat him again. we're not going to ... so they're all going around saying --"}
{"original": "and then look, we're doing too well. if anybody beat me, we have the greatest unemployment and employment numbers that we've ever had in the country."}
{"original": "pirro: that's right. that's right - who would ..."}
{"original": "trump: african-american, hispanic-american, asian-american -- the overall number, historically the best numbers we've ever had. the economy is the best economy we've ever had. more people are working today, jeanine, in our country that have ever worked in our country before."}
{"original": "i don't know how does somebody beat that? we have great trade deals. i cut taxes down to the lowest number that they've been in many years, bigger than the ronald reagan tax cuts. we have anwr. we got rid of the individual mandate on this horrible obamacare, which will end up taking care of, watch what's going to happen there."}
{"original": "so you know, we're doing a good job, and i think people see it."}
{"original": "pirro: who is the one person that you would really like to run against?"}
{"original": "trump: well, i don't want to pick any one out, but you know, a lot of people say biden's doing okay, but you know, he was always a one-percenter. he was a one-percent guy. he ran two or three times. he never got above 1 percent and then obama came along and took him off the trash heap, then he became a vice president and now he's probably leading."}
{"original": "but he's basically a 1 percent guy. he's weak. so we'll see what happens with him, but i think he's leading right now from what i understand, but i'll be watching and whoever it is, i think we're going to do just fine."}
{"original": "pirro: mr. president, i really hope you get out of the white house. i really do. i think you deserve a vacation."}
{"original": "trump: well, i like the symbol. i'll be honest i like the symbol of being here, you know, to be totally honest with you. i mean, your audience knows i'm a straight shooter. i like the symbol of me being here and then being at some play in a nice location, having a good time."}
{"original": "i like that symbol because i am ready to sign and they're not, and they're not. so we'll see what happens and if they don't do it, if they don't come to their senses, you know what i'll do, i'll do a national emergency. we're all set. it's a hundred percent and i'll have to do that, but honestly, we shouldn't have to."}
{"original": "but you know what, jeanine, they're going to want something from me someday. very important, because i have to sign everything. everything has to go through the white house. mitch mcconnell and the republicans have done an incredible job and they have stuck together like glue. we have tremendous support."}
{"original": "but you know, they're going to want something from us, for one of their favorite little deals and all of a sudden, they're going to find out, it's going to be very, very tough for them. we need security at the southern border for our country."}
{"original": "pirro: well, i'll tell you, mr. president, when you reference the viewers, the justice viewers, they are behind you a hundred percent. mr. president --"}
{"original": "trump: thank you very much, jeanine. that's nice."}
{"original": "pirro: thank you for being with us tonight. we are very grateful."}
{"original": "trump: thank you, jeanine. thank you very much."}
{"original": "pirro: all right, so much to discuss. congressman jim jordan, dan bongino, kevin mccarthy -- here tonight to react to my interview with the president and next, i'll talk live with house minority leader kevin mccarthy, the president's comments, the shutdown, the new york times bombshell on the fbi. we will touch on everything. don't go away."}
{"original": "lauren blanchard, correspondent: live from america's news headquarters, i'm lauren blanchard. thousands of yellow vest protesters gather in france for a ninth straight weekend. paris authorities arrested more than 120 people, but said, a majority of demonstrators were peaceful. the protest began months ago in response to new fuel taxes from french president, emmanuel macron. the government backed off those taxes, but the protesters are now focused on broader issues of economic hardship."}
{"original": "a mass drug overdose in chico, california leaves one person dead and 12 others in the hospital. police chief mike o'brien says the powerful opiate, fentanyl, was the cause."}

{"original": "blanchard: i'm lauren blanchard, now back to justice with judge jeanine."}
{"original": "pirro: welcome back on this very busy night of breaking news. you just heard president trump right here on justice discussing the latest on the border crisis and here to react to that and more, minority leader kevin mccarthy joins me now. good evening, congressman mccarthy. you heard the interview with the president?"}
{"original": "rep. kevin mccarthy, r-calif., house minority leader: yes, i did. i thought he did a very good job."}
{"original": "pirro: and what is your take on the issue of the border and how the democrats are handling it given especially that schumer has voted for a border fence eight times, pelosi has voted for a border fence, the way the democrats are behaving in the meetings with the meetings with the president, what's your opinion?"}
{"original": "mccarthy: look, i've been in all these meetings and i've watched the president, even when you listened tonight, he was calm, just answered the questions. i watched him in these meetings. he's made offer after offer. the only people in these meetings that have not made a counteroffer are the democrats."}
{"original": "the democrats said they're for border security, but who in america believes that border security would not include some form of a barrier? we know that works. we know there is a crisis on the southern end. you know who else said there was a crisis on the southern end of our border? barack obama - who's voted for fencing. barack obama, hillary clinton, biden, nancy pelosi - twice, but now because it's president trump, they're allowing their own political bias to enter in this for those extreme levels of the democratic party to stop anything from moving, and this is causing real damage."}
{"original": "there's 800,000 of americans who didn't get a paycheck because nancy pelosi will not compromise. she will not even put an offer on the table and they've been in power and what have they done? every week, they've been in power, the government shutdown. they adjourn instead of staying here and solving the problem."}
{"original": "pirro: well, you know, congressman, the amazing part of it all is that it's almost as though the illegals are more important to them than the american citizens, than the safety and sovereignty of this country."}
{"original": "mccarthy: well what's very concerning to me, they'd rather have open borders than an open government. we have sat inside these rooms and when we had our first meeting in the situation room, to just get the facts on the southern border. the minute secretary nielsen from homeland security went to speak, nancy - speaker pelosi and senator schumer interrupt, will not let her talk because they don't want to hear the facts."}
{"original": "three or four meetings in, when we finally get the facts out, she says, i just do not believe them. i thought the secretary was very strong. she goes, ma'am, those are just the facts. and what's most interesting is when we first started these meetings, speaker pelosi could not actually discuss it because she wasn't elected speaker yet."}
{"original": "then when she gets elected speaker, the president even in the last meeting offered her what she wanted. he said, he turned to her and he said, okay, nancy, if i open up the government in 30 days, could we have border security? she said, not at all."}
{"original": "that's why he got up and left because they will not even go one minute of compromise and the president has moved from a from a concrete wall to a steel slat. i mean, he has moved and you've heard democrats say they would support part of the wall part."}
{"original": "pirro: part of the wall, absolutely. i ran several - the sound of them, but the amazing part of this thing is that if the american people 800,000 are not getting a paycheck and if 90 percent of the heroin in this country and i don't know what percentage of fentanyl is coming from the southern border and we know that there are gang members coming through, why isn't the american public onto the fact that they don't care about the american people? that if chuck schumer can't eyeball the president, he can't even look in his eyes and they come out smiling and smirking that you know, the american people need to get what's going on here."}
{"original": "mccarthy: what the american people have to understand, because of the rules of the senate, you need 60 votes, so this shutdown would have never taken place unless senator schumer decided he would not provide the ten votes because the house when the republicans were in the majority, sent a compromise over to the senate that gave $5.6 billion in border security."}
{"original": "schumer said no, so we went into a shutdown. the president stayed here to solve it and where did the democrats go? just like they went this weekend, they don't want to come back to the table and the president is right. we could solve this in 15 to 20 minutes, it would be over and we'll compromise, too."}
{"original": "i will work with any american that wants to put us - move america forward and actually secure our border and open this government up."}
{"original": "pirro: all right, i've got 20 seconds, minority leader, how does this end?"}
{"original": "mccarthy: well, how it should and how our government is designed that we find compromise on both sides. we secure our border just as president obama said there was a crisis and we see that there's a crisis today that you have to have for border security, yes, some barrier along there."}
{"original": "we've seen it work in san diego, el paso, yuma. we know that it works and we know we need a part of that and i appreciate the president being strong and staying and making it happen."}
{"original": "pirro: we appreciate your being here, minority leader kevin mccarthy. thanks so much."}
{"original": "pirro: all right, dan bongino still ahead, but next congressman jim jordan with his take on my exclusive interview with president trump and just what this new information about the fbi and the investigation into the president really means. who do you think?"}
{"original": "pirro: president trump speaking to me just minutes ago in a justice exclusive. congressman jim jordan joins me now with reaction to that interview and all of the developing news tonight. congressman, thanks so much for being here tonight. it's always good having you on set."}
{"original": "all right, let's - just your reaction to the president. you heard him tonight. you were in the green room."}
{"original": "rep. jim jordan, r-oh: yes, now, the president is doing a great job. i mean, i've said this time and time"}
{"original": "again. think about what we've seen the last two years -- regulations reduced, taxes cut, economy growing at an unprecedented rate, lowest unemployment in 50 years, 312,000 added last month, gorsuch, kavanaugh in the court, out of the iranian deal, embassy in jerusalem, new nafta agreement -- i mean, you could just go on and on."}
{"original": "so it's been a great two years, but democrats just want to keep focusing on trying to stop him instead of helping the country."}
{"original": "pirro: well, yes, it seems they're pretty determined to stop him."}
{"original": "pirro: even if they look like absolute hypocrites and deny everything they've done in the past."}
{"original": "jordan: voted for our border security wall, a few years ago, against it now because it'll help the president. forget about what's good for the country. they're focused solely on stopping the president."}
{"original": "think about the first day, brad sherman, congressman from california, first day files impeachment article with - they haven't even been in congress 24 hours and the congresswoman from michigan says the disgraceful thing she said about the president and now we've got michael cohen, the first big interview - excuse me first big hearing. they're bringing in a guy who was a convicted felon going to prison in two months."}
{"original": "and you know one of the things he's convicted of, lying to congress."}
{"original": "jordan: i mean go figure. you can't make this stuff up, but i mean, you'd laugh if it wasn't so serious."}
{"original": "pirro: yes, well, a lot of the stuff is absolutely bizarre, but i want to talk to you about the new york times article where the fbi opened an inquiry into whether or not trump was secretly working on behalf of russia and i asked the president if he is now or has he ever worked for russia as in the old mccarthy question. what's your take on this article? you did a lot of investigating on the fbi."}
{"original": "jordan: yes, and we're still going to, if the democrats won't shut it all down. two things, you've got to remember, who's saying this? who's doing this? and when are they doing it? so who's doing it? andy mccabe, deputy director of the - former deputy director of the fbi."}
{"original": "jordan: fired. lied three times under oath, not according to republicans, but according to the inspector general. lisa page who was demoted, then left the fbi. peter strzok, former deputy head of counterintelligence, demoted and then fired by the fbi and jim baker, don't forget him."}
{"original": "jordan: general counsel at the fbi, demoted and then left. these four people are the ones who have this extreme animus towards the president. they're the ones who are saying to start this counterintelligence investigation in the president. it's ridiculous."}
{"original": "and remember when it happened, it happened just days after their best pal, jim comey is fired. so remember that critical week, those critical eight days. may 9th, comey gets fired. may 17th, bob mueller gets named special counsel. andy mccabe is running the fbi. they're talking about everything. they're talking about this investigation, new york times report on it, which is not really new news. we all agreed ..."}
{"original": "pirro: why? i didn't think it was new. i kept reading it. what's new here?"}
{"original": "jordan: the one name that's not mentioned there though, rod rosenstein. rod rosenstein who is talking about wearing a wire to record the president, who was talking about invoking the 25th amendment. this is the crazy stuff going on with these people who had this extreme animus and bias against the president of the united states."}
{"original": "pirro: all right, so what you have is their best friend is fired. comey is fired, so his pals who worked with him on the hillary clinton investigation, so-called investigation decide that we're going to look at this guy for obstruction of justice and start a counterintelligence investigation."}
{"original": "the guys who already hate the president, all right, and at the same time, rosenstein is talking about, hey, maybe i'll go in and wear - and get a wire - wear a wire when i talk to the president."}
{"original": "i mean if this isn't a conspiracy in itself ..."}
{"original": "pirro: to undermined the president, then it's very scary."}
{"original": "jordan: and remember, even with all this, judge, jim comey testified up until the day he's fired, he said there was no evidence to show any type of coordination between the trump campaign and russia to influence the election. lisa page said the same thing when we deposed her."}
{"original": "remember that one text message from peter stzrok, there's no there, there."}
{"original": "pirro: there's no big there, there."}
{"original": "jordan: right, that's the day after mueller is named special counsel and strzok is deciding whether he is going to go in to the special counsel, so even if all this crazy stuff is going on this eight-day time period, even then peter strzok says, there really isn't any there, there. but because he had this bias that you know sent these terrible text messages, he sent trump should lose a hundred million to zero. this bias he had against the president. they're all talking about these ridiculous things."}
{"original": "pirro: well you know what i don't understand in all of this and i'm sure you have better insight than i do because you know stuff that's classified that i don't. why is rod rosenstein allowed to just leave?"}
{"original": "pirro: why is this guy given the velvet glove treatment? don't - talk to me, you're looking down. look at me."}
{"original": "jordan: mark meadows and i sent a letter to chairman cummings this week where we said just because - excuse me, to the justice department where we said just because rod rosenstein has said he's leaving, he still needs to come testify. there's important questions he needs to answer that we want him under oath in front of us asking - answering our questions and more importantly, the american people need the answers."}
{"original": "pirro: will the fisa warrant give us some indication of the wrongdoing?"}
{"original": "jordan: i think all of that -- bruce ohr's 302s, the fisa -- but, we need to get rod rosenstein under oath in front of us."}
{"original": "pirro: oh yes, i want to be there that day, congressman jim jordan. always great to have you on set in new york. thanks for being with us."}
{"original": "jordan: good to be with you. you bet. thank you."}
{"original": "pirro: all right, dan bonging is next, stay with us."}
{"original": "pirro: more reaction to my interview with president trump. joining me now, host of the dan bongino show podcast, don bongino. good evening, dan. did you hear the president tonight? he actually mentioned you and thought you a great guy and all that jazz, did you hear that?"}
{"original": "dan bongino, host, the dan bongino show podcast: yes, sorry i was like scratching my brow there when i came on. i did hear that. i was - i was surprised, always flattered, but listen, he's onto something, judge."}
{"original": "he knows, you know you and i and greg that have done a lot of homework into this spygate, russiagate debacle that this is nonsense. this is a total scam. it's a scheme. it deserves to be exposed and i'm glad he fights back and doesn't take the media narrative nonsense."}
{"original": "pirro: well, we're all glad that he fights back and you know, the amazing thing is that this second new york times article, the second, the one from yesterday, it's like they just won't give it up. they just rerun this stuff and give it a new headline and you know, it's almost like, there's a coup. i mean, like every day, there's a new coup with the same dossier, the same players. it has got to be - it is amazing that it's been able to last this long."}
{"original": "bongino: yes, you know your line to congressman jordan there was classic. it was great. you felt the same way i did. you read this right, judge, and you said what's the news here? the fbi used the political document, the dossier from the hillary team that's been widely discredited and debunked as a reason to target and weaponize the fbi to attack the trump team."}
{"original": "i don't understand what was new about this article and even worse, i don't understand why this reflects poorly on trump. the piece basically admits that the fbi took a purely political document and used it to spy on the president."}
{"original": "wait, judge, can i mention one more thing about this though, don't you find it a little odd that in that piece, rod rosenstein is not mentioned? yet, it was rod rosenstein's letter that was used to fire comey. so if that piece is right, that the firing of comey incited some big counterintelligence investigation, why was the investigation focused on trump? why not investigate rosenstein?"}
{"original": "you and i know the answer. this had nothing to do with rosenstein and everything to do with donald trump."}
{"original": "pirro: well and the amazing part of it is that rosenstein announces he's going to - he's going to retire and it's like, there's no consequence like you know, bye, rod. we'll give you a watch. we'll see in a few. i don't understand why he's getting away with it, but the answer is in - is when the president releases the fisa information and the fisa warrant and declassifies it. it has got to be done. i just - i am dying to know what it is about this guy."}
{"original": "but let me ask you this, i mean when we talk about the - what is going on right, you were in the secret service. i mean, you were in law enforcement before that. immigration -what is going on and why do the democrats allow this to continue? and i'm not even talking about the politics, but the influx."}
{"original": "we know ms-13. we know drugs. we know fentanyl, human trafficking. why?"}
{"original": "bongino: because this isn't about immigration to the democrats. this is about political power. this is about open borders and a welfare state to replace the voters they're losing now in mass amongst the american working class. this is all the democrats have."}
{"original": "judge, make no mistake, this fight, this shutdown fight right now, i'm telling you on the democratic side, don't laugh when i say, it has nothing to do with immigration. this has everything to do with what they perceive to be a defeat for the president of the united states where they can marshal that political power for impeachment later."}
{"original": "this is the fight. everybody needs to draw a line in the sand right now and understand what this is about. if we lose this fight on this shutdown, they will go after this president. it will be geometrically worse than it is now. this is the fight. there can be absolutely no backing down and no retreat on this. the fight is now, the sacrifices have to be made now. everybody needs to toughen up for what's ahead."}
{"original": "pirro: all right, dan bongino, yes or no, use emergency funding?"}
{"original": "bongino: i don't think so. i think it's a bad call. i think he's doing the right thing right now, holding back on that."}
{"original": "pirro: all right, dan bongino, thanks so much for being with us and we'll be right back."}
{"original": "pirro: and finally tonight, i mentioned my exclusive interview with acting ice director ron vitiello, but we went a ran a little long with president trump tonight, so we're saving director vitiello for next week. you'll see it then right here."}
{"original": "don't forget to keep up with me throughout the week on facebook, twitter and instagram. thanks for watching tonight. i'm jeanine pirro advocating for truth, justice and the american way. the greg gutfeld show is coming up next and i'll see you next saturday night."}

{"original": "imagine if a state law prohibited new restaurants from opening in your town unless an aspiring restaurateur successfully convinced the government that the area needed another eatery."}
{"original": "now imagine if that law didn't stop there – that is also gave incumbent restaurants a say in the matter. if one could persuade the government that a new entrant would harm its interests – or could marshal its employees to lobby the state to protect their jobs – then that new restaurant would never open."}
{"original": "freed from competition, existing restaurants could hike prices or reduce service. and there would be little diners could do about it."}
{"original": "'unconstitutional' obamacare is deeply flawed, and it's time to do away with it"}
{"original": "such laws actually exist. but they don't govern restaurants. they prevent new hospitals and clinics from being built. these anti-competitive statutes, known as certificate of need (con) laws, are driving up health care costs across the country. it's time to repeal them."}
{"original": "new york enacted the first certificate of need law in 1964. state lawmakers feared that hospital groups would build too many facilities and pass the cost of creating and maintaining excess capacity on to consumers. so they required health care providers to seek permission before constructing or expanding hospitals or clinics."}
{"original": "in 1974, the federal government effectively forced states to put certificate of need laws on their books as a condition for receiving federal funding."}
{"original": "[i]nstead of keeping health care prices stable, con laws concentrated market power with incumbent providers, who then gouged consumers."}
{"original": "but instead of keeping health care prices stable, con laws concentrated market power with incumbent providers, who then gouged consumers. on average, u.s. hospital spending grew at a 14 percent annualized rate during the 1970s and a 9.6 percent annualized rate over the course of the 1980s."}
{"original": "the federal government repealed its con law requirement in 1986. since then, 15 states have abolished their statutes."}
{"original": "but 35 states and the district of columbia still enforce them. and their residents pay a heavy price. those 36 jurisdictions have 99 fewer hospital beds per 100,000 people than non-con states, according to a study from the mercatus center at george mason university."}
{"original": "patients in con states also travel farther to receive health care. and they pay a lot more for it. per capita health spending is 11 percent higher in states with con laws than in those without them."}
{"original": "these anti-competitive laws make it particularly hard for rural patients to access care. there are 30 percent fewer rural hospitals per capita in states with con laws, according to another mercatus study."}

{"original": "acting white house chief of staff mick mulvaney strongly suggested on fox news sunday that president trump will construct a border wall using his emergency powers if congress cannot agree on a compromise to fund the construction in the next three weeks."}
{"original": "trump on friday signed a short-term spending bill to re-open the government through feb. 15, ending the longest partial federal government shutdown in u.s. history. but the president insisted the move was not a concession, writing in a tweet that in 21 days, if no deal is done, it's off to the races! -- a message mulvaney emphasized."}
{"original": "we don't go into this trying to shut the government down. ... it's still better to get it through legislation, mulvaney, who officially still holds his title as director of the office of management and budget, said. that's the right way to do it. at the end of the day, the president is going to secure the border, one way or another."}
{"original": "mulvaney added, at the end of the day, the president's commitment is to protect the nation, and he'll do it either with or without congress."}
{"original": "meanwhile, speaking to nbc's meet the press, florida republican sen. marco rubio said that declaring a state of emergency would be a terrible idea and set bad precedent."}

{"original": "mulvaney, speaking to fill-in anchor john roberts, said that democrats had privately indicated to the white house that striking a deal might be possible now that the government is temporarily re-opened."}
{"original": "why [trump] did what he did was because many democrats had come to us, some privately, many of them spoke out publically, but they actually started to agree with him on the necessity for a barrier on the southern border, mulvaney told roberts. and they had come to us and said 'look, we agree with you, you're winning the battle on the importance of a barrier on the southern border. but we simply cannot work with you while the government is closed.'"}
{"original": "at the end of the day, the president's going to secure the border, one way or another. — acting chief of staff mick mulvaney"}
{"original": "he added: that's a marked difference – excuse me, while the government was closed – that's a marked difference from where the democrat leadership was. they said they wouldn't talk to us about border security ever. nancy pelosi famously said that even if we opened the government, she wouldn't give us a single dollar for the wall. so i think the president saw a chance here to try and take the democrats at their word."}
{"original": "trump challenges pelosi: if walls are immoral, why not tear down existing ones?"}
{"original": "the white house has directed the army corps of engineers to look at possible ways of funding border security, including possibly using the president's emergency powers and unspent disaster relief money."}
{"original": "i think the president wants his $5.7 billion, mulvaney said. keep in mind – why why why is that number? it's not a number that's made up. it's what the experts have told him. he's listened to dhs. i've been in on the meetings. he's listened to cbp [customs and border patrol], he's listened to ice."}
{"original": "should the white house move forward with an emergency declaration, it has a handful of legal routes to take. the national emergencies act grants the president broad authority to declare emergencies, and several federal laws then could clear a path for the white house to move ahead with building a wall."}

{"original": "mulvaney offered some advice to democrats hoping to avoid the possibility of an emergency declaration: stop following their leader in congress at every turn."}
{"original": "the last time democrats sort of followed nancy pelosi blindly down a path on policy, we ended up with obamacare and bailouts and cap and trade and they lost control of the house, mulvaney said. the question is: is nancy really leading the democrat party or is she just being led by the hard left wing of her party. and will the rest of the democrats follow her?"}
{"original": "the president from the very beginning here actually has been the one willing to negotiate, mulvaney added. he was the one staying in washington, dc when nancy went to hawaii. he's the one who stayed in dc when democrats all went down to puerto rico. he was in d.c. when she tried to leave to go to europe and the middle east last week. he wants to negotiate on the deal. and the democrat leadership simply refused to take him up on that."}
{"original": "some democrats have hinted they are willing to buck pelosi. last week, house homeland security committee chairman bennie thompson, d-miss., broke with some of his fellow congressional democrats by acknowledging in an interview that he would not rule out a wall in certain instances, although he cautioned that the white house needs a better plan than simply using a wall as a talking point."}
{"original": "thompson suggested in an interview with abc news' this week that trump was stuck with pelosi, however."}
{"original": "mr. president, democrats will work with you, thompson said. but you can't pick what democrats you work with. we have picked our leaders, and you have to work with our leaders. he continued, the notion that we can't have barriers is just something that's not true."}
{"original": "democratic leaders have previously supported building border walls. senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., and other democrats, including then-sens. barack obama and hillary clinton, supported the secure fence act of 2006, which authorized the construction of some 700 miles of fencing at the border. as of 2015, virtually all of that fencing had been completed, according to government figures."}
{"original": "and house majority leader steny hoyer, d-md., acknowledged earlier this month on fox news' special report with bret baier that border walls obviously work in some areas, and he rejected suggestions that barriers are necessarily improper -- contradicting pelosi's claims that a wall is an immorality."}

{"original": "democratic presidential candidate joe biden on monday praised the american people's resolve while calling on president trump to start to act like the wartime president he says he is, in the first of what his campaign says will be regular briefings about the coronavirus threat."}
{"original": "biden's remarks, livestreamed from a studio set up in his home, were short compared with the president's near-daily coronavirus briefings, lasting less than 15 minutes in total. trump's all-hands-on-deck press conferences often run over an hour."}
{"original": "but the former vice president covered a range of topics including the president's coronavirus response, what he would do if he were in the oval office, the lessons that can be learned from governors' actions to fight the coronavirus, the senate republicans' stimulus proposal and a lawsuit backed by the trump administration and republican attorneys general to strike down obamacare on constitutional grounds."}
{"original": "biden called on republicans to drop that lawsuit."}
{"original": "it's worth noting that today is the tenth anniversary of the signing of the affordable care act. i'm proud of the role i played alongside president obama backing him up to bring obamacare into the law, biden said. but also today in the middle of one of the largest public health emergencies in generations, the white house and republican attorneys general are actively pursuing a lawsuit to invalidate the aca in court. they're working to strip millions of americans of their health care and tens of millions of their protections for preexisting conditions."}
{"original": "joe buck will call play-by-play for coronavirus-era home videos: 'i'd love to get some practice reps in'"}
{"original": "he continued: i sent a letter this morning with a simple request, withdraw the lawsuit please."}
{"original": "on the senate republicans' coronavirus response bill, biden said it focused too much on corporate america and not enough on individuals struggling because of the pandemic. this, after senate democrats blocked the massive economic rescue package on sunday, sending negotiators scrambling to reach a deal."}
{"original": "as of last night president trump and [senate majority leader] mitch mcconnell were offering a plan to let big corporations off the hook, biden said. they proposed a $500 billion slush fund for corporations with almost no conditions. under their plan, the trump administration could even allow companies to use the money ... being given to them .. to buy back stocks, increase executive pays, if that's what the secretary of the treasury decided. they wouldn't have to make commitments to keep workers employed."}
{"original": "biden also had some advice for trump on his daily briefings and his coronavirus response."}
{"original": "later today you'll hear from the president in his daily briefing. these briefings are an important opportunity to inform and reassure the american public. they're not a place for political attacks or to lash out at the press. they're about the american people, biden said. so i hope today and in the days ahead the president will give us the unvarnished truth. that's what the american people need and what they deserve."}
{"original": "he also said: trump keeps saying he is a wartime president, well, start to act like one. … donald trump is not to blame for the coronavirus, but he does bear responsibility for our response."}
{"original": "joe biden's coronavirus plan: what's in it?"}
{"original": "biden's move to essentially hold his own briefings amid the coronavirus pandemic is unusual, considering they are sure to offer a starkly different message than the daily briefings out of the white house during a time of national emergency. but they also come as the former vice president must keep a high profile, asserting himself as the presumptive nominee even as the numerous primary delays tied to the pandemic prevent him from officially locking down the nomination and beating lone remaining rival bernie sanders."}
{"original": "and the gaffe-prone but affable former vice president couldn't make it through the novel briefing by a candidate without one awkward moment. as he was detailing his plan to fight the coronavirus crisis, biden appeared to lose track of his spot on the teleprompter."}
{"original": "he signaled to his staff that there was something wrong, before going off on an awkward ad-lib."}
{"original": "and uh, in addition to that, uh in addition to that we have to make sure that we uh, we are in a position that we are, well met me go the second thing, i've spoke enough on that, biden said before going on to speak about the aggressive action he would like trump to take under the defense production act."}
{"original": "trump's reelection campaign is firing back, accusing biden of trying to politicize the crisis."}
{"original": "by preying upon americans' fear amid the coronavirus outbreak, biden isn't just playing cheap politics. he's making the crisis worse. it's dangerous, the campaign said in an email. biden's monday morning quarterbacking is an effort to sow anger and division among americans."}
{"original": "biden on monday also criticized trump for not warning americans urgently enough and acting fast enough to fight the coronavirus, citing his own comments about the coronavirus on jan. 27."}
{"original": "the mindset that was slow to recognize the problem in the first place, to treat it with the seriousness it deserved, is still too much a part of how the president is addressing the problem, biden said."}
{"original": "biden then sounded the alarm on the need for work on treatments and vaccines for the coronavirus, employing the defense production act to get masks and ventilators to health care professionals caring for those sick with the coronavirus, stepping up testing and more — mostly along the lines of recommendations he made in a detailed coronavirus response plan over a week ago."}

{"original": "above all, biden's address seemed aimed at making him seem like the adult in the room — the experienced statesman who has dealt with this before and can unite the country around a common cause."}
{"original": "when we've stood as one, this nation has never ever been defeated... and we're not going to be defeated now, biden said. the pandemic of 1918, the great depression, two world wars, we overcame them all. and out of each crisis we emerge stronger, and we will again. this new enemy may be unseen, but we have the tools, the expertise and most importantly the spirit to defeat it."}

{"original": "how much would 'medicare for all' cost?"}
{"original": "her statements appeared to be a full-throated call for single-payer health insurance, as opposed to merely expanding medicare, and a dramatic embrace of the kind of proposals advocated by vermont independent sen. bernie sanders."}
{"original": "well, listen, the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care. and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require, harris told tapper."}
{"original": "who among us has not had that situation? she continued. where you got to wait for approval, and the doctor says, 'well i don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this.' let's eliminate all of that. let's move on."}

{"original": "harris appeared unwilling to follow obama's example on monday night, and instead stuck to her answer as she jokingly told tapper to move onto the next question."}
{"original": "during a speech to officially launch her 2020 run earlier this month, harris declared that health care is a fundamental right and vowed to serve her constituents by supporting medicare for all."}
{"original": "in august 2017, harris became the first senate democrat to support sanders' medicare for all bill. the program, if implemented, would cost tens of trillions of dollars over a decade, experts say."}
{"original": "how much would 'medicare for all' cost? experts break it down"}
{"original": "several independent studies have specifically estimated that government spending on health care would surge by $25 trillion to $35 trillion or more in a 10-year period. a study released over the summer by the mercatus center at george mason university, for example, estimated that sanders' program would cost $32.6 trillion — $3.26 trillion per year — over a decade. by comparison, the federal budget proposal for the fiscal year 2019 was $4.4 trillion, the congressional budget office states."}
{"original": "analysis by the new york times in 2017 showed at least 74 million americans who currently benefit from medicaid would potentially face higher taxes under medicare for all."}
{"original": "sanders and new york democratic rep. ocasio-cortez have countered that while spending would necessarily increase in the short-term, fundamentally restructuring medicare would ultimately yield sustained economic benefits by reducing administrative inefficiencies, cutting perscription drug costs, and encouraging young people to put more money into the economy."}
{"original": "but charles blahous, a senior strategist at the mercatus center and an author of the study, has said ocasio-cortez and sanders would need to make unrealistic assumptions to come to that conclusion, because increased demand for healthcare would potentially offset any such administrative gains."}
{"original": "he criticized the two for making comments that appear to reflect a misunderstanding of my study after they cited his work as proof that 'medicare for all' would, in fact, necessarily save money. numerous fact-checkers, including the washington post and factcheck, concluded that both liberal politicians had misread the paper's conclusions."}

{"original": "speaking separately in response to a gun rights question at monday's town hall, harris urged a ban on assault weapons, without defining the term."}
{"original": "there is no reason in a civil society that we have assault weapons around communities that can kill babies and police officers, harris said to applause. something like universal background checks -- it makes perfect sense that you might want to know before someone can buy a weapon that can kill another human being, you might want to know have they been convicted of a felony where they committed violence? that's just reasonable. you might want to know before they can buy that gun if a court has found them to be a danger to themselves or others. you just might want to know. that's reasonable."}
{"original": "harris also defended her record as attorney general in california, saying she enforced the death penalty in the state despite opposing the practice. likewise, she said she chose not to take a public position in 2015 on legislation to require her office to investigate all police-related fatal shootings because her office would write the law and enforce it."}

{"original": "it's unclear what legislative issues may consume congress between now and the end of september but one thing's for sure: president trump's veto of a measure to terminate his national emergency for the border has the potential to spark another government shutdown on oct. 1."}
{"original": "yes, the president and congress just sparred over the border wall during the 35-day shutdown which ended this past january. they could be back at it again soon because trump elected to go around congress, testing the limits of the constitution and separation of powers, and mining appropriations bills for wall money."}
{"original": "it was thought that the bipartisan attitude on capitol hill which forged a funding agreement could generate cooperation and goodwill heading into fiscal year 2020. but, president trump's national emergency declaration may have doomed any charity left in congress."}
{"original": "the house and senate lack the votes to override trump's veto. the house is about 40 votes shy. the senate is eight votes off the mark. the house is still set to try the override on march 26, but it's almost certain the override endeavor will perish there -- and president trump will use his declaration to use various military funds to cover the cost of the wall unless blocked by a federal court."}
{"original": "now the administration has presented lawmakers with a list which details a pool of military projects from which it may use cash to pay for the wall. the administration has called the clump of money unobligated. it amounts to $12.9 billion."}
{"original": "he is planning to take funds from real, effective operational priorities and needed projects and divert them to his vanity wall. that may help shore up his political base, but it could come at the expense of our military bases and the men and women of our armed forces who rely on them, said sen. jack reed, d-r.i., the top democrat on the armed services committee."}
{"original": "congress is just starting to prepare the 12 appropriations bills which fund the government for fy '20. almost all democrats, and frankly, many republicans, have described trump's effort to bypass congress as brazen. lawmakers of both parties have guarded congressional prerogatives of the purse closely, so it's likely a bipartisan group of lawmakers will start to install restrictions to curb the president from diverting funds in the next spending round – without direct congressional approval."}
{"original": "president trump's budget request calls for $8.6 billion in wall funding for fy '20. congress likely will grant the president some of the money – but not all. will he attempt to sidestep congress again? will trump veto bills where congress tries to re-assert its power of the purse or curb his ability to circumvent the traditional appropriations process? that's where a possible shutdown comes in."}

{"original": "the agenda in the senate focuses mostly on the confirmation of judges and other administration nominees. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., has a few more queued up for next week, but the actual gop agenda is unclear."}
{"original": "tax reform is done, for good or ill. republicans can't go back to take yet another stab at repealing and replacing obamacare, so the gop is trained on problems of the democrats. mcconnell, house minority leader kevin mccarthy, r-calif., house minority whip steve scalise, r-la., and house republican conference chairwoman liz cheney, r-wyo., routinely have pilloried dems over their own internal divides. gop leaders simply have pointed out issues democrats have had with reps. alexandria ocasio-cortez of new york, ilhan omar of minnesota and rashida tlaib of michigan, among others. the house republican leadership brass routinely has gone after house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., for not doing more to keep the conduct of omar and tlaib in check."}
{"original": "border patrol union leader: congress is wrong, national emergency on the border is real"}
{"original": "mcconnell's set up a procedural vote to try starting debate next week on the green new deal, backed by ocasio-cortez and others. the senate needs 60 yeas just to launch debate."}
{"original": "senate republicans certainly don't support the green new deal. mcconnell's gambit is to get democrats on the record as either supporting or rejecting the measure. consider all of the senate democrats running for president: kirsten gillibrand of new york, elizabeth warren of massachusetts, cory booker of new jersey, kamala harris of california and amy klobuchar of minnesota -- not to mention bernie sanders, i-vt. mcconnell clearly would love to register a roll call vote on where democrats stand in favor of the green new deal. then, republicans could crow about how radical and out-of-step the democrats have been."}
{"original": "or, mcconnell also would enjoy democrats opposing the green new deal. he then could exclaim that ocasio-cortez's blueprint was too drastic even for the most liberal and environmentally friendly voices in the democratic party. either way, mcconnell would get something he's wanted."}
{"original": "but, it's unclear whether he would score something definitive. the vote set for next week is just a procedural vote. it's two steps away from an actual up-or-down vote on the underlying measure. any vote to start debate -- or to prevent the measure from coming to the floor -- is muddled when it comes to messaging. sure, mcconnell could say that ocasio-cortez's resolution was too far-flung to merit debate. but, that's not the strongest argument to make in politics."}

{"original": "this is why the legislative agenda on capitol hill is so jumbled. there's no clear path on what the sides can accomplish in the coming months. there will be a fight over lifting the debt ceiling this summer. how the sides resolve that is unclear. and the national emergency declaration likely will create yet another standoff over the border wall in september."}

{"original": "that 12-point jump is driven by more democrats (+16 points) and independents (+22 points) now saying all congressional lawmakers should be sent packing than said so in 2010. among republicans, views held mostly steady at about six in 10."}

{"original": "but as biden pointed out in last week's debate, bloomberg hasn't always been such a staunch defender of obamacare. in a speech given a few months after president obama signed his health plan into law, bloomberg called obamacare a disgrace. he also dismissed it as another program that's going to cost a lot more money but do absolutely nothing to fix the big health care problems in this country."}

{"original": "bloomberg's proposal to build on obamacare wouldn't fix any of the problems he previously complained about. he has proposed a medicare-like public option, wherein the federal government would charter a new health plan to compete against private plans. according to his campaign, this would increase competition in the private insurance market, pushing down premiums for all."}
{"original": "but that's not what would happen. unlike a government-run plan, private insurers don't have the power to underpay providers. medicare's reimbursement rates to healthcare providers are about 40 percent lower than those paid by private insurance. nor can private insurers draw on the u.s. treasury to help pay out claims. they have to set premiums high enough to cover their costs."}
{"original": "given the chance, many americans would jump to an artificially cheap public plan. within a decade, nearly 7 million uninsured people would gain coverage through the public option, according to a study by kng health consulting. by that time, the united states is projected to be short nearly 122,000 doctors."}
{"original": "that sounds like a recipe for long waits and overcrowded hospitals -- just as the bloomberg of a decade ago predicted."}
{"original": "bloomberg's response to care crunches like these is what we might expect from a master of the universe like him -- rationing by government officials who know best. a video released on feb. 17 showed bloomberg in 2011 saying providers should deny treatment to older patients, citing the example of a 95-year-old with prostate cancer."}

{"original": "and he said, i'm not doing this to criticize. i'm doing this to say, 'this is what i think you should do.'"}
{"original": "there's a number of specific suggestions that i know from the past work and some i think would work. i'm prepared to offer them to the president, biden emphasized. i understand if he doesn't want to take my advice, but it won't be 'i told you so mr. president.' it won't be if he decided to do what i suggested, i go back and say 'well, i told the president to do that.' this is beyond politics right now."}
{"original": "biden also urged the trump administration to change course and allow for another open-enrollment period for obamacare to allow those without insurance who are battling the covid-19 disease caused by the coronavirus to sign up for health care coverage."}
{"original": "democrats and republicans are calling for president trump and his administration to do the right thing and open up a new enrollment period for obamacare, so that people who need insurance now can get it. now's not the time for petty politics. this is a national emergency, biden stressed."}
{"original": "and he took aim at senate majority leader mitch mcconnell over the kentucky republican's resistance to any quick congressional action on another coronavirus stimulus package."}
{"original": "i predict to you that no matter mitch says, he's going to be back handling another package. the idea that this is the end of it, i will be dumbfounded if that occurs. and disappointed, biden emphasized."}

{"original": "but secretary of state mike pompeo has disputed whether sanctions are hampering humanitarian efforts in iran."}
{"original": "biden said in a statement on thursday that in times of global crisis, america should lead. we should be the first to offer help to people who are hurting or in danger. that's who we are. that's who we've always been."}
{"original": "biden noted that iran, an adversary of the united states for four decades, has failed to respond effectively to this crisis, including lying and concealing the truth from its own people, and it continues to act provocatively in the region."}
{"original": "but he also stressed that iran is struggling to contain one of the deadliest covid-19 outbreaks in the world and that the iranian people are hurting desperately."}

{"original": "biden's campaign on thursday said it welcomed the decision."}
{"original": "our campaign will continue to work closely with state parties and the dnc on any changes to the delegate selection process and the format of the convention to ensure that health and safety will remain the top priority as we confront this covid-19 crisis as a nation, the biden campaign said in a statement."}

{"original": "reconciliation is a special process for budget-related legislation that allows for a 51-majority vote, rather than the 60 votes normally required to advance a bill. democrats have 51 votes in the senate with vice president kamala harris' tie-breaking vote."}
{"original": "abc news correspondent mary bruce during the daily white house briefing brought up comments sen. majority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., made on the floor earlier thursday, saying democrats would move forward with biden's coronavirus relief proposal with or without republicans."}
{"original": "does this hurt your call for bipartisanship and are you urging them to give this more time? bruce asked psaki."}
{"original": "schumer: dems prepared to pass coronavirus relief 'with or without' republicans"}
{"original": "the president wants this to be a bipartisan package, regardless of the mechanisms, she replied. republicans can still vote for a package even if it goes through with reconciliation. there's no blood oath anybody signs. they are able to support it regardless."}
{"original": "but it doesn't seem like you can get the speed you want and the bipartisanship, so which is the priority? the reporter shot back."}
{"original": "we refute that notion, these challenges the american public are facing are urgent, psaki said. we're confident that people are going to listen to [americans] and support a bipartisan bill."}

{"original": "she added that the white house is not looking to split the bill. we're not looking to split the package. that is not a proposal from the white house, she said."}
{"original": "psaki said that the president was having calls with democrats and republicans to drum up support for the bill, and he was open to hearing from the gop on how to make the legislation more targeted, though biden already believes it is."}
{"original": "our focus is making it better, she said, but we're not going to do this a piecemeal way."}

{"original": "he ran on a pledge to restore unity, he promised to be a president for all americans, but since he's gotten into office, he's been largely acting unilaterally, one reporter noted. biden has signed over 30 executive orders since taking office jan. 20. president trump averaged 55 executive orders per year and presidents obama and bush were at around 35."}

{"original": "putting obamacare on steroids will only make a bad situation worse."}
{"original": "look no further than our northern neighbor or ally across the pond for a peek into what government-controlled health care looks like. the waitlists to receive health care in the u.k. and canada stretch into the millions and the queue time to see a specialist, for example, can be up to seven times as long compared to the u.s. in short, it's not an outcome we want to mimic."}

{"original": "the bloated u.s. health care system—pumped full of bureaucracy, middlemen and opaque pricing schemes—siphons more than $3.5 trillion away from the economy every year. that's roughly $11,000 per person and amounts to nearly one-fifth of the u.s. gross domestic product. and under a biden administration with no guardrails, that number would only grow and taxpayers broadly would become increasingly responsible to cover the costs."}
{"original": "while the degree of health care spending should reflect the critical— and literally lifesaving—role of services provided by medical professionals, waste should not be tolerated."}

{"original": "by streamlining the health care system and utilizing the free market and transparency to push prices down, consumers will have more money to spend on other priorities—a financial reset that will ripple throughout the economy and benefit all americans. the savings could be used to buy a house, pay for college or even invest in a small business."}
{"original": "rather than inject more government into health care, sens. perdue and loeffler understand we need less. in fact, the two lawmakers recently co-sponsored a senate resolution that would do just that and provide americans with personalized health care at lower costs. all while patients with preexisting conditions are protected. the plan mirrors an already released reform framework called healthcare for you."}

{"original": "kellyanne conway, counselor to the president: thank you, chris."}
{"original": "wallace: we're going to get to the mueller report in a moment. but we're going to start with a fast-moving political story. it involves a woman named lucy flores."}
{"original": "she was a state legislator in nevada who was running for lieutenant general in 2014. she says that during a rally, the real you are seeing here but off-camera, that then vice president joe biden touched her inappropriately. biden's staff says he doesn't remember it that way."}
{"original": "this morning, here's what lucy flores said to abc news."}
{"original": "lucy flores, former nevada assemblyman: at that point, it wasn't even joe biden, it was the second most powerful man in the country, the vice president of the united states of america, is touching me and kissing me and smelling my hair."}
{"original": "wallace: and to give you a sense of how quickly this is moving, we're going to put up on a screen, this is a statement that has just come out from former vice president biden. he says: in my many years on the campaign trail and in public life, i have offered countless handshakes, hugs, expressions of affection, support, and comfort, and not once, never, that i believe i acted inappropriately. if it is suggested i did so, i will listen respectfully, but it was never my intention."}
{"original": "kellyanne, you have shared the fact that you were a victim of sexual assault much earlier in your life. i know this doesn't rise to that level, but your reaction to what we are hearing now about this incident?"}
{"original": "conway: first of all, this woman lucy is very bold to come forward and i would remind the audience that she shares joe biden's political party. he was there to help the democratic party of nevada and her candidacy. so it's quite bold for her to go up against the highest levels of her own political party."}
{"original": "but all of these post-#metoo allegations and insinuations really don't comport with probably joe biden's conduct over the years. if anybody just types in creepy uncle joe videos' you come up with a treasure trove. far more evidentiary information and videos and we saw one brett kavanaugh's nomination was trying to be derailed and him as an individual and his family being destroyed by folks who had no evidence of what had allegedly happened 34 years earlier."}
{"original": "and i think joe biden has a big problem here because he calls it affection and handshakes. his party because it completely inappropriate. and the other thing that biden really has is a problem is stacey abrams, who i look upon as a big future part of the democratic party. she is very compelling --"}
{"original": "wallace: let me, if i may --"}
{"original": "conway: she rebuffed his advances to be on his ticket pretty much. she said: if i'm going to run, i'm going to run for the whole thing."}
{"original": "so, he's had a bad couple of weeks. he doesn't have president obama, the men he served for eight years as vice president."}
{"original": "conway: he apparently doesn't have his endorsement."}
{"original": "conway: so i think he's had the worst non-rollout for any would-be 2020 candidate on the democratic side. this doesn't help."}
{"original": "wallace: let me ask you about one more question and we move on, we've got a lot to cover here this morning, kellyanne. i'm sure a lot of folks are saying there are women who have said much worse about your boss, president trump, in terms of touching them inappropriately."}
{"original": "conway: we've certainly covered that ad infinitum during the campaign, the transition practically every day. but look what's happened to the people who alleged all that and who think you have to speak about that repetitively and ubiquitously. now, they have to -- they have to really grapple with what's going on in their own party with a man who was vice president of the united states until two years ago."}
{"original": "and so, let's have that conversation and i do think, as somebody who is very affectionate, i am, i tend to hug people, i tend to put on my head because i guess we're not supposed to do that. i do think that we should examine appropriate conduct in the public sphere."}
{"original": "but joe biden's intent is only partly or maybe not at all, relevant here. it's really how that woman felt. she feels that it was unwelcome."}
{"original": "conway: and she's coming forward with it because she doesn't want, i supposed she doesn't want this man to continue to advance in public life. joe biden this week was apologizing to anita hill for his role --"}
{"original": "wallace: ok, all right. you're going to have plenty of time to go after him on other issues."}
{"original": "conway: why didn't he apologize to lucy? why didn't he apologize to this woman? why didn't he do that? they never apologize to the individual."}
{"original": "and i think the way the media covered everything from collusion to kavanaugh to the covington kids means they ought to be able to cover issues like this with the same time of vigor."}
{"original": "wallace: well, that's why i'm asking you about it at the beginning of our interview."}
{"original": "let's turn to what the president is telling americans about the mueller report. here he is."}
{"original": "donald trump, president: the special counsel completed its report and found no collusion and no obstruction, total exoneration. complete vindication."}
{"original": "wallace: now, the special counsel cleared the president on collusion -- absolutely, no question about it. but he expressly did not clear him on the question of obstruction. so, why is the president telling americans something that is not true?"}
{"original": "conway: well, the barr memo talks about no obstructive conduct. it also says something -- i don't think it's enough coverage, which answers your question in part, chris, which is that also nobody in the department of justice felt like the investigation was interfered with, that mr. mueller couldn't do the job he wanted to do."}
{"original": "so for all the times i was asked, the president was asked, we were all asked, will he protect mueller? will he fire bob mueller? will he impede the investigation? will he fire this (ph)? the department of justice feels --"}
{"original": "conway: -- that mr. mueller was able to do that. now, he also didn't say the president obstructed --"}
{"original": "wallace: kellyanne, i'm asking you specifically about obstruction and i don't mean to interrupt but --"}
{"original": "conway: well, it's not in there."}
{"original": "wallace: i do want to keep you on point. here is the summary that attorney general barr sent to congress about the issue of obstruction. i want to put it up on the screen. this is barr summarizing the special counsel."}
{"original": "for each of the relevant actions investigated, the reports they found evidence on both sides of the question, the special counsel states that, quote, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime of obstruction, it also does not exonerate him."}
{"original": "so when the president says that its total exoneration on obstruction, kellyanne, that's just not true."}
{"original": "conway: well, the president is probably comparing that report and the ultimate conclusions of no conspiracy, no collusion, no contact with any russian at a campaign that i managed into its final successful phases and have always been offended than anybody would think that we would cheat, lie, steal or talk to any russians. that's ridiculous and always was. we wasted a lot of money and a lot of time in people's anxiety over it."}
{"original": "but the president is also saying, look, people were out there as recently as a week or days before the barr memo characterizing the mueller report was released by saying that the evidence of collusion was in plain sight, that the president had committed a crime, that elizabeth warren said we don't even know if you will be a free man."}
{"original": "wallace: look -- take yes for an answer, i'm agreeing with you on collusion. i'm asking you"}
{"original": "conway: i'm always going to take yes for an answer on the barr report."}
{"original": "wallace: i'm asking about obstruction, though."}
{"original": "conway: we will see with the full report says but there's nowhere in the barr report that says the president obstructed justice. there's nowhere in the barr memo that says you or i (ph) obstructed justice. and remember, we --"}
{"original": "wallace: well, there was no barr report. barr is simply summarizing --"}
{"original": "conway: the barr memo summarizing, but i think --"}
{"original": "wallace: mueller. and mueller says it did not exonerate him."}
{"original": "conway: well, it said many things and most importantly, it said that this president and his campaign did not commit a crime, that there was no conspiracy, no collusion and people vomited collusion for two straight years --"}
{"original": "conway: -- and wasted taxpayer dollars and people's anxiety and got into - - and by the way, adam schiff is completely compromised. you want to find one person who is compromised, he's the head of the house intelligence committee, spent more time on tv than at committee over the last how many years and all nine republican members have asked for his resignation. i certainly did it a week ago, the president has done."}
{"original": "conway: he cannot be fair. that is one of the most important positions in the united states house of representatives. he sees all the nation's secrets and he ought to step down."}
{"original": "wallace: we're going to talk about adam schiff with jim himes, his number two, in a moment -- in a couple of minutes."}
{"original": "i do want to ask about mexico because the president is now threatening to close the border between the u.s. and mexico this week if it doesn't stop the migrant caravans coming from mexico. take a look."}
{"original": "trump: if they don't stop them, we are closing the border. we'll close it. and we'll keep it closed for a long time. i'm not playing games."}
{"original": "wallace: mexico, kellyanne, is our third-largest trading partner. there's a half a trillion dollars of goods that comes back and forth across the border. thousands of americans every day go back and forth across the border."}
{"original": "is the president really serious about closing the border this week with all the disruption to our economy or is this just a bluff?"}
{"original": "conway: it certainly isn't a bluff. you can take the president seriously, and here's why. you're giving those metrics. what he's looking at is that 4,000 migrants apprehended in one day recently. we're on track this month for close to 100,000."}
{"original": "we have never seen a surge like this coming from the northern triangle company (ph). some of these kids are already separated by their parents from their parents before they even arrive here. congress can fix this, chris, in an hour."}
{"original": "they can give us a fix for the flores agreement that a court said there's only so much we can do. we have 20 days and then we have to release unaccompanied minors into the interior. congress can fix the problem of immigration they failed to fix. and this president is looking at the metrics."}
{"original": "secretary nielsen saying we are in a meltdown. we are at the breaking point."}
{"original": "conway: and the customs and border patrol head saying we've never seen a surge like this and even, give credit to dhs secretary jeh johnson under president obama said we have a crisis at the border."}
{"original": "wallace: i understand that and i want to ask about that surge because the president is also now going to cut off all foreign aid to three countries in central america -- guatemala, honduras and el salvador -- including aid for things like gang prevention."}
{"original": "the argument that a lot of people is making is if you cut off all those aid -- all that aid for all things that might improve conditions in what's called the triangle, those northern central american countries, you're only going to make things worse and you're only going to spur more migration."}
{"original": "conway: well, chris, this is the classic case of let's talk about what may happen and what we are looking for, versus what's right in front of us. how can people deny what they see, which is these caravans day by day, that people coming from the northern triangle countries and trying to come to this country, and they are at very deplorable conditions that many of them are facing. the dhs says --"}
{"original": "wallace: you're going to make the conditions worse, kellyanne, if you cut off foreign aid."}
{"original": "conway: the conditions are really awful. the conditions are already awful. we have back-to-back homeland security secretary, president obama and president trump saying that we have a crisis. we are over the melting point."}
{"original": "we have to -- congress must act. the executive branch has done so much to try to mitigate these awful circumstances and we need to send a message back to these countries too. be honest with people. they are being promising in giving their life savings to coyotes and they are being promised something that cannot be once they get here."}
{"original": "conway: and we have to just got off the drugs. you know that we've interdicted drugs through the ports of entry, outside of the points of entry, enough fentanyl to kill every american in this country. and people are just denying what they should see in front of them."}
{"original": "wallace: all right. we are blowing --"}
{"original": "conway: and, by the way, on trade, this president has the usmca. get congress to get a vote and put it into law. he struck a great --"}
{"original": "wallace: a lot of people think this is going to hurt them (ph)."}
{"original": "i want to move onto obamacare because the president also announced this week that he wants to kill obamacare, through the courts, including what it does to protect people with pre-existing conditions. here he is."}
{"original": "trump: if the supreme court rules that obamacare is out, we will have a plan that's far better than obamacare."}
{"original": "wallace: simple question, kellyanne, what's the republican plan?"}
{"original": "conway: the republican plan is manifold. and let me just begin by saying even the president's current budget, pre-existing conditions are accounted for. he has said time and again for years including this week that he --"}
{"original": "wallace: you had two years -- you had two years with republicans control of the house --"}
{"original": "wallace: -- and the senate and the white house and you could never -- the gop -- could never come up with a plan that they could all agree on and passed. so --"}
{"original": "conway: well, they need to come and here's why -- by the way, the democrats are opposed to obamacare also. president obama last fall said he likes medicare-for-all. if the democrats actually liked obamacare, they would all be running on obamacare. instead they are running on medicare- for-all, which is a health version of the green new deal which got exactly zero votes in the senate this week."}
{"original": "why? because people make noise about it on the campaign trail and then when i have to vote on nonsense like medicare-for-all and green new deal, they vote present. they didn't get a single positive vote in medicare-for- all. what (ph) medicare-for-all would mean choices for none and apart from the monetary costs, the moral costs are abhorrent. we'd be pushing more people out of the system."}
{"original": "you're going to do away with private insurance, 180 million americans would lose their insurance, more than half of the country."}
{"original": "conway: obamacare has been a failure because one-third of the country had one insurance option, which is no option at all."}
{"original": "conway: the cost $50 billion a year in subsidies."}
{"original": "walalce: kellyanne, i hate interrupting, but if i didn't, i think you might going."}
{"original": "conway: we're going to offer higher quality, lower -- lower cost, more choices and less hassle."}
{"original": "wallace: but there is no plan right now?"}
{"original": "conway: there is a plan. we've been working on a plan for a long time. and we hope that congress would come along."}
{"original": "wallace: right, nine years but you've never actually come up with a whole plan."}
{"original": "conway: well, donald trump has been president for two years. so, give us a chance and we'll have --"}
{"original": "conway: -- we are working on a plan at the white house."}
{"original": "wallace: finally, i'm going to get into something i don't like talking about, i know you don't talk about but i have to tell you that when we announced that you are going to be on the show, more people asked me to ask you about this than any other question. you know where i'm headed here and that is --"}
{"original": "wallace: yes, you do. this is the state of your marriage with george conway."}
{"original": "i'm going to put up some of the things that your husband has said about president trump. just this month, march 5th: wherever he goes and whatever he does, trump will always be summa cum liar. let me try that again, always be summa cum liar."}
{"original": "march 19th: once someone understands narcissistic personality disorder, they understand you."}
{"original": "march 26th: if the charge were on fitness for office, the verdict would already be in: guilty beyond a reasonable doubt."}
{"original": "trump: i don't know him, he's a whack job, there's no question about it and i call him mr. kellyanne. the fact is that he's doing a tremendous disservice to a wife and family. she's a wonderful woman."}
{"original": "wallace: why is your husband attacking your boss?"}
{"original": "conway: well, you could ask my husband. but it doesn't affect my job because my job is to be counsel to the president and do the best job i can do to provide information --"}
{"original": "wallace: do you think -- do you think that he is -- come on, you've obviously thought about this. do you think he's cyberbullying here to try to get you to quit? do you think he's jealous of your high-profile?"}
{"original": "conway: some people think that. and they certainly do."}
{"original": "my first line of protection in this world is and will always be my four children. so i don't really like to discuss this publicly. what i will tell you is that george was very supportive of president trump, cried on election night in his maga hat, blocks away from her at the hilton in new york, wanted to take a job in the trump administration and changed his mind, and was a guest of the president and first lady months after he withdrew himself from consideration."}
{"original": "conway: -- at the white house."}

{"original": "conway: i will tell you that it's unusual for washington too because i think that many women get -- tend to get their power and their position through the men in their lives and this is a little bit different and i'm sure the feminists are going to throw me a parade at some point."}
{"original": "wallace: finally, and you have said that you believe that this has hurt your four children, and understandably, nobody would want to see their mom and dad fighting out in public."}
{"original": "conway: but that's not true, some people would like us to fight."}
{"original": "conway: some people take a little bit too much glee over the situation."}
{"original": "wallace: i don't your children want you to fight."}
{"original": "i guess the question i have to ask, bottom line, final question, has this hurt your marriage?"}
{"original": "conway: oh, chris, what are you, oprah now? i mean, what am i, on a couch and you are a psychiatrist? i think it's a really inappropriate question, and here's why. that's the line over which nobody should have crossed."}
{"original": "so if you want to talk about policy issues, policy disagreements, the fact that george conway, my husband, would prefer that i not work in the white house, i guess you can ask those questions. the president has weighed in. i've weighed in, as modestly as i can."}
{"original": "but now, you're asking a very personal question and i would say to you, you should go ask it of many people."}
{"original": "conway: because i see messy lives living in glass houses all over both cities in which i live."}
{"original": "wallace: i would only point out -- and look, this is not something i'm comfortable talking about, your boss."}
{"original": "conway: i'm surprised you would ask that."}
{"original": "wallace: the president did call him the husband from hell, so it's out there."}
{"original": "conway: i'm surprised that people would ask that question. i have seen home wreckers on tv as marital experts, all of a sudden. it's very amusing to me."}
{"original": "but i think people knew they crossed the line when they're talking about people's marriages. all the stuff about leave us alone in my private life. my family has a right to their private life also."}
{"original": "conway: i have children who are 14, 14, 11 and 9. and the reasons get so much coverage, particularly by the mainstream media is because george conway now agrees with them. he shares the views about president trump and their goals."}
{"original": "conway: but you know what? if you read george's op-ed in the washington post, the headlines didn't match the op-ed. he was talking about the mueller report, the barr memo and i think that they just -- they take glee in this and people should have thought thrice before they crossed a certain line over the last couple of days (ph)."}
{"original": "wallace: kellyanne, i -- you know, as i said, i'm not comfortable people asking it, it is what people are talking about. if i offended you, i'm sorry."}
{"original": "wallace: thank you. thanks for your time. always good to talk with you. please come back."}
{"original": "wallace: up next, we'll get reaction from a top democrat on the house intelligence committee, congressman jim himes, joins us next."}
{"original": "wallace: democrats are threatening to issue a subpoena unless attorney general barr sends them the full mueller report by this tuesday."}
{"original": "so what did they make of barr's plan now to send it to congress by mid- april if not sooner?"}
{"original": "joining us from connecticut, congressman jim himes, the number two democrat on the house intelligence committee."}
{"original": "congressman, let's start with what you told your local newspaper in connecticut this week about whether the mueller report clears the president on the issue of collusion with the russians. here's what you told them."}
{"original": "i'm not sure i would break out a lot of champagne. they try to make the case that the mueller report says there's no evidence of collusion. there's plenty of evidence."}
{"original": "but, congressman, now i'm taking the counterargument to what i was discussing with kellyanne. it doesn't say there's plenty of evidence of collusion."}
{"original": "rep. jim himes, d-ct: no, what the mueller -- well, first of all, nobody knows what the mueller report says, because we haven't seen it. we've got the four-page barr summary."}
{"original": "and even though my republican friends are attacking adam schiff and others by saying that the mueller report says no evidence, that's not at all what it says. if you read the barr letter, the barr letter says that the investigation was not able to establish. so, chris, two things --"}
{"original": "wallace: no, excuse me. with all due respect, sir, that's absolutely incorrect. i'm going to put up on the screen because we know that this probably was going to come up, the specific quote from attorney general barr."}
{"original": "here's what he says: the special counsel did not find that the trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with the russian government in these efforts despite multiple offers from russian affiliated individuals to assist the trump campaign."}
{"original": "so, specifically the special counsel is not saying there is insufficient evidence to prosecute. he saying it didn't happen."}
{"original": "himes: right. so, again, two things are possible at the same time. number one, whatever happened, and there's 400 pages of report that we are going to see, so something happened or it wouldn't be 400 pages long. but whatever happened, the conclusion is that it's not a chargeable offense."}
{"original": "wallace: no, again, sir, respectable, he didn't say it's not a chargeable offense. he said the report did not find that the trump campaign conspired or coordinated."}
{"original": "wallace: on the issue of obstruction, he said, i've got some issues as to whether it's a prosecutable offense. he didn't say that when it came to collusion."}
{"original": "himes: right, chris, but my own quote, which you read back to me, was saying that there was not a finding of no evidence. and that is also true. so, the conclusion is that there was not explicit collusion, conspiracy, but that does not mean that there is no evidence, ok?"}
{"original": "now, that's sort of a fine point. but here's the big picture -- we are accepting that, and adam schiff and his famous speech of last week said, we are accepting the conclusion of bob mueller -- something. of course, that the republicans did not do on benghazi, on uranium one, on clinton emails."}
{"original": "we are accepting that and we want to see the report and this is why i say i wouldn't break out the champagne just yet, for two reasons. one, the conclusion, despite what kellyanne conway just told you, is not clear on obstruction, and number two, again, at 400 pages, we are all speculating about what's in there, but we know about don jr.'s meeting in trump tower."}
{"original": "himes: we know about many people going to jail for lying about russia. my guess is that when you see the whole report, you will see good reasons, good reasons for why a number of people, a lot of people were concerned by the possibility, since disproved, that the trump campaign was colluding with the russians."}
{"original": "wallace: ok, let's move onto another subject, and that is that house democrats are demanding that attorney general barr turnover the entire mueller report by this tuesday, two days from now."}
{"original": "here is basically barr's response to that. barr says that you're going to get it by mid-april, which is two weeks from now, if not sooner. he says he's going to redact grand jury testimony and intelligence material but he says the white house won't get to review it for executive privilege. no white house review for executive of which, which i know it's a big concern of yours."}
{"original": "isn't that a reasonable plan, congressman?"}
{"original": "himes: well, i'll say a couple things. number one, it is absolutely reasonable that they remove all classified information from a report. my guess is it contains a lot of classified information because it pertains to russia. absolutely reasonable."}
{"original": "grand jury information, a little more ambiguous. congress theoretically has the right to that. and then there's that third category, which you didn't mention of information that may be potentially embarrassing to third parties. and then -- but remember, we're talking about a difference of ten days here or so, and so my guess is that this is going to be something that can be negotiated away so that we wind up, as everybody agrees we should, with the mueller report."}
{"original": "wallace: so, in other words, if it's just a matter of ten days or so, this tuesday as opposed to two weeks from then, you're saying that there won't be a subpoena and you'll take yes for an answer."}
{"original": "himes: well, we'll see. i think -- my guess is that jerry nadler and others are probably actually in communication with barr and with the department of justice on the nature of what is slowing them down."}
{"original": "now, remember, congress can and does see classified information, so it's also possible that the department of justice can convey the report just to congress in a closed environment."}
{"original": "but by the way, just to come back to the executive privilege thing, remember, what barr said was that the president has publicly indicated that he wants the report released and therefore we don't anticipate executive privilege claims. but, look, this could get reversed tomorrow morning if the president decides that he wants to change his mind on that. this is a president who has changed his mind in the past. so, we are sensitive to that possibility."}
{"original": "wallace: all right. let's move on to adam schiff, who you talked about and also kellyanne conway talked about."}
{"original": "the president and house republicans, particularly republican members of the house intelligence committee, are going after adam schiff. he, of course, is chairman of the house intelligence committee. you're the number two democrat on that committee. take a look at their -- what they're saying."}
{"original": "donald trump, president: little pencil neck adam schiff."}
{"original": "there could still have been some russia collusion. sick. sick. these are sick people."}
{"original": "rep. kevin mccarthy, r-calif., house minority leader: all americans should be concerned with a chairman of the house intelligence committee taking the position of judge and jury."}
{"original": "wallace: so, house republicans are saying that schiff should step down as chairman of house intelligence. the president has tweeted that he thinks that schiff should be forced to resign from congress."}
{"original": "himes: well, look, the american people will need to decide what they think about a president who poisons our political dialogue by going after people's physical characteristics, calling him pencil neck, et cetera."}
{"original": "on the substance here, you just need to watch what adam schiff said last week in the committee. first of all, he is we accept mueller's findings. something the republicans could never find it in their hearts or minds to do with respect to benghazi, the clinton e-mails, uranium one, i could go on and on. he said we accept the findings. we're not going to do ten investigations the way they did on benghazi."}
{"original": "second, he said, i do not believe it is appropriate for people to lie about contacts with russians. when the report comes out, what the american people will learn was that there was plenty of reason to be concerned about the nature of those contacts and the possibility of what those contacts might have meant."}
{"original": "himes: so i don't see adam schiff as having done anything at all wrong. and, in fact --"}
{"original": "himes: purporting (ph) himself far more responsibly than the republicans ever did on benghazi and the many ginned-up (ph) scandals that they had."}
{"original": "wallace: well, let me -- let me -- let me point out what i think sticks in a lot of republicans craws, and that's what they say adam schiff, in the run-up to the mueller report, said repeatedly that he thought there was a good chance that president trump had committed a crime. here's some clips of adam schiff in just the last couple of months."}
{"original": "schiff.: my takeaways is there's a very real prospect that on the day donald trump leaves office the justice department may indict him."}
{"original": "so there's clear evidence on the issue of collusion and this adds to that body of evidence."}
{"original": "the bigger pardon question may come down the road as the next president has to determine whether to pardon donald trump."}
{"original": "wallace: is that appropriate for the chairman of the house intelligence committee, which is basically and traditionally been seen as non-partisan, above politics -- not always, and i agree in recent years not at all -- but above politics, a fact-finding committee to be talking openly about the president being indicted, the next president having to pardon him before he even knew the results of the report?"}
{"original": "himes: well, we don't need to have the conversation we had previously about whether there was reason to be concerned, evidence or reason, whatever you want to call it, that the president's campaign might be compromised. you know, we -- it's all out there for people to see from the don junior meeting, to so many people lying about contacts with russia. there was reason for this investigation."}
{"original": "now, when -- when adam schiff says that there is a possibility that the president might be indicted after his presidency, remember, chris, as we sit here today, any number of u.s. attorneys in the southern district of new york and elsewhere continue their investigations of the president."}
{"original": "wallace: so -- so basically you're not -- i understand that. so basically you're not troubled by that?"}
{"original": "himes: well, again, i don't think adam said anything that wasn't factual."}
{"original": "adam never said the president is guilty of this. he himself is a former prosecutor. he is more careful than that. he said there was evidence. again, the american people can judge the facts that they know today before the report has been released. as to whether they would have criticized barack obama if barack obama's daughter had met with russians looking for dirt on barack obama's political foes."}
{"original": "himes: they can make that judgment. but until the full report is out, people should reserve judgment on what adam schiff knows or doesn't know, because adam schiff, as chairman of that committee, had access to lots of information that the public does not yet have."}
{"original": "himes: again, i don't say that because i think there's a surprise. we accept the conclusion of the report. but i don't think adam schiff said anything that wasn't true in his -- in the statements you played there."}
{"original": "wallace: congressman himes, thank you. thanks for sharing part of your weekend with us. always good to talk with you, sir, and we'll stay on top of what your committee does next."}
{"original": "wallace: coming up, we'll bring in our sunday group to discuss the president's decision to revive the fight over the affordable care act."}
{"original": "plus, what would you like to ask the panel about president trump's promise about a new health plan that is better than obamacare? just go to facebook or twitter, @foxnewssunday, and we may use your question on the air."}
{"original": "wallace: coming up, the end of the mueller investigation hasn't ended the partisan bickering around it."}
{"original": "trump: there has to be accountability, because it's all lies."}
{"original": "pelosi: i think they're just scaredy cats. they just don't know what to do."}
{"original": "wallace: we'll ask our sunday panel if what the attorney general plans to send congress is good enough."}
{"original": "trump: the democrats have to now decide whether they will continue defrauding the public with ridiculous bull (expletive deleted)."}
{"original": "wallace: well, president trump, in his own way, telling a rally in michigan this week democrats owe the country an apology for pushing the russia investigation for more than two years."}
{"original": "and it's time now for our sunday group. the co-host of benson and harf on fox news radio, guy benson, charles lane from the washington post, author of the new book freedom's detective, julie pace, washington bureau chief for the associated press, and josh holmes, senator mitch mcconnell's former chief of staff."}
{"original": "so, julie, some folks, especially democrats, say that the president is jumping the gun going on this victory tour declaring complete victory on the mueller report and that when it finally comes out there will be a bunch of stuff in there that he's not going to like and that they're going to have to explain. what's the feeling in the white house, let's just take the good news and if there's bad news later we'll deal with it later?"}
{"original": "julie pace, the associated press: pretty much. i mean i think there have always been legal questions and political questions when it comes to the -- to the mueller investigation. and from the legal perspective, this is indisputably good news for the president. you know, we always believed that mueller was never going to be able to charge him because of justice department guidelines about a sitting president, but there were real questions that surrounded other people in the president's orbit, including his son, donald trump junior. and the mueller investigation ended with no additional criminal charges. that is good news for the white house. there is no other way to spin that."}
{"original": "on the political question, i think we don't completely know yet how this will cut. i think that if you look at the totality of the investigation, it certainly hasn't been good for the president. his national security advisor had to plead guilty. his campaign chairman is going to be in jail for several years. but i do think that the president sees this as a way to rally his base heading into his reelection, to cast this investigation as politically motivated and to get some of his voters really energized heading into 2020."}
{"original": "wallace: guy, whatever we end up reading, and they're probably -- i mean you can tell from the summary of the mueller report from barr, there's evidence on both sides on obstruction, not on collusion. whatever we end up reading in the report, isn't this a big victory for donald trump, both politically and legally in the sense he was being -- he was investigated for more than two years by federal authorities and they end up finding no evidence apparently of collusion and apparently no criminal evidence, nothing prosecutable, when it comes to obstruction."}
{"original": "guy benson, co-host, benson and harf: of course it's a huge victory for him. i'd also say it's a victory for the american people that the president and his team did not collude with a hostile foreign government to steal an election. that is something we should all be celebrating. there's some glum faces around washington, which i think is telling."}
{"original": "but, yes, the president has been not only accused of being a criminal for the last two years, but in a lot of precincts of being some sort of a traitor. and now we see from bob mueller, who was determined to be the gold standard, and i actually have always agreed with that, no conspiracy and no coordination. i think a lot of democrats are focusing on the word conspiracy, look we heard from your last guest, well, this isn't a crime necessarily. the word coordination was also ruled out by the special counsel. to me that is very significant."}
{"original": "i think we should wait for the entire report to come forward. i think the full football spiking might be premature. there's going to be some embarrassing stuff in there, no question. but the bottom line on the central thrust of what mueller was investigated for two years, it's a vindication broadly for the president."}
{"original": "wallace: then there was the president's decision -- surprising decision this week to jump into a court case that would strike down all of obamacare if it is -- this was a judgment by a district judge in texas -- if it goes through the appeals process. here was the back-and-forth on that."}
{"original": "trump: they are going to work together to come up with something that's really spectacular. maybe we'll even get support in the house from democrats. but it's going to be far better than obamacare."}
{"original": "chuck schumer, d-n.y., senate minority leader: the president wants to go back to repeal and replace again? make our day."}
{"original": "wallace: we asked you for questions for the panel, and on this question of the president's promise to produce a new gop health plan, we got this on facebook from jacob staven, why, after nine years, do the republicans not have any replacement plan? why after two years does trump not have a replacement plan? all they have is repeal. that's not a plan."}
{"original": "josh, you expressed big concerns this week about president trump and the white house deciding to go back and re-litigate obamacare. how do you answer jacob?"}
{"original": "josh holmes, founder, cavalry: well, look, i think there's a practical problem here and there's a political problem here. the practical problem is, unless you believe that speaker pelosi is going to work hand in glove with the trump administration and senator majority leader mitch mcconnell to repeal obamacare and come up with a replacement, we're talking about an exercise in futility. the second piece of this, which i think is more broadly concerning, is the fact that the issue selection is not exactly where it needs to be here. they're fighting a battle that has been waged for eight years and largely decided in august of 2017."}
{"original": "where we're at now is democrats full-throated embrace of a medicare for all policy. and i've got to tell you, the one biggest political liability that you can accrue in politics is separating families from coverage that they have, despite the efforts of their federal government, be able to navigate and provide for their families. that's where democrats are right now and that's really where the trump administration and all republicans out to focus."}
{"original": "wallace: so how big a gift was the president's decision to get back into the obamacare fight to democrats?"}
{"original": "charles lane, the washington post: it could be a big gift if they persist in it. if it is a one-off thing that just sort of popped out of the white house in the wake of the mueller thing because as --"}
{"original": "wallace: and when you say if they persist, you mean the -- the president?"}
{"original": "lane: you know, mick mulvaney thought what's -- now's our chance to get at -- at obamacare."}
{"original": "it's very important to understand that the republicans actually -- they may not have a whole repeal and replace plan for obamacare, but they have plans for health care, which include things like work requirements for medicaid, which are not super popular around the country. that it's -- there's a good case to be made that the 2018 election went overwhelmingly in the house for the democrats because they harped on pre-existing conditions. it republicans are threatening your pre-existing conditions. and that's what nancy pelosi and chuck schumer see coming -- coming back. it's just fallen right back into their laps. here comes the republican administration threatening that again. and, you know, they're going to -- i think if they're smart, the white house will backpedal quickly and this will be a passing thing."}
{"original": "pace: and this is partially why republicans were so frustrated because they thought that the debate had changed. they thought at least they had gotten the president and a lot of their vulnerable lawmakers to the place where they could accept pre-existing conditions, where they could accept the provisions of obamacare that let people stay on their parent's health insurance until they're 26. those are broadly popular. there's very little appetite anywhere in -- in either party to do away with those right now. and suddenly the administration is out there saying we want to get rid of the whole thing again."}
{"original": "wallace: so we'll see what -- because the -- the democratic presidential candidates are talking about medicare for all, which is a much more controversial issue. but protecting obamacare has become increasingly popular."}
{"original": "all right, panel, take a break here. when we come back, beto o'rourke has his official launch and joe biden faces new scrutiny as he makes a decision whether to run. we'll check in on where the 2020 democratic race stands now."}
{"original": "joe biden, former vice president: when anita hill came to testify, she faced a committee that didn't fully understand what the hell it was all about. to this day, i regret i couldn't come up with a way to get her the kind of hearing she deserved."}
{"original": "wallace: well, former vice president joe biden apologizing this week for the way he handled anita hill's testimony in the clarence thomas confirmation hearing for the supreme court in 1991."}
{"original": "and we're back now with the panel."}
{"original": "we're going to get to the other part of the biden story in a moment. but, josh, biden had a tough week this week, even without this latest allegation from lucy flores in nevada. first, his comments about anita hill and the hearing in which he seemed to apologize for being a white guy and that all the members of the committee at that time were white guys, and then to say that he apologized for not giving her the hearing she deserved. after all, he was the chairman of the committee."}
{"original": "holmes: right. and he's not even in the race yet, chris. i mean this is going to get worse. and i think what we're watching from joe biden at this point is twisting himself into a pretzel trying to appeal to a primary electorate on the democratic side that frankly has moved far beyond the joe bidens of the world."}
{"original": "what he's talking about now is basically a world apology tour. and that's not going to work. that's not going to sell in iowa, new hampshire or anywhere else. ultimately what the challenges that he faces is that he is no longer representative of that core primary electorate that will determine who the next democratic nominee for president is."}
{"original": "wallace: now, there is also, as we've been discussing this morning with kellyanne conway, potentially a much more serious problem, that involves a woman named lucy flores. she was a state legislator in nevada running for lieutenant governor in 2014. joe biden there with her on the stage at a rally supporting her."}
{"original": "but, it turns out, she alleges that before, in private, off camera, he came up behind her, he touched her shoulders, then he came in and kissed the back of her head. he says, or his staff says, that he doesn't recall the incident. he put out a statement this morning to say, i'm a huggy guy. i certainly didn't think i'd ever bothered anybody."}
{"original": "but here is the reaction from another democratic candidate already, senator elizabeth warren."}
{"original": "sen. elizabeth warren, d-mass., 2020 presidential candidate: i believe lucy flores. and joe biden needs to give an answer."}
{"original": "question: should he not run as a result?"}
{"original": "warren: that's for joe biden to decide."}
{"original": "wallace: julie, you have covered the vice president for years. are you surprised that this would come up about the -- the -- the issue of inappropriate touching?"}
{"original": "pace: i'm not surprised. joe biden -- anybody who has covered him has seen these -- these moments. he is quite an affectionate person. there are moments where he's been on camera in front of big crowds and he's put his hands on women's shoulders. he nuzzles them. it's -- it's part of what people have -- have called kind of the uncle joe persona."}
{"original": "i think the challenge for joe biden is, you know, due those moments look different in 2019 when we are in a place where we've gone through the me too movement, which has really, i think, cause people to take a fresh look at the -- at the behavior of men in powerful positions. you know, this is not necessarily sexual assault, but if he was making women feel uncomfortable, if he was using his position of authority to do that, that is not going to be looked at favorably, certainly by this democratic electorate."}
{"original": "wallace: well, it reminded a lot of people of this incident, let's put it up on the screen. this is 2015. and they you see ash carter being sworn in as defense secretary and joe biden is touching the wife of ash carter, puts his hand on her shoulders, nuzzles in and asks her -- says something -- whispers something into her -- into her ear."}
{"original": "guy, could this be a problem, a serious problem, especially, as julie points out, in the me too movement, period."}
{"original": "benson: yes, it could be for him. and i think a lot of conservatives are saying, hang -- hang on a second. all of a sudden it's news that joe biden is handsy with women. this has been a conservative meme for eight years at least. and that video you just played is one of many examples."}
{"original": "i think it's very clear that joe biden is not going to win a wokeness primary. and if he tries to, he's going to fail. and i think between -- not necessarily this story, but a lot of the shots being fired already, these are warning signals from the left that if he gets in, they are going to make his life miserable. and i think he needs to be fully aware of that if he decides to jump in."}
{"original": "lane: i'm going to just take the other side of this for a moment politically with two words for anyone who thinks joe biden is finished. ralph northam. we thought he was finished and he's still around. these things have --"}
{"original": "wallace: well, wait, wait, but there's a difference."}
{"original": "lane: no, no, the difference --"}
{"original": "wallace: ralph -- ralph northam is the governor. it's a question of kicking him out. the other guys' got to actually win a primary."}
{"original": "lane: i'm just saying, people have a way of surviving things that you think they can't survive. and so we should all just be prepared for that possibility."}
{"original": "but i do think this -- what this -- let -- and the other point i would make is he's still well above the rest of the field in the polls. so at least he came into this with a reservoir of good will. but it was inevitable that democrats would have to go negative on one another in such a large field. and being the front runner, you're the one everyone's going to target."}
{"original": "so i guess the hope for biden would be that he's still not officially candidate, but that this will somehow get processed before he is one and he'll be in some way inoculated against it. but i just wouldn't rule out the possibility that he's not finished, you know, already."}
{"original": "wallace: does anybody at this table think that joe biden won't get into the race?"}
{"original": "pace: i think there's a chance."}
{"original": "pace: i mean we have -- i think there's a chance he doesn't get in. i mean joe biden has this operation around him right now that is completely set up, waiting for him to turn to them and say, i'm ready, and he hasn't said that yet. and he's been pushing this deadline back and back and back. we're now talking possibly late april is the -- is the new timeframe that some people around him are using."}
{"original": "and joe biden knows better than anybody what this would entail. you know, what is the thing that he is going to learn over the next couple of weeks that will push him over the finish line? i think the longer that this goes on, yes, it leaves open the possibility that he doesn't do this ultimately."}
{"original": "holmes: he might be at the point of no return. i think the draft biden movement has gotten big enough where it's going to be very, very difficult for him to walk that back. but i -- you know, to the point that guy made earlier, i think that's honestly a mistake. i don't think that he can compete in this primary electorate."}
{"original": "lane: well, if he doesn't get it, it will be a real watershed in the history of the democratic party because it will be the end of that whole generation of leaders and they'll be moving into sort of an unknown new -- new land with this whole bunch of newcomers, ideologically very different, diverse from one another and it would be a real free-for-all."}

{"original": "there's a health care reform idea making the rounds and garnering significant attention these days. it is the very plausible sounding medicare-for-all. who could argue with expanding a program that america's seniors generally like and indeed have come to rely on? after all, if it's good enough for the grandparents, isn't it good enough for everyone else?"}
{"original": "well, just as not every shiny thing has value when you're panning, this idea truly is fool's gold."}
{"original": "census data shows a majority of americans obtain their health insurance from their employers (56 percent). this is followed by medicaid (19.3 percent), medicare (17.2 percent), direct-purchase coverage (16.0 percent), and military coverage (4.8 percent)."}
{"original": "trump has broken free of obamacare's grip, but more reforms can and must be made"}
{"original": "it's important to note that the current medicare program is not self-sufficient. payroll taxes collected from workers and employers and all of the premiums paid by those enrolled cover only about half of medicare's costs. taxpayers subsidize the rest."}
{"original": "when it comes to those with employer-provided health plans, a 2018 survey released by america's health insurance plans shows 71 percent are satisfied with their current coverage. why then would anyone advocate expanding a program headed for insolvency in 2026 according to the medicare board of trustees, while simultaneously upending the employer provided plans that americans like?"}
{"original": "medicare-for-all threatens to make the same exact mistake obamacare made – expanding health care coverage over controlling health care costs. but think for a moment. why do millions of americans, even after years of obamacare, still lack health insurance? the answer is simple: it is too expensive."}
{"original": "numerous experts have estimated the cost of medicare-for-all, including former medicare board of trustees member charles blahous. he estimates the cost to the federal budget at $32.6 trillion. the urban institute estimated $32 trillion over10 years as well. medicare-for-all would double the size of federal government spending. even a doubling of corporate and individual income taxes would fail to cover its costs."}
{"original": "but cost is just one issue. medicare-for-all is mandatory, single-payer national health insurance. there is no opt-out provision, and there are no private health plans, as competition with the government would be illegal. it would replace the medicare tailored exclusively for seniors with a one-size-fits-all plan that would even wipe out the current and popular medicare advantage plans, with enrollees responsible for 20 percent of the cost."}
{"original": "besides paying more for health care, patients would undoubtedly receive inferior care. extensive wait times seen in countries like canada and the u.k. would now be the norm in the u.s. current wait times in canada are 47 weeks for neurosurgery, 38 weeks for orthopedic surgery, and 29 weeks for ophthalmology, to name just three."}
{"original": "and, with current medicare payments already 40 percent below private payments, more hospitals would close if this payment scheme were thrust on the entire system. the current physician shortage would worsen as reimbursement rates and pay were capped to control costs. anyone who ever lived through or read about war time rationing would see a return to the ugly side of an economy of shortages."}
{"original": "more incremental and market-based approaches are achievable at much less expense, and with the potential to truly control costs, which is the main problem in the u.s. health care system. the association of mature american citizens (amac) supports expansion of health savings accounts (hsas) with their triple tax advantages, more transparency with prescription and medical procedure pricing, and eliminating the middle men when it comes to drug pricing."}
{"original": "amac has been a strong advocate of the good samaritan charitable services act, which would allow doctors to treat up to 20 patients free of charge (pro bono) in exchange for a small tax deduction (capped at $50). billions in annual medicaid costs would be saved, and families would have a doctor/patient relationship rather than using expensive emergency rooms as their primary source of health care."}

{"original": "it's important to have all the facts. some polls show support for medicare-for-all. but when those polled are informed of the doubling of taxes required to fund such a scheme, support collapses. no wonder advocates choose not to discuss costs."}

{"original": "she called their behavior a serious breach of conduct and dismissed the entire speech as beneath the dignity of the white house."}
{"original": "earlier thursday, trump held up two newspapers with blaring acquitted headlines at the national prayer breakfast mere feet from pelosi, d-calif."}
{"original": "trump first picked up a usa today newspaper and presented it before the audience. he then put it down and picked up a copy of thursday's washington post, which had a similar headline."}
{"original": "he later addressed the audience and took some not-so-subtle swipes at pelosi once more."}
{"original": "i don't like people who use their faith as justification for doing what they know is wrong, nor do i like people who say 'i pray for you' when you know that is not so, he said. pelosi had publicly said during the impeachment process that she and fellow democrats were prayerful and that she prays for the president."}

{"original": "take a quick glance at obamacare's busted multimillion-dollar website and the 3.5 million health insurance cancelation notices hitting american mailboxes and you might be tempted to dub the whole thing a disaster. but it's not -- at least not for the politically-connected crony companies and big money obama fundraisers poaching your tax dollars to fix the debacle they helped create."}
{"original": "as cnbc recently put it: thanks to obamacare, the health-care industry is going to get a big makeover during the coming years and venture capitalists have wasted no time looking for ways to cash in. put simply, obamacare's complexity and catastrophic rollout create rivers of cash for obama's cronies."}
{"original": "so who are some of the winners in the obamacare crony capitalist giveaway?"}
{"original": "for those on the left who thought that obamacare would mean large health insurance companies might get their comeuppance, they might want to look at unitedhealth. wall street analysts expect the giant to see its stock price rise 40 percent over the next two years, thanks to expanding profit margins. the company has also won big contracts to help implement the rollout. quality software services, inc., a major contractor for healthcare.gov, is a subsidiary of unitedhealth. one of president obama's most reliable fundraisers in both 2008 and 2012 was anthony welters, executive vice president of unitedhealth. he raised more than $500,000 for the 2012 election, according to opensecrets.org"}
{"original": "another big obamacare winner is tech giant qualcomm. in 2011, the company created a subsidiary called qualcomm life specifically designed to profit off obamacare changes. the company offers products to securely transfer data between wireless health care devices. thanks to obamacare, company executives believe that wireless solutions are going to be looked at more prominently. former qualcomm chairman irwin jacobs raised more than $500,000 for obama's re-election in 2012."}
{"original": "also poised to do well is obama bundler david friedman, founder of sandy river health systems, which works in health care, nursing homes, and long-term care. friedman raised more than $500,000 for obama's re-election in 2012."}
{"original": "obama bundlers who are private equity investors also stand to make a mint. obama bundler jay snyder (he raised more than $500,000) heads up hbj investments, which was founded by his father. hbj invests in health care medical companies and pharmaceuticals positioned to cash in on obamacare."}
{"original": "vice president al gore and investor david blood head up investment firm generational investment management. the company may be known for backing green energy businesses, but earlier this year generational investment management invested heavily in health care stocks -- a full 27 percent of the portfolio for generation investment management llp is made up of health care investments. predictably, gore and blood's firm is expected to cash in on obamacare. and, predictably, blood bundled more than $500,000 for obama in 2012."}
{"original": "bundler robert pohlad (who bundled more than $500,000 for obama in 2012) is the head of pohlad companies, which has a subsidiary called arcadia solutions, a software company that is selling software to hospitals and doctors affected by healthcare reform."}
{"original": "obamacare is also spurring a growing number of mergers among hospitals and other health care providers, according to the new york times. as another paper notes, because of all the new regulations and changes to how hospitals are paid, look for more mergers and consolidation. this creates opportunities for wall street dealmakers like evercore partners, which, in september, hired away matthew mcaskin from goldman sachs where he was the co-head of the healthcare services investment banking unit. in its announcement, evercore noted that mcaskin has advised on a number of the most recent notable transactions in the hospital, managed care, hcit, physician services and outsourced medical services subsectors and that health care represents one of the largest and most active industries for investment banking services. evercore boasted at least two big dollar bundlers for obama, the most prominent bundler being roger altman, co-chair of the company, who bundled between $200,000 and $500,000 for obama in 2012."}
{"original": "another big obama fundraiser who stands to profit from the obamacare debacle is alexa wesner of austin ventures. the investment firm has big stakes in emerus hospital partners, llc, eso solutions (which offers software to the health care industry), and explorys, inc., which hopes to leverage big data in the health care sphere. wesner bundled over $500,000 for obama in 2012"}
{"original": "obamacare may be a disaster for the millions of americans whose health insurance plans are being canceled, the millions of americans who cannot use the government's website, and the taxpayers forced to foot the bill for the boondoggle. but make no mistake -- at least one group of americans loves obamacare: the president's big money backers and cronies who stand to bag millions of your tax dollars amid the mess."}
{"original": "while starting a debate focused on the coronavirus by coughing wasn't the best move by former vice president joe biden, he employed the right strategy in his first one-on-one matchup against sen. bernie sanders on sunday night, making it about solutions versus a revolution."}
{"original": "biden addressed the coronavirus crisis and every topic discussed with real answers to the existing challenges we face today. in contrast, sanders missed the mark by relying on his stump speech about a revolution to change health care and other important aspects of american society."}
{"original": "with a very strong performance, biden was the clear winner of the debate between the democratic presidential candidates."}
{"original": "sanders attacks biden record as one-on-one debate turns personal: 'don't laugh, joe'"}
{"original": "yes, many headlines will focus on the commitment biden made to select a woman as his vice presidential running mate. he also made news by committing to put an african-american woman on the supreme court if he becomes president."}
{"original": "but it was the stark contrast between biden and sanders, and by extension with president trump, that really mattered in the debate."}
{"original": "biden's pledges on female appointments were meaningful historically and politically. it was also smart to make sure there was a headline or two, in case the evening didn't go well. but biden not only made news – he delivered a great performance as well."}
{"original": "the former vice president provided specifics throughout the debate – whether it was calling for dealing with the worsening coronavirus crisis by adding more hospital beds or deploying the military to assist the emergency response. he showed he knew what to do about the pandemic, as well as a range of other topics."}
{"original": "rarely did sanders tackle a problem head-on with a solution. instead, he leaned on his well-worn campaign rhetoric or parts of his record – especially his oft-repeated desire to reform the health care system with medicare-for-all."}
{"original": "in contrast, biden did an especially good job defending the obama administration bailouts that saved the economy and prevented the great recession from becoming a depression. he pointed out that many of the very people who sanders constantly claims to represent – blue-collar workers, small-business owners, and hourly wage earners – would have been hurt the most if sanders had his way and thwarted the bailout."}
{"original": "the context of this debate was clear before it started. biden is the presumptive democratic nominee with what looks like an insurmountable delegate lead. he is expected to defeat sanders in upcoming primaries and clinch the party's presidential nomination."}
{"original": "in this first and perhaps only one-one-one sanders-biden debate (if sanders ends his campaign early) sanders tried to get commitments from biden to support his policies and move to the left."}
{"original": "sanders foreshadowed his strategy in remarks he made in the wake of his losses last tuesday in a string of primaries."}
{"original": "but biden preempted sanders by announcing before the debate he supported free public college tuition for any family with an income less than $125,000."}
{"original": "looking ahead to the november election, each candidate pledged to support and campaign for the other if his competitor becomes the democratic presidential nominee."}
{"original": "sanders likes biden, which will advance efforts at party unity. biden has always treated sanders well from the day sanders walked into the senate."}
{"original": "this also made for a much better debate and allowed viewers to focus on the stark policy differences between the two candidates."}
{"original": "at the end of the debate, you saw the differences between biden and sanders. but you could also see the differences between biden and trump. and a debate between them could be a doozy."}
{"original": "holding a debate focused on the coronavirus without an audience was the best idea of the night. it allowed everyone to see how sanders, biden and trump are reacting to the pandemic."}
{"original": "add to this biden's strong, aggressive performance throughout and that made him the clear winner."}
{"original": "from his experience in the obama white house and long senate service, biden repeatedly offered specific details about how to tackle problems, pointing to his previous experience doing the same and showing voters he could get the job done."}
{"original": "in one exchange biden got right to the point by focusing on medicare-for-all and the coronavirus, showing viewers that proselytizing for single-payer government health insurance isn't the answer."}
{"original": "that has nothing to do with whether or not you have an insurance policy, biden said. this is a crisis. we're at war with a virus. we're at war with a virus. it has nothing to do with co-pays or anything."}
{"original": "biden repeatedly stated that now isn't the time for a revolution because we need to solve problems immediately. then he pointed to the fact that sanders still hasn't said how much medicare-for-all would cost."}
{"original": "sanders knows he won't be the nominee and you could see it in his debate performance. that doesn't mean he won't keep trying to get biden onboard with his positions."}
{"original": "biden really hit his stride talking about bidencare building on obamacare to tackle health care and the coronavirus pandemic, and reminding viewers in a very personal way about his own experience with health care crises. his first wife and daughter died in a car accident in 1972 and his son beau died in 2015 of brain cancer."}
{"original": "the former vice president noted that most people want to have hope when faced with a health crisis."}
{"original": "biden put it all together on a night when our country is facing one of its biggest challenges in the coronavirus pandemic. if he can continue to perform during the next eight months the way he did sunday night then trump will have an even bigger challenge on his hands to stay in the white house."}
{"original": "with what seems to be an insurmountable delegate hill to climb, sanders entered the debate looking like the loser in the nomination race. so sanders' strategy in the debate was to get biden to move to the left and endorse sanders' proposals about health care, climate change, immigration and other issues."}
{"original": "but sanders failed to push biden as far left as the senator from vermont would have liked. in addition, sanders hesitancy to commit to picking a woman running mate gave us a window into him and his campaign that wasn't a winning look."}
{"original": "sanders was effective when he reminded viewers of votes biden has taken in the past that don't look good today."}
{"original": "as a senator in 1996, biden voted for the defense of marriage act, which barred the federal government from recognizing same-sex unions for the purpose of federal benefits. also as a senator, he voted in 2002 to give president george w. bush the right to take military action against iraq, voted for the hyde amendment that barred the use of federal funds to pay for abortions except to save the life of the woman or if the pregnancy was a result of rape or incest, and voted for legislation that made it harder to declare bankruptcy."}

{"original": "sanders voted against all the above measures and sought to use the old votes against biden in their debate sunday night."}
{"original": "but even that effort failed when biden hit back by reminding everyone that sanders voted against the brady act gun control legislation five times and voted to give gun manufacturers protection from lawsuits."}
{"original": "furthermore, sanders never answered biden's question about why he voted against sanctions on russia for interfering in our 2016 presidential election."}
{"original": "while sanders may have won some points in these exchanges he lost the debate."}
{"original": "click here to get the fox news app"}
{"original": "finally, sanders at one point lectured biden that biden would be a weak candidate against trump because he couldn't muster the enthusiasm of voters. biden punctured that argument by noting he increased turnout and broke records in the primaries while sanders outspent him more than two-to-one in some contests."}
{"original": "sanders knows he won't be the nominee and you could see it in his debate performance. that doesn't mean he won't keep trying to get biden onboard with his positions. but sanders is unlikely to have any more luck with that in the future."}

{"original": "sanders has signaled a willingness to pass legislation without gop support by using this special process that's reserved for tax and fiscal matters. the first test could be biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief legislation that is the first priority for the new democratic administration."}
{"original": "biden's covid-19 proposal also includes a provision to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, vaccine funding, money for schools and state and local governments -- priorities that may not fit into budget reconciliation rules. democrats may be required to pick up gop votes or compromise for a smaller package that has bipartisan support."}

{"original": "but first, tomorrow marks day 13 of the government shut down and while president trump and the republicans are working around the clock to come up with a compromise, to get funding for border security democrats are doing their best to delay and score political points as the situation at our southern border grows more dire by the day."}
{"original": "just look at what happened monday night. a violent mob of more than 150 illegal immigrants rushed the border, putting women and children in danger, even reportedly pushing them to the front while clashing with border patrol agents."}
{"original": "this is the second such incident since the caravan arrived late last year. president trump says, it's more proof he needs the money to build the wall."}
{"original": "president donald trump: we have a very tough border. i think you've see that even last night where people charged the border, tried to get through but they couldn't because we have a wall up. if they knew they had a physical barrier, if they knew they had a wall. if they knew they had something that's going to stop them, they would have never come up in the first place."}
{"original": "we're in a shut down because democrats refused to fund the border security. they try and make it like it's just about the wall and it is about the wall. the areas that are built, nobody's getting through, you can't get through unless you're a world class pole vaulter in the olympic team."}
{"original": "chaffetz: we've got a big line up for you tonight covering all the angles. former acting ice director, tom homan is here plus congressman mark meadows and jim jordan but we begin with trace gallagher in our west coast news room with the backstory. trace."}
{"original": "trace gallagher, fox news reporter: jason, the border patrol says just after midnight on new year's, it fired tear gas at a group of migrants because they were throwing rocks and trying to climb the border fence, saying the migrants were again showing their propensity for violence. watch."}
{"original": "unidentified male: instead of trying to come north or surrender, they decided to assault border patrol agents with a hail of rocks. our agents responded with the least amount of force they possibly could to protect themselves and the border and did actually secure the border in this area."}
{"original": "gallagher: but an associated press photographer disputes the border patrol sequence of events, saying the rocks were thrown after the tear gas was launched, though there appears to be no dispute that more than a 100 migrants did rush the border and used a variety of tactics to climb over and under the fence."}
{"original": "and former ice director thomas homan says it's no coincidence that tv cameras happen to be rolling."}
{"original": "tom homan, former director, ice: the people that plan this and motivate this caravan are taking on the board patrol. they want to make it a story about border patrol abusing the civil rights of these aliens. and again, the border patrol is doing their job."}
{"original": "gallagher: no reports of major injuries but dozens of migrants were arrested. this marks the second time in two months that caravan members have stormed the border and the second time that border agents have pushed them back using tear gas and pepper spray."}
{"original": "meantime in the wake of two migrant children who died in the custody of immigration agents, customs and border protection says the number of sick kids at the border is soaring and that they are now referring 50 people a day for urgent medical care including for tuberculosis, flu and women about to give birth."}
{"original": "most of those who need care are children, in fact 20% of all cases are those under the age of five. cpb also says most of those needing medical help were sick before they arrived at the border and many of the migrants have acknowledge being told that if they brought their young children to the border, they would get more lenient treatment by u. s. authorities. jason."}
{"original": "chaffetz: thanks trace. joining me now tom homan, former acting ice director and fox news contributor and francisco hernandez, an immigration attorney. gentleman, thank you for being here. it's tough to see kids particularly, at the border but it does appear francisco, that a lot of these parents have been told that it would be easier to get into the united states if they brought their kids and that they're trying to use these kids in order to you know make their way into united states."}
{"original": "francisco hernandez, immigration attorney: absolutely, we are the country where it's easier to get forgiveness than permission. i do want to say, i can't understand why special agent homan was not made permanent director of ice."}
{"original": "i mean, he is - he does have the support of the troops, he has my respect and he has real solutions but the problem is here, never blaming the democrats, we just took over the house today."}
{"original": "what happened to the last two years? why couldn't they build the wall? why couldn't they do immigration reform the last two years, we're sitting down and nothing is getting done."}
{"original": "chaffetz: it's a math problem. francisco, it's a math problem and that number is 60."}
{"original": "chaffetz: they require 60. the house of representatives did pass a $5 billion you know, appropriation at $5 billion to build the wall but to say that the republican have the house and senate, the president - presidency--"}
{"original": "hernandez: why are republicans scared? why are republicans scared of a democrat filibuster. let them show their true colors and let them filibuster but put something on the table."}
{"original": "hernandez: i'm scared of the democrat filibuster."}
{"original": "chaffetz: don't tell. hold on, i want to bring tom here. i want to bring in tom homan in here."}
{"original": "hernandez: i would yield to him."}
{"original": "chaffetz: that - that - so that - but i agree with you, i think the senate should have voted in the 115th congress on the bill that was passed out by the house. tom, though i want to get to the situation on the border. you've got border patrol agents, they're not very well compensated, they put all the weight on their shoulders but the border patrol agents, they do want to wall, don't they?"}
{"original": "and how are they dealing? how do you how do you instruct and teach people and tell people to deal with people who supposedly are coming to claim asylum but they're throwing rocks at you and trying to sneak under the border over a wall."}
{"original": "homan: well, look, these border patrol agents, they are well trained first of all and you said, they're not being compensated very much. they're not being compensated at all right now. i mean, these men and women are working without being paid."}
{"original": "homan: and they're putting their lives on line for this country and i saw what happened on the border and look, they're doing the best job they can."}
{"original": "homan: they want to protect this border and using tear gas was a minimal use necessary to protect themselves, they can't be hit with rocks. i mean, so"}
{"original": "chaffetz: they do what they got to do."}
{"original": "homan: --they're doing a job and we all salute for doing their job but you know, i said it in an earlier show, this isn't all by accident. these demonstrations and you know, there's a lot of - there's a lot of pushing going on the southern border, these caravans are trying to make the news."}
{"original": "they want to put the border patrol in bad light. they want to be on the front page of every newspaper in the world so you're not going to convince me that 7000 people, one at a time decided, hey, let's all go to united states. this has been a managed - this has been planned by certain groups and--"}
{"original": "hernandez: you're correct, preach on, yes, i'll sign up with special agent homan. he's absolutely right."}
{"original": "chaffetz: but francisco, why are these people not going to the port of entry? i mean that's where the resources are."}
{"original": "hernandez: because they can't get in the port of entry. they can't - this is an entire orchestrated, we don't know if it was from the right or the left but there is no way 7000 people all of a sudden get up and come over here in unison and none of them looked like they missed a meal, okay?"}
{"original": "this is politics, it is a political ghost, we're afraid of it, we can't touch it but we're all afraid of it. let's just get down the immigration reform. if democrats going to block it, let them filibuster, let them show their true colors."}
{"original": "chaffetz: no argument, senate should be voting, no doubt about that."}
{"original": "chaffetz: i want to ask mr. homan though, for a second though. there's a report out today that when the compressional leaders went over to meet with the white house, secretary nielsen was going to give a briefing and that they were interrupted by either ms. pelosi or mr. schumer and they really didn't want to get the briefing when they went to the white house."}
{"original": "what runs through your mind when you hear stories like that?"}
{"original": "homan: it is unconscionable that our democratic leadership did not let the senate confirm homeland security secretary give them a security briefing on the border. i mean, she was going to share with them, she got some of all the numbers, how many criminals have been arrested coming across the border? how many terrorists have been arrested coming across the border?"}
{"original": "how many criminals have been arrested by ice that are here illegally, that obviously came into the united states illegally. she was going to give them a real life situation on the border. how many children are sick? how many people coming need medical attention? how many people come with diseased?"}
{"original": "and they refused to let her give them a briefing. they have the number one responsibility of this country as congressional representatives and get a security briefing by the border. they didn't want to hear because it doesn't fall in line with their talking points of there's no problem on the border. nancy pelosi -"}
{"original": "homan: there's no crime, there's no disease at the border."}
{"original": "chaffetz: gentlemen, i got to get your reaction."}
{"original": "homan: if they would have only heard it, they would have known."}
{"original": "chaffetz: fair enough. i've only got a minute left."}
{"original": "hernandez: why do we let the democrats - why do we let them to tail wag the dog. democrats been a minority for two years. why are we letting them discuss."}
{"original": "homan: jason, let me tell you when these happened. since they shut down the secretary today, if the president of united states is watching, i implore you to have a presidential address to the entire nation in prime time and share this data with american people."}
{"original": "they voted for you to secure this border, they need to hear this data on the criminals and the gangs and the drugs coming across as border. go around nancy and mr. schumer, talk to american people, you will win their support. you're doing the right thing."}
{"original": "hernandez: sign me up. that's a man speaking the truth right there, absolutely. i'll fold, i'm with him, absolutely."}
{"original": "chaffetz: well, good, gentlemen, thank you very much for what you do and thanks for joining in this discussion but i've got to move on to another topic but it's really the same topic because president trump is asking congressional leaders to return to the white house on friday to try to hammer out a deal on national security."}
{"original": "but neither side appears willing to compromise. what that actually means?"}
{"original": "unidentified female: how long do you think the government is going to stay partially shut down?"}
{"original": "trump: could be a long time or it could be quickly. could be a long time. it's too important a subject to walk away from. we're in the shut down because of the fact that the democrats are looking to 2020. i actually think it's bad politics but i'm not thinking about the politics."}
{"original": "i'm thinking about what's right and what's wrong. and we need a physical barrier. everything else is bells and whistles."}
{"original": "chuck schumer, minority leader, united states senate: the bottom line is very simple. at our last meeting the president said, i am going to shut the government down. they are now feeling the heat. he says he won't sign it and use the government as hostage, we should just give in. the american people don't want that, that's bad for our country and that's not the way to govern."}
{"original": "nancy pelosi, minority leader, house of representatives: we're asking the president to open up the government. we are giving him a republican path to do that. why would he not do it?"}
{"original": "chaffetz: joining me now for an ingraham angle exclusive. house freedom caucus member jim jordan and mark meadows, gentlemen, thank you for being here. i had the honor and privilege of serving with you so it's always good to be back with you."}
{"original": "rep. mark meadows, r-n.c., chairman, house freedom caucus: good to be back with you."}
{"original": "rep. jim jordan, r-ohio, house judiciary committee: good to have committee back together."}
{"original": "chaffetz: yes, that's right, that's right. i want to start with mark meadows, here. congressman, i got to tell you, there's been some tweeting out there and some reports that you've been working pretty closely with lindsey graham trying to figure out how to get - figure out the right compromise. where are we at tonight?"}
{"original": "meadows: well, i can tell, you said earlier, the president has been working around the clock, he and his team, i can tell you. i was on the phone with him twice. yesterday, i was on the phone with him on christmas eve. senator graham has done the same, doing great work, really offering a number of options."}
{"original": "it's interesting, the whole narrative is that the republicans won't compromise and the democrats will compromise but i can tell you there's been at least three substantial offers, both directly and indirectly that have been made on behalf of the republicans that really come up against a wall."}
{"original": "it is a wall of really undeniable resolve where they're saying 0 money for border security. let's have open borders and the american people won't support that."}
{"original": "chaffetz: i want to play this clip and then jim jordan react to it. this is nancy pelosi on another network."}
{"original": "unidentified female: are you willing to come up and give him some of this money for the wall because apparently that's the sticking point."}
{"original": "pelosi: no, nothing, we're talking about border security."}
{"original": "unidentified female: nothing for the wall but that means--"}
{"original": "pelosi: but we can go with this all back and forth. no, anyway how many more times can we say no, nothing for the wall."}
{"original": "jordan: well, i mean, this is nancy pelosi, this is the same lady who said, you got to read the bill before you know what's in it and she passed a bill before you know what's in it. this is the same nancy pelosi who three weeks ago in the oval office said, there aren't the votes on the house to pass a bill with border security, border wall funding in it and a few days later it was 217 to 185."}
{"original": "so when she says she's not going to do it, i say let's take the case to the american people just like the president's doing. ask some families who've seen terrible things happen by people who came in this country illegally. ask molly tibbett's family."}
{"original": "ask the law enforcement officer, just a few weeks back so this is important, we need the border security wall, the president's been clear on that as mark just indicated, he's willing to compromise but the democrats have said nothing. just like nancy pelosi, nothing for the well, that's the problem."}
{"original": "if you want to deal with the drug problem, the gang problem as your previous guest said and the human trafficking problem, you need your border security wall, that's all we're saying and we're only asking for $5 billion and we were willing to come down some on that."}
{"original": "so let's - let's just get off the positions, speaker to be pelosi and let's do what the american people -"}
{"original": "chaffetz: i don't know how the democrats can be successful because you're trying to do what the border patrol wants, the border patrol wants the impediment of people coming north, they're the ones that have to deal with it. jerry nadler, the congressman from new york is the incoming chairman of the house judiciary committee which does have jurisdiction here. listen to the comments he made."}
{"original": "rep. jerry nadler, d-n.y., incoming chairman, house judiciary committee: with this shut down that president trump has initiated proudly, he claimed it, it's really blackmail of the american people because he is feeling abandoned so what this shut down is really is an extremist policy designed to appeal to an extremist base and hold the whole country hostage."}
{"original": "meadows: you know, it's interesting, most people back home, most of your viewers tonight, they believe that they need to have a safer community and a secure border. we're a nation of laws, lets uphold the laws and yet here we are, border patrol agents, you just heard it there."}
{"original": "border patrol agents that say they need a barrier, they need the tools to do that, we need to do that, listen, the president has waited two years, he campaigned on this, you know that, jason. he's waited two years, he says enough is enough, now is the time to do it. let's make sure that we get a border wall."}
{"original": "jordan: here's the fundamental problem. the democrats are much more focused on stopping the president than they are on doing what's best for the country. the agents want the wall, the american people want the wall, people whose families who've had loved ones harmed by people here illegally want the wall."}
{"original": "mr. nadler, he's much more focused on impeachment proceedings, he's much more focused on the emoluments clause on trump's tax returns and all those things. let's do what's best for the country here."}
{"original": "chaffetz: i don't know how a democratic party succeeds when they want to abolish ice. they say the wall is immoral, they're in favor of sanctuary cities and then when you try to fund the things that they voted in favor of previously, they're not willing to do the appropriations."}
{"original": "meadows: exactly, many of these same democrats, you saw nancy pelosi and chuck schumer, many of them have voted for border fencing and walls previously. the only difference now is president trump is in the white house and they can't stand to give him that."}
{"original": "chaffetz: okay, so how do you get over that hurdle?"}
{"original": "meadows: i think one, you have to continue to give options which the president is doing, you have to make the case to the american people, we're trying to sign - get a petition going, we've opened up borderwallnow.com where we're encouraging grassroots from across the country, just started today, where they're going to sign a petition and say, we're standing with the president, we want border security."}
{"original": "but it's really going to be your viewers and people like them across the country that have to speak up."}
{"original": "jordan: a gofundme page, brian kolfage, i think it's $19 million already."}
{"original": "chaffetz: one of our colleagues, house freedom caucus member warren davis has got a bill which would enable that money to actually go to the treasury and help build the wall, it is as bill has called, buy a brick, build the wall."}
{"original": "those are the kind of thing that americans - because that's good common sense, that makes good sense, let's continue to make the case and let's get this done for the american people."}
{"original": "chaffetz: yeah, it is. it's almost $19 million, it's unbelievable. i got to transition to a little bit oversight, something the three of us sat on and i was the former chairman of and you're going to be the new ranking member working alongside elijah cummings who will be the new chairman of that committee."}
{"original": "i think the democrats have laid out some 80 plus investigations that they already - how are you going to deal with that?"}
{"original": "jordan: so i mean, they've talked about 80 different investigations they want to do, they had 54 different subpoenas that they issued, that they wanted to issue this congress, this past congress and just two weeks ago, mr. cummings announced 51 letters on all kinds of things he wants to investigate."}
{"original": "so we'll see, do they - i think the president said this best, do they want to legislate or do they want to investigate? it sure seems like they want to investigate, it sure seems like they're more focused on stopping president trump than they are in helping the country so we'll see what chairman cummings and some the other chairman do."}
{"original": "chaffetz: you know, what i thought was interesting, i was very proud of the fact that we had evidence of something that was wrong and then we pursued it as opposed to presupposing the end result and then trying to go back and fill in the facts later."}
{"original": "meadows: and we - i'll still call you mr. chairman and you're exactly right because what happened there jason is, we have an oversight responsibility, not an investigative responsibility, it's very different. when wrongdoing or this suspicion of wrongdoing is brought to us, then indeed we can properly investigate, conduct oversight and do the like."}
{"original": "but yet here we have is a fishing expedition, where we're going to say everything that you could possibly have done wrong, we're going to investigate even if it was prior to you becoming the president of the united states. it's just wrong."}
{"original": "jordan: we just got to focus on the truth."}
{"original": "jordan: focus on getting to the truth, doing our proper oversight, holding the executive branch accountable but focus on the truth, if we do that, i think we'll be fine and we'll serve the taxpayers."}
{"original": "chaffetz: well, gentlemen, we appreciate what you do so i appreciate your service and i know personally, how much time you sacrifice away from your beautiful families that you have and i thank you for joining us here tonight."}
{"original": "there's a lot on the line, it would to be interesting to see what happens tomorrow and the election of a new speaker but coming up next."}
{"original": "mitt romney comes roaring into congress with a renewed attack on the president. hear my take on the new war of words plus the newly elected senator from indiana, mike braun on the eve of being sworn into the 116th congress."}
{"original": "trump: he hasn't even got into office and he was very happy when i endorsed him. so i think that mitt romney hopefully will be a team player and if he's not, that's okay too. look, i handle it."}
{"original": "senator-elect mitt romney, r-utah: i think it's very important for a president to demonstrate the qualities of integrity and honesty, forthrightness, empathy and respect for the institutions of our democratic republic. i think those are all parts of the job and while i agree with them on a lot of policy fronts and salute the work that's been done by the republican leadership in washington, there are places that relate to the, if you will, forming of national character that i think we could do a better job."}
{"original": "chaffetz: that was incoming utah senator and failed g.o.p. presidential nominee mitt romney after his blistering op-ed against president trump, the leader of romney's own party. trump hitting back today."}
{"original": "trump: well, i wish mitt could be more of a team player. you know, i'm surprised he did it this quickly, i was expecting something but i was surprised he did it this quickly. and you know look, i endorsed him, he thanked me very profusely, was very nice but i am surprised because we've done a lot and he actually says it."}
{"original": "chaffetz: leland vittert joins us live now with more on the war of words."}
{"original": "leland vittert, fox news correspondent: good evening jason. mitt romney seems to have been able to unify the republican party, to a way that has been allusive for just anybody else. so far the only significant republican coming to romney's defense is outgoing senator jeff flake."}
{"original": "other than that romney's alone after writing an op-ed headlined, the president shapes the public character of the nation. trumps character falls short. he outlines a number of complaints with the president and says in part on balance, the president has not risen to the mantle of the office."}
{"original": "trump: i just hope he's going to be a team player and if he's a team player, that'll be great. i will say this, if he'd fought really hard against president obama like he does against me, he would have won the election."}
{"original": "vittert: romney's niece and gop's chairwoman ronna romney mcdaniel wrote on twitter, for an incoming republican freshman senator to attack president trump as their first act feeds into what the democrats and media want and is disappointing and unproductive."}
{"original": "sen. rand paul, r-ky.: why is he out there calling the president dishonest? i think that's- when you attack someone's character like that, i think that's such a low blow and so personally directed and so malevolent that it's not something like, oh, we're going to - you know, someone's going to change their character."}
{"original": "he's now called his character, dishonest and i think that's a bad way for him to start in the senate because i think it's going to spoil relations between his representation of utah and the president."}
{"original": "vittert: now, it is fair to say that president and romney have had an on again - off again relationship with mr. trump endorsing romney in 2012 and trading jabs with the then candidate trump, calling romney a choker in 2016 to then considering him for secretary of state before endorsing romney for senate, a favor romney refused today to return."}
{"original": "romney: and i haven't decided if i'm going to endorse him in 2020, i'm going to wait and see what the alternatives are."}
{"original": "vittert: one alternative could be jeff flake who as we noted earlier jason, defended romney today and also noted, i do hope that somebody runs to challenge the president, that being senator flake's words."}
{"original": "chaffetz: thanks leland. so here's my take, i represented the people of the great state of utah for 8.5 years in congress. i want both romney and trump to succeed. there are a lot of problems with the senator elect's ill-timed op-ed."}
{"original": "romney readily accepted trump's endorsement when he was running for the senate even after calling trump, a phony and a fraud back in 2016 but nothing changed. trump is still the same person he was back in 2016. part of what i actually live about president trump."}
{"original": "romney rode that trump train all the way to washington."}
{"original": "in an october debate, when he was asked about his past trump attacks romney said this."}
{"original": "romney: i'm not going to characterize specifically my comment in that regard in the past. i'm going to talk about the future where we're going at this stage, what is done positively in my view. he's doing a number of things that i agree with and frankly, not a lot that i disagree with."}
{"original": "chaffetz: well, i guess that wasn't true. it's perfectly clear that romney doesn't take issue with trump on policy. no, his focus is on trump's personality and approach. to the good people of utah, some of who will cheer these romney comments, his job is to represent the state of utah, not himself."}
{"original": "this is not a good look for an incoming senator, in fact it's a selfish move, it does not help the state of utah or solve a problem, it only creates one. but now we have a different newly minted senator joining us. the one from indiana, mr. mike braun is hearing and congratulations sir on becoming the next senator from indiana."}
{"original": "sen. mike braun, r-ind.: thank you."}
{"original": "chaffetz: a big move, you're coming into washington d.c., you see what's going on with mitt romney and in the midst of a government shutdown, is this the picture you thought it would be when you're coming and got elected."}
{"original": "braun: you know when you stick your neck out to do something like this, you never know what's going to eventuate but you know, i get it, back in 2017 when i started kicking the tires to you know, i was inspired by what i saw with president trump and you know, i think when you talk about character and other things, it's important."}
{"original": "you know, i don't dismiss that. i think what mitt romney did have a political calculation to it that remains to be seen. i'm just anxious and would not have run unless i was inspired by the fact that it wasn't going to be business as usual and to me, for a main street entrepreneur like myself from a functional state like indiana, we were looking for something refreshing that was different from the past two or three decades which mitt romney and others have been a part of."}
{"original": "you know, i will respect everybody that's here. i just thought it was peculiar timing for a freshman senator you know, to make that kind of statement."}
{"original": "chaffetz: okay, so you're coming in, you're in the midst of a government shutdown, what is the first order of business?"}
{"original": "braun: well, to me, we've got to get back to where we pass a budget under regular order and do things that i think most hoosiers and americans would expect. and that's not to have a, what is it, a $4 trillion budget that we cannot seemed to get balanced year after year."}
{"original": "and where i come from, when i was on the school board, when i was in a functional state government, and when i've run a business for 37 years, you'd been laughed out of any one of those institutions if you were operating like the federal government does. so i'm not going to cast any aspersions or stones at anyone, but i want to start seeing things work. and i think it's going to take more people from the mainstream, the main street of america if we are going to see something happen different in the dynamic of d.c."}
{"original": "chaffetz: where are you out of the wall? indiana, a little far from the southern border. what is your take on the president and what the president is advocating?"}
{"original": "braun: and all throughout the campaign, primary and general, border security, including building a wall, where you need to especially, worries about social security and medicare going to be around, that actually ranked up with the economy, and that's because the economy is doing so well."}
{"original": "chaffetz: so are you willing to keep the government shut down until the president gets his wall?"}
{"original": "braun: look at how long we have gone and border security has not been addressed by republicans and democrats. and i think, when would be a better time than now? most of the government is funded. that is a misstatement that the government is going to fall apart. and we're going to have to get used to having less government in the long run anyway if we are ever going to balance a budget. and i think it's time to stake out your turf on, let's see where the democrats are. we know they are against a wall. i'd love to see what they would be willing to spend any money on, and all i hear is that they would be for border security with no specifics."}
{"original": "chaffetz: that's the problem is they don't have any specifics."}
{"original": "braun: and how much money are you willing to spend?"}
{"original": "chaffetz: i've only got just over a minute, but i've got two questions i've got to ask you. what do you believe is the biggest threat to the country that congress needs to aggress?"}
{"original": "braun: i believe, and we hear it all the time, that if we keep laughing off trillion-dollar deficits, and most people don't realize interest rates have gone up two, two and a quarter percent, on $20 trillion, that's $400 billion. we cannot run a government with that kind of dynamic. we don't do it anywhere else."}
{"original": "chaffetz: we are spending more than $600 million a day just in interest on that debt. you have a great business background, you beat two of my colleagues from the house in luke messer and todd rokita, two good people, but you shot through the middle and came to victory. last question i want to ask you, because i know you got a passion for this, but where do you want to focus your time? there are so many issues but where do you want to focus? what do you actually want to tackle and achieve as the new senator?"}
{"original": "braun: i've got a lot of things i'm interested in. number one, we've covered it. if you don't get more people like me from the real world that have balanced budgets, run payrolls, and done things with balanced budgets and cash reserves, we are not going to do much as a federal government."}
{"original": "specifically, health care. the democrats basically got that issue right in the sense that you should never go broke because you have a bad accident or you get sick. but they teamed up with big health care, and we got obamacare. we got to have something better there. i want to focus on infrastructure, which, hopefully, all of us believe that roads and bridges out to be sound in this country, and find a way to pay for them."}
{"original": "chaffetz: listen, we wish you the best of luck on both sides of the aisle. what's good for our country so that we should be prioritizing. and congratulations to you and your family. tomorrow will be a big day, swearing in, sworn in as the nest senator for indiana. so thank you."}
{"original": "up next, a doctor at one of the country's most procedures hospitals is fired after some very disturbing anti-semitic comments surface. plus, a former new york times executive editor admits what we have long suspected. the paper has become, quote, unmistakably anti-trump. howard kurtz is here to expose the bias up next."}
{"original": "president donald trump: but the new york times, you remember, it's very famous. nobody's never seen it before, maybe never done before. they apologized for their bad coverage of me. they apologized to their subscribers because after i win, everyone said, what the hell happened?"}
{"original": "chaffetz: you really have to hear the story to believe it. a resident at cleveland clinic was fired after vicious anti-semitic comments surfaced on social media, including a threat to give jewish people the wrong medicine. trace gallagher is back with all the details. trace?"}
{"original": "trace gallagher, fox news correspondent: jason, 27-year-old laura kollab was a first-year resident at the prominent cleveland clinic when she was accused of making a lengthy list of anti-semitic remarks on social media for several years. collab, who worked in the hospital's internal medical program, deleted all of her social media profiles. but screenshots of her remarks dating back to 2011 were documented by canary mission, a site dedicated to exposing anti-semitism. canary mission notes that kollab supported terrorists, called for violence against jews, trivialized the holocaust, and in 2013 compared nazi germany to israel. quoting here, tell me what makes israel's we must remain a jewish state obsession any less disturbing than hitler's obsession with a pure white nation."}
{"original": "kollab, who also tutored and mentored high school and college students, and was involved in the big brothers, big sisters of america, also wrote in 2013, quote, annoying to go to school in a city full of jews because everywhere i go i hear about the wonderful israel. about to tell this guy to shut the blank up. and in 2012, she posted this, quote, haha, ew. i will personally give all the yahood, a arabic term for jewish people, the wrong meds."}
{"original": "the cleveland clinic says, quoting, there have been no reports of any patient harm related to her work during the time she was here. in no way do these beliefs reflect those of our organization. we fully embrace diversity, inclusion, and a culture of safety and respect across the entire health system. the hospital also confirms that she was fired after an internal investigation, and canary mission says kollab is connected to other social media users whose feeds are replete with anti-jewish posts. jason?"}
{"original": "president donald trump: if you are reading a story about somebody, you don't know. you assume it's honest because it's like the failing new york times, which is like so bad. it's so bad."}
{"original": "chaffetz: president trump has been railing against the new york times since the 2016 campaign, claiming they were dishonest and biased against him. it turns out he was right according to its former executive editor, jill abramson. she says the paper's news pages, the home of its straight news coverage, have become, quote, unmistakably anti-trump, end quote."}
{"original": "here now is howard kurtz, fox news media analyst and host of media buzz here on the fox news channel. howie, thanks so much. you were the one that broke this story and found what she had been saying. but this is -- we've heard this before, but we haven't really seen it to this degree."}
{"original": "howard kurtz, fox news media analyst: we haven't heard it from the former editor of the new york times. the story has gone absolutely viral since i broke it in my fox column. it's trending on twitter. that's a big deal. and jill abramson has written a forthcoming book called merchants of truth, and she says, the news pages, not the op-ed land, the news pages, anti-trump, raw opinion in some stories and headlines, and that this rings the cash registers. here's another quote, given its mostly liberal audience, there was an implicit financial reward for the times running lots of trump stories, almost all of them negative. they drove big traffic numbers, more than a half million digital subscriptions, just the first few months of trump moving into the white house."}
{"original": "chaffetz: yes, so they were rewarded with circulation. but at what point did they get off the rails and decide that, hey, we have got to go out there and make sure that we give our audience what they want rather than playing it straight and delivering the news? why isn't that their mantra?"}
{"original": "kurtz: that should be the mantra of every news organization. but i think a lot of organizations like the times are finding that there is a financial reward, almost a business model in playing to an anti-trump audience. now, in this case, yes, jill abramson was fired four years ago. she writes about this in the book, i write about it in the column. she admits that she had flaws, she could be self-righteous, she was a flawed manager. and she's criticizing her successor, dean baquet, the current executive editor who was her number two who did play a role in the firing. but it doesn't read to me like sour grapes. she praises him at times. it reads to me like somebody who loves the new york times, who, by the way, is not a fan of president trump. she's criticized him in her own columns. but she believes that the paper that she loves has gone off the rails when it comes to this president."}
{"original": "chaffetz: is there a term -- is there a change in the journalistic standards of the young people? i want to put up this quote that she says the more woke staff thought that urgent times called for urgent measures. the dangers of trump's presidency obviated the old standards."}
{"original": "chaffetz: so they think they are self-righteous and justified in doing this because there is the greater good."}
{"original": "kurtz: and i have heard so many journalists say this, some publicly, some privately, donald trump, his presidency is so out of control, he's so unfit for the job and all of that, that it justifies what we're doing, that in effect we have become what steve bannon once called the opposition party, that we have to crusade against him. and abramson is telling about the the times, she says it's the younger staff, the more woke staff, that feels like, the standards we use for every other president, throw them out the window because this is donald trump."}
{"original": "and then she says the more anti-trump the the times was perceived to be, the more it was mistrusted for being biased. and that is the cost. you make lots of money in the short term, but if you lose that credibility that you are just applying a whole different set of standards to a president you don't like personally, viscerally, ideologically, i think your credibility gradually erodes with a larger audience."}
{"original": "chaffetz: even the relationship that she had with hillary clinton, because it wasn't all pro hillary clinton, the new york times did break the story about --"}
{"original": "chaffetz: the private email server, and that caused some distressed. and she seemed, at least from what i read your article, to say that was a problem for her."}
{"original": "kurtz: she says that she's never gotten along with hillary. she says hillary could be paranoid. she also thinks the times overplayed the hillary story. that's been the subject of a lot of debate since 2016."}
{"original": "but the point is this is not me saying it, you saying it, president trump saying it, this is the former editor of the paper, former washington bureau chief, former wall street journal reporter, putting her thoughts into this book, and essentially saying that the critics, the worst critics of the the times are true when it comes to the trump coverage. and i think journalists at all organizations have to worry at this point, and not that there shouldn't be aggressive reporting, not that there aren't smart reporters at the times, not that some of the investigations missed the mark, but the cumulative tone and volume and relentless nature of the anti- trump fusillade i think is really hurting credibility, and now we have jill abramson --"}
{"original": "chaffetz: go to foxnews.com, you can find this article that you put out there. it is a fascinating read."}
{"original": "chaffetz: and i do think it is more problematic than just the new york times. and i wonder where these schools of journalism are and what they are teaching these kids because i don't get the sense of we're going to report the news, not try to create the news to push our own political narrative. so thank you, howie."}
{"original": "kurtz: somehow that is now seen as old-fashioned. thank you."}
{"original": "a new year and a new round of attacks and our president by the new york governor, andrew cuomo. did the democrat cross the line? my panel answers that after the break."}
{"original": "gov. andrew cuomo, d-n.y.: let new york say that the federal government may shut itself down but it will never extinguish the statue of liberty's torch."}
{"original": "chaffetz: new york governor andrew cuomo is starting out his third term in office with the same old scare tactics. the democrat using his 20-minute inauguration speech to attack president trump, not by name, of course. have a watch."}
{"original": "cuomo: as our nation once confronted a great economic depression, we now confront a great social depression. people's frustration is turning to fear and the fear is turning into anger and the anger is turning into division. it is impossible to overstate how dangerous, how malignant this condition is. it is like a cancer that is spreading throughout our society."}
{"original": "chaffetz: joining me now, byron york, washington examiner chief political correspondent and a fox news contributor, and richard goodstein, a former aide to hillary clinton and a democratic strategist who has joined us on the show many times. thank you, gentlemen, for coming in here. a bit melodramatic as i read what andrew cuomo did. i recognize he's being sworn in for the third time, but was it over-the-top for you, richard?"}
{"original": "richard goodstein, former adviser to hillary clinton: he comes quite honestly, given who his dad was, right. i actually don't foreclose the notion that he is going to run for president, although he insists that he's not. i think he has been kind of angling for it for some time. he couldn't resist. he didn't call out trump by name, as you mentioned."}
{"original": "and yet i actually think the things he is calling for when he talks about a new era for justice in terms of voter registration and taking no corporate money into state campaigns, we have that federally, as you know. so i actually don't think what his agenda is as all that radical, but he has to but that little twist on rhetorically, and that again, i think is in his gene pool."}
{"original": "chaffetz: governor of a big state, byron, and an important state in new york. what was your take on it?"}
{"original": "bryon york, chief political correspondent, washington examiner: it was a little more over-the-top than the romney op-ed, but kind of some of the same themes there. but this is a trend i think we are seeing in some blue states, where some blue state officials seem more interested in donald trump then they are in what is going on in their own states. cuomo spent a lot of his reelection campaign talking about the trump administration and the president. letitia james, the new new york state attorney general basically won a race that was kind of a get trump contest, where all of the candidates talked about how much they will go after donald trump if they became the attorney general."}
{"original": "so in these blue states, where you do have huge, huge anti-trump majorities among the voters, there seems to be more interest in national politics at the moment than what is going on in their own states."}
{"original": "chaffetz: they run a risk, right, democrats, of being all trump all the time and then not talking about -- they get in their brain. donald trump gets in their brain, and then they are not talking about the issues that supposedly differentiate democrats from republicans."}
{"original": "goodstein: my answer to that is they won 40 some house seats, and 24 to 11 in the senate. so let's not think they had a bad year in the senate. they won 24 of 35 --"}
{"original": "chaffetz: i hope republicans keep having bad years like that."}
{"original": "goodstein: my point is, they won the seats they did by talking about health and talking job creation and so forth that were very much geared toward their constituents. and frankly in competitive seats they didn't talk all that much about -- they can't resist it in california and new york and so forth, and it works for them. but i think in these competitive races, they actually were talking about things that matter to their constituents, like health care."}
{"original": "chaffetz: but byron, they were also other there talking about -- cuomo pardoned 20 plus people so that they could get out of having to be deported. is that a winning message outside of maybe the liberal new york or california?"}
{"original": "york: right. and this speech i think was delivered at ellis island to send an immigration message. and here again, it's all about trump. put aside the question of whether all of these pardons or commutations were justified. some of them involved people who had been convicted of murder. put aside that question. here again, you have states of trying to make their own immigration laws. we saw this began before donald trump appeared, the whole sanctuary city thing dead. but they are trying to make the own immigration laws, in particular because they dislike this president."}
{"original": "chaffetz: do you think that will hurt the governor if he decides to do anything else out there, pardoning these people?"}
{"original": "goodstein: do i think that pardoning joe arpaio for contempt of court, pardoning people who basically misused -- lied to the cia, what donald trump has done, do i think that is going to hurt him when gets to reelection? no, because if you rank order all the things he has done, or that andrew cuomo, this is not -- this is kind of small potatoes."}
{"original": "chaffetz: i want to get your quick thoughts on something very serious. this is a very authentic, just a true moment where you just catch the senator, senator warren on instagram, and just a raw -- this is who she is. watch this."}
{"original": "sen. elizabeth warren, d-mass.: i'm going for everyone who is joining this video. it's great to hear for you. hold on a sec, i'm going to get me a beer. hey! my husband, bruce, is now in here. you want a beer?"}
{"original": "unidentified male: no, i'll pass on a beer for now."}
{"original": "warren: you sure? so this is my sweetie."}
{"original": "chaffetz: yes, it's 2020 politics at its best, byron."}
{"original": "york: well, some candidates, alexandria ocasio-cortez, made huge use of instagram, very, very successful use of instagram. this has kind of these kids of today feel to it where the 69-year-old senator is kind of trying to adopt this. but you will see a lot of this in the campaign, in part because it's free. you can do it and we talk about it, it gets spread around, and you don't have to pay anything to spread it."}
{"original": "goodstein: in the last 48 hours, we've had elizabeth warren deriding for which beer she picked, how she went to get it, how she drank it, and stanley mcchrystal saying that he wouldn't work for donald trump because he's immoral and dishonest. and we've had basically that same sentiment from people who have been in the cabinet. honestly, i don't know that elizabeth warren will be the nominee. i tend to think not. but that is a fight i think democrats will be happy --"}
{"original": "chaffetz: i think, like hillary clinton, and to a degree mitt romney, the authenticity question will be her biggest problem."}
{"original": "chaffetz: thank you for joining us. we'll be right back with the last bite."}
{"original": "chaffetz: it's time for the last bite. tomorrow is a big day here in washington, d.c., and it's the start of a brand-new congress, the 116th, and a brand-new speaker. nancy pelosi is confident she has the votes to take back the gavel. that still remains to be seen. so what do her kids think about it?"}
{"original": "john berman, cnn anchor: what are your feelings about this person you know quite well becoming speaker of the house for a second time?"}

{"original": "alexandra pelosi: no one ever won betting against nancy pelosi. she has persevered. you've got to give her credit."}
{"original": "chaffetz: wow. i guess she think that's a compliment in that family."}

{"original": "president trump, in an exclusive wide-ranging interview wednesday night with fox news' hannity, vowed to release the full and unredacted foreign intelligence surveillance act (fisa) warrants and related documents used by the fbi to probe his campaign, saying he wants to get to the bottom of how the long-running russia collusion narrative began."}
{"original": "trump told anchor sean hannity that his lawyers previously had advised him not to take that dramatic step out of fear that it could be considered obstruction of justice."}
{"original": "i do, i have plans to declassify and release. i have plans to absolutely release, trump said. i have some very talented people working for me, lawyers, and they really didn't want me to do it early on. ... a lot of people wanted me to do it a long time ago. i'm glad i didn't do it. we got a great result without having to do it, but we will. one of the reasons that my lawyers didn't want me to do it, is they said, if i do it, they'll call it a form of obstruction."}
{"original": "trump added: frankly, thought it would be better if we held it to the end. but at the right time, we will be absolutely releasing."}
{"original": "trump also accused fbi officials of committing treason -- slamming former fbi director james comey as a terrible guy, former cia director john brennan as potentially mentally ill, and democrat house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff as a criminal."}
{"original": "redacted versions of fisa documents already released have revealed that the fbi extensively relied on documents produced by christopher steele, an anti-trump british ex-spy working for a firm funded by the hillary clinton campaign and democratic national committee, to surveil trump aide carter page. at least one senior doj official had apparent concerns steele was unreliable, according to text messages exclusively obtained last week by fox news."}
{"original": "the leaked dossier, and related fbi surveillance, kickstarted a media frenzy on alleged russia-trump collusion that ended with a whimper on sunday, when it was revealed special counsel robert mueller's probe concluded finding no evidence of such a conspiracy, despite several offers by russians to help the trump campaign. page was never charged with wrongdoing, and he is currently suing the dnc for defamation."}
{"original": "fox news exclusive: newly revealed texts show doj officials clashing with fbi over 'bias' of key warrant source"}
{"original": "citing a high-level source, kentucky gop sen. rand paul late wednesday tweeted that anti-trump ex-cia director john brennan had internally pushed the dossier. fox news has not independently verified paul's source."}
{"original": "i think brennan's a sick person, i really do, trump said. i believe there's something wrong with him, for him to come out of the cia and act that way was so disrespectful to the country and to the cia. he was not considered good at what he did. he was never a respected guy."}
{"original": "brennan was one of the loudest and most virulent voices to trumpet the russian collusion theory over the past two years, asserting falsely just weeks ago that mueller was likely planning to indict members of the trump administration's family in a scene reminiscent of the ides of march and the assassination of julius caesar. trump, who revoked brennan's security clearance last year amid concerns brennan was improperly hinting that he had inside information about ongoing federal probes, called those remarks horrible on wednesday."}
{"original": "brennan has since acknowledged he was wrong, but has said inaccurately that mueller merely could not find evidence meeting the high bar needed for a criminal prosecution -- when in fact mueller found no evidence at all that the trump team responded to russians' numerous efforts to involve them in a conspiracy."}
{"original": "when i said there could be somebody spying on my campaign, it went wild out there, trump told hannity. they couldn't believe i could say such a thing. as it turned out, that was small potatoes compared to what went on. ... millions and millions [spent] on the phony dossier, and then they used the dossier to start things. it was a fraud, paid for by hillary clinton and the democrats."}
{"original": "just hours earlier wednesday, trump made clear he was enthusiastic about the idea of appointing a second special counsel to review the origins of the russia investigation when it came up during a meeting tuesday with republican senators, a source familiar with the discussions told fox news."}
{"original": "trump, speaking to hannity, separately raised doubts about the secretive and mysterious june 27, 2016 phoenix airport tarmac meeting between bill clinton and then-attorney general loretta lynch -- which was spotted while lynch was overseeing the hillary clinton email probe."}
{"original": "i had a lot of planes for a long time. i've never stopped the plane on the tarmac to let somebody on the plane, trump said. bill clinton said he was there to play golf, but i know the area very well. arizona. it's a little warm at that time of year for golf, ok?"}
{"original": "rand paul bombshell: high-level source says brennan pushed discredited anti-trump steele dossier"}
{"original": "in an apparent shot at former attorney general jeff sessions, trump also told hannity this all would not have happened if attorney general william barr had been with his administration from the beginning."}
{"original": "trump also noted that ratings for several networks that aggressively pushed the russia narrative have fallen off dramatically. msnbc host rachel maddow's audience of 2.5 million on monday was 19 percent below her average this year, and it went down further to 2.3 million on tuesday, according to the nielsen company."}
{"original": "if you wrote this as a novel, nobody would buy it; it would be a failure, because it would be too unbelievable, trump said. we're getting to the bottom of it. this can never, ever happen to a president again. that was a disgrace and an embarrassment to our country. ... hopefully they won't get away with it."}
{"original": "we'll have to see how it all started, but i'm going to leave that to other people, including the attorney general and others, to make that determination, trump continued. fifty years, 100 years from now -- if someone tries the same thing, they have to know the penalty will be very very great if and when they get caught."}
{"original": "trump also lashed out at schiff, d-calif., who has pushed strongly for investigations into possible trump-russia links. schiff is a bad guy, he knew he was lying -- he's not a dummy. for a year and a half he would just leak and call up cnn and others. you know, i watch him, so sanctimonious ... he knew it was a lie, and he'd get in the back room with his friends in the democrat party, and they would laugh like hell. in one way, you could say it's a crime what he did -- he was making statements he knew were false. he's a disgrace to our country."}
{"original": "the president insisted the u.s. should have a great relationship with russia and china, but that the fake news and nonsense distorted his intentions into something more sinister."}
{"original": "trump also criticized comey, whom he'd fired in 2017, as a terrible guy. he insisted he did not fire him to obstruct justice, telling hannity he knew that firing comey would only increase scrutiny on the white house."}
{"original": "it was treason, it was really treason, trump said, referring to texts between former fbi special agent peter strzok and former fbi lawyer lisa page that discussed an insurance policy in the event of trump's election."}
{"original": "you had dirty cops, you had people who are bad fbi folks ... at the top, they were not clean, to put it mildly. he said later, we can never allow these treasonous acts to happen to another president."}

{"original": "separately, trump also said he hopes democrats continue pushing the green new deal, which flamed out in a test vote on tuesday, as most democrats voted present instead of going on record supporting the sweeping transformation of the entire u.s. economy."}
{"original": "i don't want to speak badly about the new green deal, frankly, because i'm afraid they will stop using it, trump said. i really do want to campaign against it. it's ridiculous."}
{"original": "trump's interview came as multiple gop lawmakers have claimed the president may have somewhat undercut perhaps the best week of his presidency by backing the complete overturn of obamacare."}
{"original": "on monday, the justice department asked the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit in new orleans to affirm last year's ruling by a texas federal judge stating that the affordable care act was no longer constitutional because the 2017 tax reform legislation eliminated the health care law's penalty for not having health insurance."}
{"original": "multiple congressional republicans told fox news they were bothered by the timing of the trump administration's intervention in the matter, which came on the heels of the mueller report findings, the house sustaining the president's veto of a bill to halt the national emergency for the border wall and a senate vote that shined a spotlight on what conservatives described as problems with the green new deal, championed by rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y."}

{"original": "i think it's very frustrating for the president to see the difficult circumstances that kellyanne is put in. she obviously is one of the most trusted advisers in the white house and not just within the white house but beyond, gaetz said on the story. i think it's frustrating for him to see george conway be so critical when kellyanne has been such a part of the great success that's driving country."}

{"original": "emphasizing the importance of health care as an issue in 2020, biden stressed that if we take the fight to trump on obamacare again – we'll beat him again. and we'll not only win the presidency – we'll win a majority in the senate, too."}
{"original": "biden also knocked the president over gun violence – saying i look forward to debating him on guns. he's turned the oval office over to the nra."}
{"original": "and he slammed trump over the president's relationship with russian leader vladimir putin, saying i don't believe we're a nation that bows down to vladimir putin and i will not, and over trump's frequent targeting of the press, noting i don't believe we're a nation that sees the free press as the enemy of the people."}
{"original": "the former vice president also targeted trump over the president's lack of action on climate change."}
{"original": "he doesn't understand the science. he doesn't believe what's happening. he refuses to admit the problem exists. while the rest of the world applauded greta thunberg for her courage and leadership when she was named time's person of the year – all trump could do was seethe over losing the cover on time magazine, biden said."}
{"original": "biden focused entirely on trump and didn't mention his rivals during his speech, which he delivered hours after his campaign went up with a new tv commercial in iowa in which he attacked trump's character."}
{"original": "trump's re-election campaign also previewed its super bowl ad highlighting his administration's economic successes."}
{"original": "just as the super bowl crowns the greatest football team, nothing says 'winning' like president donald trump and his stellar record of accomplishment for all americans, brad parscale, trump 2020 campaign manager, said in a statement. with an incredible economy, historically low unemployment, and a policy of putting america first, president trump is most certainly keeping america great."}

{"original": "wrong: gerald walpin was unceremoniously fired. congress was not notified in advance, as is required by law, and, even worse, the white house did not cut its ties with kevin johnson. it even awarded sacramento a new $650,000 americorps grant."}
{"original": "hearings held by the democrat-led house of representatives on this topic? zero. democrat-led requests for documents? subpoenas? depositions? zero, zero, and zero."}

{"original": "why wasn't congress up in arms about the mistreatment of government watchdogs? the answer is simple: these abuses happened in the first years of obama's presidency, when the house was under democrat control, and scandals of varying magnitudes were quickly and dutifully swept under the rug."}

{"original": "if democrats insist on looking for skeletons in the closet, they should take a long look at themselves. they've hidden more than their fair share."}
{"original": "former vice president joe biden has consistently polled at the top of the 2020 democratic candidates angling to challenge president trump. elected a senator from delaware in 1972 and tapped to be barack obama's running mate in 2008, biden is a longtime pillar of the democratic establishment. he is running a more moderate campaign in comparison to progressive candidates like massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren and vermont sen. bernie sanders."}
{"original": "here is where biden stands on some of the top issues voters care about in the 2020 campaign."}
{"original": "biden often emphasizes his connection to former president barack obama — who remains very popular among democrats — on the campaign trail. he regularly touts the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, to highlight his health care bona fides and remind voters of his obama ties."}
{"original": "health care is personal to me, obamacare is personal to me, he said in an august tv commercial that ran in iowa. we've got to build on what we did because every american deserves affordable health care."}
{"original": "cory booker suspends 2020 presidential campaign"}
{"original": "biden is a staunch defender of obamacare and therefore does not favor a major overhaul of the health care system like medicare-for-all embraced by more progressive candidates. instead, he supports a government-run public option that would compete with private insurance, similar to what obama and many democrats attempted to work into the affordable care act but could not pass in the final bill."}
{"original": "biden's public option would be separate from medicare and would not outlaw private insurance, as other democrats have advocated for in their medicare-for-all plans."}
{"original": "like most 2020 democrats, biden has been critical of trump's handling of climate issues, specifically his withdrawal from the paris climate agreement."}
{"original": "in a september town hall about climate change on cnn, biden said trump is dead wrong on basically everything across the board, regarding climate. we've got to start choosing science over fantasy here."}
{"original": "biden has said he supports the concept of the green new deal, a nonbinding resolution introduced by rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y. the resolution seeks to mobilize the federal government in the fight against climate change while achieving ambitious social justice goals. on his campaign website, biden also refers to climate change as a national security threat and promises to fight polluters who disproportionately harm communities of color and low-income communities."}
{"original": "'we've got to start choosing science over fantasy here.' — joe biden"}
{"original": "despite what is an ambitious plan to attack climate change, biden sports one of the more moderate climate plans in the primary field. he would spend just $1.7 trillion over 10 years on his climate plan and he sets a goal of net-zero carbon emissions for the united states by 2050. that is approximately half of what warren's plan would cost and about one-tenth of the price for sanders' plan."}
{"original": "biden also would not ban fracking, a controversial method of extracting underground natural gas reserves — another contrast with warren and sanders."}
{"original": "with corporate profits and income inequality now big issues in the democratic primary, biden takes a middle-of-the-road approach to this issue as he does with many others."}
{"original": "he advocates a hike in the corporate income tax from 21 percent to 28 percent. others in the race have pushed to return the corporate income tax rate to 35 percent, which is the level it was at before trump and congressional republicans passed a tax reform law in 2017."}
{"original": "elizabeth warren claims she 'objected' to sondland confirmation – she didn't"}
{"original": "biden also does not support a wealth tax, which would place a levy on the net worth of some of the richest american families. sanders, warren and pete buttigieg have all backed such a tax."}
{"original": "where biden does fall in line with his party's progressives, however, is on a $15 minimum wage. nearly every member of the primary field has endorsed such a hike, and house democrats passed a bill to that effect last july."}
{"original": "biden has sharply criticized trump's actions on immigration, including family separation, restricted access to asylum and the border wall. he has also vowed to stop what he calls inhumane treatment of illegal immigrants in detention facilities, though many of the conditions that gained attention under trump existed under the obama-biden administration as well."}
{"original": "trump has waged an unrelenting assault on our values and our history as a nation of immigrants, biden's campaign website says. it's wrong, and it stops when joe biden is elected president."}
{"original": "while some moderates in the democratic primary have said they would accept some physical barrier at the u.s. southern border in some circumstances, biden has stated he is against it. additionally, he supports a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants and says he would continue obama's policy of addressing the root causes that push desperate people to flee their homes in the first place by giving aid to countries including el salvador, guatemala and honduras."}
{"original": "biden breaks with most democratic candidates on whether or not illegal border crossings should be decriminalized, however, saying that such irregular entries should remain criminal offenses rather than civil."}
{"original": "biden has made headlines this election cycle as he's flip-flopped on the federal legalization of marijuana, which has become a popular position not just among democrats but in the general public too."}
{"original": "it's a debate, and i want a lot more [data] before i legalize it nationally, biden said in november, according to business insider. i want to make sure we know a lot more about the science behind it."}
{"original": "after taking criticism from the left, biden later reversed course to adopt a more mainstream position within the democratic party — calling for the rescheduling of the drug, expunging prior convictions and allowing states to legalize it themselves."}
{"original": "click here to get the fox news app"}
{"original": "in november, the house judiciary committee passed the marijuana opportunity reinvestment and expungement act 24-10. the bill would decriminalize marijuana federally while supporting members of marginalized communities who start marijuana businesses."}
{"original": "biden also takes a more moderate stance than many in his party on voting rights for individuals convicted of a felony. biden would allow felons who have served their time and are out of prison to vote while other 2020 contenders, including sanders, entertain the idea of allowing felons who are still incarcerated to cast ballots."}

{"original": "warnock rose in georgia politics through his vocal leadership of the campaign to expand medicaid for low-income residents of the state. he supports increased covid-19 relief funding, expanding the affordable care act (the aca, also known as obamacare), and passing the john lewis voting rights act."}

{"original": "the new rule had previously been blocked with a nationwide injunction that the supreme court stayed in a separate case, so the injunction in the cook county case only affected the state of illinois."}
{"original": "that narrow scope, plus the fact that the 7th circuit is scheduled to review the illinois injunction in the coming week, led sotomayor to believe that the government was not at risk of suffering significant harm that warranted the supreme court putting the injunction on hold."}

{"original": "but perhaps the most insidious aspect of h.r. 1 is the targeting of our kids, claimed the fox news host. the bill forces states to accept voter registrations from 16 year-olds, even though they cannot legally vote. the bill also turns colleges and universities into government-funded voter mills. h.r. 1 creates 'campus vote coordinators' and [hands out] cash to schools that register students — in other words, schools that churn out the most democrat voters."}

{"original": "imagine if the los angeles rams had to play the super bowl against the patriots and the nfc championship against the saints at the same time."}
{"original": "that's what running for president is like. we think of the primaries and the general election as two different games, but the truth is that whomever democrats nominate is already auditioning for the general electorate – including loosely attached democrats, independents and even some republicans."}
{"original": "as sen. kamala harris, d-calif., is finding out today, the demands of the two games are often quite contradictory. her glib, facile answer to a serious question about health insurance is the political equivalent to a fumble on her own ten-yard line."}
{"original": "being the frontrunner isn't all puff pieces and pep rallies."}
{"original": "in an interview with cnn, harris was asked about the downstream consequences of her proposal to make medicare, the entitlement program which provides health insurance for americans age 65 and older, available to every citizen, regardless of age."}
{"original": "the proposal is the key policy of one of her rivals, sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., and has become a litmus test for liberal activists assessing the 2020 democratic contenders. it would also blow the bottom out of the private, employer-based health insurance which provides coverage for about half of all americans."}
{"original": "employers generally hate having to be in the insurance business and many, especially those with large workforces, would be delighted to be able to shunt that responsibility over to medicare. they chip in for extra coverage or otherwise defray costs and get to kiss goodbye one of the biggest hassles for companies in labor-intensive businesses. that reduced pool of customers would make insurance more expensive for those that remain in the private sector, which would cause more employers to follow suit, and so on and so on."}
{"original": "proponents and opponents of the proposal agree on where the road would end: the demolition of the system as it has mostly existed since the 1960s. they disagree about how quickly or chaotically that would happen and certainly are at odds about whether that is good or needful, but agree that it would begin the end of health insurance as we know it."}
{"original": "asked about this consequence, harris was dismissive to the point of blitheness."}
{"original": "the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through all the paperwork, all of the delay that may require, harris said. who of all us have not had that situation where you have to wait for approval and the doctor says, 'i don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this.'"}
{"original": "let's eliminate all of that, she added. let's move on."}
{"original": "now, we want to be generous of spirit here and assume that harris was blowing off another part of the question and entirely ignoring the downstream consequences. the elimination of the insurance that covers something like 160 million people isn't something even the most oblivious politician would do."}
{"original": "but that phrase let's eliminate all of that will now be stuck to her until she comes to the end of the trail. john i actually did vote for the $87 billion before i voted against it kerry knows what we're talking about."}
{"original": "as the excellent and useful polling from the kaiser family foundation shows, democrats enjoy a substantial advantage on the question of health insurance and health care. that's traditionally a better issue for the blue team and the republicans' 2017 obamacare debacle erased the considerable damage that the original passage and enacting of the law did to the democratic brand."}
{"original": "here's kaiser: net favorability towards a national medicare-for-all plan (measured as the share in favor minus the share opposed) … ranges as high as +45 percentage points… yet, on the other side of the debate, net favorability drops as low as -44 percentage points when people hear the argument that this would lead to delays in some people getting some medical tests and treatments. net favorability is also negative if people hear it would threaten the current medicare program (-28 percentage points), require most americans to pay more in taxes (-23 percentage points), or eliminate private health insurance companies (-21 percentage points)."}

{"original": "harris and other democrats have glommed on to sanders' plan as a bumper-sticker solution. and given the fact that the number of uninsured americans is climbing and voters are increasingly anxious about the situation, democrats certainly are right to want something the sounds generous, simple and direct."}
{"original": "but as barack obama learned and then donald trump said, nobody knew health care could be so complicated. lolz."}
{"original": "voters don't like surprises and deeply mistrust any change that involves their policies or care. democrats loved being able to run in 2018 on saving obamacare or protecting your insurance. it will be less fun to say exactly what they want to do."}
{"original": "and that goes double with a plan that involves millions of americans potentially being dumped into government-run health insurance and new pressures it will apply on doctors who already dislike the complexity and measly rates of medicare."}
{"original": "it tells us a lot about how harris' background in california politics is insufficient preparation for the national version. but it also tells us even more about the dangers ahead for democrats as sanders to continue to exact his revenge on the party that passed him over in 2016. if he succeeds in sticking his party with this one, democrats will kiss off millions of votes from the very group they need so much: suburban, middle and upper-middle class moms who are very skeptical about trump."}

{"original": "few if any house democrats would vote for any plan to fund the government if it includes wall money. that means house republicans, in the majority for the moment, could be called upon to advance a spending bill to run the government, and presumably fund the wall, by themselves."}

{"original": "here's the other problem. fox news is told there are a number of defeated or retiring house republicans who don't intend to come back to washington so close to christmas. in some ways, a vote just before the dec. 21 deadline could actually help avert another shutdown if attendance dwindles. the outcome may hinge on who shows up."}

{"original": "trump: well, what about when you hire thousands and thousands of people to explain obamacare because it is 2900 pages, it's totally complex. nobody can understand it and the people that they have hired don't understand it and you then create a website and they worked on the web site for years now the website opens and it's useless. it's just not working. it's dead."}

{"original": "as precinct caucus results started coming in, the idp ran them through an accuracy and quality check, it continued. it became clear that there were inconsistencies with the reports. the underlying cause of these inconsistencies was not immediately clear, and required investigation, which took time."}
{"original": "the release went on to say the data collected was sound but due to a coding issue, the full results were not available last night. state democrats said the problem has been resolved and hope to have the results at some point on tuesday."}
{"original": "president trump commented on the chaos in iowa last night on twitter tuesday morning and called it a disaster. he also compared it to the issue-plagued obamacare website."}
{"original": "iowa caucus results delayed by apparent app issue"}
{"original": "click here for the fox news app"}
{"original": "the democrat caucus is an unmitigated disaster, he tweeted. nothing works, just like they ran the country. remember the five billion dollar obamacare website, that should have cost 2 percent of that. the only person that can claim a very big victory in iowa last night is 'trump.'"}
{"original": "associated press white house reporter jonathan lemire followed by saying that the caucuses turned into a disaster on every level for the party. scarborough said sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., and former south bend, indiana mayor pete buttigieg and their supporters should be furious at the party for denying the two candidates their moment after an expected strong night."}
{"original": "[sanders] worked his ass off for years, survived a heart attack. ... this is inexcusable, the co-host said."}
{"original": "fox news' tyler olson contributed to this report"}
{"original": "this is a rush transcript from hannity, january 9, 2019. this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated."}
{"original": "sean hannity, host: all right. tucker, thank you."}
{"original": "and welcome to a busy hannity tonight."}
{"original": "we begin our hannity watch on huge, massive political hypocrisy tonight. now, democrats, you watch them closely, people on the left, they claim to have a monopoly of compassion. conservatives are coldhearted. they're even selfish and greedy because they want low taxes and less government bureaucracy."}
{"original": "they say we're mean spirited, wanting to curtail entitlements. not true. i don't know republican that is want to get rid of social security or medicare. that's one of those campaign lies. or if you don't their health care system, hasn't worked out well."}
{"original": "democrats are always generous but with other people's money. but what it now comes to is what a real life or death crisis, at our southern border, they are nowhere to be found. in fact, the democrats, the radical left's new talking point is to call what is death and destruction and chaos, caused by unsecured borders, nothing more than a manufactured crisis."}
{"original": "rep. nancy pelosi, d-calif., speaker of the house: president trump must stop holding people hostage. stop manufacturing a crisis."}
{"original": "sen. chuck schumer, d-n.y., minority leader: this president just used the backdrop of the oval office to manufacture a crisis."}
{"original": "unidentified male: folks, the president has manufactured one heck a political crisis for himself."}
{"original": "unidentified female: donald trump has manufactured a national security crisis."}
{"original": "unidentified female: you will hear them say, this is a manufactured crisis. it's not a national security crisis."}
{"original": "unidentified female: the big scam of the whole address was that there's a crisis. there's not a crisis."}
{"original": "unidentified male: the notion that we have a crisis there, security crisis, is absolute nonsense."}
{"original": "unidentified male: it remains a seinfeld shutdown, all about nothing."}
{"original": "unidentified male: what happens when there is a real crisis? when there's a real emergency? does he take to the air waves? do we give him air waves? do we believe him?"}
{"original": "unidentified male: there is not a crisis at the border. it's a manufactured crisis for the president to get a political win."}
{"original": "unidentified male: he's determined to convince you, there is a crisis at the border. even though an intelligence official tells cnn, quote, no one saying this is a crisis except them."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. first thing you've got to notice is, you notice how the hate trump democrats and the hate trump media that they speak in one voice. they have one talking point."}
{"original": "now, tonight we're going to do something. as promised you at the beginning of the year, you will not see on any other network and we're going on show what you real victims of a crisis at our southern border."}
{"original": "look at the side of your screen. take a look there. men, women, husbands, wives, children, parents, those are all human beings that have been killed because we have unsecure southern border. that's -- those are real names."}
{"original": "that includes police officer ronald singh. he was gunned down by that illegal immigrant, just after christmas. and officer singh leaving behind a wife and a 5-month-old baby boy who will never know his father."}
{"original": "democrats, are you really prepared, the media, democratic party, liberals, are you going to look at this man's face and tell them that this death say manufactured crisis? where have your hearts gone?"}
{"original": "and earlier this week, we interviewed the parents of this young man, pierce corcoran and he was killed by a suspected illegal immigrant, driving on the wrong side of the highway without a license, without insurance in the country, 14 years. are democrats going to call the corcorans and tell them what happened, that their son say manufactured crisis?"}
{"original": "what about josh wilkerson or dominic durden or sergeant brandon mendoza or jamiel shaw, or grant roneburger (ph), i can keep going. just keep watching the names on the side of your screen tonight."}
{"original": "do democrats really want to you believe this is some grand conspiracy, a manufactured crisis?"}
{"original": "now, we do have angel parents. those who have lost their children because of open borders. they are speaking out tonight and they have done so many times in the past and they are reminding some of american's politicians and their best friends in the media that this is not a political gain for them. this is a crisis, a clear and present danger, real americans losing real lives, needlessly, and real families suffering -- if you might say a word, permanent separation. take a look."}
{"original": "steve doocy, host: when you hear chuck schumer and nancy pelosi last night saying the president has manufactured a crisis to sell this wall, what's your message to those top democrats?"}
{"original": "angel parent: it may seem manufactured to them because they're sitting behind walls, but for those of us out in regular america, we are victims. we are prone to the victimization of illegal aliens and crime."}
{"original": "angel parent: i'm just wondering, how many of these people have had their sons, daughters, wives or husbands' lives snuffed out by one of these illegal aliens. i'm just wondering if nancy pelosi's children or grandchildren are assaulted in the same way that my son was assassinated, if she would speak the same way."}
{"original": "hannity: now, i've been to the border, what, 12, 13 times now. last time i was down with governor perry, then governor at the time, sat in a security briefing, 642,000 crimes committed against texans alone in a seven-year period. in just the past two years alone, 4,000 criminal aliens have been arrested for homicide. in fact, over the past two decades. criminal immigrants have been responsible for tense of thousands of murders."}
{"original": "now, to these families, our fellow americans, that crisis is always present. their lives have been devastated, forever altered, their loved ones murdered. and yet, hate trump democrats, hate trump talking point media people, they are to suggest this is a manufactured crisis? really?"}
{"original": "we're talking about an all too common occurrence. it should never happen. law abiding men and women killed by illegal immigrants that don't respect our laws, our sovereignty, our borders. they shouldn't be here at all."}
{"original": "now, if we secured the borders, lives are going to be saved. people will be protected. there won't be permanent separation as in the cases we're telling you about."}
{"original": "now, many of these cases, those responsible, even had long, criminal track records. some had previously been deported, all gaining access, because our southern border is wide open. and sadly, this is only one aspect of the crisis at our southern border."}
{"original": "over the past two years, 30,000 criminal aliens arrested for sex crimes, over a hundred thousand were violent assaults. in 2018, 800 gang members apprehended at our southern border. that's a 50 percent increase over the previous year."}
{"original": "yes, last year, we also saw 122 percent increase in fentanyl being smuggled across the southern border. do you know fentanyl? that's the drug killing americans every single day in this country."}
{"original": "fentanyl, the deadly substance, often mixed with heroin. remember heroin? ninety percent of that, smuggled across our southern boarder."}
{"original": "and keep in mind, every seven days, 300 americans will die from a heroin over dose. that death toll is equal to the number of american troops killed every week in vietnam, during 1968. that was the deadliest year of that war. so, is that a manufactured crisis?"}
{"original": "last year, 17,000 individuals with criminal records apprehended trying to cross the border. sixty thousand inadmissible or illegal immigrants turned away from our borders every single month. and over the last few weeks, 20,000 children, smuggled or trafficked into the united states."}
{"original": "this is not a manufactured crisis or a talking point. those children matter, those women mater. those americans being killed by addiction matter. we talk about the opioid epidemic in the country all the time, this is a big part of it."}
{"original": "and so do the human beings, by the way, on the other side of the border. totally understand that 98 percent that want a better life for themselves, their family, their children, their grandchildren, but one out of every three migrant women, who make that dangerous trip, try to make it into the united states, hoping for a better life. they're sexually assaulted and 7 in 10 migrants reported being victim during that trek. it's an arduous journey."}
{"original": "and average of 50 children each day require emergency and medical care after they arrive at the southern border. and you have thousands of illegal immigrants, they have died trying to cross unfamiliar deserts, in unsecured regions of our border."}
{"original": "and don't forget about the risks that are posed to our national security, unvetted, illegal immigrants from all over the world use our unsecured southern border in order to gain access to the united states."}
{"original": "sara carter recently took a trip to the border, actually interviewed two individuals. they're from bangladesh."}
{"original": "sara carter, contributor: que pais? what country?"}
{"original": "carter: how long have you been walking?"}
{"original": "please put your hands down. don't worry. don't worry. i'm a journalist."}
{"original": "carter: do you know where you're at right now."}
{"original": "carter: who brought you here? who helped you?"}
{"original": "unidentified male: who helped you (inaudible)"}
{"original": "unidentified male: mexico, i don't know."}
{"original": "carter: what was the first country you came after bangladesh?"}
{"original": "carter: dubai, brazil, and then through central america?"}
{"original": "carter: and then up here to the united states."}
{"original": "hannity: and you have the media and democrats telling you, this is a manufactured crisis. we're going to have more from sara's trip to the border coming up. you're definitely going to want to see what she has delivered."}
{"original": "also last night, in order to address many of these issues, the president delivered a powerful address, unveiled a plan to fix this crisis, but the democrats telling you, this is a manufactured crisis. we're going to have more from sara's trip to the border coming up. you're definitely going to want to see what she has delivered."}
{"original": "also last night, in order to address many of these issues, the president delivered a powerful address, unveiled a plan to fix this crisis, but the left, their friends, their willing accomplices and their media doesn't seem to care."}
{"original": "look at late night. seth meyers actually joking about the devastation out of southern border, tweeting, is the oval office: svu?"}
{"original": "and socialist congresswoman, alexandria ocasio-cortez, even calling for ice to be abolished. take a look."}
{"original": "rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y.: women and children on that border that are trying to seek refuge and seek opportunity in the united states of america, with nothing but the shirt off their backs. they're acting more american than any person who seeks to keep them out."}
{"original": "a child died in ice custody. the president should not be asking for more money to an agency that has systematically violated human rights. the president should be really defending why we are funding such an agency at all. because right now, what we are seeing is death. right now, what we are seeing is the violation of human rights. these children and these families are being held in what are called hieleras, which are basically freezing boxes that no person should be maintained in."}
{"original": "this is systematic. it is wrong and it is anti-american."}
{"original": "ocasio-cortez, not the only democrat living in this fantasy world. yesterday, during an extremely bizarre joint speech worthy of a saturday night live open skit, a shared podium, speaker pelosi and senate minority leader chucky schumer, literally, they are scowling as they offered zero solution to the crisis and they start pushing the manufactured crisis line."}
{"original": "is this the liberal compassion that they lecture us about all the time? do they not care about human beings on both sides of the border?"}
{"original": "long time democratic strategist, even james carville, he made a joke about schumer's force democratic rebuttal. he's dead on accurate. take a look."}
{"original": "james carville, democratic strategist: i don't think they wanted to do it. i don't think they should have done it and i guarantee you, at the staff meeting tomorrow morning, somebody is going to get, you know, chewed out pretty good. the only good thing about it, it didn't matter. they could give a gettysburg address and it wouldn't matter. they didn't want to be - - i've been more excited about colonoscopies than his speech tonight."}
{"original": "hannity: funny and true and accurate, but not really a laughing matter when you talk about the issue."}
{"original": "you know, over the course of my career, 30 years in radio, my 23rd year here at fox, i have interviewed way too many angel moms, dads, brothers and sisters over the years, people that lost children, are paying a pain that never most recover from. and this is a pain in which the president now is looking to solve a problem, opening the door to the white house, urging lawmakers from both sides -- both parties to come and negotiate."}
{"original": "but during today's meeting, democrats again they're not interested at all. for them, political optics trumps all."}
{"original": "rep. kevin mccarthy, r-calif., minority leader: i want to turn floor over, the president said to, speaker pelosi and schumer. she began to argue whether we even have a crisis or whether facts are true. turned to schumer again, who said, we just have to open the government up."}
{"original": "the president then turned to the speaker, and politely asked her, ok, nancy, if we open the government up, in 30 days, could we have border security? she raised her hand and said, no, not all. the president calmly said, i guess you're still not wanting to deal with the problem."}
{"original": "the president wants to solve this problem. that's why he continues to bring us down. that's why he's put offer on the table. not once have the democrats offered anything back. and way they displayed and their behavior is embarrassing to me."}
{"original": "hannity: in 2006, remember, democrats had a very different perception and different ideas, and they and republicans came together to fund a partial border wall. they supported then, the secure fence act, allowed over $50 billion over the next two decades to construct and maintain hundreds of miles of new barriers. sixty-four democrats in the house voted in favor of the bill and the senate, passed with overwhelming support, both parties, including chucky schumer and then senator hillary clinton, and california senators boxer and feinstein, and even barack obama voted to fund the wall."}
{"original": "now, campus reform recently asked college students to react to quotes from several top democrats who once supported a border wall, they did it about a twist. take a look."}
{"original": "campus reform: what's your thought on his push for the wall?"}
{"original": "unidentified female: i'm not a fan."}
{"original": "campus reform: everyone has a shared reaction to this."}
{"original": "unidentified male: i really don't see a need for it."}
{"original": "campus reform: we should spend money to build a barrier, to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in."}
{"original": "another quote: we cannot allow people to pour into the u.s. undetected, undocumented and unchecked."}
{"original": "quote: illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple. until the american people are convinced, we will stop illegal immigration. we'll make no progress."}
{"original": "when you hear quotes like that. what's your reaction to them?"}
{"original": "unidentified male: it's divisive. i think america is a land of opportunity, a place for inclusion."}
{"original": "unidentified female: i just really think it's really kind of hateful speech in general."}
{"original": "unidentified female: it's a negative message."}
{"original": "campus reform: what if i told you this was from chuck schumer, barack obama and hillary clinton."}
{"original": "hannity: well, trump says it's bad. democrats say it's good. now trump's president and the wall to democrats is suddenly immoral. actually, democrats, what they're doing is playing politics and risking in the process, the lives of american citizens, just because they don't like donald trump, who wants to solve a problem."}
{"original": "and yet, the solution they once supported is effective. we know the law works. after completion of the wall, south of san diego, illegal traffic drops by approximately 92 percent. the wall in el paso, texas, resulted in a significant drop as it did, walls in tucson and yuma, arizona, where they extended one wall from five miles to 65 miles, it drops 95 percent."}
{"original": "the president is now requesting one tenth of 1 percent of our federal budget to build more strategic barriers. he's also requesting increased border patrol, and ice personnel, and an increase in detention capacity and humanitarian resources and counter smuggling tools along with other important technology."}
{"original": "it's not a radical plan. it's a plan to keep america safe. it address what is is an urgent serious crisis."}
{"original": "so let me say, i understand, by the way, the concerns. twenty-five percent partial government shutdown are furloughed. workers furloughed."}
{"original": "look, i've been there in my life, living paycheck to paycheck. it's not fun. they will and should and deserve to re coupe all of their money. while they're not working, they deserve it."}
{"original": "and this is, though, for others. life and death, literally, preventable death, which makes this all the more frustrating. officer singh is gone forever. the corcorans will never see their song pierce again."}
{"original": "the families of the people you see on the right of your screen throughout the night tonight, they deserve better. these deaths are not manufactured. this is not a manufactured crisis."}
{"original": "and democrats and their allies in the media, their talking point, frankly is cold, heartless, it's a lie and frankly, a slap in the face to every angel mom and dad and family member in this country that have lost loved once, as a result of open borders and illegal immigration, or every family that has lost a loved one from a heroin overdose or from other drugs smuggled over our wide open borders."}
{"original": "the clashes with border patrol agents, rocks, bottles thrown, chaos, destruction, they also -- that's not manufactured, that's real. democrats, remember, it wasn't a manufactured crisis because they were politically bludgeoning trump over the family separation issue, something he eventually stopped that happened in the previous two administrations. it wasn't a manufactured crisis for the democrats or the media when they were bludgeoning our brave border patrol officers who had to use tear gas after they were being pelted with rocks and bottles. remember, the left accused them of gassing children."}
{"original": "so, pelosi, schumer, the rest of the democratic party and the media want to stay on manufactured crisis and allow this to continue and play a political game? the president, he will have the full authority and power to declare a national emergency and tackle this head on with or without congressional funding approval or he could use the defense department. this is about protecting our homeland."}
{"original": "but, first, it's up to you. look at the number on your screen, you might want to call, ask your member of congress or the senate, to hold the line. this is too important -- 202-224-3121."}
{"original": "joining us now, congressman mark meadows of freedom caucus, jim jordan of freedom caucus as well."}
{"original": "jim, you look like you're standing out the white house. is that where you are?"}
{"original": "rep. jim jordan, r-oh: no, no, i'm in the studio."}
{"original": "look, we're losing all these lives. ninety percent of the heroin comes in. human trafficking, drug trafficking, violence -- i mean, if saving american lives isn't a priority, i don't -- why do we have of the government? what is their role?"}
{"original": "jordan: sean, you're exactly right. i loved your opening statements."}
{"original": "look, the vast majority of the country understands this is a crisis. democrats get it. republicans get it. independents get it."}
{"original": "the only people who don't get it are democrats in washington, d.c., and it comes right down to this issue. democrats in washington are more concern about stopping the president than they are in helping the country. more concern about stopping president trump than dealing with 400,000 apprehension on the border last year alone, and the drugs, the gangs, the human traffic violence that you talked about."}
{"original": "so, until their constituents tell them -- that's why it's great, you put the number on there. until their constituents tell them, focus on the country. focus on the crisis. we're not going to get this problem solved and we saw that today in the meeting that the presidents had with congressional leader."}
{"original": "hannity: you know, congressman meadows, if we can stop 90 percent of the heroin that comes into the country, and if we can -- look. i support immigration. i believe 98 percent of people that run across the border and even illegally, want a better life."}
{"original": "but it's the 2 percent. it's the criminal element. it's the cartels. it's the human traffickers. it's potential terrorist that come to our border and want to bring harm to our cities and towns."}
{"original": "why is this so unconcerning to them?"}
{"original": "rep. mark meadows, r-n.c.: well, it should be very concerning. and you mentioned it earlier. that's why government was actually founded and supported is to protect and serve. and if government is falling down on its fundamental premise of why it exists, then we have got to do better than that."}
{"original": "but, you know, listen, sean, the big thing today is going to be the fact that the president walked out of a meeting because he said it was a waste of time to deal with democrats because they're not negotiating. and you're exactly right. he should --"}
{"original": "hannity: well, they offered a dollar. they're insulting -- they sent aides to negotiate with the vice president. pretty insulting."}
{"original": "meadows: exactly. they're not negotiating. they're not negotiating in good faith."}
{"original": "he should have walked out that have meeting but i'll tell you who he's not walking out on. he's not walking out on the moms and dads who have lost their children. he's not walking out on law enforcement officers who have to fight this each and every day and sometimes tragedy strikes there. he's not walking out on the families who have to deal with drug overdoses each and every day. he's staying engaged and i applaud him for doing that and we need to get behind him."}
{"original": "hannity: i know the president means what he says. we learned that about him in two years."}
{"original": "will the republicans in the house and senate hold the lines and stand up on the principle that these lives can be saved? jim jordan?"}
{"original": "jordan: we will, we held together when the democrats offered an appropriation bill, spending bill in the house floor. only a handful of republicans voted with the democrats. so, we're holding strong and we're going to continue to hold strong because this is a crisis."}
{"original": "the drug problem, the gang problem, the human trafficking problem is real. everyone gets it, except democrats in washington d.c."}
{"original": "and again, they're too much focused -- they're too focused on just stopping the president. let's address this. how could it not be a crisis? when we have seen this caravan phenomenon over the last several months play out on our southern border. anyone who's watching knows it's a crisis."}
{"original": "meadows: yes, it's not a manufactured crisis. it's a crisis that is happening on our southern border. but more importantly, it's a crisis that's happening in our communities, each and every day. we've got to make sure we fight back, stand strong and stand with this president and take the political games out of it."}
{"original": "hannity: you know what? there are things worth fighting for. american lives are one of them."}
{"original": "when we come back -- thank you both -- congressman dan crenshaw, retired navy seal. he is here to explain why walls do work."}
{"original": "sara carter, exclusive footage of illegal immigrants, caught on camera crossing the border into texas. tammy bruce, kirstjen nielsen from dhs and much more."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. fox news contributor sara carter, she is currently in texas where she has been investigating the border situation for herself, while roaming the border area, she had a remarkable run-in with suspected illegal immigrants, coming from bangladesh into the united states, our most southern border."}
{"original": "sara carter, contributor: que pais? what country?"}
{"original": "carter: how long have you been walking?"}
{"original": "carter: three months. who brought you here?"}
{"original": "who brought you here? did you pay? lots of money."}
{"original": "carter: yes. together. you pay. how much?"}
{"original": "unidentified male: how much -- $16,000."}
{"original": "carter: sixteen thousand dollar to get here to the u.s."}
{"original": "hannity: now, meanwhile, newly elected republican congressman dan crenshaw has a new term for those choosing to ignore the border crisis, tweeting, quote, definition of border denialism, one, the belief that physical barriers can simply be climbed over, just like that. two, the belief that there's no real problem on the border because 400,000 illegals apprehended on the border per year is insignificant. three, that the belief that because you can't put a wall everywhere, the rio grande, you should therefore, put a wall nowhere."}
{"original": "here with reaction, fox news contributors, sara carter, down at the border, tammy bruce, texas congressman dan crenshaw."}
{"original": "the tape is really compelling, sara, and, by the way, we have an announcement coming up at the end of the show. you're down there, and i'm watching these two guys and they must have thought you were there to arrest them. i mean, it could of course a more dangerous situation depending."}
{"original": "how do they get there from bangladesh?"}
{"original": "carter: well, sean, it was just as shocking for me. i mean, i had been to that area before in 2014. this had been a crisis, an ongoing crisis, through various administrations, and i saw people crossing, maybe unaccompanied minors. in 2014, at least 50 i ran into, that summer, that i was down there."}
{"original": "so, within 10 minutes of being at the rio grande river, on the border, these two men came up to me. they were coming up the road. they apparently thought that i was law enforcement, i was there with an off duty law enforcement officer and i got to tell you, their story was very compelling."}
{"original": "remember, bangladesh is a special interest country, so these are special interest aliens. and what that means is people from bangladesh, pakistan, afghanistan, iraq, and other nations that are considered special interest aliens. and what that means is, people from bangladesh, pakistan, afghanistan, iraq and other nations that are considered special interests aliens, are from countries where either al-qaeda, islamic state other various terrorist groups have had influence."}
{"original": "so these two men seemed perfectly fine. they - i had to explain to them that i was a journalist. they agreed to talk with me. they eventually did. had little bit of understanding of english and they were able to explain that they went from bangladesh to dubai through brazil."}
{"original": "and once they get into brazil, sean, then they're either going through costa rica, colombia then all the way up through central - sorry i'm at an outdoor area. then they go all the way up through central america and into mexico. and then from mexico they make their way into the united states. but these people had no idea that they were even in the united states when they ran into me."}
{"original": "hannity: unbelievable story, and great footage. thanks for doing that for us. congressman crenshaw. i like your new definition of denialism. it seems like - i've interviewed too many angel moms and dads and families, including this week, and that's pierce corcoran's parents on this program. a five month old little boy, he's never going to see his hero father who was shot as a police officer, officer singh. they're really - to say it's manufactured, is beyond insulting to me."}
{"original": "rep. dan crenshaw, r-tx: it absolutely is. and we have angel parents and in my district as well, i think everybody does. the first thing we have to consider is, is there a problem on the border? and i use that 400,000 number, i think that's the right number to use, because that's the number of apprehensions that border patrol agents conduct on the border every single year."}
{"original": "that's - how many football stadiums can you fill with that number? that's a completely unsustainable problem and number. and so then we have to ask, well, what's the solution here? well the solution is a mix of things. right? it's a physical barrier where that makes sense. it's drone technology, it's sensor technology."}
{"original": "and the democrats like to talk about those latter things. but when you mention walls in certain places they refuse to talk anymore. but that matters, right? barriers matters. and they can dismiss in the smug way as ineffective and forced sensory solutions. they just dismiss it out of hand without any thought or evidence to back that. but the reality is, those do work, and they do matter."}
{"original": "i was a navy seal, so we have a long career worth of infiltrating places and walls actually matter. and i'd love to see them - love to the democrat - my colleagues come down with me and climb over these things or tunnel under them, nancy pelosi said today."}
{"original": "hannity: yes, i've been down there about 12 times myself. tammy, there's a certain arrogance that the democrats had as the american - 88 percent of the american people do not believe it's a manufactured crisis."}
{"original": "tammy bruce, president of independent women's voice: right."}
{"original": "hannity: you see the drugs traffickers, cartels, gang members. so we know people that have been impacted by this. it's happening in small towns and big cities. but the arrogance - we'll give you a dollar. we're not going to negotiate it all. when is this backfire? because i see a major boomerang coming."}
{"original": "bruce: i think it already has. and, look, it's the president's existence, him being elected, him standing up for what he believes in that has exposed the democrat leadership for the craven grifters that they are and the american people are the mark."}
{"original": "i know we don't have a lot of time, but just let me say this. they have voted for certain things as the establishment before like the wall and they did it because they knew it would never happen. trump is the threat, because he will get it done. and what is so craven here and what is so awful is that this is a crisis."}
{"original": "a little while ago the democrats cared for one minute about the two dead children that we had, horrible, horrific situation, we still care about them. that is a crisis. the number of people who are coming up who the cpb, say, or have been ill for a long time, tuberculosis, the flu, hepatitis, hiv, that they are coming because of the incentive of free health care that you hear now about being offered even more extensively by california and new york."}
{"original": "bruce: this is to not end and the american people understand that our lives are at stake, but so are the lives of the people who are being used as a political cudgel by the democrats in this country. supporting the president is key, this is key for the future of the country for every american family."}
{"original": "hannity: call your congressman or senator, good point. (202) 224-3121. thank you all very compelling. when we come back we have a big announcement that we will be sharing with you. also, exclusively, will talk with the homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen, she'll join us and she'll explain the humanitarian crisis on our southern border and that announcement coming up straight ahead."}
{"original": "president donald trump: my fellow americans, tonight i am speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. every day customs and border patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country."}
{"original": "we are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country. america proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who would reach our society and contribute to our nation. but all americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. that was the president last night in his address on our crisis on the southern border. joining us now is homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen is with us. madam secretary, good to see you."}
{"original": "kirstjen nielsen, united states secretary of homeland security: good to see you, sean."}
{"original": "hannity: you were in the situation room today, not a very long meeting, not a productive meeting, give us your thoughts."}
{"original": "nielsen: i - you know, as i said in the snow, i just have through the meeting. i just am thoroughly disappointed. this is a severe humanitarian and security crisis. the president is taking leadership. he is taking decisive action and congress continues to refuse to act. he's made it very clear what the crisis is, what we need to do, they have no alternative."}
{"original": "they will not - they refused to engage and it's very, very disappointing. it's disappointing on behalf of the 240,000 men and women who are trying to secure this country, but it's also disappointing as an american."}
{"original": "hannity: madam secretary, there are some simple facts here that they're saying - their party line is this is a manufactured crisis. but we do know this. we do know 90 percent of our heroin comes from the southern border and that we have about 300 deaths per week."}
{"original": "we do know that in the last two weeks we lost police officer singh and he has a five month old little boy, will never know his father. we do know pierce corcoran, his parents were on this show earlier in the week. we do know their 22-year-old son killed by an illegal immigrant."}
{"original": "drug trafficking, human trafficking, we have drug deaths, we have other deaths, violence, cartels, gangs, how do you - what is your response when they say it's manufactured, when these are real people, real lives, life and death, and they just ignore it?"}
{"original": "nielsen: yes. i mean, it's offensive, it's disrespectful. i can't imagine being one of these victims' families and listening to an elected member of congress claim that their pain and their suffering is manufactured. its offensive, is what it is. but it's also unprofessional."}
{"original": "hannity: for some people in the media it's been like a numbers game. we do know americans die. we do know - i'd argue probably 98 percent of people that want to come here want hope, opportunity, liberty, freedom and all the things we may even take for granted ourselves. but it's a 2% i worry about that are part of the gangs, the drug cartels."}
{"original": "the 2% maybe you have talked about, but you can't give numbers. there are instances that you can confirm that you know of terrorists that have tried to cross our southern border and we've apprehended them."}
{"original": "nielsen: yes, sean, and we've talked about the thousands - the thousands of terror watchlist individuals who traveled through our hemisphere last year. to pretend there's not a danger on an unsecured border, on an open border is just ridiculous. if belies common sense."}
{"original": "but it's not just a security crisis that the president and the vice president continued to draw the american public's attention to, it's a humanitarian crisis. we have doctors at our border saying one in three women on this journey are raped. seven out of 10 of these migrants are victims of violence. this is a humanitarian crisis that is caused by the pull of the loopholes in our law, by our lack of resources and by the refusal of democrats to act."}
{"original": "hannity: what do you make and how do you explain that chuck schumer, nancy pelosi, joe biden, barack obama, hillary clinton, just a few years ago, 2013, they were willing to allocate $48 billion for border security as part of a gang of eight plan. and then they're making the point that it's not needed anymore or it's manufactured."}
{"original": "but, yet if you look at the one sector in arizona, yuma border sector it was one of the in the country and they went from five miles of border fencing to 63 miles and they saw a reduction of 95 percent in apprehensions and people being able to cross into the country illegally. doesn't that prove the point in that one county that it works, walls work, barriers work?"}
{"original": "nielsen: sean, walls work. i mean, we can't say it enough. the facts are incontrovertible. anywhere that we have built wall illegal migration has dropped between 90 and 95 percent. they know that, those are the facts. they've been to the border themselves. they claim that they've talked to our border patrol agents. they claim they're in favor of border security."}
{"original": "what the president continues to make clear is this is not an either, this is not and/or situation, this is an and. we need security at our ports of entry and we need security between the ports of entry."}
{"original": "hannity: there is politics being played here, though, madam secretary. because it was a crisis when they could bludgeon the president politically and say the kids were being separated from their parents, which should happen in the two previous administrations, and this president fixed it."}
{"original": "or when they could say after our border agents will be in pelted with rocks and bottles, they could say, oh, they - our border patrol and ice were teargassing children. so it seems to be a crisis when they could politicize it. but americans are dying in big numbers because of that small percentage of the criminal element. drugs are coming in every day. and what do you say when people - when lives are at stake and people are playing politics? it's clear, it's politics."}
{"original": "nielsen: i hate that i agree with you on this point, sean, but i do, it is politics. and what i think that i would say in response is the president and the vice president continue to take leadership. they continue to try to solve this crisis. they continue to describe it for what it is. they're doing it with compassion."}
{"original": "i think you saw a president last night that was very serious. that was taking a leadership role. he was showing compassion, and very importantly he was making it clear that he continues to listen to the men and women who are on the frontline who protect this country every day, often at danger to their own lives. that's what the president is doing."}
{"original": "i don't know what the democrats are doing, because the president has made offers, the president has explained to them what needs to be done. they have come up with no solutions on their own. but they continue to claim, as you said that this is a manufactured crisis. nothing could be further from the truth."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. secretary nielsen, thank you so much for being with us. we appreciate it."}
{"original": "hannity: this is a matter of life and death. these are american lives, american kids, real drugs, real cartels, real gang members, and real violence. joe concha, larry elder, they will join us next. we'll talk about the hate trump media, their outrageous reaction to the president's speech last night. and we have a major announcement that's coming up straight ahead."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. not surprised that media is absolutely unable to cover the president's oval office address without letting their trump hatred, well, get in the way. take a look."}
{"original": "carl bernstein, political analyst, cnn: we're talking about a wall here that is a symbol that says, brown people, we don't want you."}
{"original": "jim acosta, chief white house correspondent, cnn: that address probably should have come with a surgeon general's warning, it was hazardous to the truth."}
{"original": "rep. james clyburn, d-s.c.: we saw a reckless president morph into a feckless presidency."}
{"original": "joe lockhart, cnn political commentator: when you look at this speech is the definition of being disingenuous."}
{"original": "unidentified male: what was the point of that exercise? it felt - and this entire process, by the way, feels like a colossal waste of time so he can deliver on a chant he began three years ago at some of his rallies. the government is tied up because of it, we're tied up because of it, the american people are tied up because of it, and it's all about nothing."}
{"original": "hannity: joining us now, salem radio talk show host, larry elder, and the hill and hannity special media correspondent, joe concha is with us. larry, let me just - really they speak in one voice, they use the same words and i watch this, it's every second, minute, hour, every 24-hour day - hate trump, hate trump."}
{"original": "larry elder, american radio show host: well, that's right. it's - i've never seen this level of hatred. they've always disliked republicans. george herbert walker bush was called a racist by maxine waters. george w. bush was called a racist by barney frank, who accused him of ethnic cleansing by inaction for allegedly responding sluggishly to hurricane katrina."}
{"original": "but this is a whole level of hatred. and i think it has a lot to do with the fact that donald trump has put the media on notice. we know the media has engaged in fake news. we know the media has been biased for years. donald trump is the first one to call him out on it, and that's why they dislike him so much."}
{"original": "hannity: the fact that they all say the same thing, joe, it's like one voice. manufactured crisis - will any of them ever have the courage to say that to an angel mom or dad or family?"}
{"original": "joe concha, media reporter, the hill: well, it's easy from the ivory towers of new york and washington, the media centers - political media centers of the country. so, yes, i would imagine that that wouldn't be the case."}
{"original": "but remember what the media tenor was going into yesterday's address. we were told, almost guaranteed, the president is going to lie. that the networks needed to deliberate even to carry the speech on their networks without either delay or at all because they needed to fact-check it first. they were demanding that a text of the context of the speech was supposed to be given to them."}
{"original": "but then a funny thing happened. the fact checkers didn't have a heck of a lot to do. so then they started to injecting their opinions into the fact checks. i mean, if you saw the washington post yesterday, they actually fact-checked the president when he said, the 266,000 illegal aliens were arrested over the last two years."}
{"original": "and they said this quoting, the number is right, but misleading. no, no, no, when you fact check something, if the number is right. that should end the fact check. but instead they went into this whole diatribe on how you can't include immigration offenses in there. no, a crime is a crime is a crime and once you start nitpicking at that then you look stupid, even when you're fact-checking. the media really dropped the ball on this one."}
{"original": "hannity: and larry, when secretary nielsen said, well pelosi goes, i don't take your facts. she said they're not mine. they are the facts."}
{"original": "hannity: i know. this is hysterical. i imagine where was jim acosta saying that there ought to be a surgeon general warning during the eight years of the obama administration when he told whopper after whopper that moved major policy."}
{"original": "we're talking about obamacare, that radically changed the way we get health care in this country. and he said several whoppers, including it'll bend the cost curve down most, economists did not believe that. they said his mother, as she lay dying at a hospital bed in hawaii, was fighting with her health insurance carriers over paying her hospital bills, turned out that was not true."}
{"original": "and of course, the big one, if you like your doctor you can keep your doctor. what about the whopper he told when he pulled all the troops out of iraq. he said after isis metastasized, hey, my hands were tied because george w. bush had entered into a timetable. that was not true. where was the graphic? why didn't people - there to be some sort of graphic saying."}
{"original": "hannity: yes, yes. let me show this joe this. joe, i would think there's an opportunity here to put politics aside when 90% of heroin comes in from that southern border, put - when people, when we know the 2 percent of the criminal element that we'd be protecting american lives. that - where is that part of the media and that part of the democratic party?"}
{"original": "concha: i remember during 2016 campaign that afterwards people asked me, well, what did the media do wrong? and my answer was they didn't go to ohio and michigan and pennsylvania and wisconsin to get the feeling on the ground, to talk to the people that were there. and the same thing should be happening here."}
{"original": "we should be seeing reporting from the border and on those situations like you talked about, whether it be drug trafficking, human trafficking. those are the reports we should be seeing instead of people opining from afar of what they think people should think, sean."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. thank you both, great analysis. when we come back, our big announcement, that's next."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. quick programming note, tomorrow the president is headed to mcallen, texas to tour the southern border. we will be there. we are traveling to the lone star state and we will broadcast from there tomorrow night."}
{"original": "we will be interviewing the president and ted cruz and secretary nielsen and border patrol agents themselves. we have a lot to talk to, well, to president and everyone else about tomorrow night. that's tomorrow 9:00 eastern right here on the fox news channel."}
{"original": "think about it from this perspective. when you think about human lives suffering, isn't it worth protecting americans first? but let not your heart be troubled. the news continues. laura ingraham is standing by in the sewer, the swamp known as washington d.c."}

{"original": "president trump never mentioned impeachment in his state of the union address tuesday night."}
{"original": "but tuesday night was all about impeachment."}
{"original": "the capitol pulsed with apprehension before the address. would trump veer off script? lambaste the speaker on the dais? upbraid house democrats?"}
{"original": "yours truly found aides rolling a wheelchair-bound rush limbaugh into the capitol just moments before the speech, to receive the presidential medal of freedom. congressional republicans chanted: four more years! four more years! as though they were delegates on the floor of a quadrennial political convention."}
{"original": "would democrats go joe wilson on trump, hectoring him from the backbenches?"}
{"original": "trump condemns 'evil' impeachment after senate acquittal: 'it was a disgrace'"}
{"original": "one can often distill a state of the union speech into a moment or two. the same could be said for tuesday night's speech. only this time, the emblematic events never unfolded inside the body of the speech. episodes just before the speech -- and seconds after the speech -- crystallized tuesday night's address. there were two, visual philippics: trump refusing to shake the hand of house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif. -- and the speaker later shredding trump's remarks like they were junk mail."}
{"original": "you likely wouldn't have had either episode were it not for impeachment."}
{"original": "in a few days, few will remember what the president said during his address."}
{"original": "but everyone will recall what unfolded on the dais between the speaker and the president for decades. after all, actions speak louder than words."}
{"original": "years from now, the history books will note a handful of defining moments about pelosi's speakership. she was the first female house speaker. the highest-elected woman in u.s. history -- if voters still haven't elected a female as president. she ushered obamacare to passage. and then, there was pelosi's decision to peel trump's speech in front of a national television audience back in 2020."}
{"original": "a clutch of reporters descended on house majority leader steny hoyer, d-md., shortly after the speech to ask if pelosi's rebuke was appropriate."}
{"original": "nobody yelled out 'you lie!' said hoyer, a reference to rep. joe wilson, r-s.c., ignominiously badgering then-president barack obama during a joint session of congress on obamacare in 2009."}
{"original": "but frankly, pelosi did. she didn't have to say a word."}
{"original": "i tore up a manifesto of mistruths, said pelosi at her weekly press conference thursday. i don't need any lessons from anybody, especially the president of the united states, about dignity."}
{"original": "the speaker described her action as entirely appropriate, and, considering some of the other exuberances within me, the courteous thing to do."}
{"original": "for good or ill, congress and its traditions course through pelosi's blood."}
{"original": "she's served in congress since 1987. this is pelosi's second turn at the speakership. her father, the late rep. thomas d'alesandro d-md., represented baltimore on capitol hill in the 1930s and '40s."}
{"original": "pelosi's decision to rip up the president's script reflected the territorial tension between the branches of government. the constitution mandates a convergence of the legislative and executive branches for the state of the union. state of the union speeches are inherently awkward when the house or senate majority is of one party and the president comes from the other. but the juxtaposition of an impeached trump -- at the time in the middle of his senate trial -- orating in a house chamber, controlled by democrats, augmented the anxiety."}
{"original": "pelosi's visceral reaction encapsulated a turf war. this was inevitable, considering the nature of trump's speech and how the speaker believed the president annexed congress for his own benefit."}
{"original": "we do not want the chamber of the house of representatives to be used as a backdrop for one of his reality shows with unreality in his presentation, charged pelosi. we will not allow any president to use that capitol, that chamber of the house of representatives, of the people's house, as a backdrop for him."}
{"original": "nearly all lawmakers bring a special guest to the state of the union. it's often a constituent from law enforcement or someone from the health care community. the guests serve as de facto props, aligned with the views of a particular lawmaker, maximizing media attention and underscoring a political point. former rep. vince mcallister, r-la., brought willie robertson of duck dynasty to obama's 2014 state of the union speech. for this year's address, rep. ted deutch, d-fla., invited fred guttenberg, father of jaime guttenberg, who was killed in the 2018 parkland school shooting."}
{"original": "it's like strength in numbers. boisterous nfl fans wearing the jerseys of their teams to a raucous sports bar on a sunday afternoon."}
{"original": "pelosi flagged the president's recognition of what she termed constant guests in the viewing gallery, peering over the house chamber."}
{"original": "we want a state of the union, pelosi said, not 'let me just show you how many guests i can draw out.'"}
{"original": "the speaker even flagged trump ceding time to his wife to present the presidential medal of freedom to rush limbaugh."}
{"original": "do it in your own office, said pelosi. we don't come to your office and do congressional business."}
{"original": "the animosity prompted jake sherman of politico to ask the speaker if she'd invite trump back for another state of the union. of course, the voters will have a say in that come november. and don't forget, nothing says that the president has to deliver a speech to congress."}
{"original": "article ii, section 3 of the constitution dictates that the president shall from time to time give to the congress information on the state of the union."}
{"original": "the constitution is silent on the medium."}
{"original": "george washington delivered speeches to congress during his terms in office. but thomas jefferson halted the practice, submitting a missive to congress. it would be more than a century until woodrow wilson rekindled the speech tradition. harry truman gave the first televised address in 1947. state of the union never fell in primetime until lyndon johnson came along in the mid-1960s."}
{"original": "in such a divided country, in such a toxified political climate, it's hard to see how the 2020 state of the union speech could have gone down in any other fashion -- punctuated by trump's impeachment trial."}

{"original": "on the heels of the mueller report concluding there was no collusion between the trump campaign and russia, president trump is arguably having his best week. but reviving the health-care debate may derail it, fox news politics editor chris stirewalt said wednesday."}
{"original": "in a sharp policy piviot, the department of justice declared it would move forward to eliminate president obama's signature legislation, the affordable care act (aca), after a court deemed it unconstitutional."}
{"original": "during wednesday's all-star panel segment on fox news' special report with bret baier, stirewalt -- along with national journal politics editor josh kraushaar and national security analyst morgan ortagus -- weighed in on the political ramifications of trump's renewed fight against the aca, also known as obamacare."}
{"original": "congressional republicans rattled by trump's pivot to obamacare fight after mueller summary"}
{"original": "stirewalt declared that this was a good week for the republican party and the best week of donald trump's presidency because of the positive outcomes of the mueller report."}
{"original": "to dive into this in this way is not politically savvy for one simple reason: obamacare is popular, stirewalt told the panel. it's above 50 percent and people are generally satisfied. quinnipiac polling this week was absolutely clear: people want status quo, don't take away what we got and that's exactly what republicans are talking about."}
{"original": "kraushaar agreed, calling a battle over obamacare a potentially self-inflicting wound for president trump because health care is the one issue that has dogged republicans."}
{"original": "voters, both republicans and democrats, are incrementalists. they're looking at the party that isn't gonna disrupt the status quo more. and you have a lot of democrats talking about single payer, talking about a lot of really radical proposals on the presidential campaign trail, kraushaar said. well, here you have trump now saying 'i just want to rip up obamacare and i'm gonna support this court ruling.' so you have a lot of congressional republicans really scratching their heads."}

{"original": "the justice department filed a letter wednesday to notify the court that the united states no longer adheres to the conclusions in the previously filed brief. the health care case was argued a week after the election in november."}
{"original": "the trump administration called on the justices to strike down the entire obama-era health law under which some 23 million people get health insurance and millions more with preexisting health conditions are protected from discrimination."}
{"original": "the fight is over whether a 2017 change in a provision of the law known as the individual mandate rendered it unconstitutional. congress eliminated the penalty for not having health insurance."}
{"original": "the trump administration backed the view of texas and other republican-led states that if such an important part of the law is invalid, the entire law should fall with it."}
{"original": "in wednesday's letter, the justice department said the now-toothless mandate remains constitutional, but that even if the court decides otherwise, the rest of the law should be left alone."}

{"original": "the biden justice department last month asked the justices to postpone arguments in two immigration cases. oral arguments had been scheduled in the coming days, but the high court agreed to put off consideration of private challenges to trump executive orders on using military funds to build the border wall and to enforce its stay in mexico policy for asylum seekers."}
{"original": "the associated press contributed to this report."}
{"original": "by most conventional measures, president biden should be riding pretty high."}
{"original": "he is about to score his first major legislative victory, pumping nearly $2 trillion—a staggering figure—into the economy to deal with the pandemic. a new abc poll shows 68 percent of those surveyed approving of his approach to the crisis, a figure that includes 35 percent of republicans. and he says every american will be able to get a vaccination by the end of may."}
{"original": "yes, but: the senate and house passed the giant packages without a single republican vote. what happened to biden's talk of bipartisanship?"}
{"original": "the biden team felt that republican offers were way too low for any meaningful compromise. they were wary, after biden's experience in the obama administration, of having marathon talks that ultimately led to nothing. they were also hellbent on moving quickly, given the fragile state of the economy and the ticking clock on jobless benefits."}
{"original": "yes, but: republicans say the bill is a christmas tree with all kinds of costly ornaments that have little to do with the pandemic."}
{"original": "that's true. there's $86 billion targeted for a taxpayer bailout of nearly 200 union pension plans on the verge of collapse. and more than $100 billion in tax credits for families with children, which expires in a year but could later be made permanent. that would boost the democrats' longtime goal of drastically reducing child poverty."}

{"original": "yes, but: didn't biden have to cave to joe manchin? and doesn't that mean he can blow up any future white house legislation?"}
{"original": "in a 50-50 senate, a moderate like manchin has enormous leverage, so he was able to get a smaller and shorter package of unemployment benefits. he and a half-dozen other democrats also made sure there would be no $15 minimum wage. this has ticked off the party's bernie wing but may have a hidden benefit: keeping biden from being pulled too far to the left."}
{"original": "yes, but: trump republicans say biden is pushing a stunningly liberal agenda on immigration, climate change and other issues. they say he'll lose support when the scope of his left-wing goals becomes clear."}
{"original": "well, maybe. it sure may seem that way to conservatives who may like his handling of the pandemic. just yesterday he created a white house gender policy council. the immigration bill is probably going nowhere. he also wants to push infrastructure spending that could have some appeal to republicans. but biden has largely avoided the culture-war stuff, limiting himself to symbolic gestures."}

{"original": "predictably, of course, never trump republicans are also taking up the chorus. ross douthat of the new york times tweeted in part, good rules for life: don't let your catholic school's students wear maga hats on for a field trip for the march for life."}
{"original": "and of course bill kristol never misses an opportunity to hit the president and his supporters even when he has his facts wrong said, the contrast between the calm dignity and quiet strength of mr. phillips and the behavior of maga brats who have absorbed the spirit of trumpism - this spectacle is a lesson which all americans can learn."}
{"original": "whether a piece of clothing says feel the bern or i'm with her, it's all the form of political expression, and thus it is speech protected by the first amendment. you can be offended by it, but you can't purposely use it to intimidate and frighten people and even terrorize them."}
{"original": "but today's left, joined by the rabid never trumpers are so desperate to be proven right about the president. they seize on symbols instead of solving problems. all right, guys it's a lot easier isn't it to brand kids races for what they're wearing then to debate adults on things like immigration and trade policy."}
{"original": "but for some maga, well, it symbolizes something very different."}
{"original": "kanye west, american rapper: it was something about when i put this hat on, it made me feel like superman. you made a superman. that's my favorite superhero, and you made a superman cape --"}
{"original": "ingraham: well, kanye kind of saw this all coming when he said, he didn't want people to control him, to tell him what or how to think, because of the color of his skin."}
{"original": "today's real rebels are the kids who dared to show up for the march for life last friday. today's real rebels are the faithful who refused to genuflect to what's popular and instead defend what they think is right. today's real rebels, they reject the collectivist mindset of hollywood, the media, and the universities that obliterate history, instead of actually teaching it."}
{"original": "and, yes, today's rebels will wear maga hats knowing that they might be abused for doing so like the covington kids were. even in the end, it's really not about the hat, is it? it's about 2020. trump hating fanatics aim to deprive the president of any opportunity to brand his re-election campaign. in other words, any trump paraphernalia will be verboten."}
{"original": "i thought about this today and it's actually in its own way a form of voter intimidation and potentially lethal with consequences that are incredibly destructive. by the way, you can't scream fire, right, in a crowded theater, and you can't scream racist when someone in a crowd wears a hat you don't like and that's the angle."}
{"original": "all right. here now on what promises to be a pretty fiery debate, pastor and activist bishop talbert swan and dan bongino, host of the dan bongino podcast. bishop, i was - looking at twitter last night, couldn't sleep. and i came across your tweets. we quoted one of them in the angle."}
{"original": "and i really appreciate - first of all, i know we disagree on some issues. i really appreciate your being here tonight to share some thoughts and maybe even get somewhere, so thank you for coming."}
{"original": "bishop talbert swan, sr pastor, spring of hope cogic: thanks for having me."}
{"original": "ingraham: the video evidence that we're now seeing, when we see all of the evidence, not just a snippet, does show, bishop, that these boys did not start this confrontation. but you still see them, i believe, as the villains in this story. tell us why?"}
{"original": "swan: well when you look at the video, it's true. these young men were ridiculed by the hebrew israelites, there's no doubt about that, and there's no excuse for the behavior that those men displayed in terms of how they came at them."}
{"original": "but you cannot deny what your own eyes see when you see these young men mocking, jeering, ridiculing, the native american. you can't deny what you see on other videos when you see them accosting and yelling at women and saying things like, it's not rape if you enjoy it."}
{"original": "ingraham: bishop, bishop, what's really important tonight and i would not interrupt you--"}
{"original": "swan: let's not put in that they were not guilty of any wrong doing."}
{"original": "ingraham: bishop, this is where we have to agree on just the basics, otherwise it's not going to be a great conversation. again, just facts, that's all i'm interested in. the fact is, that--"}
{"original": "swan: but those are the facts. that video is out there."}
{"original": "ingraham: --that person who made the comment about rape is not a covington catholic high school student. he's not part of their group. none of those kids were very jeering at african-american activists. they weren't doing that bishop. i'm just telling you. they weren't doing that. they are 15- year-old kids who are standing - they were - he was standing there."}
{"original": "swan: they will mocking, they were jeering, they were ridiculing--"}
{"original": "ingraham: --nick sandmann has been threatened and he was standing there. no, they weren't. they were not doing that. and if you look at the whole tape--"}
{"original": "ingraham: --then you can actually see that."}
{"original": "swan: --i've seen the whole video. and they definitely--"}
{"original": "ingraham: ok. so you're saying - so covington catholic is lying that student is actually a member of covington catholic. dan bongino, i got to get you in here, and i'm really glad that bishop came on. but we have to get these facts straight. it's very important for an honest conversation. just like you have to get the facts straight on other issues--"}
{"original": "ingraham: --like trayvon martin and i agree with you on that bishop, by the way. we got to get those facts straight. we got to get the facts straight on something where someone did - that where somebody did not die--"}
{"original": "swan: no doubt about that. and i would love to talk about that."}
{"original": "ingraham: --but where kids have been threatened, badly threatened. dan bongino, did these boys, standing there did they trigger this behavior on the part of this activist - that we're learning a lot more about tonight, by the way, and the black hebrew israelites. did they trigger them with these maga hats?"}
{"original": "dan bongino, host of dan bongino show: laura, with due respect your other guest, i have no idea what he's talking about. i have a monitor in my office. i mean, we're all watching the same - it's like we live in a post- fact bizarro world universe."}
{"original": "you have a kid standing there in a maga hat with a political expression on it motionless, with the smile on his face, while an adult confronts the kid and yet i don't know what tape the bishop is watching. what did these kids do wrong?"}
{"original": "and then to throw in this random fact and i'm using the dreaded air (ph) quotes because it's an anti-fact, a non-fact that someone scream this about rape which they did, but they were not part of that group, is clearly either an effort to distract from the lack of a point which, i don't believe the gentleman has, or to distract from the video on the screen that we can all see."}
{"original": "these were a bunch of kids waiting for a bus while a group of activist confronted them. what video are you watching, i don't understand."}
{"original": "swan: well, if you want to pretend if - i was watching the same video you were watching. and if you want to pretend that the few moments where mr. sandmann was standing in front of mr. phillips--"}
{"original": "swan: --say all and the be all to the video, then go right ahead. but there's a lot more to the video than just that one point."}
{"original": "swan: --and you cannot sit here and tell me that these young men were not ridiculing, that they were not jeering, that they were not mocking."}
{"original": "ingraham: bishop, you're man of a cloth--"}
{"original": "swan: that's obvious. that's what i see."}
{"original": "ingraham: bishop you're a man of the cloth."}
{"original": "ingraham: and i know you don't advocate - you don't advocate violence and you don't - and you agree, i would imagine, that nonviolent standing there, even wearing a piece of clothing that people find objectionable is not grounds for them threatening to kill them, to burn them, to destroy their lives, to dox them?"}
{"original": "swan: well, laura, you and i completely agree - you and i completely agree that there's no excuse of anybody threatening to kill or to burn or to harm anyone. matter of fact, i've been getting death threats and phone calls from people on the other side, because of my tweets."}
{"original": "i emphatically condemned that type of behavior. but i also condemned the type of behavior that i saw from those young men on that particular day."}
{"original": "ingraham: what were they doing? they were standing there bishop."}
{"original": "swan: and if we want to - they were not standing there. are you and i seeing the same video? are you not seeing those young men--"}
{"original": "ingraham: what is nick sandmann doing? nick sandmann didn't speak."}
{"original": "swan: we're not talking - nick sandmann was not there by himself. there was an entire group of young men who were mocking, they were jeering, they were ridiculing--"}
{"original": "ingraham: they were reacting. they were reacting to being called incest babies--"}
{"original": "swan: and for you all that sit here and pretend that we don't hear that--"}
{"original": "swan: well, it wasn't philips who called them that."}
{"original": "ingraham: they were being called incest babies--"}
{"original": "swan: and you can't - what you can't do--"}
{"original": "swan: --what you cannot do is blame their behavior on what their interaction with the hebrew israelites were--"}
{"original": "ingraham: so someone should - ok, so people should be called incest babies and crackers and swear words, and not be able to - not respond. and when they do respond, they're the ones. i mean, first--"}
{"original": "swan: at the beginning-- ingraham: --of all, i mean, nick sandmann didn't say a thing. and those other kids weren't part of the school. but i got to ask you a simple question."}
{"original": "ingraham: is the maga hat - simple question, bishop, is the maga hat racist?"}
{"original": "swan: well, at the beginning i condemn the behavior of the hebrew israelites, so let's not pretend you all--"}
{"original": "ingraham: all right. is the maga hat racist?"}
{"original": "swan: when it comes to the maga hat, it's a piece of clothing that represents donald trump and everything that comes along with donald trump. donald trump--"}
{"original": "ingraham: so is that a yes?"}
{"original": "swan: --what is an unrepentant racist. he is an unrepentant racist."}
{"original": "swan: the maga hat, to many, is representative of a klan hood or various other symbols--"}
{"original": "swan: --of racism. absolutely. it absolutely is."}
{"original": "bongino: what's going on here? is this real? did he just say that on a cable television? bishop--"}
{"original": "bongino: --i don't want to - i not willing to defer to the man of god line to you anymore after you just said one of the dumbest comments--"}
{"original": "swan: well, it really doesn't matter what you refer to me as you don't define me."}
{"original": "bongino: that is the dumbest thing i have ever hear in seven years of doing cable news that make america great again, by the way, a slogan used by bill clinton at times too--"}
{"original": "ingraham: reagan - that was reagan's time by the way--"}
{"original": "bongino: --is racist? are you serious?"}
{"original": "bongino: so let me get this straight. donald trump - wait, wait hold on - i didn't interrupt you. so donald trump who gives you back more of your money, has fought for school choice, has black unemployment at the lowest in modern american history we've seen. donald trump, if he's a racist, he's the worst racist we've seen in american history--"}
{"original": "swan: come on, come on - donald trump--"}
{"original": "bongino: are you serious? i'm embarrassed for you and you should be too."}
{"original": "swan: donald trump calls african nations a-- hole nations."}
{"original": "ingraham: no, he calls third world nations--"}
{"original": "swan: donald trump calls mexicans rapists. donald trump calls black athletes sons of (expletive)."}
{"original": "ingraham: bishop. bishop. hold on guys. hold on, hold on--"}
{"original": "swan: --that the racism that oozes from donald trump has not happened?"}
{"original": "ingraham: ok. bishop, i have a question. is the criminal justice reform legislation that is passed into law which president obama wanted to do, i think george bush talked about, which civil rights leaders for years have been trying to get people to pass. he actually did it. does that count at all?"}
{"original": "swan: well - it absolutely counts laura."}
{"original": "swan: and the entire team of van jones and those who worked with him--"}
{"original": "ingraham: right, van jones worked with him."}
{"original": "swan: that piece of legislation will have benefits to african americans and people across this spectrum."}
{"original": "ingraham: so why would a racist do that?"}
{"original": "swan: and so there is no doubt."}
{"original": "ingraham: what would a racist do that?"}
{"original": "swan: well, laura, because someone got a piece of legislation passed, does not mean that we ignore a long 40-year history. and what i can't believe is that, you all are telling me from the channel who - one of your anchor's said when trayvon martin was killed that, if you don't want to be perceived as a thug you shouldn't wear a hoodie."}
{"original": "from you all who said that black young men who wear hoodies should have a certain perception to tell me that a maga hat should not viewed in a certain way - it's absolutely hypocritical."}
{"original": "ingraham: bishop, i have to say - i think - putting aside your comments about the channel. i think you're making a really good point about profiling people based on what they wear. i think that's an excellent point. you shouldn't profile. someone wants to wear a hoodie, let him wear a darn hoodie. someone wants to wear a hillary button or a bernie button or a bernie hat or - good for them. it's their political expression."}
{"original": "i don't judge them on the clothes they wear, you shouldn't. and if i've ever done that, i'm wrong. but i think we have to apply that standard across the board. and i actually think that you actually can work with president trump--"}
{"original": "swan: and we agree on that."}
{"original": "ingraham: i think you could actually work with president trump on a lot of issues. i'm not saying that to try to be cute here. i actually think, if you and bongino and trump got together in a room, i bet you guys could do some really good things together. i really do. this conversation about what's racist--"}
{"original": "how about solutions? let's help each other get this country on the right track. i think you could actually do it, i really do. i think you got a lot of passion, got a lot of supporters."}
{"original": "bongino: donald trump has solutions, laura. a lot of black men and women are working right now, because of donald trump and are supporting their kids--"}
{"original": "swan: well, there were lot of black men and women who are working before trump came into office. let's not pretend that--"}
{"original": "swan: --the unemployment rate being drop down 16.8 percent down 7.8 percent under obama, before trump ever came into office."}
{"original": "bongino: the economy right now is - you know, your comment is so ridiculous--"}
{"original": "swan: it dropped another 1 percent under trump--"}
{"original": "ingraham: but again, i'm trying - ok."}
{"original": "swan: so no - when you try to give him credit for what someone else did, that's what's absolutely."}
{"original": "bongino: right, right, give him right."}
{"original": "ingraham: i think in the end--"}
{"original": "bongino: racial tensions were high under barack obama - very hot."}
{"original": "ingraham: guys, i think in the end, people - we all do this, i do this too. you kind - you want to see the world in the way that you absolutely believe it has to be at that moment. we all do it. but i'm saying on national television, i really believe if people just think about what works, basic things that work."}
{"original": "ok, probably having some immigration laws work, because we want to protect our people. we want to have - some better trade policies will probably help all americans. like how do we get from a to b and who can get us there."}
{"original": "and i just think, a lot of times we're talking past each other and i think it's sad. and i think people watching a lot of these shows, they get sad."}
{"original": "bongino: but, laura, let me ask you a question, though, how - i agree with you. and i would love - i started this debate with an open mind with the gentleman, and i still have an open mind. but how do you talk to someone who claims when you put a maga hat on that you're the worst scum on the planet, which would be a racist."}
{"original": "swan: well, those are your words. don't put words in my mouth. don't put words in my mouth. i'm well able to articulate for myself. i'm well able to articulate for myself and i didn't say that, you said that. but let's not sit here and pretend that symbols don't have meaning."}
{"original": "bongino: this is the whole basis of your commentary."}
{"original": "swan: let's not sit here and pretend that things have meanings - that symbols don't have meanings."}
{"original": "swan: and the maga hat has a meaning, it's a sign that is attached to donald trump and everything that he stand for."}
{"original": "ingraham: guys, we are out of time. but i can say that there are hundreds of thousands of americans who have those hats, and i think it's really dangerous for any of us to judge them as individuals based on the fact that they voted for president trump, because they just thought he had better ideas. not that they're not bad people."}
{"original": "swan: well, those young men didn't vote. they are not old enough to vote."}
{"original": "ingraham: i mean, there are always bad people in every group. all right, there are lot of bad people in every group, i get that."}
{"original": "bongino: they are old enough to think."}
{"original": "ingraham: but i just think we should profile people based on the clothes they wear. i should do it, i don't think anyone should do it. i think it's bad, and i think it's toxic. but i really - we might get somewhere eventually. but i really appreciate both of you joining us. thank you both. i probably talked too much in this segment. but that's what i want."}
{"original": "ingraham: all right. could those who threatened those covington teens be charged with domestic terrorism? a prosecutor from kentucky joins us next exclusively to explain. plus president trump's defiance saying, he'll deliver a state of the union next week even if it's not on capitol hill. steve scalise will join us, andy biggs also here. and where the president could make the next speech?"}
{"original": "ingraham: covington catholic school has reopened but the violent threats against the students have not stopped. in fact, the covington diocese received a suspicious package just tonight. we share tweet after tweet with you from celebrities, liberal commentators calling for attacks and even the death of these teenagers. tonight some hope that this hate speech will not go unpunished."}
{"original": "joining me now exclusively for his first national television interview, is rob sanders. he's a prosecutor for kenton county, kentucky where covington catholic high is located. rob, it's good to see you. what kind of charges could realistically be filed and against whom?"}
{"original": "rob sanders, kenton county, kentucky prosecutor: well, we have a number of different charges in kentucky that might apply. the one that jumps out the fastest is terroristic threatening. now there's three different degrees of terroristic threatening in kentucky, two of them are felonies."}
{"original": "the most common one, i think that might apply in this situation is terroristic threatening second-degree, that's any time that someone threatens death or violence against a educational institution in kentucky or any student in the educational institution in connection with the school function."}
{"original": "now that is a class d felony. it's one to five years in the state penitentiary. that could rise to five to ten years in a class c felony if the person threatens that violence or death in connection to an educational institution in it the use of a device of mass destruction or weapon of mass destruction."}
{"original": "ingraham: yes. well, you have - this is happening on twitter though."}
{"original": "sanders: --that would double up the--"}
{"original": "ingraham: mr. sanders, this is happening on twitter from different states."}
{"original": "ingraham: --different locations, does that hinder the prosecution? i mean you don't really need an - i mean, you have to interview these people, they're in different states. you're going to have to get to them somehow."}
{"original": "sanders: well, it makes it much more difficult. it makes it much more difficult, much more complicated, #1. there's a number of misdemeanors that could apply in a lot of these cases, but we can't reach across state lines and extradite for misdemeanors--"}
{"original": "sanders: --which means, we would have to wait for the person to come back to kentucky or make a stop in kentucky before we could ever arrest them. but when it comes to the offenses that rise to the felony level, we can extradite."}
{"original": "now it's not as easy as staying a twitter handle. we can't reach out and just arrest someone who - half the time they're using a fake name, fake profile picture that sort of thing. we have to go through a process of issuing subpoenas, search warrants, getting--"}
{"original": "ingraham: are you going to do this?"}
{"original": "sanders: --information that goes with - it's already underway. i've had detectives in and out of my office all day today. we were starting with some comments, some threats that were made in state, because those are people that we don't even have to extradite. and we are moving on then to the ones that are out of state."}
{"original": "we've had the detective that works in my office has already been busy issuing grand jury subpoenas and composing search warrants for detectives at other agencies."}
{"original": "sanders: --sending out, so we can get the information associated with the ownership of these accounts."}
{"original": "sanders: we get the ip addresses that are registered--"}
{"original": "ingraham: you got to get these people."}
{"original": "ingraham: i mean, it's only - you are only one office--"}
{"original": "sanders: that's right, we find out who uses the internet, those ip addresses."}
{"original": "ingraham: yes, we get the ip addresses. we're going to follow-up with you later in the week to find out where you are on this. but--"}
{"original": "ingraham: --this has to happen. because, until people--"}
{"original": "sanders: well, it's going to happen. everybody's got to realize that these- -"}
{"original": "ingraham: --have to got jail. they have to go to jail. that's got to hurt. otherwise someone is getting hurt and i fear - we're about to talk to steve scalise who felt it in a different way. someone is going to get hurt or someone is going to get killed. prosecutor, i really appreciate you joining us."}
{"original": "sanders: yes, there is no doubt."}
{"original": "ingraham: and we'll have you back. i know it's a longer segment. we've got a lot of people to talk to, so we appreciate it."}
{"original": "nancy pelosi, d-calif., speaker of the house: let's work together on a mutually agreeable dates and welcome you to the capitol to get a state of the union address. government is still shutdown. i still make the offer."}
{"original": "trump: just so you know, she uses on the basis of the shutdown - when she asked me to make the address, she did it during the shutdown, well into the shutdown by a couple of weeks, so the shutdown was going on. now she is blaming the shutdown."}
{"original": "ingraham: well, the gloves are off, and the state of the union in the house chamber has officially been canceled. very adult of nancy pelosi. but if you thought trump was backing down, think again. there's going to be some version of the state of the union next tuesday, whatever they call it. it's not called the state of the union, but it's not going to be on capitol hill."}
{"original": "here now, house minority whip steve scalise and congressman andy biggs. congressmen, you both offered the president an alternate location. congressman scalise, where?"}
{"original": "rep. steve scalise, r-la, house minority whip: frankly, i think the president ought to do a state of the union, and let him choose. we've talked but a number of locations. but ultimately it's the message that is so important."}
{"original": "this is about securing the border of our country. clearly nancy pelosi doesn't want the american people to hear the president's message. but you know what, laura, the american people want to hear the president's message. nancy pelosi can't stop this. it just shows how petty she is and how disgraceful this action is. she will go down as the first speaker in the history of our country -- george washington gave addresses to congress. this is a constitutional requirement. she's now going to have stain on her record."}
{"original": "ingraham: he could do it in writing, though, right?"}
{"original": "scalise: the president is still going to give a state of the union, and frankly i think a lot more people will listen to it now and hear the message about why it's so important to protect our border."}
{"original": "ingraham: why is she afraid of the people hearing the president and what he's going to say? congressman biggs, you have an idea. what is it?"}
{"original": "rep. andy biggs, r-ariz: yes. we've invited the president to come to arizona. it's a border state. it's a great backdrop. he is loved in arizona. i don't want it to be a rally. i want it to be a true state of the union, but let's do it -- why not do it in a friendly environment? bring the democrats in. maybe they'll go to the border and see what's really going on and understand the crisis as well."}
{"original": "ingraham: very interesting. congressman, also a surprising twist, there appear to be some defections among the democrats who may have just had about enough of this shutdown. watch."}
{"original": "sen. mark warner, d-va: i know we are going to have to add additional border security."}
{"original": "where folks say we need additional barrier protections, i'm all for it."}
{"original": "rep. steny hoyer, d-md, house majority leader: physical barriers are part of the solution."}
{"original": "neil cavuto, host: so you don't share nancy pelosi's view that a wall is immoral?"}
{"original": "hoyer: it's protecting people. it's moral."}
{"original": "unidentified male: give trump the money. i would give the whole thing that he wants and put strings on it so that you make sure he puts the ball where it needs to be."}
{"original": "why are we fighting over this? we are going to build that wall anyway at some time."}
{"original": "ingraham: i think the president is getting some push from certain quarters, it's all turning against you. everyone is blaming you. you've got to give in. you've got to stop. i think he's doing exactly what needs to be done. it's a lot like the obamacare thing. the longer you let this thing play out, the more clear it becomes what a crisis this is and we need to do something."}
{"original": "scalise: laura, the american people are for securing the border. and if you look, president trump is gaining momentum because people are seeing what this is about. frankly, these kind of actions by nancy pelosi only heighten the awareness of what's going on. and the more she does this, she's got more of our own democrats in her party that are moving away from her. they are taking a dangerous position by opposing border security. they are on the wrong side of this issue."}
{"original": "ingraham: they don't want a wall. repair some existing fences. but the 30 more centrist democrats wrote a letter to pelosi, right? that's not nothing. there are cracks in this resolve on their part."}
{"original": "biggs: yes. i talked to them on the floor. i try to get out of my echo chamber, and a lot of them are like, well, you know, maybe we need to move on. and i think that's part of it. they just want to move on and resolve it. and i'm not sure how keen they are on building a wall. they just want to resolve the issue to get the government open."}
{"original": "ingraham: i also think, look, a lot of people, it's been a month they haven't been paid. that's a rough deal for a lot of people. they need to get paid. and they need to have their jobs, and they want to do their jobs. and really, it's not great for this to continue to go on for anybody."}
{"original": "scalise: we need to reopen the government and we need to secure the border. we can do both. president trump has worked overtime to come up with different ideas. nancy pelosi has not offered one single alternative. and now she thinks by holding the state of the union hostage, she's going to be able to win this. the people in this country want to see the border secure. she is on the wrong side."}
{"original": "ingraham: freshman congressman, democrats on the house government -- or oversight committee, i guess, right, it's the oversight committee. so you've got ilhan omar, she's from minnesota. she's quite a firebrand. and a number of others who are -- they've got them all. pressley, a democrat, ayanna pressley from massachusetts, tlaib, these are far left, very popular in their own way. how's that going to be different on committee life?"}
{"original": "biggs: you know what, the reality is they have kind of stacked that committee for the one reason they are there. it's to impeach the president. if they can't impeach them, they want to force him out somehow. that won't happen. the bare minimum is to try to embarrass him. that's really what it is. and they want to further try to delegitimize president trump. that's the whole purpose of that committee now. that's the way they've structured the rules and their membership. that's where they are going."}
{"original": "ingraham: well, we are going to be following at every step of the way. we hope the president delivers the state of the union. i hope he delivers it at ellis island. how about that. that would be great."}

{"original": "arroyo: it's amazing -- she is worthy of a hollywood production because she is recasting reality. where's the darkness? these communities have low crime, high wages, low unemployment. she should be celebrating. but she's recasting. it's rather brilliant what she's doing here. people should take notice, laura."}
{"original": "arroyo: finally, it's not all politics with ocasio-cortez. she knows how to have a good time. she's coined a new game which she plays regularly in the halls of congress called, where's mitch?"}

{"original": "ocasio-cortez: hash-tag, #wheresmitch. you can run but you can't hide."}
{"original": "ocasio-cortez: we went to his office at the capitol. we went to his office in the russell building. we went to the floor. we went to the cloakroom. he's not in the cloakroom. he's not in the capitol. he's not in the russell building. he's not on the floor of the senate, and 800,000 people done at their paychecks. so where's mitch?"}

{"original": "ingraham: whatever happened to abortion being safe, legal, and rare? a bill just signed into law by new york governor andrew cuomo takes the radical and inhumane and barbaric step of legalizing abortion up to birth in many cases. now, you would think the passage of a bill like this would be greeted in a much more muted fashion due to the cruelty of it. but here the new york assembly basically celebrated its passage."}
{"original": "unidentified female: the bill is passed."}
{"original": "ingraham: they got a standing ovation for death. now, we want to show you just want a fetus looks like at approximately 24 weeks gestation. ok, about that. and remember that this bill would allow abortions after this date. so 11.5 inches long, almost 1.5 pounds, the faces almost fully formed, has eyebrows, eyelashes, and hair. the baby can hear your voice and will recognize these sounds after birth."}
{"original": "here to debate, madeline morreira, a research attorney at the bioethics defense fund, and asha dahya, a reproductive health advocate. madeline, let's start with you. this new york bill allows, and this is key here for women's health, it allows not only doctors for ob-gyns, but health care practitioners to perform abortions. that's not necessarily a doctor, right? could it be a dentist, could it be a chiropractor? what does it mean? and why is it dangerous?"}
{"original": "madeline morreira, pro-life attorney: what this law does is effectively legalizes abortion on demand up until the due date. the reason is because that it not only legalizes abortions for cases where it threatens the life of the mother but where her health is threatened. and that is defined as including mental or emotional health. so you can effectively go to your doctor or your nurse practitioner or midwife or physician's assistant even and have them determine that your health on some level is threatened by the pregnancy or the impending birth of your baby and up to the due date have an abortion performed, and a doctor is not involved. and not only that --"}
{"original": "morreira: -- this new law removed the protections for babies born alive would survive abortions."}
{"original": "ingraham: asha, you have no problem with that?"}
{"original": "asha dahya, reproductive health advocate: i think the most important thing for me is seeing this law taken out of the state constitution's criminal code and put into the health care code. this is a law that was put in to the state's constitution dating back to 1970, and now that it's in the health code, i think the state assembly and i hope the leaders will take a look at it and make it so that they can better serve women and children and their families --"}
{"original": "ingraham: how are you serving women, asha? first of all, i'm really happy you came on. i really appreciate you coming on. i'm really curious to understand, how does this law help a child who is -- has an 80 percent chance after six months of being viable if born? this is a child that feels pain. this is an unborn child that hears, knows sounds, voices. when someone is pregnant, they don't say we are going to have a fetus shower. they say a baby shower because it's a baby. how is this not hitlerian, to say you can for economic reasons, when a baby could be born - -"}
{"original": "ingraham: -- be killed. the baby is being killed in the womb."}
{"original": "dahya: let's remember women are choosing abortions at a late stage because they are excited about it. it's often a very difficult decision. and they are making these decisions with their doctors, with their families. and i think they should be given the dignity and the respect and make these tough decisions in a way that they're not going to be threatened with criminalization."}
{"original": "ingraham: does the infant deserve any dignity? does the infant in the womb deserve anything? i mean, they don't give any say. it's not their fault they are there."}
{"original": "dahya: i think these are important questions. these are important questions, and and they should be discussed in privacy with respect and with intelligence with the doctor, with the family, as opposed to criminalization and threatening these women."}
{"original": "ingraham: ok, madeline, quick last word, like 15 seconds."}
{"original": "morreira: is 24 weeks not long enough to tell that you don't want to have the baby or that it will affect your mental health? there was no point of passing this law. it goes way past what roe v wade requires. new york state may well be the most radical state in the nation on abortion today."}
{"original": "morreira: new york already aborts one-third of every single pregnancy."}
{"original": "ingraham: we are out of time, madeline. i'm sorry to cut you off. it's shocking and shame on andrew cuomo. shame on you."}

{"original": "overcoming a defiant last-minute challenge from the party's progressive wing, house democrats on thursday approved most of a sweeping new rules package that effectively places restrictions on some new spending, incorporates ethics reforms and dramatically shakes up several key voting procedures and committees."}
{"original": "although planned portions of the rules relating to the house's handling of obamacare were tabled for the future, the 234-197 vote marked a decisive defeat of new york democratic rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez's opposition to the measure."}
{"original": "three republicans supported the democrats' rules, including pennsylvania rep. brian fitzpatrick, and new york reps. john katko and tom reed. in addition to ocasio-cortez, hawaii democratic rep. tulsi gabbard and california rep. ro khanna voted against the rules package."}
{"original": "on wednesday, ocasio-cortez vowed to join khanna to oppose the so-called pay-go rule included in the rules package, supported by house speaker nancy pelosi. that rule requires that any new mandatory spending for entitlements or tax cuts be offset by other separate revenue increases (such as tax hikes) or budget-cutting measures so that the new spending does not expand the federal deficit."}
{"original": "the pay-go principle, ocasio-cortez charged in a tweet wednesday, was a dark political maneuver designed to hamstring progress on healthcare and other legislation."}

{"original": "pay-go applies to discretionary spending that is approved through the normal appropriations procedure. last in effect in 2010, pay-go replaces the current so-called cut-go provisions, which require only that mandatory spending increases be matched with other cuts to mandatory spending."}

{"original": "other rule changes eliminate the supermajority requirement to pass federal income tax changes, and potentially avoid future showdowns over raising the debt ceiling by suspending the debt limit through september 30 of the budget year once the house adopts a budget. the so-called gephardt rule had offered the house much less latitude, requiring an agreement between the house and senate on a budget resolution in order to avoid a debt-ceiling vote."}
{"original": "the rules package also establishes a climate-change committee. the select committee on the climate crisis lacks some of the same legislative teeth that its predecessor committee wielded when democrats last controlled the house. but, the house rules give the panel until march 31, 2020 to make recommendations to other committees for actual policy changes and legislation."}

{"original": "additional elements to the rules package include ethics reforms that preclude congressional members and their staff from serving on corporate boards, as well as the revival of a rule that all legislation must be made available at least 72 hours before a vote is held."}

{"original": "another piece of legislation proposed and debated by democrats would fund six of the seven unresolved spending bills through sept. 30. that bill, which the white house has also said will not become law, was approved by a 241-190 vote at approximately 10 p.m. et, with seven republicans joining democrats to vote yea. the measure puts together six of the seven unresolved appropriations bills in one package."}
{"original": "in a news conference thursday night, pelosi broadly discussed the ongoing partial shutdown, which has dragged on since dec. 22 amid demands from the white house that any federal spending bill include funding for a wall on the southern border."}
{"original": "however, pelosi, even as she said she would be willing to fund border security, called a border wall a symptom of an old way of thinking and promised not to fund it."}
{"original": "we sense the urgency of opening up the people's government so that they can be served by the agencies of government on which they rely, house majority leader steny hoyer, d-md., told reporters. the president has asked us to come down and meet tomorrow at 10:30. and we will do that. and we will have a discussion. pelosi then interjected to remind hoyer that the meeting was actually planned for 11:30 p.m. et, and joked that trump perhaps had told her the wrong time intentionally so that she would be absent."}
{"original": "trump met with pelosi and other senior democrats at a contentious meeting on wednesday in the white house situation room, which included senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., interrupting homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen within five seconds, according to republicans at the meeting. the sitdown adjourned after a consensus emerged that more progress could be made after the new congress was seated thursday."}

{"original": "fallacy 1: medicare is a 54-year-old real-world test for the viability of single-payer government-funded health care."}

{"original": "but within the organization, a grave threat was emerging."}
{"original": "in june 2020, members of the organization's leadership were informed in writing and in subsequent phone calls of at least 10 specific allegations of harassment against co-founder john weaver, including two involving lincoln project employees, according to multiple people with direct knowledge of the situation. the email and phone calls raise questions about the lincoln project's statement last month that it was shocked when accusations surfaced publicly this year. it's also the first known suggestion that weaver targeted a lincoln project staffer."}
{"original": "despite the early warning, the group took no action against weaver and pressed forward with its high-profile work. for the collection of gop consultants and former officials, being anti-trump was becoming very good for business. of the $90 million lincoln project has raised, more than $50 million has gone to firms controlled by the group's leaders."}
{"original": "there is no evidence that the lincoln project buried the allegations against weaver for business reasons. but taken together, the harassment allegations and new revelations about spending practices raise significant questions about the management of one of the highest-profile antagonists of trump. the revelations threaten the stature of not just the lincoln project but the broader coalition of establishment-oriented republican groups hoping to pool their resources to excise trump from the party."}

{"original": "backed by its founders' commanding social media presence, the organization quickly attracted a massive following of trump critics in both parties that exceeded even its own founders' expectations."}
{"original": "since its creation, the lincoln project has raised $90 million. but only about a third of the money, roughly $27 million, directly paid for advertisements that aired on broadcast and cable, or appeared online, during the 2020 campaign, according to an analysis of campaign finance disclosures and data from the ad tracking firm kantar/cmag."}

{"original": "i stood before the audience of several hundred people and conveyed my deep concerns about the democrat's plan for medicare for all – which will inflate expectations yet inevitably ration care like the canadian system does, pay doctors too little for doing too much and destroy jobs by deleting the employer-based health care system and its built-in incentives for taking a job you may not otherwise have wanted."}
{"original": "it was only when i shifted gears and spoke as a practicing doctor that i really connected with the audience. everyone out there had struggled to comprehend the shifting terrain of government-orchestrated health insurance but all could easily relate to the feeling of what it was like to be waiting in a doctor's office for an hour while someone who you entrusted with your health secrets struggled with computer documentation. this is the secret that all doctors and their patients know and feel deeply, that the false expectations of obamacare are coupled together with the excessive new demands of electronic recordkeeping."}

{"original": "the biggest connection i made with the audience was when i talked about the doctor/patient relationship. i mentioned how the relationship is being jeopardized and how it is becoming a dinosaur relegated to a patient staring at a doctor's back as he or she stares at a computer. a team of secretaries and nurse's aides and business managers do not successfully take the place of the time you once spent with your doctor."}

{"original": "it's amazing to write, but the biggest political story in georgia today is not about tuesday's white-knuckle, two-seat runoff election with control of the senate on the line."}
{"original": "instead, it is a recording of president trump badgering the state's elections chief to swipe georgia's electoral votes for him."}
{"original": "or, as trump might characterize it, swipe them back."}
{"original": "in a leaked recording of a weekend call between trump and georgia secretary of state brad raffensperger, the president tells raffensperger to find just one more vote than needed to reverse president-elect joe biden's 11,779-vote georgia victory."}
{"original": "trump told raffensperger – who rejected the demand – that such corruption is merited because he really won the state by hundreds of thousands of votes."}
{"original": "the claim is, of course, hogwash. but the fact that trump is still trying so hard to filch a second term and the fact that so many republicans are still playing along despite trump's conduct is one of the biggest stories of the century so far."}
{"original": "what trump is doing with the help of many members of his party is certainly the most historically significant part of his presidency – more than an impeachment, more than judicial appointments or any piece of policy. it is unprecedented and deals with matters central to the survival of the republic"}
{"original": "this is truly trump's legacy project, and its disposition will have a great deal to say about the future of a badly divided republican party and also our capacity as americans for self-governance in the era of brain-dead partisanship and easy disinformation."}

{"original": "but with trump on tape trying to bully an elected official into fabricating an election result and senators falling all over themselves to join sens. ted cruz and josh hawley in turning wednesday's congressional certification of results into reality television, it seems like today is the time to slip on our hazmat suit and get into it."}
{"original": "fox news has lots of great coverage of the georgia runoffs ahead of tuesday's conclusion (though the actual counting may go on much longer – sorry) and we will be back before the polls close with our full analysis of the race. if you'd like some great context and deep background, chris joined abby hornacek on her latest getting schooled podcast to talk about the peculiar history and details of this week's runoffs."}
{"original": "the two subjects are certainly intertwined. if republicans do manage to lose the senate in georgia, trump's desperate bid to cling to power and the efforts by republicans to help him will be the main reason."}
{"original": "the key swing voters in georgia are those mostly-affluent suburbanites who split their votes between biden for president and the republican senate candidates. if the purpose of having a republican senate is to support trump, even to the point of this absurdity, then those folks won't really want a republican senate. in fact, they might want to send a message to the gop about the way their senators have been behaving."}
{"original": "add in those poor souls who really believe trump's claims of massive, uncorrected, systemic electoral fraud who decide not to vote and you have created the only conditions under which republicans really could lose the senate."}

{"original": "see you tuesday with the nitty gritty on georgia."}
{"original": "backbone backfire - pity poor james lankford, the unlikeliest member of the senate's new election deflection brigade. his sudden and deep dive into the realm of the kraken is quite reflective of how this mania spread in the gop."}
{"original": "the junior senator from oklahoma is up for re-election next year in a state trump just carried by 33 points. but on nov. 11, republican lankford did something the president very much did not like."}
{"original": "while lankford did not say the truth that joe biden had won the presidency, he did say that biden needed to start receiving intelligence briefings immediately as part of a potential transition."}
{"original": "lankford, a member of the committee with oversight of the agency that facilitates presidential transitions, said on tulsa talk radio: i will step in as well to be able to push to say: 'this needs to occur.' so that regardless of the outcome of the election — whichever way that it goes — people can be ready for that actual task."}
{"original": "despite having been in the senate for only five years, lankford was esteemed among his colleagues. he replaced the legendary tom coburn and seemed to be growing into the job. in addition to his perch on homeland security and other high-profile committees, lankford was chosen to be the chairman of the ethics committee."}
{"original": "so perhaps he didn't think it would be such a big deal that he would say biden should be briefed. after all, lankford had gently criticized trump's lafayette park bible brandishing photo-op in june and seemed to have suffered little for the president's rebuke."}
{"original": "lankford was unlucky, this time, though. while other republican senators would soon make less ambiguous statements about the need to get on with an orderly transition, lankford's hit just before the wave crested and so got lots of coverage from reporters looking for evidence of a trump-senate gop split."}
{"original": "like many republicans, lankford may have assumed that after trump had used up his legal options for contesting the election that things would die down. what they did not know was that trump was not running a legal effort, but rather another campaign."}
{"original": "the brunt of that campaign came down on lankford and the senator soon buckled. five days after saying that the matter needed to be resolved immediately, lankford said he was not in a hurry to get biden briefed."}
{"original": "lankford must have heard the drooling of his potential primary challengers. if a major question for primaries in states like oklahoma next year will be how abject one's support for the former president has been, lankford has trouble. rep. markwayne mullin, for example, is about as abject as they come."}
{"original": "by allowing that biden might win and saying that he would push the trump administration, lankford plopped himself in the prone position before the onrushing mass hysteria that grips the populist right."}
{"original": "and that is how lankford, once the boy wonder of the boehnerite faction of the house gop and up-and-comer of mitch mcconnell's senate squad, ended up signing on to cruz's radical effort to subvert the election."}
{"original": "failing forward - not that it will succeed. like a lot of the chicanery we've seen in trump's effort to cling to power, cruz's bid relies on the knowledge of its participants that it will fail."}
{"original": "it's one thing to attempt to overturn an election for the sake of staging a made-for-tv spectacle on wednesday, but neither lankford nor any of the notorious self-promoters on team cruz would do it if it might actually work. none would want to be remembered by history as having precipitated what would surely be the worst crisis since the civil war."}
{"original": "this is only par for cruz, whom many americans first got to know as the architect of the bogus 2013 defund obamacare government shutdown. then he succored trump's 2016 candidacy when he thought it would benefit him but concluded his doomed run lashed up with john kasich and carly fiorina in a desperate, goofball bid to block trump. the guy who told delegates in cleveland that year to vote your conscience may have abrogated his former views, but never his ambition."}
{"original": "cruz, six other senators and four senators-elect have joined together to demand that congress select a commission to perform a 10-day emergency audit of the election results and present its findings to state legislatures just a few days before the jan. 20 inauguration so they could select new electors and strip biden of the presidency."}
{"original": "unless their demands are met (which they won't be) cruz, & co. say they will vote against certifying the votes of disputed electors (of which there are none)."}
{"original": "by procedural rules, though, their votes will trigger two hours of debate per contested state. that will allow trump's supporters to repeat their thoroughly debunked claims."}
{"original": "but, like cruz's green eggs and ham quasi-filibuster, the content is almost immaterial. the platform is the point. and for, say, a senator thinking of a presidential comeback or one being hounded by a mob back home, it would be invaluable."}
{"original": "unfortunately, the consequences of this bit of keister covering will far outlast the fears and desires of its perpetrators."}
{"original": "civil war re-enactors - unlike his possible 2024 presidential rival, hawley, cruz did not want to be so obvious in declaring his move a publicity stunt. so cruz dressed it up with a proposal based on the electoral crisis of the fall and winter of 1876-1877."}
{"original": "in the election of 1876, former confederates finally had enough power to brutally crack down on the black voters in the south – the beginning of a nearly century-long effort to deny african-americans the vote. that year, in three states – florida, louisiana and south carolina – republican elections boards threw out results they said were de-legitimated by terrorism."}
{"original": "as a result, officials in the three states each sent two slates of electoral votes to congress: one intentionally inaccurate, the other accurate but the result of brutal coercion. lawmakers deadlocked. the democrat-controlled house backed their man, new york gov. samuel tilden, and the republican senate stood strong for theirs, ohio gov. rutherford hayes. that left 20 electoral votes in limbo and the presidency dangling by a thread."}
{"original": "this is the big difference between then and now. all of the states have submitted their electoral votes and there is no dispute. that is not to say that there is no disagreement about the results, but there is no dispute in terms of the findings of the states."}
{"original": "private citizens have opinions. individual lawmakers have opinions. but in america, the states conduct elections, the results of which are confirmed by designated officials. congress has no role in conducting elections, only in verifying that the results are official."}
{"original": "the official findings are complete and biden won with 306 electoral votes. congress has no power to change that."}
{"original": "in fact, rules like the safe harbor provision that helped conscientious lawmakers, officials and judges get to this point despite unprecedented efforts to subvert the results are the product of a law passed in the wake of the 1876 nightmare to prevent a repeat."}
{"original": "playing with fire - tilden or blood was the cry of the democrats that year. if congress did not give the presidency to tilden, who had also won the popular vote, then democrats said the sons of the south would be ready to resume hostilities against the union."}
{"original": "it may have been a hollow threat given the devastated condition of the former confederacy, but for a nation still traumatized by war in ways we can't imagine, it was enough."}
{"original": "the commission that cruz & co. say they would like to emulate was not for election investigation but rather for trying to find a solution for the deadlock and save a country splitting at the seams. its members eventually voted eight to seven to award the disputed votes, and the presidency, to hayes."}
{"original": "but democrats had only dropped their threat to blockade the result after hayes had agreed to pull the remaining federal troops out of the south. by then, there were just two significant garrisons in the former confederacy. they were there to protect the duly elected governments of south carolina and louisiana from terrorists."}
{"original": "but, knowing that he would not have the power in a divided government to do much more to protect black americans in the south anyway, hayes capitulated and agreed to pull the troops out and let the terrorists drive black lawmakers from power. so began a decades-long reign of terror and its lasting shame."}
{"original": "the resolution of the 1876 election was a disaster and the start of a dreadful period of american history. that cruz would invoke it now as a model would be shabby enough even without his attack on one of the central pillars of federalism: state control of elections. these new nationalists really do mean business."}
{"original": "leaders 144 years ago were trying to find a way to resolve an inconclusive election without setting off another civil war. if these senators really were sincere in trying to do more than play political games, this would be the reverse."}
{"original": "that's what you get - what trump and his posse are hoping for on wednesday is to have two mobs protesting the results: one in congress and one outside in a promised wild rally of trump supporters."}
{"original": "this will be the second consecutive transition that will be marked by mass protests. like their pussycat-hat-wearing counterparts in the anti-trump march of 2017, the red hats of 2021 want the world to know that the new president is not legitimate."}
{"original": "these kinds of mass demonstrations around the outcomes of elections are out of character for americans. this is what you get in places where elections are not free and fair or where strongmen rule."}
{"original": "in historical terms, elections in our era are cleaner than they have ever been. fraud is much, much harder than it was in the bad old days of political machines and stuffed ballot boxes. the degree of scrutiny and oversight far, far surpasses anything our parents or grandparents would have known."}
{"original": "and yet, voters increasingly believe they are rigged. that inverse correlation is the work of trump, yes, but also of a coterie of folks across the political spectrum willing to exploit ignorance and fear for the sake of immediate gains – to survive a primary, to get clicks, to gain an advantage on rivals."}
{"original": "the american system survives because most citizens and most elected officials are holding the line. but it is reasonable to expect that work is going to get harder because of the recklessness of radicals."}
{"original": "if we have to repeat this misery in 2024, can we count on so many lawmakers, officials and judges to stand up to the threats of a sore loser of their own party? one would hope, but one would also assume that intervening primary elections will continue to punish individuals that prize propriety over party."}
{"original": "like lankford, many will find that no resistance will be tolerated. like cruz, many others will find that there are significant advantages to be had in not just joining, but seeming to lead the parade."}
{"original": "will some future congress cross the line from crass pandering and into the actual work of stealing an election? will the results of some future election be decided not by counting ballots but by the partisan composition of statehouses? will courts one day cower from angry mobs outside their chambers?"}
{"original": "those things are not the likely outcomes in our near future. we hold fast to our belief that americans tend to reject excesses in our leaders and that the pendulum will swing away from angry populism of the left and right. but it is certainly a possible future that could unfold in our lifetimes."}
{"original": "two decades from now, those of us still on this side of the sod will have a chance to reflect on the events of the fall and winter of 2020-2021. will we say that trump set a precedent that his successors followed? will we say that the backlash against such efforts activated our small-r republican immune system against demagoguery?"}
{"original": "the answers to those questions won't come on wednesday or on jan. 20. but how we as a people answer them in the years to come will determine whether america can endure in the founders' vision and meet the duties that come with our privileged place in history."}
{"original": "fellow citizens, we cannot escape history. we of this congress and this administration, will be remembered in spite of ourselves. no personal significance, or insignificance, can spare one or another of us. the fiery trial through which we pass, will light us down, in honor or dishonor, to the latest generation. we say we are for the union. the world will not forget that we say this. we know how to save the union. the world knows we do know how to save it. we -- even we here -- hold the power, and bear the responsibility. in giving freedom to the slave, we assure freedom to the free -- honorable alike in what we give, and what we preserve. we shall nobly save, or meanly lose, the last best hope of earth. other means may succeed; this could not fail. the way is plain, peaceful, generous, just -- a way which, if followed, the world will forever applaud, and god must forever bless. – president abraham lincoln in a message to congress, dec. 1, 1862"}

{"original": "the litigation you are supporting––texas v. u.s.–– threatens the peace of mind and access to care for hundreds of millions of americans…the only reason this new case gained traction was because congressional republicans decided to amend the law and zero-out the penalty for not being insured, and legal experts from across the ideological spectrum have concluded that this new argument––that this change invalidates the entire law––is legally unsupportable, biden argued in the letter."}

{"original": "unidentified male: i just want to talk about some of the criminals that border patrol agents apprehend on a daily basis. we're talking about murderers, rapists. people that commit serious crimes."}
{"original": "ice has been doing a great job in deporting the people back to their countries. unfortunately, once we deport these people, these people will not stay in their country. these criminal aliens that have been released in jail that have been deported, will come right back into the united states. however, if we had a physical barrier, if we had a wall, we would be able to stop that."}
{"original": "hannity: i have been down to the border 13 times from the rio grande to san diego. i have been in the drug warehouses, helicopter, all-terrain vehicle, horseback -- you can laugh but i was -- boats, on foot. i have watched gang members arrested. we have the video."}
{"original": "are the democrats going to listen to the agents? are they going to put the american people first? how many americans need to die because we have open borders and sanctuary city and state policies before democrats take this seriously?"}
{"original": "how long are we going to witness drug trafficking targeting our kids in small towns and big cities or the human trafficking or the infiltration of gangs and even terrorists that we have identified trying to cross our border illegally and get into this country and cause us harm before the democrats stop playing politics? four years ago, they supported the trump policy. how many billions of dollars must you, the american taxpayer spend in deportation fees, court costs, health care, education, the criminal justice system, other social services before we start controlling immigration at our southern border?"}
{"original": "i have said this many, many times. i am certain, 98 percent, 99 percent of those people that want to cross the border into this country, they just want a better life. the things we take for granted -- freedom, opportunity, hope for their kids, their grandkids. but we just want to do it legally, vet them. big wall, big door."}
{"original": "and that's why in tonight's hannity watch on the border and on the government shutdown, we are calling b.s. on all of these democrats fake attempts to reopen the government. democrats refuse to listen to the border patrol. they refused to listen to a security briefing yesterday with the homeland security secretary kirstjen nielsen. they even refused to negotiate with the president over the holidays."}
{"original": "president trump stayed in washington. he didn't go down to mar-a-lago over christmas hoping the democrats would come to the white house and negotiate a deal. nancy pelosi, she was on a luxurious vacation in beautiful hawaii, some 12 hours away, six hours behind the time in d.c. when confronted by nbc news, well, she said this about leaving town for vacation."}
{"original": "interviewer: now, you had said before the shutdown that he was being quite cavalier and maybe the shutdown would give him more time to golf. but in the end, it was you that took a holiday."}
{"original": "pelosi: what's the difference if i take a holiday? i observed the christmas holiday for a few days in hawaii. i cut in half the time i would have had with my family."}
{"original": "interviewer: was that a cheap shot?"}
{"original": "pelosi: it's not important. it is totally unimportant. the president may not know this but hawaii is part of the united states of america. maybe he doesn't realize that."}
{"original": "hannity: you know, over this past weekend, we lost a police officer. his name was officer singh. this guy was in california. the sheriff of that county was on this show last night saying the sanctuary policies played a big part in what happened, because the murderer was involved in the criminal justice system and was never deported."}
{"original": "speaker pelosi -- well, the president was in the white house waiting to negotiate, you were thousand of miles away, lapping it up, life of luxury, playing politics with border security. americans died over the course of that weekend. americans, an american hero, police officer, with a five- month-old son, is no longer on this earth providing for his child."}
{"original": "now, this is now day one of the pelosi shutdown. she obviously doesn't care about daca because the president is willing to negotiate daca. he's willing to talk about dreamers. he is willing to put the safety and security of american people first."}
{"original": "is she now doing -- what she is now doing, is this in america's best interest? is this in your best interest, your family's best interest?"}
{"original": "it seems like people only care about destroying and hating president trump and everyone around him. hating trump is now their singular focus of every second, of every minute, of every hour of every day."}
{"original": "and, of course, pelosi is not the only adversary on capitol hill. on wednesday, democratic congressman hank johnson, he actually compared president trump, and all of his supporters to nazis. and today, sirius xm patriots, kerry picket, asked johnson about those hate-filled remarks and he doubles down. take a listen."}
{"original": "rep. hank johnson, d-ga.: what i did was compare the times that we live in to the times that existed at the time hitler gained power. i mentioned the fact that he gained power through democratic elections, the same way trump did. our right to speak, freedom of the press, due process, equal protection of the law, all of those things are threatened by the current climate of right wing extremism."}
{"original": "hannity: now, remember, this is the same genius congressman who openly worried that the island of guam was going to capsize and tip over if too many u.s. military personnel were stationed on the island. they were going to tip the island over. that actually happened. he actually said that."}
{"original": "and that's your democratic party now in control of the u.s. house of representatives and, of course, democrats aren't the only people working against the president. even incoming senator, mitt romney, well, he wanted trump's endorsement, now criticizing trump in an op-ed, causing many of his republican colleagues to resoundly slam the freshman senator."}
{"original": "now, reporter kerry picket also caught up with romney today and asked him about his rough start on capitol hill. take a look."}
{"original": "kerry picket, siriusxm patriot: the president endorsed you and now you have made this op-ed. how is that not considered essentially a shiv in the back?"}
{"original": "sen. mitt romney, r-ut: it is certainly an opportunity for us to work together on things where we agree. i actually said prior to the primary in an op-ed that i wrote in the utah papers, that i would work with the president on places we agree and where we disagreed, i would point that out."}
{"original": "that's the great nature of this representative democracy, which is where we agree, we come together. where there are disagreements, we express those openly and honestly. that allows people to have trust in one another. i look forward to have a trusting relationship with the president and others despite differences from time to time."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. so, 2020 is just around the country. romney is going to need to ask himself, well, what's better for the country, the president' pro-growth agenda, lower taxes, less regulation, oh, we are now energy independent. we are now making more oil, or producing more oil than saudi arabia and russia. we are, for the first time in decades, energy independent."}
{"original": "does he want originalist supreme court justices? does he want border security or does he want to hate trump media to like him or hate trump democrats or the hate trump deep state, hell bent on destroying the not only the president but a duly elected president and his administration?"}
{"original": "one such democrat, elizabeth warren, has already announced her presidential bid after saying she wasn't going to run in march. oh, i thought democrats hate lying or not remembering correctly. take a look."}
{"original": "interviewer: i hear the president going after you from time to time referring to you as pocahontas, and that recently, you were speaking about your native american heritage. does that get under your skin when he does that? and do you want to run for president in 2020?"}
{"original": "sen. elizabeth warren, d-mass.: i am not running for president in 2020."}
{"original": "hannity: i thought trump haters didn't like lying."}
{"original": "now, of course, we all know this is nothing new for elizabeth warren. today, the president, he wasted no time calling her out for her fraudulent claims of native american heritage, posting this tweet mocking warren's now infamous dna test and exposing her life of lies."}
{"original": "and even some on the left are coming after the 2020 hopeful over the debacle. for example, new piece in the huffington post titled: elizabeth warren's insult to native americans matters even more now that she's running. and they slam her for refusing to stop publicly claiming her family is part native."}
{"original": "another potential democratic 2020 hopeful, new york governor andrew cuomo, beginning his third term, using his inaugural address to slam president trump, of course. watch this."}
{"original": "gov. andrew cuomo, d-n.y.: from voting reforms to roe v. wade for new york, to protecting a woman's right to choose, to better gun laws, to health care protection, to legalizing marijuana, to protecting the labor movement, to a green new deal, to real criminal justice reform, we will make history. and new york will move forward, not by building a wall, my friends, but by building new bridges and building new airports and creating new middle class jobs."}
{"original": "hannity: maybe cuomo should spend more time focusing on his own state, which is now home to one of the most corrupt and inefficient governments in the entire country, with new yorkers leaving the state in droves, moving to tax havens like texas and florida, pretty much a disgrace. i'm going to have a lot more on that later in the show."}
{"original": "but it's time for tonight's hannity watch on the deep state. our own catherine herridge reporting, house republicans shuttering the fbi and justice department's actions during the 2016 campaign as they hand over power. but their final findings reveal fbi divisions over the clinton case, conflicting claims on rod rosenstein's comments about recording the president."}
{"original": "chairman gowdy and chairman goodlatte even called for a second special counsel to investigate decisions made by the doj in the clinton email and russia probes, and, quote, the disparate way these two investigations were seemingly conducted. now, the house investigation also determined that high level discussions were taking place that fbi and the doj about invoking the 25th amendment and removing the president that they didn't want elected in the first place from office, a claim that rod rosenstein has adamantly denied. and while house investigations are now over, senator lindsey graham is picking up right where they left off."}
{"original": "all right. joining us now with much more, brand new book just out today, the case against the democratic house impeaching trump, harvard professor, alan dershowitz."}
{"original": "by the way, professor dershowitz, i have this book, his signed copy to me. he is -- right after this show, he's going to be taking part in an online signing. you can go to it and watch it and fight out more about the book at dershowitzbook.com."}
{"original": "and i'm going over for a few minutes to say hi."}
{"original": "alan dershowitz, harvard professor: thank you very much."}
{"original": "hannity: just have -- all i have to do is go online, at the website."}
{"original": "dershowitz: yes, and i will sign the book right in front of them to them and they'll get a copy."}
{"original": "hannity: if the signature is different?"}
{"original": "dershowitz: it is the same. i know how to write my name. i have signed over 1 million copies of books over the years."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. he's bragging now. not only he teaches at harvard now."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. looking forward to it. let's talk about this. i'm looking out for the country right now. i don't see anything that's going on with the democrats that's going to help working men and women, help make us more safe and secure, make the lives better for young americans, opportunity for them. all i hear about is hate trump, hate trump, hate trump."}
{"original": "dershowitz: look, i voted for democrats in congress, because i want to see checks and balances operating. but i want to see the democrats use their election to help america and to bring people together. we need border security, obviously and we need it in a way that satisfies due process. we need health care. we need all of these things."}
{"original": "hannity: the democrats five years ago supported a wall. are they hypocrites?"}
{"original": "dershowitz: well, i think that's hypocritical. i think the idea of focusing on the wall. look, israel has a security barrier."}
{"original": "so, i don't see any problem with that as long as that is not the only solution we have. as you said, 99 percent, 98 percent of people want to come to this country like our grandparents and our great grandparents who made america really great."}
{"original": "dershowitz: yes. you know, my grandmother was held in detention for a day."}
{"original": "dershowitz: she was held in detention, because her future husband, who was meeting her, the boat was a day early. he was a day late."}
{"original": "dershowitz: she had 20 cents in her pocket and they kept her in detention overnight. my grandmother was a prisoner."}
{"original": "hannity: my grandparents were rich. they had $10 in their pocket. amazing people. we all stand on their shoulders."}
{"original": "dan bongino, best selling author of spygate, former secret service agent."}
{"original": "you know, i don't know how many more people have to die. i've watched -- we have an opioid epidemic. many of those drugs have funneled up through our southern border into small towns and big cities. you know from your law enforcement background. you see the human trafficking."}
{"original": "i'm sympathetic as professor dershowitz is. i don't care how many people come into the country. i don't. can we check you out and can you also not be a burden to the american taxpayer?"}
{"original": "dan bongino, former secret service agent: sean, what's troubling about this is two particular things. one is the conversation always seems to resolve when it comes to liberal democrats, around the consequences of illegal immigration on the illegal immigrant. the consequences for the american people are almost never discussed."}
{"original": "did you notice? you mentioned that hero, this patriot, officer singh. did you see the picture of his family? they will never, ever see -- the young child will never know his father. and the spouse, this beautiful young lady, will never see her husband again. what about those consequences?"}
{"original": "hannity: he is an immigrant. he came in legally."}
{"original": "bongino: he is everything right about this."}
{"original": "hannity: everything right and wanted -- i had the local sheriff and police chief on last night. the police chief could barely speak."}
{"original": "bongino: i watched the interview, sean, and this is the distinction that we -- i know you, me, and professor dershowitz, i want to speak with you, but i'm sure you feel the same way, legal immigrants and illegal immigrants, the democrats constantly conflate the two."}
{"original": "we are not -- let me -- we are not talking about legal immigrants. my wife is one. you are everything right about the country."}
{"original": "we are talking about people who openly violate our laws and this officer singh, the death of this american hero, is a consequence of that."}
{"original": "dershowitz: the tragedy is that --"}
{"original": "hannity: sanctuary cities, though, professor --"}
{"original": "hannity: -- we had this guy in custody. if we followed federal law and states didn't aid and abet, criminal activity and breaking the law, this man may very well be alive today."}
{"original": "dershowitz: well, everybody has to follow the law. the great tragedy is that the vast majority of americans, republican or democrat, agree on what they want as immigration policy. they want to see good people brought into the country and they want see legal immigration, and they want to make sure that illegal immigrants don't come in and don't get ahead of the line in front of legal immigrants. everybody agrees on that."}
{"original": "but the democrats and republicans are each playing politics with this --"}
{"original": "hannity: i'm not going to let you -- how are the republicans playing politics? the president is offering daca dreamers a deal."}
{"original": "dershowitz: i agree with that. i think the wall has become too much of a symbol of what immigration is going to be about."}
{"original": "dershowitz: i understand that. but they have to support -- both sides have to support more. they have to support a reasonable --"}
{"original": "hannity: is the president, is he not meeting them with daca dreamers?"}
{"original": "dershowitz: look, i agree. he stayed home for christmas and they should have come and meet him halfway. look, what i worry about is the democrats win and they are going to try to impeach the president. it will be terrible for america."}
{"original": "hannity: right. so, right after this program, you are going to be online at -- what does it called?"}
{"original": "hannity: when we come back, a hannity watch report on the hate trump media. joe concha and rachel campos duffy will join us, the media's democratic obsession, and an exclusive interview with our secretary of state about borders, about iran, about syria and everything as it involves national security, mike pompeo."}
{"original": "dershowitzbook.com. see you after the show."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. time now for our hannity watch investigation on the hate trump media. the liberal mainstream media pundits, they couldn't contain their giddiness their excitement over nancy pelosi becoming speaker of the house and the democrats regaining the house. that is like chris matthews having that obama throw up his leg thing."}
{"original": "unidentified male: it is hard to imagine how much worse things could get for the president from here."}
{"original": "unidentified male: his party will no longer have total control of the government. he will no longer have a majority in the house. democrats are salivating at the idea they could eat his lunch."}
{"original": "unidentified male: no matter how many times donald trump tweets, no matter how much, you know, spends his morning executive time, hovering up rails of adderall and rage tweeting, it is not going to change where pelosi is."}
{"original": "unidentified female: nancy pelosi, who is a historic figure, she is going to reclaim her position as speaker, the most powerful woman in american politics."}
{"original": "unidentified female: she is very openly, aggressively, consciously, trying to send messages of women of all parties in a nonpartisan way, and of all professions, all walks of life, that it is ok to be a powerful woman."}
{"original": "unidentified female: let us just take this moment and feel good about it and know that maybe things will get tough again tomorrow. but i have just a little better feeling about things right now as of this moment."}
{"original": "hannity: i feel so much better."}
{"original": "that wasn't enough. liberal morning joe is back from vacation, calling for the 25th amendment to be invoked against president trump. take a look."}
{"original": "joe scarborough, msnbc host: if we had a house and a senate that took their job seriously, there would be people going up to the white house this morning saying, mr. president, questions abound whether you are fit for this office. if this continues, we are going to ask your cabinet to take a vote on whether you are fit for office and invoke the 25th amendment."}
{"original": "hannity: do we get to vote if people are fit to do a tv show? i'm just asking."}
{"original": "here with reaction, the hill's joe concha, fox news contributor rachel campos-duffy. you see her often on fox & friends weekend."}
{"original": "hannity: all predictable. but this runs deeper, joe. you know, i got jill abramson's comments, which i thought were pretty amazing, that the news part of the new york times is anti-trump, but it's more than that. i am saying it's every major newspaper, every network, every so-called cable network. we are like an island on this show."}
{"original": "but it is every second, minute, hour every day. it's not news anymore, none of its news anymore. it's activism, call it whatever you want. i'm a talk show host. they never identify themselves as such. i think it's an information crisis like we've never had in this country before."}
{"original": "joe concha, media reporter for the hill: yes, that's true. there was a poll out last year where a majority of americans can't name even one neutral news source. a majority can't say, oh, i could go there and find what i need. that that's remarkable that you say there's an information crisis, that's true."}
{"original": "i think what that montage show me, you called it activism, i think it's more acting, as in bad acting. i see these pundits on all these other networks that are trying to outdo themselves. i mean, rachel used to be in a show called the real world, where you had each season - each cast tried to be as sensational and over-the-top more than the previous the cast of the other season."}
{"original": "hannity: joe let me say what it is."}
{"original": "hannity: trump is really, really, really, really, really - no, he's really, really, really, really awful, awful bad. they want - that's like - it's like a kid's game. but there's no news in it."}
{"original": "concha: no, but its play-acting. it's stage. but - sean to make a point."}
{"original": "hannity: no, no, no, i disagree. this is - they hate him. this hatred is real. they wake up hating him every morning and they want to screw him and they want impeachment, they want the 25th amendment. and they don't really care about the american people or what's good for the country, or they never report on the good things he's done. i'll give you a quick chance to respond, joe."}
{"original": "concha: sure. okay. look, the new york times, did get back to jill urban's point. they fired their public editor. they said, we'll depend on readers' comments instead. that was a big problem. but the paper of record - it's now the paper that seeks to provide comfort food to only people in american cities, only half the country and that's a big problem."}
{"original": "let me give you one stat from gallup, because this goes back to the point we're talking about before. 66 percent of those polled saying that news organizations are being too dramatic and too sensational in order to attract more readers and viewers, 27 percent disagree. in other words two- thirds of people think that all this is being sensationalized to bring in people through clickbait or the stuff we see on cable news."}
{"original": "and i know you say its hatred, i think that's half of it and i think half of it is also just to bring in folks by being hyperbolic and being over- the-top. i really believe that."}
{"original": "hannity: rachel, you know, this - the interesting irony is in all this, is they need donald trump. you take away donald trump, they've got nothing. what are they going to do? there's nobody in the - in a fascinating way he is the most fascinating public figure we've ever had, highly entertaining, but also extraordinarily successful in being a great disrupter, iconoclast, who actually keeps his promises."}
{"original": "rachel campos-duffy, contributor: absolutely. listen, i watched the coverage today. i was not surprised to see nancy celebrating. her - and the democrats should celebrate. this is a big victory for them."}
{"original": "when the media - i saw the media just giddy and salivating and just over- the-top fawning. it's unseemly, but guess what, it's also just as fitting. they were just as hard as nancy pelosi--"}
{"original": "hannity: let me ask you this."}
{"original": "campos-duffy: --dccc to give her that gavel. they worked hard with negative headlines with suppression of news - of very good news that donald trump had energy independence, blue collar recovery, minorities doing better than ever. all of these things happened and they suppress that news in order to get this victory."}
{"original": "hannity: does it help the country? does any of what they're doing in the media help the country, rachel?"}
{"original": "campos-duffy: absolutely not. the media is served - the country is served when we have a media that just reports the facts. and right now the one- sidedness of what has happened - the stuff that abramson brought up herself out of her own organization, the new york times, she even says that the american people are losing trust in the media. and what it's doing is its allowing others other sources of media--"}
{"original": "hannity: joe, last words - real quick."}
{"original": "concha: yes, sure. so i think that nancy pelosi was treated the same way that hillary clinton was during the 2016 election, and what happened, she didn't win. that tells me the influence on media ain't what it used to be. don't worry about it."}
{"original": "hannity: mike pompeo next. thank you both."}
{"original": "president donald trump: you can call it a barrier, you can call it whatever you want, but essentially we need protection in our country. we're going to make it good. the people of our country want it."}
{"original": "i have never had so much support as i have in the last week over my stance for border security, for border control, and for frankly the wall or the barrier. i have never had anything like it in terms of calls coming in, in terms of people writing in and tweeting and doing whatever they have to do. i've never had this much support, and we've done some things that, as you know, have been very popular."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. that was president trump speaking earlier today during his surprise appearance at the white house press briefing. hannity watch on the government shutdown, a border security, we continue now with secretary of state mike pompeo."}
{"original": "mr. secretary good to see you. i see this as a massive national security issue. it deals with relations, obviously, with mexico. it's about drugs being brought into the country, human trafficking, criminals, gang members, some people that have ties to terror. why shouldn't we all view this as a national security issue?"}
{"original": "mike pompeo, secretary of state: we should. thanks for having me on tonight. we should. we should all be very serious about this. i've been the cia director. i'm now the secretary of state. this has enormous national security implications and border security is an important part of american sovereignty and keeping americans safe."}
{"original": "there is a central role to make sure that we know who's coming in and what is coming into our country, and president trump is doing the right thing, in making sure we understand what's moving across that border and we do so with enough border security, so we have confidence and we can do this on behalf of the american people."}
{"original": "hannity: we've been able to apprehend 3,700 people that we've identified as having ties to terror."}
{"original": "pompeo: there's lots of risks associated, the narcotics risk itself has enormous implications for people inside the united states. there are lots of things that come across that southern border that we need to get control over and president trump is determined to make that happen. it includes the rest that we have terrorists come across that border."}
{"original": "hannity: we're talking about central america, but you've had a pretty busy year. we have the talks with north korea, talk about denuclearization of the korean peninsula. we have issues now with china. we also have issues with the middle east. new alliances, opportunities, hopefully emerging, certainly with israel, with the iranian deal being drawn back."}
{"original": "where do you see on the world stage - where is america different now - because i don't think the president gets a lot of credit for a lot of progress around the world."}
{"original": "pompeo: oh, sean, we have we have made fundamental changes in american foreign policy that enormously benefited the american people. i could take through the same list of places that you spoke about. the previous administration had decided that the world's largest state-sponsored terror was the partner in the middle east, iran. we've fundamentally flipped that."}
{"original": "we know that that is a real threat to the world and to america and so we have developed relationships with arab countries, and israel. we've brought them together to develop a coalition to keep americans safe from things going on in the middle east."}
{"original": "you spoke first, i think, about north korea. lots of work that is left to be done, but i'm confident that in to the next short period of time president trump and chairman kim will get the chance to meet again. and truly create a much better, safer america with less threat of not only nuclear weapons being launched at us, but nuclear proliferation as well. these are real risks and real changes from the previous administration's policies."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. let's talk specifically about north korea. so the president's been hinting and saying that there's going to be another meeting with kim jong-un will that be about and will there be the potential at that meeting of the denuclearization of the entire peninsula. obviously, missiles aren't being fired, remains have been sent back, hostages have been released, so a lot of progress. is this where you might close that deal?"}
{"original": "pompeo: yes, sean i will be surprised if we get all the way home in this meeting, although it would be fantastic if we did. i don't want to tell you exactly what our negotiating strategy is."}
{"original": "but suffice it to say, i think, we have set the conditions where we can make a real progress when chairman kim and president trump meet and - to take down the threat to the united states and to the world that has been, frankly, holding america hostage for so long in north korea. it'll be good for south korea, it'll be good for japan, it'll be good for all of the world."}
{"original": "hannity: putting aside the khashoggi incident, there seem to be an emerging new alliance against iranian hegemony and that would be the united states, our closest ally is israel, the saudis, egyptians, jordanians up till recently the emirates against the iranians. do you see an opportunities - historic opportunity where these alliances could lead to a peace that nobody could even have been thinking about 10 years ago?"}
{"original": "pompeo: sean, undoubtedly, we have set the conditions in the middle east where these countries are, now working together across multiple fronts. you saw the president's announcement about our withdrawal from syria, we're still going to be able to effectively, with those partners, counter the threat from isis in the region, and we'll do it without those 2,000 soldiers on the ground."}
{"original": "we haven't changed our policy about continuing to make sure that there is no isis resurgence and we're just going to do in a way that is smarter and better, and we can do that, because of the alliances that the president trump has built."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. let's talk about china in the sense they've had a massive military buildup. but your state department issued a warning to americans traveling to china that, in fact, they could issue exit bans preventing americans from leaving. what's the status?"}
{"original": "pompeo: so, sean, we didn't change the level of the warning there in china. we did change some of the language. we do our best here to constantly review things that might happen to americans who are traveling abroad. we saw what happened with the american there in russia."}
{"original": "our job is to always have americans safe who are traveling and we wanted to let them know that there have been more risks from what china has done in terms of folks traveling there and not being permitted to return. we just want to make them aware of that and i'm hopeful that we got the language just right, so americans will understand the risk, but still travel there when it's appropriate."}
{"original": "hannity: let's talk about the latest in terms of the relationships with russia, obviously, a hostile regime, obviously a hostile actor in vladimir putin. not only the united states, but other countries have experienced their cyberwarfare, if you will, or their desire to create chaos in other countries, but if you can address that. and also their support of the iranians, their influence in syria, and do you see an iranian-russia-syrian alliance that would worry you?"}
{"original": "pompeo: i am concerned about that. and frankly, the russian's behavior has not been good. but this administration has been very serious at responding to that, whether it was the strike that presidents - the strikes that presidents taken in syria, those were in syria, but the russians were all around it."}
{"original": "our effort with respect to what the russians did in in skripal. the sanctions we've put on russian oligarchs who have threatened america and american interests, those are real responses. we've done that, sean, at the same time that we're trying to find space where we can work with them."}
{"original": "trying to find opportunities where the russians and american interests overlap, even if our value sets do not, so that we can work together against some of these most difficult problems. it's been tough and vladimir putin has not cooperated, but we're still trying to find a place to do that."}
{"original": "hannity: president has some critics as it relates to saying that he wants to withdraw from syria and afghanistan. is there a timetable or will it be based on the situation on the ground?"}
{"original": "pompeo: president's always been very clear that he wanted to get our soldiers back home, in syria he has made that decision and we are working in that direction. that decision is done and we will withdraw from syria. the timeline will be consistent with what we can do to make sure that our soldiers are safe, that we continue the counter isis campaign, that we do all that we can to keep the coalition against iran."}
{"original": "together, those are also things that the president's made very clear he was going to do. when he visited iraq now - goodness a week ago, he made it very clear that those were things that were also important. so we will manage those threats to america, but we'll do so without a couple of thousand folks on the ground in syria."}

{"original": "on jan. 27, california gov. gavin newsom's new commission exploring the viability of bringing government-run, single-payer health care to the golden state met for the first time."}
{"original": "as a california-based health care scholar who's studied single-payer for more than 30 years, i hoped newsom would ask me to join the business leaders, medical professionals and health policy experts on the commission. but my invite never came."}
{"original": "perhaps that's because newsom wouldn't like what i'd have to say. implementing single-payer in california is not only financially impossible – it would diminish the quality of care for patients."}
{"original": "obamacare architect rejects sanders, warren health insurance plans: 'i'm not an advocate'"}
{"original": "california has flirted with single-payer for years. in 2017, the state senate passed the healthy california act, which would have dumped virtually every californian into a single, state-run health insurance program. like the medicare-for-all plan championed by the likes of sens. bernie sanders, i-vt., and elizabeth warren, d-mass., at the national level, the healthy california act would have basically outlawed private insurance and made care free at the point of service."}
{"original": "newsom endorsed the bill during his gubernatorial campaign, as did the california nurses association, one of the state's most powerful labor unions. despite this support, california assembly speaker anthony rendon shelved the bill in 2017, calling it woefully incomplete."}
{"original": "click here to get the opinion newsletter"}
{"original": "the bill was a disaster waiting to happen. a report commissioned by the assembly determined it would have cost $400 billion a year – double the state's annual budget. analysts said half that funding would come from existing programs. advocates proposed generating the remaining $200 billion with a 15 percent payroll tax."}
{"original": "a study funded by the california nurses association claimed that single-payer would only cost $331 billion. in that case, the state would still need to find an additional $106 billion. the report suggested generating those funds by adding a 2.3 percent sales tax on top of california's existing 7.25 percent sales tax."}
{"original": "taxes like these aren't popular, even in famously liberal california. according to 2017 polling from the public policy institute of california, support for single-payer dropped from 65 percent to 42 percent after people learned they'd have to pay new taxes."}
{"original": "californians will like single-payer even less after they consider the devastation it's wrought in other countries. consider the experiences of british patients living under the government-run national health service. some patients are denied care because they're overweight. some clinics won't remove cataracts until the patient has reached a certain level of blindness."}
{"original": "governments don't have unlimited resources. they have to make decisions about whose care to pay for and who has to wait in line."}
{"original": "the state can scarcely afford the expansions of public health coverage the newsom administration has already green-lit. at the governor's urging, the state recently expanded the state's medicaid program, dubbed medi-cal, to cover low-income, undocumented immigrants up to age 26. official estimates peg the cost of this expansion at $98 million in its first year. on jan. 10, the governor proposed further expanding medi-cal to cover around 27,000 undocumented seniors at a cost of over $80 million."}
{"original": "click here to get the fox news app"}
{"original": "expansions like this will galvanize progressives who have called for medi-cal to cover all undocumented immigrants. doing so would cost $3 billion a year, according to the state assembly's appropriations committee."}
{"original": "newsom's healthy california for all commission will release its preliminary report on the state of coverage in california in july 2020 – and its final verdict on how to implement single-payer in february 2021. they shouldn't need a year, much less six months, to determine that a government takeover of california's healthcare system would be ruinous for the state's finances and patients."}

{"original": "president biden is expected to sign executive orders thursday aimed at getting more americans signed up for health care by reopening the federal health insurance marketplace during a special enrollment period of the affordable care act."}
{"original": "regular enrollment through healthcare.gov is usually the last six weeks of each year and the special enrollment period will run from february through may, the white house said in a release."}
{"original": "the order is part of a campaign promise biden repeatedly made during the election to expand access to obamacare."}
{"original": "for president biden, this is personal, the release said. he believes that every american has a right to the peace of mind that comes with knowing they have access to affordable, quality health care."}
{"original": "biden signs climate change orders amid concerns over jobs: 'it is time to act'"}
{"original": "it would come as many americans have lost their health insurance because of job losses during the coronavirus pandemic."}
{"original": "the biden administration said in the release the orders also aim to strengthen obamacare, medicare and access to reproductive health care in repudiation of four years of attempts by the trump administration and republicans to strip health care from millions of americans through their attempts to repeal obamacare."}
{"original": "republicans unsuccessfully attempted to repeal obamacare and replace it with a conservative plan during trump's presidency."}
{"original": "the executive orders will be the latest in a series of actions meant to quickly roll back former president trump's efforts while in office."}
{"original": "biden signs executive orders targeting fossil fuel industry"}
{"original": "these actions demonstrate a strong commitment by the biden-harris administration to protect and build on the affordable care act, meet the health care needs created by the pandemic, reduce health care costs, protect access to reproductive health care, and make our health care system easier to navigate and more equitable, the release said."}
{"original": "the white house said the order would ask federal agencies to reconsider policies that reduce access to health care such as in the case of americans who have pre-existing conditions."}
{"original": "click here to get the fox news app"}
{"original": "additionally, biden will issue a presidential memorandum to support women's and girls' sexual and reproductive health and rights in the united states, as well as globally. the memo will rescind the trump administration's global gag policy that prohibits international nonprofits that give abortion counseling from receiving u.s. funding."}
{"original": "president biden will get another opportunity to make a key judicial appointment on what is considered the second most important federal court."}
{"original": "judge david tatel of the dc circuit u.s. court of appeals has announced he is stepping down from full-time service on the bench. he will take senior status, meaning a reduced caseload."}
{"original": "he joins merrick garland—biden's nominee for attorney general—in planning to leave the bench. that powerful court is considered something of a professional stepping-stone to the supreme court. chief justice roberts and justices thomas and kavanaugh—along with the late justices scalia and ginsburg—served on that appeals court, which hears many important cases dealing with congressional laws and executive actions."}
{"original": "biden admin tells supreme court obamacare is constitutional, a reversal of trump's doj stance in pending case"}
{"original": "the dc circuit currently has 7-4 majority of democratic-appointed full-time judges. three of the gop-appointed judges were named by president trump: gregory katsas, neomi rao, and justin walker. that court has issued a number of judicial setbacks to trump-era policies on immigration, the environment, and other executive actions."}
{"original": "biden could have more opportunities to make his mark on the federal courts—about a third of federal appeals court judges nationwide are eligible to step down from-full time service."}
{"original": "tatel was named to the appeals court by president clinton in 1994, taking ginsburg's old seat. he is legally blind."}
{"original": "it's faintly amusing to see the maestros of the mainstream media saying that donald trump is going about winning reelection the wrong way."}
{"original": "not only did virtually all its denizens see trump losing right up until that november morning in 2016, the new york times had an election meter that at the end gave hillary an 85 percent chance of winning: mrs. clinton's chance of losing is about the same as the probability that an nfl kicker misses a 37-yard field goal."}
{"original": "so maybe this guy knows something about winning elections that mere journalists don't."}
{"original": "but in a piece yesterday, the times suggested that the president is pursuing a very strange strategy if he wants a second term."}
{"original": "now there's a lot of good information in this story. i agree with some of the points. there are head-scratching moments when i can't figure out why trump isn't doing more to expand his fiercely loyal but short-of-a-majority base."}
{"original": "trump, in fiery first rally since mueller vindication, celebrates end of 'collusion delusion' and 'ridiculous bulls---'"}
{"original": "why, for instance, did trump step on the filing of the mueller report — a very good story for him — by making a move on obamacare, which has been an awful story for him? why did he overrule some of his top aides and back a lawsuit to junk the law when he has no plan after three failed attempts at repeal with a republican congress? i have no clue."}
{"original": "i do know that too many journalists and commentators live in a liberal urban bubble, and i've been saying that for decades."}
{"original": "presidents, too, can be trapped in a bubble, and that is the focus of the times story that says the current one is almost hermetically sealed."}
{"original": "he eats almost every meal in the white house or at properties he owns. his presidential travel has been limited largely to red-state campaign rallies with adoring crowds, brief appearances surveying natural disasters, official travel overseas and a handful of forays to factories. his most consistent interactions with americans are the steady diet of tweets he sends them."}
{"original": "while the times acknowledges the bubblicious nature of every presidency, the paper says trump is comfortable there, living in an echo chamber of his own making, an approach to the presidency that will be strenuously tested as mr. trump begins his campaign for re-election."}
{"original": "congressional republicans rattled by trump's pivot to obamacare fight after mueller summary"}
{"original": "a look at trump's travel shows that the president has mainly spoken to audiences who already agree with him, with the exception of his trips responding to natural disasters ... he has spent 82.5 percent of his presidency at the white house and has visited a property he owns on 224 out of 796 days, or 28.1 percent, he has been in office."}
{"original": "he has visited 38 states, but that masks the extent to which he has concentrated his time in states that voted for him for president: nine visits to missouri and west virginia, eight to texas and north carolina, for example. mr. trump continued that pattern through the midterm elections, making only three campaign appearances in states that he did not win in 2016."}
{"original": "oh, and trump has eaten only five times at the home of supporters (he has that nice hotel five blocks down pennsylvania when he wants to go out, or that palm beach spread)."}
{"original": "the paper concedes that lbj and richard nixon were trapped in bubbles by war and scandal, but says barack obama, among other things, liked to go to five guys."}
{"original": "i have two major caveats here. while trump does need to expand his base, intensity is also crucial. once he's not just running against a generic democrat, the level of turnout among his supporters could be the difference between 2016 and 2018."}
{"original": "what's more, trump isn't only surrounded by sycophants because he watches a whole lot of television. and while fox news is clearly his preferred network, it's clear from his tweeting that he also hate-watches msnbc and cnn, which means he's hearing a whole lot of criticism."}
{"original": "that's why trump tweeted yesterday that ratings at those two networks — and he singled out morning joe — tanked in the wake of the mueller report. (that could be temporary, of course, and joe scarborough responded that his show is breaking its ratings records and trump is only at 34 percent in new hampshire.)"}
{"original": "now listening to a bunch of pundits is obviously not the same as engaging in the real america, but it's not being in a windowless bunker, either."}
{"original": "trump is not much of a glad-hander. you don't see him working rope lines. he doesn't have those reflexes because he didn't grow up in the baby-kissing environment of retail politics. and yet in this social media age, his supporters don't seem to mind."}

{"original": "rep. john lewis, d-georgia: i don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president."}
{"original": "wallace: what's your reaction to congressman lewis?"}
{"original": "pence: donald trump won this election fair and square, thirty of 50 states, more counties than any republican since ronald reagan, and the american people know that. and, while i have great respect for john lewis, and for his contributions, particularly with the civil rights movement."}
{"original": "i was deeply disappointed to see someone of his stature question the legitimacy of donald trump's election as president and say he's not attending the inauguration, and i hope he reconsiders both positions. you know, we'd even had recounts in this election where the numbers for the president-elect had actually gone up. there's no question about the legitimacy of this election, and for john lewis to make those statements is deeply disappointing."}
{"original": "this is also -- it's disappointing, too, because i truly do believe this is a time when the american people should be celebrating the peaceful transition of power. that's what this week is really all about, chris, and to know that four living presidents will be on the stage acknowledging that peaceful transition of power, the world will be watching, will hear the first remarks that donald will make as president of the united states in his inaugural address."}
{"original": "i just -- i hope that john lewis, and some others who have joined his plans to take a pass on the inauguration, will rethink that, will be with us and will celebrate this extraordinary moment in the life of our nation and the life of democracy."}
{"original": "wallace: i like to ask you as well -- you talked about lewis' comments about mr. trump. but also, i'd also like to ask about mr. trump's comments about mr. lewis. i want to put up this tweet, because in response, the president-elect called john lewis all talk, talk, talk, no action."}
{"original": "can he really say that about the man who got his head cracked open walking across the pettus bridge in selma, alabama, on bloody sunday, all talk, no action?"}
{"original": "wallace: do you think that's appropriate?"}
{"original": "pence: i think -- i think donald trump has the right to defend himself. when someone of john lewis' stature, someone who is not only an icon in the civil rights movement, but also someone who by virtue of his sacrifice on that day that we know as bloody sunday, he crossed the edmund pettus bridge and he suffered that abuse and it was -- it was true that that the voting rights -- for someone to use his stature to use terms like this is not a legitimate president, it's just -- it's just deeply disappointing to me, and i hope he reconsiders it."}
{"original": "but what donald trump was talking about their was literally generations of failed policies coming out of washington, d.c., that have failed to many families and too many cities across this country. i will tell you, donald trump is a man who is profoundly impatient with failure. and you saw in the campaign, he went to major cities in this country and said we are going to bring safety to our streets. we're going to bring school choice to our children. we're going to bring jobs and opportunities to our cities."}
{"original": "you remember that great line what the heck do you have to lose? he's committed to being president of all the people in this country and to bring new jobs and prosperity in ways that the failed liberal policies of the last several generations have not."}
{"original": "wallace: let me pick up on another controversy this week, because mr. trump has been going after the intelligence community, especially after they briefed him, and it became a public that they had briefed him both as unverified oppo research that the kremlin allegedly put together on him. on friday, mr. trump sent these tweets, probably released by 'intelligence', intelligence in quotes, even knowing there is no proof, and never will be."}
{"original": "does the president-elect really believe that the intelligence community is trying to undercut him and does he stand by his comparison of those tactics to nazi germany?"}
{"original": "pence: well, i think -- and obviously, the briefing that the president-elect and i received a week ago was a classified briefing and i can't comment on anything that happened there."}
{"original": "wallace: well, the intelligence community has --"}
{"original": "pence: i never will. but --"}
{"original": "wallace: they have verified that they did brief him on this oppo research."}

{"original": "wallace: what about the intelligence community?"}
{"original": "pence: -- from whatever the source, and we don't know what the source was that put this into the traffic. i know that the director of national intelligence said that it had been -- this information had been his floating around for months."}
{"original": "it -- i think the president-elect and i, it was an act of your responsibility by a handful of news organizations to actually traffic in and pay attention to these materials. and again, i think the american people saw for what it was, and our focus is going forward. when you see the team that the president-elect has assembled in the course of this transition, particularly when it comes to national security, in general mattis and in senator dan coats, and in mike pompeo, you're going to see an effort to reinvigorate our national security, national intelligence, and the president is going to see to that from day one."}
{"original": "wallace: let's talk about policy going forward, because the president-elect's seemed to suggest in an interview this weekend with the wall street journal that he might dramatically change relations with russia, and in fact lift sanctions against russia if they begin to cooperate with us on isis and other areas. i want to put a quote from that interview."}
{"original": "mr. trump said, if you get along and if russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebody's doing some really great things?"}
{"original": "how quickly might he end sanctions on russia?"}
{"original": "pence: i think -- i think the president-elect has made it very clear that we have a terrible relationship with russia right now, and that's not all our own doing, but it really is a failure of american diplomacy in successive administrations. and what the president-elect is determined to do is explore the possibility of better relations. we have a common enemy in isis, the ability to work with russia to confront, hunt down, and destroy isis at its source represents an enormously important priority of this incoming administration."}
{"original": "but i think what the american people like about donald trump is he someone who can sit down, roll the sleeves up, and make a deal. and i think what you're hearing in his reflections, whether it'd be with russia, whether it'd be with china, whether it'd be with other countries in the world is that we are going to reengage. we are going to put america first. we're going to put america's interest first. but we're going to reengage in a way that advances america's interest in the world and advances peace."}
{"original": "wallace: i want to ask you about two very specific questions briefly so we can move on to domestic policy. we now know that the trump's national security advisor, mike flynn, had several conversations with the russian ambassador, kislyak, just at the time that president obama was announcing new sanctions to the hacking of the u.s. election against russia."}
{"original": "number one: did mike flynn ever discuss lifting sanctions in any of those conversations? do you know?"}
{"original": "pence: i talked to general flynn yesterday, and the conversations that took place at that time were not in any way related to the new u.s. sanctions against russia or the expulsion of diplomats."}
{"original": "second question: can you flatly deny -- because this continues to be out there -- that there were any contact at any point in the campaign between mr. trump's associates and russian operatives, including cutouts, as we know, about the hacking of the democrats during the election?"}
{"original": "pence: this -- you know, some of this derives from this opposition research memo, i guess, chris, that made its way around the internet. there was about 24 hours were michael cohen, who has worked in the trump organization for many years, was accused for having a meeting in prague, and finally, some news organizations did a little checking and found out that it was a different michael cohen. and michael himself has never actually been to prague."}
{"original": "wallace: but i do want to ask you a question."}
{"original": "pence: he was at a baseball game with his son in august of last year. so --"}
{"original": "wallace: i understand that. but there's been other talk, and in fact, if i may, senators specifically asked fbi director comey about that. he refused to answer."}
{"original": "so, i'm asking a direct question: was there any contact in any way between trump or his associates and the kremlin or cutouts they had?"}
{"original": "pence: i joined this campaign in the summer, and i can tell you that all the contact by the trump campaign and associates was with the american people. we were fully engaged with taking his message to make america great again all across this country. that's why he won in a landslide election."}
{"original": "wallace: -- if there were any contacts, sir, i'm just trying to get an answer."}
{"original": "pence: yes. i -- of course not. why would there be any contacts between the campaign?"}
{"original": "chris, the -- this is all a distraction, and it's all part of a narrative to delegitimize the election and to question the legitimacy of this presidency, the american people see right through it."}
{"original": "pence: and truthfully, this is a week -- you know, i just sat on with our transition team in washington yesterday, we have -- we've named 20 out of 21 of our candidate officials, probably have all of them named before we get to inauguration day. the caliber and character of men and women that the president-elect has assembled, the hundreds and hundreds of interviews and conversations he himself has had, i think should be deeply inspiring to millions of americans. and they know when he raises his right hand on that inaugural platform this coming friday, that he is going to be ready on day one to keep his promises to the american people to turn this country around."}
{"original": "wallace: but let me ask you about this. we've got about three minutes and i'm going to ask you three questions. so, let's try to get them all in, ok?"}
{"original": "wallace: the president-elect he wants to see repeal and replace basically at the same time. here he is in his press conference."}
{"original": "trump: it will be repealed and replaced. it will be essentially simultaneously. it will be various segments, you understand, but will most likely be on the same day or the same week."}
{"original": "wallace: i don't have to tell you that replacing is a lot more complicated than repealed, especially how do you pay for some of the provisions of obamacare you want to keep, like the pre-existing conditions? can you really do the really two at the same time, and when will that be? how quickly?"}
{"original": "pence: the short answer is yes. we can do it at the same time."}
{"original": "pence: the president-elect made it very clear to leaders in the congress this week that he wanted to do both at the same time. and we're very grateful the house and senate moved resolutions this week to begin the process of repealing obamacare."}
{"original": "wallace: so, realistically, when could you do that, sir?"}
{"original": "pence: lifting the enormous burden -- you are seeing an incredible increase in premiums on americans. obamacare has failed. we are going to repeal it."}
{"original": "but at the same time, we're going to pass the kind of legislation that will lower the cost of health encourage without growing the size of debt. i would anticipate in the first 100 days that we'll deliver on that promise for the american people."}
{"original": "wallace: does mr. trump still have confidence in fbi director -- did he ever have confidence in fbi director james comey?"}
{"original": "pence: well, you will have to ask him about that. i know it's been the subject of some commentary this week."}
{"original": "but, you know, at the end of the day, i know that whether it's our security at home or abroad, the president-elect is going to put the safety and security of the american people first in every decision."}
{"original": "wallace: you're not willing to give him a vote of confidence at this point?"}
{"original": "pence: well, you'd have to ask the president-elect. i know they've had conversations. and that will be a good question for him after january 20th, chris."}
{"original": "wallace: and finally, one minute left -- central message, central theme that president trump wants to advance in his inaugural address, the message he wants to send to the american people?"}
{"original": "pence: well, i'll let him speak for himself on friday. i think the american people will see the same donald trump they saw every day of this campaign step up to that podium. he's going to speak from his mind, he's going to speak from his heart, and he's going to -- he's going to lay out a vision to make america great again."}
{"original": "and i have to tell you, chris, when i stand surrounded by my family and take the oath of office as vice president of the united states, all i will be thinking about is what an honor it is to stand next to a man who i know -- who i know -- can restore and revive this country, and i'll also just be thinking as the grandson of an irish immigrant, what a great country this is."}
{"original": "wallace: i should also point out, you're going to be taking the oath of office on the reagan bible, which i -- and i gather that's the first time it will have been used since ronald reagan put his hand on the bible back in the '80s. i know how much you revere ronald reagan. that's going to be a pretty emotional moment."}
{"original": "pence: it will be, and to have the oath of office administered me by justice clarence thomas, someone who i admire for his philosophy, for his courage on the bench in his 25th year on the supreme court."}
{"original": "again, it's just very humbling for me. we are approaching it with prayer, but with deep, deep gratitude to the president-elect for his confidence and deep gratitude to the american people who have elected donald trump and elected a man who i know is going to make america great again."}
{"original": "wallace: mr. vice president-elect, thank you. thank you for joining us during this very busy time. and it's always a pleasure to talk with you, sir."}
{"original": "wallace: up next, the outgoing chief of the cia, john brennan, on those russian rumors, mr. trump's relationship with the intel community and the hot spots he'll face around the world."}
{"original": "wallace: a look at the inaugural stage in the west front of the capitol where donald trump will take the oath of office on friday."}
{"original": "mr. trump begins his presidency in an extraordinary split with the intelligence community, a split that only widened after they presented him with unsubstantiated oppo research the kremlin allegedly compiled, a file that quickly went public."}
{"original": "joining me here in washington for an exclusive exit interview is the outgoing cia director john brennan."}
{"original": "and, mr. brennan, welcome back to fox news sunday."}
{"original": "john brennan, cia director: good morning, chris."}
{"original": "wallace: president-elect trump has made it clear, as we just discussed, that he believes the intelligence community released, put out information about this unverified dossier in order to undercut him. here's what he said at his press conference."}
{"original": "trump: i think it was disgraceful, disgraceful, that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out be so false and fake out. i think it's a disgrace, and i say that and i say that, and that something that nazi germany would have done and did do."}
{"original": "john brennan, cia director: well, i think as the director of national intelligence said in his statement, this information has been out there circulating for many months. so, it's not a question of the intelligence community leaking or releasing this information, it was already out there."}
{"original": "wallace: but it hasn't been reported, though. and one of the reasons it hadn't is because it hadn't been verified. and when you briefed the president on it, you collectively briefed the president on it, the president-elect, that made it news."}
{"original": "brennan: well, nothing has been verified. it is unsubstantiated reporting that is out there, that has been circulating in the private sector and with the media as well by a firm that pulled this information together."}
{"original": "but what i do find outrageous is equating the intelligence community with nazi germany. i do take great umbrage at that, and there is no basis for mr. trump to point fingers at the intelligence community for leaking information that was already available publicly."}
{"original": "wallace: but it wasn't available publicly. various news organizations, if i may, various news organization had it, but they weren't reporting it because it hadn't been verified. and this brings me to the real question, director brennan, why on earth within nations intelligence spy chief's brief president-elect trump in your first meeting collectively with him on this unverified information? first of all, it wasn't intelligence, it was rumors. and secondly, my briefing him on it, you made it a news event and, therefore, gave news organizations an excuse to report it."}
{"original": "brennan: well, i think news organizations should not assume what happened during that discussion with mr. trump."}
{"original": "wallace: well, it's been verified by the director of national intelligence that he was briefed on this information."}
{"original": "brennan: chris, bringing to the attention of the president-elect, as well as to the current president that this was circulating out there was a responsibility in the minds of the intelligence directors, of the intelligence community to make sure that there was going to be no evaluation of it, but just making sure that the president-elect was aware that it was circulating."}
{"original": "wallace: but shouldn't you have done it a bunch of better ways, for instance, had a staff level person, give it to a staff level person, rather than the spy chiefs giving it to the president and the president-elect?"}
{"original": "brennan: well, i think anybody who has read the reports that are out there, i think there are some very salacious allegations in there, again, unsubstantiated, that were circulating. and so, making sure that the president-elect himself was aware of it. i think that was the extent of what it was that the intelligence chiefs wanted to do."}
{"original": "wallace: one of the questions, though, is whether the intelligence community is going after -- or somehow is going to try to undercut by selective leaks the new president-elect."}
{"original": "let me ask my question, because former top intelligence officials have been bashing mr. trump for months, and i want to put a couple of these on the screen. former acting cia director mike morell wrote, in the intelligence business, we would say mr. putin had recruited mr. trump as an unwitting agent of the russian federation."}
{"original": "and then, former cia director michael hayden said he'd prefer a different term, that's the useful fool, some naif, manipulated by moscow, secretly held in contempt, but his blind support is happily accepted and exploited."}
{"original": "can you understand given that and given all these leaks that have been coming out for months, why the president-elect with think the intelligence community had it in for him?"}
{"original": "brennan: well, these are private citizens now for speaking about the current political environment about individuals. so, i'm not going to try to defend or explain what they said. but i can tell you that the intelligence community is prepared to support the president-elect and his incoming team, as we have done throughout the course of our history."}
{"original": "so, there is no interest in undermining the president-elect and the national security team that's coming in. it's our responsibility to make sure that they understand exactly the dangers that are on the world stage, so that as they can decide on which policy courses they want to pursue, they have both the full benefit of the expertise, the capability, the experience and the intelligence that we have so that they can make the best decisions for this country."}
{"original": "wallace: you said you were offended, and understandably so, by his comparison to nazi germany. what's the danger when a president-elect and an intelligence community are at such odds and such -- at least on the part apparently of the president-elect -- such distrust?"}
{"original": "brennan: well, there are many dangers. i think the world is watching now what mr. trump says, and listening very carefully. if he doesn't have confidence in the intelligence community, what signal does that send to our partners and allies, as well as our adversaries?"}
{"original": "so, i think mr. trump has to be very disciplined in terms of what it is that he says publicly, he is going to be in a few days' time, the most powerful person in the world in terms of sitting on top of the united states government and i think he has to recognize that his words do have impact. and they can have very positive impact, or they can be undercutting of our national security."}
{"original": "wallace: i want to end this part of the interview with one more question, which is the same question of the device president-elect fence. does the intelligence community have any information -- i'm not talking about rumors, any information -- about contacts between the trump camp and associates of the kremlin about discussions during the campaign about hacking the democrats?"}
{"original": "brennan: the intelligence community collects foreign intelligence on foreign parties, entities or people. if in the course of our intelligence collection, we pick up information related to u.s. persons or officials, which we refer to as incidental collection, we share that information with the appropriate authorities. in most instances, that's the fbi."}
{"original": "and so, if we did come into contact with that type of information, it would have been shared with the fbi, and we would make sure that our intelligence committees then were aware of it as well."}
{"original": "wallace: so, is there such information?"}
{"original": "brennan: i'd just say, if we came into -- if had that type of information, we would share it with the fbi."}
{"original": "wallace: i mean, i just would say, that's not a denial, sir."}
{"original": "brennan: well, i wouldn't confirm or deny something like that on your program, as much as i respect you, chris."}
{"original": "let's talk about some hot spots. mr. trump said in this weekend, as we just talked about it in that wall street journal interview, that he might lift sanctions on russia if they start helping us. and here's what the president-elect said about relations with the kremlin in his news conference. take a look."}
{"original": "trump: if putin likes donald trump, guess what, folks? that's called an asset, not a liability."}
{"original": "wallace: do you think that mr. trump understands the threat from russia?"}
{"original": "brennan: i don't think he has a full appreciation of russian capabilities, russia's intentions, and actions that they are undertaking in many parts of the world. and that's with the obligation and responsibility of the intelligence community is."}
{"original": "i very much hope that our relationship with russia improves in the coming administration -- absolutely -- because there are very important things we need to do, not just on counterterrorism, but trying to deal with political instability around the globe. but here is a fair amount of responsibility on russia's part to change their behavior, change their actions. and what we need to do is make sure that mr. trump and vice president-elect. mr. pence, understand exactly what it is that we know, what we have intelligence about, so that when they make those decisions, it will be -- they will be informed decisions."}
{"original": "wallace: are you concerned when you hear mr. trump in that interview with the wall street journal already talking about a situation where he might lift sanctions?"}
{"original": "brennan: i think he has to be mindful that he does not yet have a full appreciation and understanding of what the implications are of going down that road, as well as making sure he understands what he's doing."}
{"original": "wallace: what are the implications of going down that road?"}
{"original": "brennan: well, when you look at what's happening in ukraine, and what's going on in syria, and what is happening in the cyber realm, i think mr. trump has to understand that absolving russia of the various actions that it's taken in the past number of years is a road that he i think needs to be very, very careful about moving down (ph)."}
{"original": "wallace: from your vantage point at langley, as director of the cia, what's the most immediate and pressing crisis? foreign policy, national security crisis that mr. trump will face?"}
{"original": "brennan: the problem is, the challenges that he is going to face numerous ones immediately. you have the problems of terrorism, clearly, the cyber challenge that we just are talking about in terms of elections and other types of cyber capabilities that other countries have."}
{"original": "north korea, increasing development of its nuclear and ballistic missile capability, instability that has wracked the middle east. there are so many issues that the new administration is going to have responsibility for on day one, and that's why we're trying to make sure that he and his team are fully briefed on all of these issues."}
{"original": "wallace: as you have heard, and i don't know if you're able to say this, but you're five days from leaving office. what do you think of his plan, of his prescriptions, what he saying about these various trouble spots, crises, challenges around the world?"}
{"original": "brennan: well, what i think mr. trump has to understand is that this is more than being about him and it's about the united states and our national security. and he has to make sure that now he's going to have the opportunity to do something for national security, as opposed to talking and tweeting, he's going to have tremendous responsibility to make sure that u.s. national security interests are protected and are advanced."}
{"original": "and so, i am very much hoping that he has some very good people that he has pulled together, jim mattis, mike pompeo, john kelly, and others. i think they are the ones that are going to be able to give him some wise counsel about what he needs to do and not be very spontaneous in his words and his actions. spontaneity is not something that protects national security interests. and so, therefore, when he speaks, when he reacts, just to make sure he understands that the implications and impact on the united states could be profound. again, it's more than just about mr. trump, and it's about the united states of america."}
{"original": "wallace: finally, you are ending eight years of service as one of president obama's top national security advisors, both in the white house and then also as cia director. what – looking back on these eight years, what is your greatest source of pride and what is your biggest regret?"}
{"original": "brennan: first, source of pride being part of an administration – part of an administration that really has tried to advance the interests of peace and stability around the world at a very challenging time, bringing bin laden to justice, being able to prevent a recurrence of an 9/11 attack here in the homeland. these were things that the administration and the government, as a whole, really did some great work."}
{"original": "regrets, when i look at the situation in syria, i think my heart and a lot of hearts bleeds over what has happened to that beautiful country. and i – i regret that we were not able to find a way to arrest the growth of violence and bloodshed there so that we could make sure that syria is going to have a future for the – at least the next generation of syrians. and that's the one area that i'm very – very regretful about."}
{"original": "wallace: very briefly, in – is there a policy that you now believe with hindsight could have worked to stop the – the carnage and –and interrupted the civil war?"}
{"original": "brennan: well, we – 20/20 hindsight is always, you know, quite clear. looking back now over the last six years, the way some developments happened, the growth of isil, isil wasn't – didn't exist at the time. i think a lot of countries, including the united states, could have been more aggressive and proactive in terms of what we should have done to – to prevent the – the deterioration into so much bloodshed in syria."}
{"original": "wallace: director brennan, thank you. thank you for your time. and we want to thank you for your years of service to this country, sir."}
{"original": "brennan: thank you, chris. thank you very much."}
{"original": "wallace: up next, we'll bring in our sunday group to discuss the russian intel and this week's confirmation hearings where mr. trump's top cabinet picks discuss some surprising disagreements with their new boss."}
{"original": "wallace: coming up, some of donald trump's cabinet nominees split with him on russia."}
{"original": "james mattis, defense secretary nominee: with mr. putin, we recognize that he is trying to break the north atlantic alliance."}
{"original": "mike pompeo, cia director nominee: russia has reasserted itself aggressively."}
{"original": "wallace: we'll ask our sunday panel what those different opinions mean for our foreign policy next on fox news sunday."}
{"original": "trump: a thing like that should have never been written, it should never have been had, and it should certainly never have been released."}
{"original": "pelosi: i always wondered, what did russia have on donald trump?"}
{"original": "wallace: mr. trump and house democratic leader nancy pelosi reacting very differently to that unverified russian dossier that supposedly has compromising information on the new president."}
{"original": "and it's time now for our sunday group. gerald seib, executive washington editor of the wall street journal, bob woodward from the washington post, former democratic congresswoman jane harman, director of the woodrow wilson center, and washington examiner contributor lisa boothe."}
{"original": "well, bob, what do you think – and this is something we discussed with both of our guests – of the way that the intelligence community handled the so-called russian dossier? and, overall, how do you think of the way they've handle donald trump?"}
{"original": "bob woodward, the washington post: i think what's underreported here is trump's point of view on it. and you laid it out when those former cia people said these things about trump, that he was a recruited, you know, agent of the russians."}
{"original": "woodward: yes, and a useful fool. i mean they started this. and in trump's mind, he knows the old adage, once a cia man, always a cia man. and no one came out and said those people shouldn't be saying things. so then act two is the briefing when this dossier is put out. i – i've lived in this world for 45 years where you get things and people make allegations. that is a garbage document. it never should have been presented in – as part of an intelligence briefing. as you suggested, other channels have the white house counsel give it to trump's incoming white house counsel."}
{"original": "so trump's right to be upset about that. and i think if you look at the real chronology and the nature of the battle here, those intelligence chiefs who were the best we've had, who were terrific and have done great work made a mistake here. and when people make mistakes, they should apologize."}
{"original": "wallace: well, let me bring in the former top democrat on the house intelligence committee, congresswoman harman."}
{"original": "yo know, there is this sense that – that – that an awful lot of information that the intelligence community developed about russia hacking, the garbage dossier, new phrase, that it got public. and – and can't you understand how donald trump would end up feeling like these guys are trying to knife them?"}
{"original": "jane harman, former u.s. congresswoman, d-cali: yes, i can understand that. but from the other side, i can understand that very careful and highly trained intelligence professionals think they're being dissed. john brennen just said that in hindsight he might have done some things differently. i agree with bob, there was another way to handle that salacious two page unsubstantiated dossier. but i think the intelligence community seriously has put out its case starting in early october when jeh johnson and i think it was mike rogers put out the case that there was russian hacking."}
{"original": "and i think it's important for donald trump and his good cabinet picks, dan coats and – and mike pompeo, to end this war, for two reasons. number one, we need –"}
{"original": "wallace: the war – the war, we should say, with the intelligence community."}
{"original": "harman: yes, yes, the war with the intelligence community, for two reasons. number one, we need these guys. they're on the front lines now in undisclosed locations. my – i have visited them all over the world. they're fabulous. we need them. we need truth to power. but the second reason is, we need our allies to have confidence in the trump intelligence relationship and not think that if they share information with us, which is crucial for us understanding threats to the united states, it won't be compromised in some way."}
{"original": "wallace: all right, i want to change dramatically."}
{"original": "gerry, you were one of the two reporters for the wall street journal that conducted that interview over the weekend with president-elect trump. how dramatically does it seem to you he wants to reshape our relations both with russia and china?"}
{"original": "gerald f. seib, the wall street journal: well, that's not clear, but what is clear is that the mindset is totally different. this is a -- everything is open for negotiation kind of an approach to the two biggest countries outside the u.s. in the world. the two most important, russia and china. and he literally said with china, everything is open to negotiation, including the one-china policy. this was the policy by which the u.s. has for years and years recognized beijing as the one and only true representative government of the people of china, not taiwan."}
{"original": "and on russia sanctions, he said, i'll keep the sanctions in place for a while, but we'll see how the russians behave. and it's very much a transactional kind of an approach to foreign policy. you're nice to us, we'll find ways to be nice to you, and vice versa. and it's going to be different. i mean people will argue the wisdom of it, but the one thing that's clear is that the mindset going in is going to be different."}
{"original": "wallace: the senate started holding confirmation hearings for trump's cabinet picks this week, and one of the things that everyone noticed is the sharp differences between the nominees and mr. trump. let's put some of them up on the screen."}
{"original": "there were real differences over the threats posed by russia, waterboarding, building a wall, and tearing up the iran nuclear deal with."}
{"original": "trump: my number one priority is to dismantle the disastrous deal with iran."}
{"original": "gen. james mattis, defense secretary nominee: it is an imperfect arms control agreement. it's not a friendship treaty. but when america gives her word, we have to live up to it and work with our allies."}
{"original": "wallace: lisa, are we headed for a constructive debate, divergent opinions in the trump cabinet, or we headed for chaos?"}
{"original": "lisa boothe, washington examiner contributor: i think we are. i mean, look, donald trump came –"}
{"original": "boothe: good point. no, i think it's going to be constructive, so to answer that for clarity sake. but, you know, look, i mean donald trump can't win here because he got a lot of criticism during the general election that he wouldn't take the advice of counsel, that he wouldn't take the advice of his advisor, but he has surrounded himself with some very smart and capable people, as the cia director pointed out in his interview with you as far as general mattis goes. and i think he'll have a lot more faith in the intelligence community when he does have some people there that he trusts, like someone like mike pompeo."}
{"original": "in regards to russia as well, i think the biggest problem here is the distrust, the erosion of trust in – in just institutions at large when you have the fact that the media reported something that the new york times said was very difficult to check. and even what could – can be checked is problematic when the fact that you have sitting members of congress saying that they're not going to recognize president-elect trump as the president because he is illegitimate. when you have individuals that are calling for the abolishment of the electoral college and we're calling for electors to defect. so i think the biggest problem that we are dealing with right now is the erosion of trust in all of the institutions, whether it's the intelligence community, the media, and the government at large."}
{"original": "wallace: all right. we're going to take a break here."}
{"original": "and it certainly is worth noting, i think that barack obama came into office on the same week with a – an approval rating in the 60s and donald trump's approval rating is in the 40s. so there is – everybody's at logger heads here in washington."}
{"original": "all right, we'll be back in a second."}
{"original": "when we come back, an inspector general announces he'll investigate possible misconduct in the way fbi director james comey handled the clinton e-mail investigation."}
{"original": "plus, what would you like to ask the panel about the ig probe? just go to facebook or twitter @foxnewssunday and we may use your question on the air."}
{"original": "james comey, fbi director: there is evidence that they were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information."}
{"original": "robby mook, former clinton campaign manager: if he has acted improperly and that the american people can no longer have faith in his ability to carry out justice, i think at that point someone should step down."}
{"original": "wallace: hillary clinton's former campaign manager questioning whether fbi director james comey violated fbi regulations in being so public about the clinton e-mail investigation. this after the justice department's inspector general announced he'll review comey's actions."}
{"original": "and we're back now with the panel."}
{"original": "well, bob, as someone who's had a lot of dealings with the fbi over the last 40, 45 years, did comey violate fbi regulations in going so public, and, frankly, should he step down?"}
{"original": "woodward: well, i mean, he's got almost no friends right now. lots of people are calling for his head. i – i – i wouldn't anticipate learning too much from this inspector general's investigation. he can't compel people to talk. and they'll say, oh, yes, that's confidential or that's connected to something classified."}
{"original": "i – i think trump and his people, having done reporting on this, have a lot of respect for comey on the issue of counterterrorism. the fbi has done a spectacular job in preventing the mass casualty attacks in this country, which were much anticipated after 9/11. so that – it – it may hang on that."}
{"original": "wallace: we asked you for questions for the panel and we got a bunch like this one from lillian murphy on twitter. i want to know why the ig is not questioning the tarmac meeting between bill clinton and attorney general lynch."}
{"original": "lisa, how do you answer lillian?"}
{"original": "boothe: i certainly agree. i think that should be under investigation. i'm glad to find as well that they will be looking at the fbi andrew mccabe whose wife was a recipient of money from one of the fbi individuals, from terry mcauliffe, who's closely connected to the clinton campaign."}
{"original": "blitzer: who was the governor of virginia and gave a lot of money to this – wife of the – who – she was running for office."}
{"original": "boothe: governor of virginia. exactly. and i think fbi director comey was set up to fail with all of this because any decision he had made from the start would have been met with extreme criticism. if he had recommended an indictment against hillary clinton, can you imagine how that would have gone over in this country? and, of course, loretta lynch tied his hands by setting out – or by meeting with president bill clinton on the tarmac of that plane. and i think this is a continued scapegoating from the left. and if they want to look for reasons why hillary clinton lost, look no further than the fact that they elected someone who was under investigation by the fbi to begin with, or the fact that she spent more money seeing one electoral vote in omaha, nebraska, on tv, than michigan and wisconsin combined."}
{"original": "wallace: almost lost in all of the talk about russia and the fbi this week is the fact that donald trump finally announced what his plan is to separate himself from the trump businesses. but the head of the office of government ethics immediately dismissed it. here he is."}
{"original": "walter shaub, jr., director, u.s. office of government ethics: the plan the president has announced doesn't meet the standards that the best of his nominees are meeting, and that every president in the past four decades has met."}
{"original": "wallace: congresswoman harman, the trumps do business around the world and – which raises the question, every time that he makes a decision, or his administration makes a decision about policy in one of those countries, does it raise the – the likelihood that people are going to say, well, that's to advance his business interests?"}
{"original": "harman: well, i think he wants his issue to be over. and in this town, appearance and reality are conflated. and i think he could do more – i'm sure gerry has some specific ideas – to stop this story."}
{"original": "i just want to say a couple words about comey. he certainly had my admiration for intervening in – in former attorney general ashcroft's hospital room to block a bush administration effort to ratify or renew some surveillance standards against the standard legal procedure. but in this case, the – his actions this last year to me are inexplicable. attorneys general are – or inspector general, are supposed to be independent. this guy maybe should investigate other actions of the justice department. but i think he's within bounds to want to investigate this. and this guy, we just checked it, could be replaced by donald trump if he chooses to replace him, comey, although he serves a 10 year term –"}
{"original": "wallace: right. so – so should – should –"}
{"original": "harman: as bill clinton replaced the then fbi director, bill sessions."}
{"original": "wallace: very quickly, should comey step down?"}
{"original": "harman: i think that's comey's call. should – i – and i – i don't pretend to make recommendations to donald trump."}
{"original": "well you shifted the question about the businesses."}
{"original": "gerry, what to think of this? i mean is this going to – you said – i think congresswoman harman's exactly right, he wanted to end the controversy. has he?"}
{"original": "seib: no, absolutely. this is going to be a continuing feature. there's no way around this. look, the issue here is that donald trump says, i've set up a trust. my sons are going to run the business. they're in charge of it. but the critics say it's not a blind trust. if you sons are running the business, you're not blind to that by any means."}
{"original": "the trump response to that is, these aren't liquid access. i'm not a guy who has a -- $100 million in stock. i own buildings and a brand. and you can't just sell that. if you sell all those things, it's a fire sale, the value that i've built up goes out the window automatically. that is the tension in this question. and it's not going to go away. and i think they realize it's not going to go away. they're going to live with it and everybody in town is going to have to question – deal with questions we haven't had to deal with before."}
{"original": "wallace: is there something reasonably that he could have done? i mean as – as – as somebody pointed out, he can't un-know the fact that he owns the trump tower or that, you know, un-know whether it – it still is in his property – his portfolio or not. what could he reasonably have done?"}
{"original": "seib: i think he could have legally separated himself from the trump organization more than he has. but he hasn't done that, and so we're – as i said, we're going to have to deal with that."}
{"original": "i think the other option would have been to take his family entirely out of the ownership and leadership of the – of the company, but that wasn't going to happen. this is the trump family, and so they weren't going to go there."}
{"original": "wallace: and i kind of wonder when he says he's not going to talk to his sons about the business, i'm thinking, boy, that's going to be an awkward holiday, huh? so, how – how about them redskins?"}
{"original": "woodward: every time the trump organization make some deal in – in the middle east, then people are going to be asking him, have you talked to your sons about this? how does he –"}
{"original": "wallace: well – well, in fairness he has said – he's said there are not going to be any new deals with foreign countries. but, you know what?"}
{"original": "thank you, panel. see you next sunday. to be continued."}
{"original": "up next, our power player of the week. the man donald trump picked to run his inauguration gives us a surprising preview."}
{"original": "wallace: a look at the national building museum, site of the salute to our armed services inaugural ball this friday."}
{"original": "whether you like him or not, donald trump always likes to do things big, but it turns out that's not how he wants his inauguration. here's our power player of the week."}
{"original": "tom barrack, chairman, presidential inaugural committee: we need to thank the people who were faithful to us, we need to encourage those who weren't, but do it simply, do it quickly, do it elegantly, and let's get back to work."}
{"original": "wallace (voice-over): tom barrack is chairman of the presidential inaugural committee, in charge of organizing 19 events over six days. and he says donald trump's marching orders may surprise some people."}
{"original": "barrack: in its simplicity, the idea is to organize what's already here and available, rather than focusing on a coronation of the man."}
{"original": "wallace (on camera): are you saying that donald trump wanted to deemphasize the celebration of his victory?"}
{"original": "barrack: he wanted to deemphasize at the celebration of him."}
{"original": "wallace (voice-over): but even a simple inauguration is a big deal. barrack has a staff of 360, backed by a security force of 35,000, handling events for as many as 750,000 people. he's running everything, except the swearing in ceremony."}
{"original": "barrack: it comes together just for that moment, to allow that peaceful transition of power. but it's – it's – it's quite an ordeal. it's putting on the olympics in 60 days."}
{"original": "trump: we're going to have a very, very elegant day. the 20th is going to be something that will be very, very special."}
{"original": "wallace (on camera): donald trump is a pretty good producer. how involved, how micro-managing has he been about this?"}
{"original": "barrack: he makes me crazy. i had blonde hair and blue eyes when this started. he wants to know the color of the napkins, where's the linen, how many people are coming, what's the play list."}
{"original": "barrack: yes. and i said, would – could you go back and just manage the free world and leave me alone?"}
{"original": "wallace (voice-over): one of the president-elect's ideas, do what andrew jackson did in the 1820s, open the white house to the public."}
{"original": "barrack: of course i had no idea what andrew jackson did. i went back and researched it and said, by the way, they absolutely –"}
{"original": "wallace (on camera): trashed the place."}
{"original": "barrack: trashed the place. so this – it – it –"}
{"original": "wallace: it's not a good idea."}
{"original": "barrack: it's not a great idea."}
{"original": "wallace (voice-over): but other ideas are going better."}
{"original": "where barack obama had ten inaugural balls in 2009, mr. trump said he only wanted three."}
{"original": "barrack: it's not appropriate after what we went through. we need a more healing kind of an inauguration. we don't need a celebration of me, the victor."}
{"original": "wallace: of course there will be protests, but barrack says as long as they're not violent, that's fine."}
{"original": "barrack: us remembering the dialogue is alive is a good thing, not a bad thing. and – and that comes from the president himself. so it's – it's people getting hurt that's the issue, not – not protest."}
{"original": "wallace: barrack and trump have been close for more than 30 years. barrack runs a private equity real estate firm with $58 billion in assets, but they've always known where to draw the line."}
{"original": "barrack: he's one of my best friends. and – and the reason i'm not going into the administration is i intend to keep it that way."}
{"original": "wallace: still, barrack is ready to defend his buddy."}
{"original": "barrack: what i tell everybody is, give him a chance. he's not even president yet."}
{"original": "wallace: but first things first, there's an inauguration to put on."}
{"original": "wallace (on camera): what's the weather forecast, which is the all-important thing, for friday, january 20th?"}
{"original": "wallace: and the forecast continues to be good weather on friday."}
{"original": "be sure to tune to this fox station for coverage of the inauguration anchored by shepard smith, or all day on fox news channel where i'll join bret baier and martha mccallum on the national mall."}

{"original": "president trump is picking a whole lot of fights in recent days, including one with a dead senator."}
{"original": "some of these are battles he should be engaging in, despite what much of the media say. and some are the kind he would be better off avoiding."}
{"original": "take, for instance, trump's involvement in the decision to ground the boeing plane that has been involved in two fatal crashes, the 737 max 8."}
{"original": "the washington post says it was extraordinary for a president to intervene in matters typically left to the faa or the department of transportation. and the story quotes a former dot secretary as saying barack obama was never involved in such safety decisions."}
{"original": "rather than simply being briefed by the faa, the post reports, trump played an active role, participating in phone calls with boeing chief executive dennis muilenburg and other stakeholders, and offering his thoughts about the aviation industry."}
{"original": "i don't know about you, but that's what i would want a president doing — not substituting his judgment for that of the experts but taking a hands-on role in crisis management. aviation safety is a crucial issue. and if a max 8 had crashed in the u.s., trump would have shouldered enormous political blame."}
{"original": "now there's an argument to be made that the president waited too long to ground the planes, acting after other major industrialized countries. maybe he was too solicitous toward boeing. and maybe the faa should have more tightly regulated the airline giant. recent reports about boeing dragging its feet on pilot training for the planes' new software — and a sensor that may have been sending the wrong signals to prevent stalling — suggest that the two crashes may have been avoidable."}
{"original": "but i'd argue trump's personal involvement is a good thing."}
{"original": "lordstown, ohio ponders life after general motors' departure"}
{"original": "i also have no problem with trump doing what used to be called jawboning to keep auto jobs in america. but he's taking some flak for blaming the latest plant closure on the united auto workers."}
{"original": "after gm shut down a factory in lordstown, ohio, trump tweeted: democrat uaw local 1112 president david green ought to get his act together and produce. g.m. let our country down, but other much better car companies are coming into the u.s. in droves. i want action on lordstown fast. stop complaining and get the job done! 3.8% unemployment!"}
{"original": "trump said he also called gm's ceo, mary barra: i am not happy that it is closed when everything else in our country is booming. i asked her to sell it or do something quickly. she blamed the uaw union — i don't care, i just want it open!"}
{"original": "but ultimately this was a business decision (though not final) by the automaker, which is moving away from small sedans like the chevrolet cruze, made at that plant, in favor of bigger cars. the lordstown plant workers agreed more than a decade ago that newly hired workers would be paid $20 an hour, not the standard $30. so the president's criticism seems like deflection."}
{"original": "and then there is john mccain. he and trump couldn't stand each other. but trump unloaded on him over the weekend, despite the fact that mccain died last august."}
{"original": "first, he lambasted the late arizona senator for giving the uncorroborated steele dossier to the fbi. trump quoted ken starr as saying this was unfortunately a very dark stain against john mccain. trump added:"}
{"original": "he had far worse 'stains' than this, including thumbs down on repeal and replace after years of campaigning to repeal and replace! and there was another shot against 'last in his class' (annapolis) john mccain."}
{"original": "click here to get the fox news app"}
{"original": "those tweets prompted stinging personal criticism from mccain's former aides and from his daughter meghan."}
{"original": "mccain, who often joked about being a poor student at the naval academy, was a controversial figure in the gop. the onetime nominee was a maverick who often took on his own party, starting with george w. bush. he did cast that late-night thumbs-down against abolishing obamacare, but that was the third repeal attempt that, if not for divisions among republicans, would never have come down to one vote."}
{"original": "but whether trump's grievances against mccain are justified is beside the point. he was a war hero who served his country for decades. he is no longer with us. perhaps it's time for the president to let it go."}
{"original": "democrats in washington are charging full speed ahead on a hastily crafted, nearly $2 trillion spending package."}
{"original": "the goal is to satisfy a political agenda and bail out political allies. the guise is covid-19 relief. regardless, their plan means tremendous harm to america's working-class. it is the wrong plan, at the wrong time, for all the wrong reasons."}
{"original": "on monday, the democrat majority on the house budget committee continued what has been a completely partisan process by holding debate and a vote on a legislative package that represented the work of nine separate committees two weeks earlier. during the nine committee markups that preceded monday's house budget committee activities, republicans offered 229 amendments. only two, or less than 1%, were adopted."}
{"original": "rep. lauren boebert: pelosi, schumer serving up pork – here's how they plan to fund their liberal wish list"}
{"original": "under the arcane budget process the democrat majority is using to jam through bad policy, no amendments could be offered during budget committee proceedings. what republicans did offer was a full-throated defense of america's working-class. there was much to discuss."}
{"original": "with $510 billion in spending, the democrat plan would bail out state and local governments, rewarding state and local officials who perpetuate painful lockdowns in their communities."}
{"original": "these lockdowns have meant the closure of more than 100,000 small businesses across the country. schools have yet to reopen, robbing kids of an education and their parents of time, money and security. worst of all, there are severe physical and mental scars that can come from keeping communities boarded up."}
{"original": "while rewarding policies at the local level that destroy jobs and harm working-class americans, the democrat plan would dispense its own share of economic pain from washington."}
{"original": "there is a $15 washington mandate that would make life harder for low-wage, disabled and less-educated workers. it would increase the cost of living – particularly damaging for seniors and others living on fixed incomes – and, according to the non-partisan congressional budget office, comes at the expense of 1.4 million jobs."}
{"original": "under the plan's further expansion of unemployment insurance, more than half of americans would earn more from an unemployment benefit than from a paycheck. increasing taxpayer subsidies for obamacare enrollees and establishing a form of universal basic income would lead to fewer hours worked in our economy."}
{"original": "these policies might sound nice, but they will be a disaster for working-class american families."}
{"original": "these policies might sound nice, but they will be a disaster for working-class american families."}
{"original": "economists – including prominent former clinton and obama appointee, larry summers – are saying all this spending is not needed to sustain the current trajectory of economic growth or compensate for a shortfall in economic output; not to mention the unintended long-term consequences for the american economy."}
{"original": "less than 9% of the spending in the bill would go toward combating covid-19 through public health measures like vaccinations, testing and tracking the virus. of the $130 billion in spending that democrats claim is desperately needed to reopen america's k-12 public schools, only 5% would occur this fiscal year – a clear sign that their urgency to notch some wins for their political base is not matched with an urgency to get schools open in the near future."}
{"original": "if it becomes law, the democrat plan would bring total covid-19 response spending to nearly $6 trillion – a sum larger than the economies of every nation on earth except the u.s. and china. spending on this scale is an open invitation to waste, fraud and abuse, and efforts to encourage more transparency have not been embraced by the biden administration."}
{"original": "click here to get the opinion newsletter"}
{"original": "it is estimated that nearly $1 trillion in existing covid-19 funding remains unspent. we recently introduced a resolution that would require president biden provide to congress a thorough and accurate accounting of any unspent covid-19 funding. such a simple measure of transparency ought to be a prerequisite before more is asked of american taxpayers."}
{"original": "there are reports the democrat leadership in the house may make further changes to the bill before congress votes on it, overruling even the work of the committees they control. rather than trying to make a bad plan more palatable to the razor-thin majority of votes they control in the house and senate, democrats ought to put these bad ideas back on the shelf and give working-class americans some relief."}

{"original": "new york democratic rep. hakeem jeffries, speaking at a martin luther king jr. day event in harlem on monday, derided president trump as the grand wizard of 1600 pennsylvania avenue, in fiery and combative remarks in front of many top democrats."}
{"original": "jeffries, who recently was elected chairman of the influential house democratic caucus, made the comment during his address to the national action network (nan) house of justice, where attendees also included potential presidential candidate sen. kirsten gillibrand, democratic new york city mayor bill de blasio, senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y., and liberal activist al sharpton."}
{"original": "these are challenging times in the united states of america. we have a hater in the white house. a 'birther-in-chief,' jeffries said as the crowd cheered, referring to trump's insistence in 2011 that then-president barack obama release his birth certificate. the grand wizard of 1600 pennsylvania avenue. one of the things that we've learned is that while jim crow may be dead, he's still got some nieces and nephews that are alive and well."}
{"original": "the grand wizard is a title that indicated the head of the racist hate group the ku klux klan. jim crow laws referred to post-reconstruction statutes that enforced racial discrimination."}
{"original": "one of the things that we need to do is learn from the lessons of dr. king and how he dealt with such hate in the '50s and '60s, jeffries continued. in 1963, i think it was the governor of alabama who rose in his inauguration speech and said, 'segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever.' and that was [former democratic alabama] gov. george wallace. but, dr. king showed us in that very same year, that when haters rise up, you don't run from the problem, you run toward the problem."}
{"original": "jeffries turned briefly to the ongoing partial federal government shutdown over border wall funding."}
{"original": "we are not going to give donald trump one dime for a border wall, jeffries said, calling it a 5th-century solution to a 21st-century problem."}
{"original": "he went on to say, as the crowd loudly clapped and cheered: if donald trump wants to build a wall, let him build it around 1600 pennsylvania avenue, so we don't have to be reminded of the long national nightmare that is the trump presidency."}
{"original": "sharpton, who posted photographs of the address on social media, wrote afterward that jeffries, 48, had delivered powerful remarks."}
{"original": "monday's episode was not the first time jeffries has used the racially charged epithet to refer to trump. last august, shortly after former trump aide omarosa manigault newman released secretly recorded white house tapes, jeffries tweeted that omarosa and cohen are crushing this guy (grand wizard of 1600 pennsylvania ave)."}

{"original": "conservatives have long believed individuals and businesses are better positioned to spend their own money and have fought the growth of government for many principled reasons."}
{"original": "these reasons include: opposition to the higher taxes and borrowing required to pay for spending; lower growth rates and opportunity costs incurred by removing resources from the private sector; inefficiency and corruption created by empowering politicians, unelected bureaucrats, and special interests to pick winners and losers and allocate resources; and decreased personal freedom and increased dependency that accompany a more powerful government."}
{"original": "trump modified the traditional conservative argument that the problem was government was doing too much for too many — and instead argued it was not doing enough for the right people."}
{"original": "trump expanded the definition of the deserving poor to include everyday working families whose wages had stagnated for years. democrats have long used similar arguments to enact universal social welfare programs. president obama cited the plight of working americans to include both medicaid expansion for the poor and exchange subsidies under obamacare for families earning up to 400% of the federal poverty level."}

{"original": "liberals argue that persistently low interest rates mean the government can afford to borrow and spend more, and that such investments are justified by exceptional hardships like the great recession, the coronavirus pandemic, growing inequality, and the opportunity to stimulate future growth through investments in clean energy, infrastructure and education."}

{"original": "obama raised taxes, spent nearly $1 trillion on a so-called stimulus plan, increased regulations and signed a new entitlement program known as obamacare. reagan did the opposite. he decreased taxes and continued deregulation. differences in results were stark. obama's recovery, according to the joint economic committee, averaged an inflation-adjusted gdp growth of 2.2 percent over the next 25 quarters."}
{"original": "the average recovery following post-1960 economic slowdowns, which lasted more than 12 months, is 3.9 percent. under president ronald reagan it was 4.8 percent. obama was the first president ever to preside over an economic recovery in which not a single year of the economy grew at least 3 percent."}
{"original": "obama's own economic team anticipated much higher growth. in february 2009, the obama administration published its analytical perspectives: budget of the u. s. government: fiscal year 2010. it said: the administration projects an economic recovery will begin in the second half of the year sparked by the american recovery and reinvestment act. by the end of the year, real growth is expected to have reached 3-1/2 percent at an annual rate, a pace that is maintained through 2010. in 2011-2013, the rate of growth in real gdp is projected to accelerate to around 4-1/2 percent annually for several quarters."}

{"original": "newsom unveiled his new health-care plan hours after a protester interrupted his swearing-in ceremony to protest the murder of police cpl. ronil singh shortly after christmas day. the suspect in singh's killing is an illegal immigrant with several prior arrests, and republicans have charged that so-called sanctuary state policies, like the ones newsom has championed, contributed to the murder by prohibiting state police from cooperating with federal immigration officials."}
{"original": "as one of his first orders of business, newsom -- who also on monday requested that the trump administration cooperate in the state's efforts to convert to a single-payer system, even as he bashed the white house as corrupt and immoral -- declared his intent to reinstate the obamacare individual mandate at the state level."}
{"original": "analysis: as california's progressive policies get crazier, what's the silver lining for the gop?"}
{"original": "the mandate forces individuals to purchase health care coverage or pay a fee that the supreme court described in 2012 as a tax, rather than a penalty that would have run afoul of congress' authority under the commerce clause of the constitution. last month, though, a federal judge in texas ruled the individual mandate no longer was a constitutional exercise of congress' taxing power because republicans had passed legislation eliminating the tax entirely -- a move, the judge said, that rendered the entire health-care law unworkable."}

{"original": "one day after sen. bernie sanders suspended his presidential campaign, presumptive democratic presidential nominee joe biden showcased new proposals to lower medicare eligibility to age 60 and forgive student loan debt for low-income and middle-class families."}
{"original": "in unveiling his plans, the former vice president on thursday credited the populist senator from vermont and his legions of progressive and younger supporters for his embracement of the proposals."}
{"original": "sanders ducks question on endorsing biden in first interview after suspending campaign"}
{"original": "senator sanders and his supporters can take pride in their work in laying the groundwork for these ideas, and i'm proud to adopt them as part of my campaign at this critical moment in responding to the coronavirus crisis, biden said in a release."}
{"original": "biden's plan for medicare -- the government-run health care system for those 65 and older -- would drop the eligibility age by five years, to 60. it would be available to those who work and retire before they turn 65 and those who are 60 or older and who want to leave their employer plans or health care coverage they've accessed through the affordable care act before they retire."}
{"original": "the campaign says the move would give older americans nearing the retirement age the ability to enjoy the benefits of the popular medicare program. and biden explained the proposal's additional costs would be financed out of general revenues to protect the medicare trust fund."}
{"original": "new polls indicate biden has the edge over trump in general election race"}
{"original": "the former vice president also emphasized that those who prefer to remain on their employer plans would be permitted to do so, and employers would have to comply with non-discrimination laws and would be prohibited from excluding older workers from coverage or otherwise try to push them out of their plans."}
{"original": "he added that the biden medicare-like public option that he's pushed on the campaign trail -- as well as subsidized private plans currently available to individuals through the obamacare health care exchanges -- would remain available."}
{"original": "the move is a significant step toward sanders' decades-old push for a government-run medicare-for-all single-payer health care system, which was the senator's signature domestic proposal in his 2020 presidential campaign. but it doesn't go as far as sanders's plan, which calls for phasing in all americans over a four-year period and phasing out private health insurance plans."}
{"original": "biden said that his other plan would forgive student loan debt for those earning under $125,000 who attended public colleges, historically black colleges or universities (known as hbcus) or private minority-serving institutions (known as msis)."}
{"original": "this concept i'm announcing today will align my student debt relief proposal with my forward-looking college tuition proposal, biden said. the federal government would pay the monthly payment in lieu of the borrower until the forgivable portion of the loan was paid off."}
{"original": "the latest from fox news on the 2020 presidential campaign"}
{"original": "biden's proposal isn't as comprehensive as sanders' plan to forgive all student debt, but it's a move in that direction. it also follows the former vice president's embracement two weeks ago of former democratic presidential candidate sen. elizabeth warren's proposal to also forgive up to $10,000 of anyone's student debt right as part of coronavirus relief."}
{"original": "the announcements by biden come as he courts sanders and his supporters in the hope of unifying the party as the former vice president challenges president trump in november's general election."}
{"original": "while suspending his campaign on wednesday, sanders refrained from endorsing the former vice president and emphasized that he'll remain on the democratic primary ballot going forward to assemble as many delegates as possible at the democratic convention where we will be able to exert significant influence over the party platform and other functions."}
{"original": "in an interview wednesday night on cbs' the late show with stephen colbert, sanders said: i hope to be able to work with joe to move him in a more progressive direction."}
{"original": "talks between the two teams to discuss areas of policy agreements are getting underway. the two campaigns continue to be engaged on a range of topics that would build on vice president biden's existing policy proposals and further our shared goals to move the country forward, a senior biden campaign official told fox news on thursday."}
{"original": "but if biden starts steering too far to the left, he'll invite a barrage of incoming fire from republicans that he's pushing a socialist agenda."}
{"original": "within moments of sanders' suspension on wednesday, the president's reelection campaign went up with a digital ad highlighting similarities between the presumptive nominee and the democratic socialist."}
{"original": "former new york city mayor michael bloomberg's late entry into the democratic presidential primary put him at a disadvantage compared to many candidates in the race. but the billionaire is using his vast fortune in an attempt to make up ground in super tuesday states, largely conceding the early states."}
{"original": "bloomberg was laid off from his job at 39 years old before starting his own very successful company, through which he has racked up a net worth of over $60 billion, according to forbes. after leaving his post as the new york city mayor (2002-2013), the democrat-turned-republican-turned-independent-turned-democrat became involved in political philanthropy, particularly on gun control — he founded everytown for gun safety in the wake of the sandy hook elementary school shooting."}
{"original": "here is where bloomberg stands on some of the issues that matter most to voters."}
{"original": "bloomberg takes a less radical route on health care than some of his democratic opponents by advocating for what he calls a medicare-like public option rather than a medicare-for-all, scheme which would outlaw private health insurance."}
{"original": "tucker carlson tells michael bloomberg: stop apologizing for your existence"}
{"original": "bloomberg's public option is similar to what former president obama pushed to include in the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, but did not have the votes in the senate to pass."}
{"original": "while bloomberg, unlike many other democratic candidates, has not said whether or not he would allow illegal immigrants to be covered by government-run health programs, he does include several other elements in his health proposals."}
{"original": "he would institute price caps for drugs at 120 percent of the average in other advanced nations, and put a cap on out-of-network medical bills at two times what the same services would cost through medicare."}
{"original": "bloomberg has been a major climate advocate and donor, ponying up large sums of cash to help various climate organizations. after president trump withdrew from the paris climate accords, bloomberg made up the funding gap at the u.n. climate change secretariat, giving the organization $10 million."}
{"original": "additionally, bloomberg dropped $500 million in an effort to end the use of coal-fired power plants last year, donating it to the organization beyond carbon, according to the new york times."}
{"original": "while it is unclear what his climate plan would cost taxpayers, bloomberg has supported a green new deal similar to the proposed resolution from rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y."}
{"original": "trump warns 2020 dems that bloomberg will turn his back on them"}
{"original": "bloomberg proposes a target date of 2050 for the united states to reach net-zero carbon emissions, which is on par with much of the democratic field."}
{"original": "bloomberg vows to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour, like almost the entire democratic primary field."}
{"original": "on taxes, the billionaire takes a more moderate stance than his primary opponents sen. elizabeth warren, d-mass., and sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., by not advocating for a wealth tax. a wealth tax is a levy on a person's or family's accumulated net worth rather than their income."}
{"original": "warren, for example, would hit families worth over $1 billion for 6 percent of their wealth each year and fix a 2 percent levy on all families worth over $50 million. bloomberg has said the policy just doesn't work. he has said, however, that he plans to raise taxes on wealthy people like me."}
{"original": "i raised taxes, and it turned out very well, bloomberg said at an event in phoenix last year. in the end, people weren't happy about a tax increase, but two years later, i did get reelected by a large amount."}
{"original": "in other initiatives, bloomberg says he will improve rural broadband access and send billions of dollars to communities across the nation to help create jobs and grow incomes."}
{"original": "bloomberg is a longtime supporter of a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants currently in the country, a policy that is supported by the vast majority of his primary rivals. he has also been a sharp critic of how trump is handling the immigration issue."}
{"original": "as president i will end trump's attempts to demonize and scapegoat refugees and immigrants, bloomberg tweeted in reaction to texas' decision to no longer accept refugees earlier this month, a move that was put on hold by a federal court."}
{"original": "additionally, he followed former new york city mayor rudy giuliani's policy of ensuring, confidentiality of immigration status for all people who interacted with the new york city government, so they would not be afraid to use city services. at the same time, however, bloomberg has panned sanctuary cities that forbid their police departments from sharing immigration information with federal authorities."}
{"original": "according to the washington free beacon, bloomberg told msnbc's morning joe in 2017, you cannot (...) have everybody deciding which laws they should obey. the law is the law."}
{"original": "marijuana activists have passionately spoken out against bloomberg, who is the only democratic presidential candidate to explicitly speak out against the legalization of marijuana."}
{"original": "he called legalization perhaps the stupidest thing anybody has ever done in early 2019, according to cnn. most candidates are calling for the federal legalization of the drug while some others would like to continue with the current u.s. policy of keeping the drug illegal federally, giving states room to legalize marijuana within their own borders."}
{"original": "like the rest of the democratic field, bloomberg is against the death penalty, previously calling it murder by the state, according to npr. additionally, bloomberg decried the florida supreme court's decision in january to force felons to pay all their court-ordered fees before their right to vote is returned."}

{"original": "if you've been incarcerated and served your time, you deserve to regain the fundamental right to vote, he tweeted."}

{"original": "president trump surprised most political observers when he won the 2016 presidential election and has presided over an administration that has been chaotic at times. he's managed to deliver on some of his 2016 campaign promises, while failing on some others, and is now making the case to voters on why they should give him four more years in the white house."}
{"original": "here is where trump stands on some of the top issues voters care about in the 2020 campaign."}
{"original": "one of the largest efforts the trump administration has undertaken on health care has been a move to repeal and replace the affordable care act (aca), although it has not been able to succeed as of yet."}
{"original": "after republicans in 2017 failed to repeal the aca, also known as obamacare, after taking control of both chambers of congress, the trump administration took another step in dismantling the aca -- removing the penalty associated with obamacare's individual mandate."}
{"original": "where does bernie sanders stand on the issues?"}
{"original": "later, the administration backed a lawsuit by several conservative states arguing that because the individual mandate no longer imposes a penalty, it cannot be read as a tax and the aca should be struck down as unconstitutional. the fifth circuit court of appeals recently remanded the case to a lower court, so it is unlikely to be resolved soon."}
{"original": "also on health care, the trump campaign touts its work to lower drug prices, including increasing the number of generic drugs approved by the fda."}
{"original": "to the surprise of many, trump has taken up the mantle of criminal justice reform, particularly on mass incarceration. he's worked with the likes of kim kardashian and kanye west on the issue and signed the first step act into law."}
{"original": "trump featured the frist step act in a super bowl ad, which touched on themes similar to those in his state of the union."}
{"original": "trump's support from african-americans will rise 50 percent or more, tim scott predicts"}
{"original": "while the president's ideas on criminal justice reform are unlikely to go as far as democrats would like in most areas, the fact he is doing something might get the attention of black voters in 2020, according to sen. tim scott, r-s.c."}
{"original": "it will go from 8 percent in 2016 to a minimum of 12 percent in 2020, scott told neil cavuto on fox news, referencing trump's potential vote share among african-americans. trump could even get support from as much as 15 percent of black voters, he said."}
{"original": "and that is 'game over,' he added."}
{"original": "the president's rhetoric on immigration has been a constant target for democratic presidential candidates, particularly his comments on drugs and illegal immigrant crime. but the president has been quite consistent on this issue since his 2016 campaign and is still trying to follow through on his campaign promise to build a wall on the u.s. southern border."}
{"original": "in january, for example, the trump administration announced it would reallocate $7.2 billion designated for the pentagon to build a border wall."}
{"original": "the administration then followed that move by waiving a group of laws requiring that the department of homeland security allow open competition for wall contracts, justify its contractor selections and secure bonds that protect the government from financial loss should the project not be completed correctly, among other things. the point of that move was to speed up the process of building the wall."}
{"original": "additionally, trump has worked to reduce the number of refugees entering the u.s., hire new border agents, deport illegal immigrants and more."}
{"original": "while democratic presidential candidates sound the alarm about climate change, trump has mostly brushed aside the concerns of environmentalists."}
{"original": "his administration began to withdraw from the paris climate agreement on the first day it was allowed to under the accord, sparking heated derision from climate activists. trump, however, argued that the accord protects the polluters, hurts americans, and cost a fortune."}
{"original": "where does joe biden stand on the issues?"}
{"original": "trump has also worked to build out america's oil and gas pipelines over the objections of environmentalists and began to allow oil and gas drilling on federal lands."}
{"original": "many of these actions have led the trump administration to be targeted in lawsuits by state attorneys general, with some using attorneys funded by 2020 democratic presidential candidate michael bloomberg to pursue their climate litigation."}
{"original": "trump has presided over a mostly strong economy, passing the tax cuts and jobs act and cutting regulations in an effort to make the u.s. more attractive to businesses."}
{"original": "he does not support a minimum wage increase, unlike most democrats, who have said that the federal government should raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour."}
{"original": "click here to get the fox news app"}
{"original": "trump has also pushed for new trade deals with other countries, worrying some in the republican party who are more supportive of free trade. his biggest accomplishment in this area has been a trade deal replacing the north american free trade agreement, called the united states, mexico, canada agreement."}
{"original": "trump has yet, however, to come to such a comprehensive agreement with china, and a back-and-forth tariff battle between the two countries has hurt some american industries that rely on trade with china."}

{"original": "maine remained too close to call wednesday morning."}
{"original": "super tuesday's mixed bag of results leave no doubt that the next three months will be an extremely bumpy ride for the democrats. both biden and sanders are deeply flawed candidates running against an incumbent president with a long list of consequential accomplishments under his belt."}

{"original": "in the democratic primaries and caucuses, a candidate needs to win at least 15 percent of the vote in a congressional district or statewide to pick up any delegates to the democratic national convention. at this writing, it's undetermined how many delegates each candidate will get."}
{"original": "among the super tuesday states, california is the biggest prize by far with 415 pledged delegates at stake, followed by texas with 228. next in line is north carolina with 110, followed by virginia with 99, massachusetts with 91, minnesota with 75, colorado with 67, tennessee with 64, alabama with 52, oklahoma with 37, arkansas with 31, utah with 29, maine with 24, vermont with 16, democrats abroad with 13 and american samoa with 6."}

{"original": "just how much personal cash bloomberg will have flushed down the toilet by the time the counting finally ends is anyone's guess. the bloomberg blunder is the latest reminder to the anti-citizens united left that candidates and ideas matter and big money doesn't buy elections."}

{"original": "the bloomberg campaign's lasting legacy will be that the american people are too smart to let someone buy their democracy with flashy television commercials."}
{"original": "bloomberg's epic meltdown, coupled with sen. elizabeth warren's monumental failure to prevail anywhere – even in her home state of massachusetts – means that it's decision time for these two dying candidacies."}
{"original": "will bloomberg the businessman cut his huge losses and drop out to endorse joe biden? will warren drop out and endorse sanders in an attempt to become his running mate?"}
{"original": "but the big elephant in the room remains bloomberg's giant checkbook. will he use it to help biden defeat sanders, or keep spending on his own hopeless candidacy?"}
{"original": "and if sanders becomes the democratic presidential nominee will he honor his pledge not to accept money from bloomberg?"}
{"original": "establishment democrats are desperate to deny socialist sanders the requisite 1,991 delegates needed to clinch the nomination on the first ballot."}
{"original": "if no candidate hits that number on the first ballot, 771 super delegates – unpledged elected officials, party leaders and former officials – can vote for any candidate they want, regardless of primary results. once super delegates vote, it will take 2,375 votes to capture the democratic presidential nomination."}
{"original": "with the super tuesday results amounting to essentially a split decision between biden and sanders, liberal washington swamp creatures now have a glimmer of hope in their quest to block the radical sanders from becoming their nominee."}
{"original": "contests later this month in the critically important states of michigan (march 10), and florida and ohio (march 17) will become ground zero for the democratic establishment's push to rob sanders of his second party nomination in a row."}
{"original": "while the results of super tuesday will certainly provide the biden campaign with a much-needed shot in the arm, the reality is that biden is a poor candidate who can barely get out of his own way."}
{"original": "rarely a day passes without an embarrassing biden gaffe or misstatement. because of biden's lackluster behavior on the campaign trail, attempting to derail the energy-packed sanders campaign is a big risk for power brokers within the democratic establishment."}

{"original": "the american people – and just about all our elected officials – frequently and justifiably complain about the high cost of health care. but unless congress acts, a tax increase on medical devices will take effect jan. 1 and needlessly raise those costs even higher."}
{"original": "the 2.3 percent tax on medical devices was signed into law by president obama and took effect in 2013. fortunately, congress passed legislation in 2015 and again in 2017 to temporarily suspend the tax. however, without further congressional action the tax will kick back in at the beginning of 2020."}
{"original": "because the tax is only 2.3 percent it may sound like an insignificant amount. it's not. some medical devices are very expensive – for example, an mri machine can cost up to $3 million. the 2.3 percent tax on that would amount to $69,000 – a cost that has to be ultimately paid by someone."}
{"original": "medical companies brace for 'devastating' obamacare tax, prepare for layoffs"}
{"original": "fortunately, patients may get a reprieve. sens. pat toomey, r-pa., and amy klobuchar, d-minn. (a candidate for the democratic presidential nomination) recently introduced a bipartisan bill permanently repealing the tax on medical devices."}
{"original": "repealing the tax would make health care and health insurance more affordable for all americans. the repeal deserves support from both democrats and republicans in congress."}
{"original": "one reason you haven't heard more objections to this tax is that most americans don't even know it exists."}
{"original": "repealing the tax would make health care and health insurance more affordable for all americans."}
{"original": "pacific research institute scholar wayne winegarden notes that the tax has been priced into the costs of the product and has been applied inconsistently across products due to exemptions and short-term suspensions, which create difficulties for firms to plan and manage the tax; and, subjects some medical devices to double taxation."}
{"original": "of course, repealing this tax is just the tip of the iceberg in terms of what's needed to reform america's dysfunctional health care system. but piecemeal changes can resuscitate the push for wider reforms. just because lawmakers can't agree on everything needed to improve our health care system doesn't mean they shouldn't agree on anything."}
{"original": "patients in need of health care would hardly be the only victims of a medical device tax. during the original implementation of the tax from 2013 to 2015, more than 20,000 industry jobs were lost as companies faced nearly $30 billion in lower sales."}
{"original": "for medical device manufacturers big and small, stagnant sales led to less research into innovative products that can save lives. with fewer products sold, reduced access for patients and less innovation, new technologies were prevented from coming to market. everyone suffered as a result."}

{"original": "and according to her, her government knows best. not you, not we, not the american people. not the people who risk, reward, incentive, and create goods and services that make our lives easier and better, that people want, need, and desire. she and her colleagues know better, which is a pretty disturbing concept because she actually had a business. we found out she owes nearly $1,900 in back taxes over her small defunct business that she founded in 2012."}

{"original": "adapted from sean hannity's monologue from hannity on march 11, 2019."}
{"original": "this is a rush transcript from hannity, november 25, 2016. this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated."}
{"original": "sean hannity, host: and welcome to this special edition of hannity: donald trump's promises. now, tonight for the hour, we're going to take you through the very specific policy issues that president-elect donald trump pledged to you, the american people that he will act on once he's sworn in as the next commander-in-chief."}
{"original": "now, over the course of the presidential campaign, we had the pleasure of interviewing donald trump many times on this program, and he laid out a very specific agenda to fix america's problems and address the challenges this country faces."}
{"original": "we're going to have highlights of those big interviews, but first -- donald trump campaigned all across the country speaking directly to you, the american people, about what he will do as the next president. let's take a look."}
{"original": "donald trump, r-presidential nominee: i am officially running for president of the united states, and we are going to make our country great again!"}
{"original": "we now have isis in 32 countries all over the world. we're going to knock them out. we have no choice. we're going to knock them out, folks."}
{"original": "real change begins with immediately repealing and replacing obama care, a disaster."}
{"original": "a trump administration will also secure and defend the borders of the united states. we will build a great wall."}
{"original": "we are going to save the 2nd amendment, which is totally under siege and appoint justices to the united states supreme court who will uphold and defend the constitution of the united states."}
{"original": "our jobs are taken just like nothing because our politicians are stupid people. they don't know what to do!"}
{"original": "hannity: now, one of the top issues that donald trump talked about this election was fixing america's broken immigration system and securing the borders. let's take a look at how mr. trump promised to address those issues."}
{"original": "hannity: let's start with, i guess, your signature issue on immigration, which is you're going to build the wall."}
{"original": "hannity: who's going to pay for the wall?"}
{"original": "trump: ... what has been interesting that i've been watching over the last week or two, and they've been saying, oh, well, maybe he won't build the wall, maybe he won't..."}
{"original": "hannity: jeb bush said that. jeb bush said, he'll never build the wall."}
{"original": "trump: oh, he said that a long time ago. i think..."}
{"original": "trump: i think people now realize we're building the wall, it's going to happen, it's 100 percent simple. you know, i tell the story all the time, the great wall of china, 13,000 miles long. this is 1,000 miles and we have caterpillar tractors to build, ok?"}
{"original": "this is 1,000 miles -- it's 2,000, but we need 1,000. and it's so easy to do. and it gets higher and higher and higher every time somebody says i'm not going to build it."}
{"original": "hannity: here's an important question. i think the time for -- if you get elected president of the united states of america, how..."}
{"original": "hannity: according to the crowd, when..."}
{"original": "hannity: yes. but here's my question."}
{"original": "hannity: how long -- how long would it take you to build that wall start to finish? you're a builder."}
{"original": "trump: yes, i'm very good at it, almost immediately. now, if you would believe it -- you know, they were going to build the wall a while ago, not so long ago, like in '06. and they couldn't get environmental impact statements, can you believe it? ok?"}
{"original": "trump: now, we got lucky because it is such -- it was such a little wall, it was such a nothing wall -- no, they couldn't get their environmental -- probably a snake was in the way or a toad or..."}
{"original": "hannity: a turtle, could have been a turtle."}
{"original": "trump: ... or something that you've probably never heard of."}
{"original": "trump: but something was in the way. and you think of china, in the south china sea, they're building this massive fortress. they're building this massive military fortress. and they're digging that water, they're digging, digging."}
{"original": "and you know what happened? they said, let's do it on sunday, and on monday morning, they started. so in our case, look, that wall is going to start very quickly. i got, as you know -- and we have a lot of the border patrol..."}
{"original": "trump: we have a lot of the border patrol agents here tonight. and we have 16,500 border patrol agents. they know the border better than anybody. their job is much easier without trump because all they have to do is let everyone just keep going by."}
{"original": "these are unbelievable people. they see what's happening. they see what's coming in. and they want it stopped. they want -- look, they want people to come in, but they want the people to be vetted."}
{"original": "so here's the story. so they endorsed me. first time in the history of the border patrol agents that they've endorsed (inaudible)"}
{"original": "trump: one other thing we have to say, and mexico will pay for the wall. they're going to pay for the wall."}
{"original": "hannity: let me ask you this. vicente fox and the -- by the way, the current president of mexico said he would meet with you. will you meet with him?"}
{"original": "trump: yes, sure. i'd meet with him."}
{"original": "trump: absolutely, i'd meet with him."}
{"original": "hannity: how do you -- they're not going to write you a check. how do you get them to pay for the wall?"}
{"original": "trump: well, there are many ways. look, look, on trade, they're absolutely killing us. they're killing us. they're killing us at the border. they're killing us on trade. we have a trade deficit with mexico of close to $60 billion a year."}
{"original": "so right there, you can build a wall because the wall is a fraction of that. so you know, right there."}
{"original": "trump: we are losing -- we lose a fortune on trade. and that doesn't include the drugs that are pouring across the border, which is probably double or triple or something, so..."}
{"original": "hannity: i have covered the border now for years on this program. i've been from the rio grande to san diego and everywhere in between 12 times."}
{"original": "hannity: i've been down to the -- i've seen drug warehouses. i have seen tunnels. we'll show some of the pictures."}
{"original": "my next question is -- and this is where you seem to in the last week be revisiting the issue of sending everybody back that is here illegally. tell us where you stand on that."}
{"original": "trump: we want to follow the laws. you know, we have very strong laws."}
{"original": "trump: we have very strong laws in this country. and i don't know if you know, but bush and even obama sends people back. now, we can be more aggressive in that, but we want to follow the laws. if you start going around trying to make new laws in this country, it's a process that's brutal. we want to follow the laws of the country. and if we follow the laws, we can do what we have to do."}
{"original": "trump: sean, let me tell you -- so important. we've got some great people in this country. they shouldn't be here. they're still great people, all right? but we've got some really, really bad gang members and some horrible people."}
{"original": "trump: those people are going out day one! they're going to be the first order i sign. they're going out day one!"}
{"original": "hannity: all right, but i know this question has come up a lot. what about people that work hard, have been here a long time, they own homes, they have their property. and this is a question everyone is going to want answered. what about them? do they have to go back or would you reconsider that?"}
{"original": "trump: we are going to follow the laws of the country, sean."}
{"original": "hannity: that means they go back."}
{"original": "trump: we are going to follow the laws. and we're going to see who people are. we're going to see how they've done. do you believe in a merit system, sean? when people come in, as an example, do you believe in a merit system?"}
{"original": "trump: one of the things that's very unfair with leaving people is that you have years and years of people waiting on line. they've gone through a process, and they've -- they've filed..."}
{"original": "trump: legally. they've filed. and they're great people in some cases. i guess in some cases, maybe not. but you have really great people wanting and so proudly wanting to come into our country. and now what you'd be doing is you'd take people away from that line. and it's really sort of unfair."}
{"original": "hannity: is there any part of the law that you might be able to change that would accommodate those people that contribute to society, have been law-abiding, have kids here? would there be any room in your mind, or are you -- because i know you had a meeting this week."}
{"original": "trump: i did. i did. i had a meeting with great people, great hispanic leaders. and there certainly can be a softening because we're not looking to hurt people. we want people -- we have some great people in this country. we have some great, great people in this country."}
{"original": "so but we're going to follow the laws of this country."}
{"original": "trump: and you know, what people don't realize -- what people don't realize, we have very, very strong laws."}
{"original": "hannity: yes, but obama doesn't follow them."}
{"original": "trump: nobody understands that. no, they don't follow them."}
{"original": "trump: but we're going to follow the laws."}
{"original": "hannity: we have 11.3 million illegal immigrants in the country now. now, you said immediately last night, all criminal aliens out, day one, correct?"}
{"original": "hannity: all right, now -- by the way..."}
{"original": "trump: that one's so simple. you know, there are some things where you sort of feel bad and you -- this one would be -- we have these killers in this country."}
{"original": "trump: they're heading up gangs. you go out exactly..."}
{"original": "hannity: they lost (inaudible) children right here behind you."}
{"original": "trump: i mean, those guys, if we ever find them, if i'm president, oh!"}
{"original": "trump: trouble. trouble. such trouble. and you know, the other thing is, you're doing to bring up some border patrol folks and they're incredible people, but it's so hard for the police to -- if somebody's protected between the sanctuary city nonsense -- we got to get rid of sanctuary cities. we're protecting these people."}
{"original": "hannity: and coming up next on this special edition of hannity..."}
{"original": "trump: as part of our plan to bring back jobs, we are going to lower taxes on american business from 35 percent to 15 percent. we will become a rich nation again."}
{"original": "hannity: donald trump -- he promised you, the american people, that he will fix the economy and create millions of new jobs. we're going to show you his plan to do just that."}
{"original": "trump: we're going to get isis out. we have no choice. we're going to get them the hell out. we're going to knock them out."}
{"original": "trump: going to happen a lot faster. it'll happen a lot faster than people think."}
{"original": "hannity: president-elect trump -- he pledged to voters that he will take out isis and defeat radical islamic terror. that and much more as this special edition of hannity, donald trump's promises, continues."}
{"original": "trump: if a company wants to fire their workers, move to another country and then try to ship their products back into the united states, where we will now have a very, very strong border, we will apply a 35 percent tax on all of those goods. and you know what's going to happen? those companies will never leave."}
{"original": "as part of our plan to bring back jobs, we are going to lower taxes on american business from 35 percent to 15 percent. we will become a rich nation again."}
{"original": "hannity: and welcome back to this special edition of hannity, trump's promises. now, that was president-elect donald trump on the campaign trail promising to cut taxes and keep jobs right here in the u.s. and over the course of the campaign, he told me how he plans to do it. let's take a look."}
{"original": "hannity: i have asked you this question about the economy before -- 95 million americans out of the labor force, 50 million in poverty, 46 million on food stamps. you know what a bad economy is, right?"}
{"original": "hannity: and we've doubled the national debt"}
{"original": "hannity: and i think the question is how do we fix this and how fast can you do it?"}
{"original": "trump: ok, we can do it fast. we have to bring our jobs back, and we have to stop jobs from leaving. every day, you read about companies great companies -- sean, right? every day, we're reading about companies, great companies, pfizer, great pharmaceutical companies moving to ireland. a lot of companies are moving to mexico. i mean, mexico's like china, little smaller version."}
{"original": "trump: oh, we're going to build the wall. who's going to pay for the wall?"}
{"original": "trump: we're going to build the wall, believe me. we're building the wall. you know, with mexico, we have a trade deficit of $58 billion a year..."}
{"original": "trump: ... $58 billion -- or china, $505 billion. and we're going to stop all that. and we have the greatest -- you know many of them, and you know they're friends of mine and have endorsed me, carl icahn..."}
{"original": "hannity: what -- but how do we get..."}
{"original": "trump: we're going to get the greatest negotiators and redo..."}
{"original": "hannity: is that enough to get americans back to work?"}
{"original": "trump: oh, it's going to be so good. it's -- we're losing -- we're losing all of our jobs, folks! we're losing so much. and what they do is monetary manipulations. they devalue their currencies to such an extend -- and they're grand masters, and we have people in washington, they don't know what's happening to us."}
{"original": "you take a look kamatsu (ph) in japan. they make tractors. look what they're doing to caterpillar. i mean, so many companies are just absolutely (inaudible)"}
{"original": "hannity: you said we're headed for a massive recession."}
{"original": "trump: if i'm not elected. if i'm not elected."}
{"original": "hannity: i have friends in this audience here tonight, and this city..."}
{"original": "hannity: really do. but this city, with the steel industry has gone through, an economic transformation and difficult times, and i know that this is representative of a lot of america. and i know that probably everybody here wants to hear how, specifically, are you going to help them so they can save money and pay for college and get a new car and live in a safe house in a nice neighborhood."}
{"original": "trump: so our jobs are being taken away from us like we're -- like taking candy from a baby. i use the expression, like taking candy from a baby. we have people that are incompetent running our country. we don't know what we're doing. our jobs are going to mexico. china is dumping steel all over the place -- by the way, all over the world, just so you feel better. but china is dumping -- dumping steel. your steel mills -- i see what's going on. this was the steel capital of the world by far, nothing close. and now i see what they're doing."}
{"original": "trump: and you know, before i came today -- because i'm making a speech where we have thousands and thousands of people right after this, and i said, give me some statistics. and it's unbelievable how you've lost your manufacturing jobs. you've lost your steel jobs. you look at what's happened with u.s. steel and all these great companies, these once -- you know, these incredible companies."}
{"original": "and it's being taken because of devaluation, all of the devaluations. it makes it impossible -- it makes it impossible for the companies to compete. and we're losing our jobs. companies are moving to mexico. mexico's becoming the new china."}
{"original": "trump: and we've got to stop this, and we're going to stop it."}
{"original": "trump: and what they're doing -- what they're doing, especially in asia, but especially china -- you look at what they're doing with the dumping. but forget the dumping. what they're doing with devaluation of their currencies is just unbelievable!"}
{"original": "and we have people that don't do anything about it because our politicians are all taken care of by lobbyists and special interests, and they're told not to do anything."}
{"original": "trump: not that they're stupid. they're told not to do anything."}
{"original": "hannity: but i guess where the -- i guess it's a razor's edge in some ways because you're saying you're going to negotiate free and fair deals. but ok, let's say we limit some of the imports from china, vietnam, depending on what the product happens to be. that also means american consumers are going to end up paying more."}
{"original": "hannity: how do you manage that?"}
{"original": "trump: because we're going to have more jobs. and you know what? you may pay a little bit more, but you're going to have better jobs and you're going to have more jobs! people never say that!"}
{"original": "trump: you know, these people that don't know what they're doing -- you know, i'm a free trader, ok? but the problem with free trade is you have to have leaders on your side that know what the hell's going on. they don't know what's going on! and we don't have those leaders. we have leaders that don't have a clue."}
{"original": "you look at what's happening -- you know, i use the -- it's just one company. i hate to pick on them all the time, but i talk about ford. i talk about nabisco. i talk about carrier air conditioner. they're moving to mexico. they let go of 1,400 people, wonderful people. i watched it. i watched it on screen."}
{"original": "hannity: so when they want to bring their products back, what do we do?"}
{"original": "trump: we do nothing. we let them come in, no tax, no nothing. they fire everybody. they move to mexico. they make their air conditioners. they sell them across the border, which now is going to be a very strong border, folks, by the way."}
{"original": "hannity: let me go back to the economy because this is so important -- 95 million americans out of the labor force, 50 million -- this is not a joke. we all know people in poverty. we all know people on food stamps."}
{"original": "you know, it used to be, in my radio career early on, if anyone lost their job, i can get them a job. i can't get them a job anymore. so the question is between trade, what else? in other words, how many jobs can we create by becoming energy-independent?"}
{"original": "trump: do you know how many millions of jobs have been taken out of our country? and this area's a primary -- you know, another area where we're really concerned -- you look at upstate new york. it's devastation. it's devastation. that's why i go up there. we had 21,000 people in albany the other night, two nights ago. we have -- 6,000, 7,000 people is, like, a routine crowd. these people are desperate for jobs, and they want their businesses back."}
{"original": "and by the way, a thing that's never mentioned -- rules and regulations. they put regulations on people and businesses that make it impossible for us to compete! and you look at the people we're competing against -- they have no regulations. so we're ..."}
{"original": "hannity: do you think -- let me go back to this side. if you become president, it's your first day in office -- i hate the fact that we rely on countries that hate our guts for energy, which is the lifeblood of our economy."}
{"original": "hannity: so my question is, how quickly could we be an energy-independent country?"}
{"original": "trump: well, very quickly. i mean, we have technology today that allows us to do things. as an example, in this state, they have decimated your coal mines. they have decimated your workers."}
{"original": "trump: they have decimated -- and you know, you have things called clean coal. you know what we do? first of all, the mines are almost -- they're going to be gone. they're going to be extinct, and they shouldn't be. coal is great. you know, we have 1,000..."}
{"original": "trump: we have 1,000 -- listen to this, though -- 1,000-year and probably more supply of coal for energy. and we're not allowing to use it. and you know what we do with it? we send it to china, and china uses it, ok? the little that we produce now. i'm going to open them up, and we're going to have clean coal. we all want clean coal. we're going to have clean coal. but we're going to open the mines up. in west virginia, it's devastated because of what they've done. parts of pennsylvania are devastated."}
{"original": "hannity: we're the saudi arabia of natural gas. we have more than any other country."}
{"original": "trump: we have so much, but we can have that..."}
{"original": "trump: we should have everything! we should have everything, including renewables. look, the problem with the renewables -- look, i know more about renewables than any human being on earth because i understand it from-- you know, from..."}
{"original": "trump: i love solar. solar's great. the problem is, it's a 30-year payback! you know, you -- it isn't..."}
{"original": "trump: it's, like, weak. it's not there yet. it's a 30 -- somebody said, oh, it's really wonderful, 32-year payback. who's going to get 32-year payback? and it doesn't have big power."}
{"original": "hannity: are there millions of jobs -- for example, for people in this crowd, are there millions of jobs in the energy sector if we commit as a country to energy independence?"}
{"original": "trump: yes, there's millions of jobs in everything! we're losing everything!"}
{"original": "hannity: would you like those jobs?"}
{"original": "hannity: coming up next on this special edition of hannity..."}
{"original": "trump: we're going to get isis out. we have no choice. we're going to get them the hell out."}
{"original": "trump: we're going to knock them out. going to happen a lot faster."}
{"original": "it'll be happening a lot faster than people think."}
{"original": "hannity: president-elect donald trump vowed on the campaign trail that he will defeat isis as our next commander-in-chief."}
{"original": "trump: i'm asking for you vote so we can repeal and replace obama care"}
{"original": "and save health care for every family in north carolina."}
{"original": "hannity: donald trump promised that he will repeal and replace obamacare. how will he do it? that and much more on this special edition of hannity: donald trump's promises, straight ahead."}
{"original": "trump: hillary clinton wants a 550 percent increase in syrian refugees pouring into our country."}
{"original": "trump: her plan will import generations of terrorists, extremism and radicalism into your schools and throughout your communities. we will suspend the syrian refugee program, and we will keep radical islamic terrorists the hell out of our country!"}
{"original": "trump: we're going to get isis out. we have no choice. we're going to get them the hell out. we're going to knock them out."}
{"original": "trump: going to happen a lot faster. it will happen a lot faster than people think. got to get rid of them. but we're going to start winning again as a country. we don't win anymore. we're going to start winning again."}
{"original": "hannity: donald trump promising to destroy isis. and during the presidential campaign, i asked mr. trump about isis, as well as his plan for vetting refugees and immigrants who want to enter this country. let's take a look."}
{"original": "hannity: isis, homeland security -- i'm sure everyone worries about the next 9/11 god forbid ever happens to this country. how do we defeat them? and do you think we need boots on the ground?"}
{"original": "trump: look, we got to knock them out. now, i was not -- i was not, and i've said it loudly, i was -- i am the most militaristic person in this room, other than maybe tony (ph). tony might be bigger."}
{"original": "trump: but i will tell you -- and i believe so strongly. but we have to know what to do, when to do it. we should not have been in iraq. we destabilized the middle east. now, then we got out wrong. obama got us out so badly when he announced a date and he announced we're going to move"}
{"original": "-- i mean, who ever heard of a thing like this? so we got out very badly. we should have left people behind. we should have had a lot of other things."}
{"original": "but we're going to knock out isis so fast. and we have to be a little bit unpredictable. you know, sean is saying -- and i do, i have a specific thing, but we have to be a little bit unpredictable, sean. i'm so tired of saying, well, we're going to attack them from here, we're going to attack from -- don't worry about it."}
{"original": "hannity: you don't want to telegraph it."}
{"original": "trump: i don't want to talk about it! i want to just do it!"}
{"original": "hannity: i am nervous for our children and our grandchildren. there's a cute little girl in the front row here that i talked to earlier. and she brought up about the safety and security of our country. specifically, you have said we're going to bomb the -- out of isis."}
{"original": "hannity: do you really believe -- do you think it's going to take boots on the ground? do you think we're going to have to send guys back? do you think this is an ongoing war that's going last for generations?"}
{"original": "trump: well, first of all, you know, i was very, very strong on people coming into this country and nobody wanted to mention it, nobody wanted to talk about it."}
{"original": "trump: and i was very, very strong. and, you know, we're going to have to get a lot tougher, a lot smarter, a lot more vigilant. otherwise, we're going to have problems like you've never seen before. you know, we used to have armies, you'd fight japan, or you'd fight germany. they had uniforms on. now we have people, we don't know who they are. we're letting thousands and thousands of people in our country right now. they have no documentation. there's no paperwork. nobody knows who they are. they could be isis. some might be isis. we better be really careful."}
{"original": "and i can tell you, the people that are coming into the country, sadly, they're going to have to go out because we have no idea..."}
{"original": "trump: we have no idea what we're doing. we have no idea. so -- and they're coming from syria. and you know, i spoke with a lot of great experts in terms of safety and borders. and they say there's absolutely no idea to judge when you don't have any documents. now, isis is also now making passports. you saw that. they stole the passport machines. so they're now making passports."}
{"original": "these are very slick customers. we're going to have to knock the hell out of them. i will say this -- i will say this."}
{"original": "trump: i don't want to put people -- we've spent, probably if you add it up, probably $5 trillion over there. in the meantime our country is falling apart, our infrastructure is falling apart. i was against the war in iraq right from the beginning, but they shouldn't have gotten out the way they got out."}
{"original": "hannity: you said take the oil."}
{"original": "trump: i said take the oil. i said take the oil. i wrote about usama bin laden in a book that was published two years before the world trade center."}
{"original": "hannity: and you talked about brussels ahead of time."}
{"original": "trump: i said about brussels, oh, the new york times, they killed me. i talked about brussels. i said five months ago, brussels is a hellhole. and the new york times did a major story, what right do i have to say that. but then they had the problem."}
{"original": "hannity: is bombing do you think going to be enough or is it going to be a combination? and is it one of those cases where america it seems always has to do the heavy lifting?"}
{"original": "trump: let me just tell you. if we had leadership, we could get other people with the boots. you have the courage. you have people that are willing to fight, but we don't arm the right people. we don't give the kurds what they want. but we give other people, and a bullet is fired in the air and they run."}
{"original": "i have a friend whose son is over there three sessions. i mean, he's been over there for a long time."}
{"original": "trump: and you know he comes back. he says the saddest thing is when the enemy has better equipment than we have. and you know where they get it. we give it to people, we don't know who we're giving it to. a bullet is fire fired in the air, they run, and the enemy, isis or whoever it may be, takes the equipment and they now have better and more modern equipment than we do. and we're the one that put it over there. and one of the things we have to do, we have to take their wealth away. we're not taking their wealth away. we're not bombing. we're sending leaflets down. in an hour we may be bombing your truck. please remove yourself. we don't know what we're doing."}

{"original": "trump: somebody said to me what is your view on trade? i said, it's doing good deals for the united states. it's a very simple view. and if you can call it conservative, call it whatever you want. so with the judges they are saying what happens if he appoints the wrong judges? what we did, we just took a list of judges, and i thought what i would do is put this forward. and this would be the list i would either choose from or pick people very close in terms of the spirit and the meaning of what they represent. and of course justice scalia is mentioned in here as right up front as being just one of our great judges and one of our great justices."}
{"original": "hannity: this is your judicial philosophy. one of the things i think people have questioned, i've interviewed you a lot during this process, and you gave me very specific things. and one of the top things i would ask you often is your judicial philosophy, and you mentioned, as i said, scalia and thomas. they are what we call originalists, constitutionalists."}

{"original": "hannity: this is interesting because i think there might have been some people, i've talked to people on the radio show, and some people said donald trump is a recent convert to conservatism. and i asked you very specific questions. for example, you say you want a balanced budget. you actually told me once it's immoral to steal from our kids."}

{"original": "a divided supreme court ruled tuesday that illegal immigrants who use someone else's information when filling out tax forms for employment can face criminal charges, despite federal laws that liberal justices claim should prohibit such cases."}
{"original": "the immigration control and reform act (irca) makes it a federal crime to lie on the i-9 work authorization form, while limiting how the false information can be used. federal law also says information contained in the i-9 cannot be used for law enforcement other than specified exceptions -- but the supreme court ruled that if workers use the same information in tax documents, they can face charges."}
{"original": "supreme court set to argue important election-year abortion case"}
{"original": "although irca expressly regulates the use of i–9's and documents appended to that form, no provision of irca directly addresses the use of other documents, such as federal and state tax-withholding forms, that an employee may complete upon beginning a new job, justice samuel alito wrote in the court's opinion, which was joined by fellow conservatives clarence thomas, john roberts, neil gorsuch, and brett kavanaugh."}
{"original": "the irca also prohibits state or local charges or civil cases against those who employ, or recruit or refer for a fee for employment, unauthorized aliens, but alito noted that this makes no mention of state or local laws that impose criminal or civil sanctions on employees or applicants for employment."}
{"original": "in the case of kansas v. garcia, three immigrants who are in the u.s. illegally used someone else's social security number on their i-9 forms, as well as on tax-withholding forms. they argued that state prosecutors improperly used information from their i-9 forms. the state dropped charges that relied on those forms and agreed not to use them during their trials, while claiming that the law does not prevent them from using their use of false social security numbers on tax documents."}
{"original": "all three were convicted, and all three convictions were upheld by the kansas court of appeals before the kansas supreme court reversed the decisions. the kansas supreme court ruled that charges were improper because [t]he fact that this information was included in the w–4 and k–4 did not alter the fact that it was also part of the i–9."}
{"original": "alito found this logic to be faulty, claiming that it was overly restrictive."}
{"original": "taken at face value, this theory would mean that no information placed on an i–9— including an employee's name, residence address, date of birth, telephone number, and e-mail address—could ever be used by any entity or person for any reason, he wrote."}
{"original": "alito noted that the defense used a broader interpretation of the law, claiming that it preempts state or local laws relating to the federal employment verification system. he noted that this approach still fails because while tax-withholding forms may typically be completed at the same time as i-9 forms, they have nothing to do with employment verification and serve entirely different functions."}
{"original": "supreme court agrees to review obamacare challenge over funding mechanism"}
{"original": "justice stephen breyer authored an opinion that agreed with alito that irca does not expressly preempt state criminal laws in this case. but maintained that there is still an implied preemption."}
{"original": "[i]n my view, irca's text, together with its structure, context, and purpose, make it 'clear and manifest' that congress has occupied at least the narrow field of policing fraud committed to demonstrate federal work authorization, breyer said in his opinion, which was joined by justices ruth bader ginsburg, sonia sotomayor, and elena kagan."}
{"original": "even though irca criminalizes that conduct, the act makes clear that only the federal government may prosecute people for misrepresenting their federal work-authorization status, he continued."}
{"original": "breyer also countered alito's argument that i-9 information can be used in prosecutions if the information appears elsewhere, asserting that if this were the case, states could easily form a loophole by creating their own work authorization form with the same requirements as the i–9, requiring employees to submit that form at the same time as the i–9, and prosecuting employees who make misrepresentations on the state form."}

{"original": "acronym also has picked up funding from at least one dark money group. the new venture fund gave acronym $250,000 in 2018 and is one of a number of nonprofit groups controlled by arabella advisors -- a washington-based philanthropy company. both araballa and new venture fund were founded by eric kessler, who worked in president bill clinton's administration."}
{"original": "arabella has been alleged to be behind a hydra-like network that blurs the line between philanthropy and political advocacy on hot-button issues, and has brought in hundreds of millions of dollars to advance left-wing causes. a report last year by the conservative watchdog capital research center said that due to financial arrangements and lack of donor disclosure it is impossible to know which organizations subsidize the various campaigns and political movements spawned by arabella's funds."}
{"original": "some on twitter noted that according to fec records, pete buttigieg's campaign also paid shadow over $40,000 last year for software. however, there is no indication of impropriety from the buttigieg campaign or bias toward buttigieg from shadow, as independent consultants and contractors like shadow often work with several different political organizations to provide technology or other services."}

{"original": "there was extraordinary heroism on jan. 6 by capitol police officers. the plainclothes uscp officer who fired a solitary shot, defending the speaker's lobby. otherwise, the mob may very well have stormed the house chamber with members still inside. officer eugene goodman baited marauders up a senate staircase – as senators escaped out the back door."}
{"original": "the fact that security officials evacuated the entire u.s. senate from the chamber may be the greatest success story of the jan. 6 attacks. the capitol is just a building. congress is comprised of people. uscp officers protected the members."}
{"original": "but what precautions must congress implement to protect the capitol after the inauguration is done? echoes of the jan. 6 calamity will resonate for a long time. is congress only safe if they secure the capitol with a cavalcade of armored personnel carriers and a wall strung with razor wire? it's not like someone just flips a switch on jan. 21 and the threat is over. the mob revealed just how vulnerable the capitol is."}
{"original": "what about the threat on feb. 13? or march 3? or april 10?"}
{"original": "more importantly, do the measures which remain constitute little more than security theater? and how does this affect the press corps? reporters are the eyes and ears of the public, watching congress, during one of the most volatile periods in american history since reconstruction."}
{"original": "the speaker's lobby behind the house chamber is where reporters talk up aides and lawmakers. officials shuttered the speaker's lobby to the press due to the pandemic. one wonders if the speaker's lobby will re-open once the pandemic subsides. that's where the uscp officer fired his shot. and, what happens with the use of magnetometers now erected at the doorways to the house chamber and speaker's lobby?"}
{"original": "new video shows maga mob rifling through paperwork in senate chamber as they hunt down nancy pelosi"}
{"original": "here's a perfect example of how unevenly they apply congressional security rules."}
{"original": "there's a longstanding directive that any man, be it a lawmaker, aide, or journalist, entering the speaker's lobby, must wear a coat and tie. no one can cite a specific house rule codifying this sartorial mandate. the closest representation of this policy is an annotation in the house rulebook stemming from something house speaker tip o'neill, d-mass., uttered from the chair about proper attire in the 1970s."}
{"original": "but congressional security officials allow lawmakers to hustle in and out of the chamber all the time in bomber jackets, blue jeans and tennis shoes to vote. they run completely afoul of this rule. chamber security personnel never stop them. but if you're a reporter without a coat and tie, you may as well be in violation of the treaty of paris."}
{"original": "so, the de facto impact? members can wear pretty much anything they want. but who has a dress code? the press."}
{"original": "here's another glaring example of how officials treated reporters in the heat of battle on jan. 6."}
{"original": "house chamber security finally evacuated everyone from the room on jan. 6. lawmakers. aides. journalists. they hustled all of the lawmakers to a secure location. but once they squirreled the lawmakers inside, reporters were left to fend for themselves. uscp made them find shelter on their own while invaders roamed the congressional halls."}
{"original": "there is now an epic fight over whether lawmakers must comply with uscp directives and pass through magnetometers when entering the house chamber. many republicans got into shouting matches with uscp officers or simply walked around the devices. house speaker nancy pelosi plans fines for members who don't comply. but it remains to be seen how stringently the house will enforce this policy."}
{"original": "it's important to see if uscp requires lawmakers to actually pass through the metal detectors in the future. or will this be like the dress code rule? lawmakers are off the hook. but reporters have to pass through the magnetometers to enter the press gallery?"}
{"original": "reporters didn't attack the capitol on jan. 6. but watch to see if going forward they treat the press corps like they're two ticks shy of boko haram."}
{"original": "congressional reporters are used to this kind of treatment. security officials hassle the press corps constantly. stand behind that rope line. don't point your camera there. don't get too close to senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., because you might give him coronavirus."}

{"original": "house democrats released a far-reaching universal health care bill on wednesday that would extend medicare to every american, creating a costly single-payer health care system."}
{"original": "the bill is being sponsored by rep. pramila jayapal, d-wash., and cosponsored by 107 members of the house."}
{"original": "according to jayapal, the ambitious, bold legislation will ensure that every american has the health care they deserve by ending medicare's eligibility age, currently set at 65, and eliminating all insurance copays, deductibles, and premiums. the proposal would also cover the cost of prescription drugs, substance abuse, dental, and maternal care."}
{"original": "bernie sanders says 'no' to americans who want to keep private insurance under 'medicare-for-all'"}
{"original": "these are, indeed, bold promises, but why should americans trust liberal promises about health care after years of failing to deliver on the promises they made the last time the party overhauled health care?"}
{"original": "democrats' newest pledge to fix america's health care system comes just one week after a new analysis by the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) thoroughly debunked one of the biggest myths democrats peddled while successfully blocking republicans from repealing and replacing obamacare in 2017."}
{"original": "while republicans sought to repeal and replace obamacare in 2017, democrats routinely alleged that any legislation passed by republicans would result in 14 million [jh2] americans losing their health coverage in the first year following obamacare's demise, a number they said would balloon to 24 million over 10 years. the widely-used 14 million and 24 million estimates came from an analysis of republicans' health care reform plans conducted by the congressional budget office, which scores proposed legislation using measures many have long known result in faulty conclusions."}
{"original": "with the cbo figures in hand, democrats successfully scuttled obamacare repeal legislation and several gop replacement plans by scaring millions of americans into believing that any attempt to replace obamacare would result in disaster. however, republicans did manage to effectively eliminate the individual mandate penalty—by reducing it to $0—when they passed tax reform legislation. although the mandate penalty was reduced to $0 in december 2017, it didn't go into effect until the 2019 enrollment period."}
{"original": "democrats have proven repeatedly that government bureaucrats can't effectively manage the health care system—or anything, for that matter."}
{"original": "now that obamacare open enrollment for 2019 has ended and sign-up data has been fully analyzed, cms says the 14 million estimate used to scare americans and a small number of congressional republicans was way off. instead, cms reports only an additional 2.5 million [jh3] americans will be uninsured in 2019 as a result of the elimination of the individual mandate penalty, and virtually all of them have chosen to go uninsured."}
{"original": "you can add the 14 million claim to the long list of failed predictions and faulty promises made by democrats over the past decade."}
{"original": "first, americans were told by president barack obama and the democrat-led congress of 2009 and 2010 that obamacare would allow every american to keep the doctors and health insurance plans they liked. within a few years of obamacare's passage, millions of people had lost their health insurance and their doctors."}
{"original": "president obama also told[jh4] americans they would save as much as $2,500 per year under the affordable care act. since the aca went into effect, premiums have doubled[jh5] and deductibles have skyrocketed."}
{"original": "democrats also promised obamacare would make health insurance markets more competitive, but obamacare's costly mandates have pushed many health insurers out of obamacare markets, leaving people with very few health insurance options available. in 2019, americans in 77 percent of u.s. counties only have one or two insurance options available in their obamacare exchange."}
{"original": "after years of making the u.s. health care system worse, democrats are now asking you to give them the keys to the entire health care kingdom, while at the same time admitting they aren't sure how they'll pay for their gigantic medicare-for-all plan. the mercatus center estimates the cost of sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., single-payer proposal, which is similar to the one now offered by house democrats, would cost $32 trillion in its first 10 years—and that's a conservative estimate. (just a reminder: the federal government is already $22 trillion in debt, with no plans to balance the budget.)"}

{"original": "when it comes down to the brass tacks of governing, or the hard work of creating something that actually functions, the left isn't capable or even really interested; their main goal is to simply gain power and will use whatever fraud they can to achieve that goal."}
{"original": "in the midst of the remarkable turn of events in iowa, the very next night was mr. trump's much-anticipated state of the union address. with a theme of the great american comeback, the president touted his success over the last three years with the economy, justice reform, and moving people up and out of poverty. it was an optimistic, forward-looking speech with a view of his hopes for the country. there were no references to or shots at the democrats for the galling impeachment effort."}
{"original": "mr. trump's restraint served as a perfect juxtaposition to the shocking behavior of mrs. pelosi throughout the evening."}

{"original": "at the end of the speech, in an unexpected and appalling action, mrs. pelosi picked up her copy of the president's speech and began tearing it apart in a manner meant specifically for television cameras to capture."}
{"original": "mrs. pelosi's action was one of extraordinary pettiness and the behavior of a woman broken, defeated and small. what an awful and ignominious collapse for her. in the aftermath, democrats are likely disappointed they can't blame this on a coding error."}
{"original": "the reaction to the speech-ripping was quick. republican rep. steve scalise of louisiana tweeted, this speech was about american heroes and american workers. she decided that was worth literally tearing apart. absolutely disgraceful."}
{"original": "the white house tweet reminded us about the americans honored in his speech: pelosi just ripped up: one of our last surviving tuskegee airmen. the survival of a child born at 21 weeks. the mourning families of rocky jones and kayla mueller. a service member's reunion with his family. that's her legacy."}
{"original": "overall, the last week has been an education for the american people as a whole and a rolling disaster for a confused and flailing democratic party. no doubt mrs. pelosi and her enablers were hoping to impact how mr. trump was viewed. they succeeded. gallup has found the president's approval ratings hit an all-time high during the impeachment trial, in part because of higher ratings among both republicans and independents."}

{"original": "the polling firm also determined, as trump's job approval rating has improved, so has the image of the republican party. now, 51% of americans view the republican party favorably, up from 43% in september. it is the first time gop favorability has exceeded 50% since 2005."}
{"original": "the president ended his state of the union address by saying, the best is yet to come. that couldn't be more true as the democrats continue to remind the american people about how much is at stake in november."}

{"original": "sean hannity, host: welcome to hannity."}
{"original": "we begin tonight with a fox news alert -- three, two, one, it is 9:00 in the east. it is 6:00 out in the west coast, 352 delegates are up for grabs in six states tonight in the democratic primary."}
{"original": "fox news is projecting joe biden will win missouri and mississippi. polls have just now finally closed in michigan. and fox news can make a call in that race. my opening monologue in just a minute."}
{"original": "but, first, we head to our decision desk. bret and martha standing by with the big news."}
{"original": "bret baier, fox news anchor: hey, sean, it is 9:00 in new york. and fox news decision can now project that vice president, former vice president joe biden, will beat vermont senator bernie sanders in the crucial state of michigan, which sanders won, of course, four years ago."}
{"original": "martha maccallum, fox news anchor: it is the biggest victory of the night for biden who earlier, as you said, sean, won mississippi and also missouri. the fox projection is based on our polling of both early voters and those who cast their ballots today, as well as data from sample precincts."}
{"original": "we're going to be back with updates throughout the evening and we will have an 11:00 p.m. roundup of all of the election news tonight, sean, as we send it back to you."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. bret and martha, thank you."}
{"original": "we now bring in our own bill hemmer now for who is going to -- who is going to be impacted delegate-wise in terms of the delegate count. you get to 15 percent, it's proportionate distribution of delegates."}
{"original": "bill, what do you got? bill hemmer is somewhere."}
{"original": "bill hemmer, fox news anchor: sean, i can hear you. you want to hang with me a moment here?"}
{"original": "hemmer: i'm going to tell you a story. ok? tell you a story that i'm seeing here that is very significant for people to understand."}
{"original": "i'll take you to michigan. i want you to focus on two things, sean. this is right now, your 41 percent of the vote, biden, we've already called for him over bernie sanders. but this is where sanders is underperforming and biden is over-performing."}
{"original": "very significant, too, this is washtenaw county, university of michigan. bernie sanders was there saturday night, 15,000 people. the congresswoman, aoc, was there as well. bernie is 49 percent over joe biden. but four years ago, this is where sanders was in the same county. he was at 55 percent. he's 5 percent underperforming at the moment, four years later."}
{"original": "this is detroit, wayne county. oakland county is just north other, suburbs, critical in the fall, right? we talk about the suburbs in virginia, the suburbs out of detroit. joe biden is almost at 50 percent of the vote there in oakland county. four years ago, hillary clinton was doing 51 percent."}
{"original": "again, biden is overperforming in some of these critical areas in michigan. now, hang with me a moment, sean, ok? because here is your calendar in march. in two weeks, you have the georgia primary, 105 delegates in two weeks."}
{"original": "next week, we have some big ones, too. you got arizona, florida, illinois and ohio. florida is the biggest one of all next tuesday at 219 delegates. here's what we find in terms of polling in florida. as of today, sean, in the state of florida, joe biden is clocking 61 percent. even if it's not accurate, if it's close to being accurate, you can make a fair argument for the following way the race is -- the race is shaping up today."}
{"original": "all of this area in the southeast, we called mississippi for joe biden. look what he did in alabama, 63 percent of the vote there. ten days ago, remember, sean, it was only ten days ago, south carolina. ten days ago he was almost 50 percent of the vote in south carolina."}
{"original": "my point is you can now start to make an argument for georgia in two weeks, maybe florida next week and the whole part of this country goes joe biden's way. it's starting to shape up a race in favor of the former vice president in a significant way."}
{"original": "he's outperforming bernie sanders in places where he should not if sanders wants to catch up -- sean."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. great analysis. bill hemmer at our big board. we'll be checking in throughout the evening."}
{"original": "that tells the story tonight. we'll bring you those live updates throughout the hour as this critical primary night does unfold. as it stands now, quid pro quo joe has pretty much cemented his frontrunner status over bolshevik bernie sanders."}
{"original": "but joe biden is struggling. there's no doubt in anybody's mind. everybody sees it. the media mob and democratic party may try to ignore it. it is now official and it is beyond alarming if we're going to be honest and truthful as a country."}
{"original": "frankly, it's even hard to watch. the confusion, the inability to finish thoughts, the never-ending daily gaffes, the bursts of outrage and anger should concern every american tonight, as it looks like he will be the democratic nominee. and this should be regardless of any political view."}
{"original": "we now on multiple occasions, he's now forgotten barack obama's name. he confused his wife for his sister. he called super tuesday super thursday. he mixed up chris wallace for chuck todd, which was an insult to chris wallace."}
{"original": "he said that 150 million americans died from gun violence. not true. he told a crowd in south carolina he was running for the senate. and i can go on and on."}
{"original": "as a matter of fact, well, we have examples just from the past few weeks. we have our list. it's ongoing. you can read it at the side of your screen."}
{"original": "now, he cannot control his agitation. and this became apparent again earlier today. totally enraged joe biden when a construction worker at an auto plant dared to ask him about this clip. we're going to show you the clip first because it turns out, the construction worker at the auto plant was right about biden talking about taking assault rifles."}
{"original": "here's the clip that proves the guy is right which we'll play in a second."}
{"original": "unidentified male: so to gun owners out there that say a biden administration means they're coming for my guns."}
{"original": "joe biden, d-presidential candidate: bingo, you're right if you have an assault weapon. the fact of the matter is, they should be illegal, period."}
{"original": "hannity: illegal, period, he said it. so, maybe biden again just doesn't remember saying that. he only said it in august of 2019."}
{"original": "maybe he doesn't remember that he recently anointed bozo beto o'rourke to lead his gun confiscation policy. remember, bozo is the same guy who said hell yes, we're going to take your ar-15s, or in joe's case, 14s."}
{"original": "and yes, maybe biden doesn't remember or maybe just can't control his temper, whatever the case may be, what i'm about to show you should be concerning to every american. this is one incident of many incidents that have been taking place. take a look."}
{"original": "worker: you are actively trying to end our second amendment right and take away our guns."}
{"original": "biden: you're full of (expletive deleted)"}
{"original": "hannity: you're full of -- the only problem is, the construction worker at an auto plant was 1,000 percent right. his point is valid. and joe says he's full of beep and he wants his vote. and then aggressively he shushed his staffer."}
{"original": "now, watch this part. and that's not all. take a look."}
{"original": "biden: i support the second amendment. the second amendment -- just like right now, if you yelled fire, that's not free speech."}
{"original": "from the very beginning -- i have a shotgun, i have a 20-gauge, a 12-gauge. my sons hunt."}
{"original": "guess what? you're not allowed to own any weapon. i'm not taking your gun away at all."}
{"original": "hannity: joe biden comparing the second amendment to yelling fire in a crowded room, uses an absurd liberal talking point. oh, my sons love hunting and then says he's not trying to take away any guns when he was on tape saying that exact same thing, which then he immediately contradicts. watch this."}
{"original": "biden: wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. take your ar-14s away."}
{"original": "worker: ok. this is no ok, all right."}
{"original": "biden: don't tell me that -- go outside with me."}
{"original": "worker: you're working for me, man."}
{"original": "biden: i'm not working for you. give me a break, man. don't be such a horse's (expletive deleted)"}
{"original": "in all my life, i thought that i owned ar-15s. i didn't know they were 14s."}
{"original": "what you just saw was the frontrunner of the democratic party, their likely presidential candidate, shushing a woman that appears to be on his staff. by the way, who kind of seems to be trying to help him get out of another troubling situation."}
{"original": "great way to treat people, trying to save you from yourself, joe."}
{"original": "and then sticking his finger in the face of a construction worker at an auto plant calling him a horse's ass saying that he's full of bleep."}
{"original": "and according to one cbc reporter on the scene, biden even threatened to slap the man. on top of it all, you just heard it, he can't distinguish between an ar-15 and 14. i don't have 14s. i have 15s."}
{"original": "staff tried to rush him out of the room. shush, get out of the way."}
{"original": "normally, maybe not a big deal. but with joe, it is now cumulatively a huge deal. this type of agitated behavior is part of an increasing, disturbing pattern."}
{"original": "in the past few months, he's called, let's see, one voter fat, a damn liar. called a young woman a dog faced pony soldier. that's the tip of the iceberg. we have tape of all of it."}
{"original": "biden: iowa is a democratic caucus. you ever been to a caucus?"}
{"original": "no, you haven't. you're a lying dog faced pony soldier. you said you are, but -- now you got to be honest. i'm going to be honest with you."}
{"original": "you're a damn liar, man. that's not true. nobody has ever said that. you want to check my shape? let's do pushups together, man. let's do whatever you want to do."}
{"original": "you said i set up my son to work in an oil company. isn't that what you said? get your words straight, jack."}
{"original": "look, fat, look, here's the deal -- here's the deal."}
{"original": "unidentified male: we have to stop building and replacing pipelines."}
{"original": "biden: you have to go vote for someone else."}
{"original": "hannity: go vote for someone else. new campaign slogan. now, does that seem like the behavior of a grounded, balanced, lucid individual? because joe 30330 or on other occasions, joe 233 -- better get it right, 30330, is running for the hardest, the most demanding, the most powerful job in the world. there's no harder job than being the president of the united states of america."}
{"original": "so i'll ask again, does this 77-year-old guy we're watching every day now, does he have the stamina, does he have the strength, does he have the focus, does he have the alertness, does he have the mental focus, mental toughness and even the mental stability to be president? it's a fair question."}
{"original": "is this how he's going to treat world leaders? quid pro joe kind of looks frail to me. is he going to invite putin to a fight or pushup context or even little rocket man? because i think, frankly, anyone will be able to kick his ass."}
{"original": "now, it's so bad that the biden campaign, they are trying to cover for quid pro quo joe. they're trying to keep him out of the public spotlight. in other words, they're hiding him from the world."}
{"original": "a great campaign strategy. hide your candidate. we can't trust what he's going to do or say. this is a disaster."}
{"original": "according to the washington post, during his rally in st. louis this weekend, biden spoke for a whopping seven minutes. seven minutes. i can see people waiting in line for hours to hear that in kansas city. he spoke for, wow, 12 minutes."}
{"original": "and his longest speech of the weekend, it didn't hit the 15-minute mark. his big rally tonight in ohio was cancelled after the campaign cited coronavirus concerns, although he will speak at a separate event in philadelphia."}
{"original": "by the way, like father like son, hunter biden, he is using the coronavirus as an excuse. remember, he denied paternity in a case down in arkansas. now, he's skipping out of child support hearing in arkansas because of the coronavirus."}
{"original": "i would argue it's probably because he doesn't want to turn over his finances. that would expose him in the burisma case and the china case, and whatever other countries was paying him millions with zero experience. and, by the way, arkansas currently has zero cases of corona."}
{"original": "we get back to quid pro quo joe. right now, he cannot be trusted to speak more than seven minutes by his own campaign. and that seven minutes with a teleprompter. he wants to lead the free world."}
{"original": "let's pause. let's take that in. let's think about that. now, of course, when quid pro quo joe actually does hold an event more than seven minutes, it's a struggle. every time a struggle is guaranteed to ensue."}
{"original": "for example, monday's rally in detroit became totally derailed after an interruption from a few anti-nafta protesters. take a look."}
{"original": "biden: i didn't -- are you a donald trump?"}
{"original": "that's all right. let him go. it's not a trump rally. it's not a trump rally. let him go. let him go. let him go."}
{"original": "the bernie bros are here. let him go. folks, folks, let him go. that's ok."}
{"original": "hannity: herein lies another serious problem for quid pro quo joe. he can't hide from what is a real horrific track record."}
{"original": "look at your screen. here's a few of joe's top accomplishments. let's see. nafta, disastrous trade deal. oh, giving mullahs that chant death to america, yes, let's give them $150 billion in cash and other currencies."}
{"original": "remember obamacare? he brags about obamacare. millions lost their doctors, millions lost their plans. we have 37 percent of the country that only has one exchange -- obama exchange care option. that's it."}
{"original": "and our premiums, average family, did you save $2,500 on average? no. we're all paying almost 200 percent more."}
{"original": "and let's not forget the horrific economic track record. i tell it often, 13 million more americans food stamps, eight million more in poverty, lowest labor participation rate since the 70s. then, of course, we have the lowest homeownership rate in 50 years, we have the worst recovery since the '40s, more debt than the four previous administrations combined."}
{"original": "not a good record compared to eight million new jobs under trump. all new trade deals, we got the wall being built, we got promises made and kept on all those trade deals and guess what? america is doing better than ever, record low unemployment for every demographic in this country."}
{"original": "now, by the way, an attack against the administration over a virus, apparently, that's fair game. and don't forget that around 17,000 americans, yes, they died from h1n1. that was the swine flu virus. that was handled, you got it, under biden-obama."}
{"original": "now, biden also voted in favor of the iraq war, but he did an interview and he told lawrence o'donnell over at msdnc, state-run conspiracy television, he did vote for a war to prevent a war from happening. he voted for a war to make a war from happening. excuse me? take a look."}
{"original": "biden: the reason i voted the way i did was to try to prevent a war from happening because remember, the threat was the go to war. the argument was because saddam hussein had weapons of mass destruction. so he said that i need to be able to get the security council to agree to send in inspectors to put pressure on saddam to find out whether or not he's using -- he's producing nuclear weapons."}
{"original": "at the time, i said, that's your reason? all right. i get it. that was the -- the rationale was, that's the way not to go to war, because i didn't believe he had those nuclear weapons."}
{"original": "hannity: i voted for a war so we wouldn't have a war. ok."}
{"original": "now, it doesn't matter how short biden's speeches get. he can't hide from his horrific track record. he can't hide from the fact that you're not getting a billion unless you fire the prosecutor investigating my zero experience son hunter who, by the way, was paid millions. he can't hide the investigation ongoing that is happening in ukraine. donald trump had nothing to do with it."}
{"original": "it's also happening with senator ron johnson in the u.s. senate. and, by the way, how many other millions of dollars did zero experience hunter make there? that will be fair game in the next 238 days."}
{"original": "and he sure as hell can't hide the increasing amount of -- let's be charitable -- senior moments on the campaign trail."}
{"original": "in potential head-to-head matchup with president trump, no stone will be left unturned. you the american people will be the ultimate jury. in 238 days, you have the opportunity to shock the world again."}
{"original": "here now with reaction, fox news contributor, ari fleischer, former white house chief of staff, reince priebus."}
{"original": "ari, let's start with you tonight. things he can't hide from. this is getting alarming, his behavior. the democratic party wants to admit it or not or the media mob wants to admit it, these moments are now troubling. a, he can't hide from the fact that he did leverage a billion dollars and bragged about it and his son was paid millions with no experience, and that's one with the tip of the iceberg. china is next, the countries after that."}
{"original": "he can't hide from the track record that i just mentioned as it relates to iran and as it relates to the economy after eight years. so, he's probably the likely nominee tonight."}
{"original": "ari fleischer, fox news contributor: well, it shapes up -- it shapes as a good donnybrook i think between biden and trump if that's what it comes down to."}
{"original": "first of all, i don't think it's over. i think it's in the late innings this year. it's late for bernie to come back but it's not over."}
{"original": "but here is what is dogging joe biden going forward with his five-minute, seven-minute and 12-minute speeches. is joe biden ok? nobody gives five and seven, 12-minute running for speeches when they're running for president unless the staff gets you off the stage. that raises that question."}
{"original": "hannity: you know, and reince, you've been out with president trump. i mean, he has endless abundance of energy. he has more energy than 40 40- year-olds, for crying out loud. his rallies go on, ad-libs half way through, most of them. well, that's the truth. i think the hardest job is being my teleprompter guy or being trump's teleprompter guy, because i ad lib all over the place."}
{"original": "and the problem is, if you can't give more than a seven-minute speech, that means you're not up to run the job as president. doesn't it mean if you're blunt and truthful and honest tonight?"}
{"original": "reince priebus, former white house chief of staff: well, and one other tough job is being chief of staff, because i -- you know, the secret to my life has been -- people ask me, it's always outworking everyone around me. he truly is a person that i have not -- i had not been able to outwork. and i don't think john kelly could, i don't think mick could, i don think mark meadows can. it is really difficult."}
{"original": "but here's the thing, like to your point, it's not really a weekend at bernie's type campaign, but it's something like that, where if you're the biden campaign -- and this is real. it's not satire, they're going to hide biden, they're going to have hit totally scripted. we have a very simple campaign."}
{"original": "they talk a little bit about gun violence, a little bit about healthcare, but it's all going to be about donald trump. a referendum up or down on donald trump. so, they're going to give the ball to the trump campaign."}
{"original": "and what the trump campaign is going to do and hopefully what they're going to do is what you just said, which is talk about all the great things that have happened, the economy, jobs, wages, isis, the world is safer, america is safer, stronger. and they're going to give us all the time on the clock. so, we're going to have to remind the american people the truth because they're going to sit back and wait and put the referendum on the ballot and say, hey, do you like donald trump? you want donald trump, yes or no? that's the election right there."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. so, now, these moments, issues of corruption. his record is now front and center. whatever is going on with biden and i think the american people can see it all in spite of the media basically having a blackout on these moments, ari, it doesn't look good. they're not starting from a position of strength by any stretch of the imagination."}
{"original": "so, if you're running the biden campaign, what are you advising him tonight?"}
{"original": "fleischer: give five-minute speeches. i really think there's something about joe biden when you see all these gaffes, the question is the old joe biden that use put together a relatively coherent sentence or the new joe biden who really is stumbling and bumbling every day that he's on the stump. if it's the latter, which it seems to be, you have to hide him. everything is a canned, staged event."}
{"original": "the biden advantage is going to be the mainstream media, sean. this is where there will be a segment of the left that is barely ever going to want to see these gaffes and stumbles. they don't have reason to wonder about his capacity because they won't see it. that's the real problem. it means the trump campaign has to tell everybody."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. last word, reince?"}
{"original": "priebus: yes, and i think ari is right. biden is surviving because he's surviving on the 2012, 20 -- you know, 2008 joe biden. not the 2016, 2020 joe biden. so, that's his survival. so, you limit his exposure and you keep the 2012 joe biden in the minds of the american people. that's what they're going to try to do."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. ari fleischer, reince priebus, thank you both."}
{"original": "now, let's turn to an important update surrounding coronavirus. without a doubt, this is a critical issue. we care about every american life. wouldn't it be great if our scientists, our medical researchers, the best in the world, those that advance our lives, cure our diseases, advance treatments, you know what, wouldn't it be great if we could cure everything one day?"}
{"original": "they're in the process of doing all of that. we have the best people working on behalf of the american people to keep us all healthy. great people. thank you if you're in that industry."}
{"original": "but the weaponization, politicizing, the hysteria surrounding in this particular case, coronavirus, it is reckless, it is responsible, it is dangerous."}
{"original": "here's just one example, courtesy of new york times. remember them? yes, that would be the newspaper that said it's the trump virus and if you're feeling terrible, you know who to blame."}
{"original": "here's bret stephens. he's a little later than his colleagues. take a look."}
{"original": "bret stephens, new york times: when coronavirus broke out in china, people said, this is china's chernobyl. actually, it's donald trump's chernobyl because there's some things you can't lie and spin your way through, above all, something like a virus which is out of control, just as the soviet government couldn't lie its way through atomic particles going through the air in ukraine."}
{"original": "hannity: now, here's what we discovered on this show based on the investigation. we've been right for three years and the things we've told the american people. those people are lying and peddling conspiracy theories and hoaxes. but the exact same people who pushed russia, russia, russia, ukraine, ukraine, ukraine, impeach, impeach, impeach -- those exact same people, we've identified them as the leaders in politicizing a virus, and scaring americans and, of course, blaming donald trump."}
{"original": "if the dog bites, bee stings, you're feeling sad, blame trump. we're going to show you all the worst examples coming up tonight. but, first, let's lay out some key facts because truth matters, context matters, especially when you talk about a disease that puts fear in the hearts of people."}
{"original": "now, that's what we do on the show because we want truth. we're not the media mob. you think working together to keep americans safe, this is not - - you know, we might agree on this. apparently not with trump rage psychosis unfortunately."}
{"original": "so far in the united states, there's been around 30 deaths, most of which came from one nursing home in the state of washington. the average age of mortality is 80 in this country. and the most at risk, and this is very important, are older people with underlying medical issues, the elderly. and, people, by the way, you know, that have compromised immune systems."}
{"original": "people getting chemotherapy, that are in need of -- have some type of immune deficiencies. healthy people, generally, 99 percent recover very fast, even if they contract it."}
{"original": "and, by the way, still any deaths are tragic. we want everybody to live. put it in perspective. 26 people were shot in chicago alone over the weekend. i doubt you heard about it. you notice there's no widespread hysteria about violence in chicago. and this has gone on for years and years and years."}
{"original": "by the way, democratic-run cities, we see a lot of that. meanwhile, senior director --senior director of infection prevention, johns hopkins university, just wrote as of yesterday, the flu is showing much more of an impact on americans than coronavirus. the flu."}
{"original": "now, again, perspective. the standard flu every single year kills tens of thousands of americans. now, does truth matter? does perspective matter?"}
{"original": "well, i wish nobody died from the flu. i hope nobody else dies from coronavirus. we don't want any people dying. i lost my parents. it sucks."}
{"original": "at the very epicenter of coronavirus in china, new cases are now in a dramatic decline. about the 80,000 hospitalizations in china, 56,000 released, 19,000 are on their way to getting well. they lost 3,000 people. three thousand is a lot."}
{"original": "in this country, h1n1, we lost over 14,000 people. this is the china coronavirus."}
{"original": "by the way, not enough has been said about this. china has not been forthcoming. they've not been helpful. we could have been there from the very beginning. they weren't telling us the truth. they've not helped the world."}
{"original": "and according to multiple reports, china has muzzled their own scientists, suppressed information. finally, i talked to my sources. they're now accepting some american expertise in health that they denied in the beginning."}
{"original": "they're even spreading conspiracy theories. the united states and donald trump is to blame for the creation of coronavirus. i told you that was going to come and i was kind of making it up last night. i said you watch. next thing you'll say, donald trump created it with putin in a laboratory with ukrainians and russians."}
{"original": "let's be clear. the disease started in the wuhan area, province area of china. the totalitarian government there grossly mishandled the situation. now, the entire world is paying for china's widespread negligence this needs to be dealt with, but later."}
{"original": "meanwhile here at home, look what the trump administration has done. they've taken unprecedented aggressive action to slow the disease and to save lives and prevent americans from contracting the disease. by far end of sentence, the single best decision that was made for the safety of the american people so they wouldn't contract this disease was made by the president."}
{"original": "we identified corona january 7th. three short weeks later after we identified it, the president unprecedented, he issued in record time a travel ban from china. oh, he also implemented mandatory quarantines which hasn't happened in a long time, decades, almost from day one."}
{"original": "now, ok. where were the democrats on this? biden was calling the president and his decision for a travel ban, he's xenophobic."}
{"original": "these are two key actions, the most important decisions from the get-go that likely prevented thousands of americans from contracting this virus. by the way, no democrat would do it. bernie said he wouldn't have done it. joe excoriated the president from doing it."}
{"original": "then fake news cnn says we're going to stigmatize the people from other countries. probably would be worse in the president did not act that quickly. by the way, it was the fastest ever implementation in history."}
{"original": "more recently, the president signed off, let's see, $8 billion response package. we need it. good. let's help americans. now the president has said he will help, offer tax relief, financial aid for those industries."}
{"original": "for example, if you work in the cruise industry, you're doing to be impacted by this. we're going to help you."}
{"original": "by the way, maybe you're an hourly wage worker. we're going to help you too. if you're not feeling well, we'll make sure that your job will be safe and that you will get the money you deserve so you're not put in a crisis."}
{"original": "now, some might say, well, we didn't have enough test kits. ok, that has been rectified in just the last week. we now have the test kits. they're all going out."}
{"original": "the overwhelming response to this disease has been aggressive and thorough from day one. and recently, even the liberal governor, i have to give a shout out, i never thought i'd do this on this program, that guy, gavin newsom, praising president trump and his current response. he told reporters, the administration said and did everything i could have hoped for and they followed through on all of their promises."}
{"original": "now, the coronavirus pose as lot of serious risks and a lot of serious challenges. this is not, though, the end of days. it's not the end of the world. sadly, these viruses pop up time to time. pandemics happen, time to time."}
{"original": "here with reaction, fox news correspondent at large, geraldo rivera, fox news contributor dan bongino."}
{"original": "ok, h1n1 is a good indicator. ok. by the time, we lost a thousand americans and 20,000 contracted the disease, geraldo, now, the health and human services secretary of obama-biden said -- say it's an emergency to get funds. but the official emergency by the president was six months later, 1,000 dead americans."}
{"original": "i don't remember this hysteria, do you?"}
{"original": "geraldo rivera, fox news correspondent-at-large: no, there was not the same hysteria. there was some. i mean, swine flu, ebola, west nile virus. in each case, there was an initial, real apprehension, real anxiety. and then things calmed down when people realized that the federal government had control of the situation."}
{"original": "when you look at the panel the president has put together led by vice president pence, you have anthony fauci coming up from the national institutes of health. he's on the panel. the cdc on the panel. the surgeon general is on the panel."}
{"original": "they're doing everything possible, they're extremely competent and they are doing an excellent job. i think that they will calm people as the -- you know, we're going to go up before we go down in terms of the number of cases. the more we soothe people now but we want people to use precautions. wash your happened. stop shaking hands."}
{"original": "i want you to tell the president, when you talk too him tonight, that geraldo said, mr. president, for the good of the nation, stop shaking hands. it's a bad example. we don't need it. i know you're brave and all the rest of it."}
{"original": "you want to be engaged. fine. we get it. you're doing a terrific job. now, everybody follow the same simple steps."}
{"original": "hannity: i don't want to shake your hand, geraldo. i mean, i'm kidding. we'll do the elbow. the hannity elbows."}
{"original": "dan knows about it because he's a martial arts guy like i am. just basic common sense. listen, if there's any good news here, it is the 99 percent, if god forbid you contract it, you'll be fine. we have to worry about mostly the elderly, those with underlying medical conditions, compromised immune systems."}
{"original": "but what they're doing, you know, dan, is unconscionable, what we're saying. the same people that did russia, lies for three years. ukraine. impeach. same cast of characters."}
{"original": "dan bongino, fox news contributor: no, it's been abhorrent, sean. i mean, think about this, the media's primary focus, a lot of them, not all, but their primary focus among some of them, some over at msnbc, has been to call you racist if you refer to it as the wuhan virus."}
{"original": "this isn't a joke, this is -- i'm not talking about b teamers. i'm talking about prominent personalities on other networks that are concerned about calling people racist that refer to a virus that originated in wuhan like the ebola virus originated near the ebola river, and ebola zaire, one of the sub-species, near zaire. i mean, this is phenomenal. this is like a new low."}
{"original": "but what is the important take-away from this, sean, why focusing on that, there's an opportunity cost. think about what they're not focusing on. telling the public what the trump administration is doing to clear up regulations to allow these tests to get out there."}
{"original": "ambassador birx mentioned it today, lightning speed, getting regulations clear. multiple tests overseas, on foreign soil for people before you get on a plane and come to this country. are you hearing about that in the mainstream media? probably not."}
{"original": "i'll give you one more. what about the nursing homes? where a lot of the problems in nursing homes can be severe, but they told regulators, primary thing now, infection control. we're going to do this and we're going to stop this."}
{"original": "you're not hearing about that because they're calling it the wuhan, the wuhan virus is racist. this is what they're wasting their time on."}
{"original": "it is the wuhan virus. what are they going to say in west nile?"}
{"original": "rivera: west nile, the west nile river is near uganda. that's you know, that's why they call it the west nile virus."}
{"original": "legionnaire's disease, the american legion convention in philadelphia. lime disease, lime, connecticut."}
{"original": "you know, come on, china. get over it."}
{"original": "but one thing this has revealed, sean, and this is very important, this epidemic has revealed that we are dependent on china for many of our vital pharmaceuticals. how can that be? how come we rely on our strategic enemy for our -- something as vital as antiviral medication?"}
{"original": "rivera: anti -- we need a strategic reserve in pharmaceuticals like we have a strategic reserve in oil."}
{"original": "hannity: all right, guys. thank you both, dan, geraldo."}
{"original": "now, the trump administration has taken unprecedented, bold action to combat the coronavirus. the mob and the media can't help but they echo their colleagues in the democratic party, using what is a serious health threat to bludgeon president trump."}
{"original": "of course, if he cured cancer, they would impeach him for that. how many times have i warned you about that?"}
{"original": "rachel maddow, msnbc host: this is the worst case scenario that you get from a government that doesn't know what they're doing and is willing to lie to the people about things that will keep them alive."}
{"original": "john brennan, former cia director: donald trump who throughout his life he looked at the world through a prism of how things affect his personal and financial political fortunes. i wonder if he's capable to put the country's well-being first."}
{"original": "joy behar, co-host, the view: the government is there to protect you from terrorism, health -- just exactly this thing. this is the function of government and how government is screwing up."}
{"original": "unidentified male: this may be donald trump's katrina. this is an event that could take down a president."}
{"original": "chuck todd, meet the press: the iran hostage crisis was the final year of carter's presidency. not his fault but it's a test in real time."}
{"original": "joe scarborough, msnbc host: the president is doing nothing but playing in his political sandbox while this virus continues to spread silently across america."}
{"original": "hannity: same people lied to you for three years, claiming the president colluded with russia to steal the 2016 election, the same people. we've got the evidence. take a look."}
{"original": "maddow: we're about to find out if the new president of country is going to do what russia wants when he's commander-in-chief of the u.s. military."}
{"original": "brennan: i think he's afraid of the president of russia."}
{"original": "brennan: well, i think one can speculate as to why. the russians may have something on him personally."}
{"original": "behar: do we have to wait until the hammer and sickle is on the american flag before we stand up to this guy?"}
{"original": "unidentified male: if it turns out that donald trump stole the election that he conspired with the russians to undermine our democracy."}
{"original": "todd: i'm obsessed with how many fingers the hand of russia had in donald trump's world."}
{"original": "scarborough: donald trump is either an agent of russia or he's a useful idiot."}
{"original": "hannity: joining us now, senior adviser to donald j. trump for president, lara trump, is with us."}
{"original": "lara, good to see you. thank you for coming back."}
{"original": "lara trump, senior adviser, donald j. trump for president: yes."}
{"original": "and yet, your father-in-law, nobody ever acted faster and he got crushed for the travel ban and quarantine."}
{"original": "well, the good news, sean, is none of these people have any credibility left because what you just heard there is it's so obvious to the american people. they've been lying to you for years about everything to do with donald trump."}
{"original": "the truth for anybody that has been paying any attention is that while the democrats were busy still trying to impeach donald trump, he took decisive action. he made sure that people were not coming into this country on flights from infected areas of china. he, of course, got called racist for that because that's the default for donald trump whenever these people don't know what to say about him because he's actually doing the job that the people elected him to do."}
{"original": "but you have to look at other things, sean. you know, the president constantly gets hit by the left and by the mainstream media for having strong borders on our southern border. this is a perfect example of why you want strong borders. you got to know whenever you have a pandemic situation going around the world that it's not going to come here to the united states."}
{"original": "these people have no credibility. it's absolutely ridiculous. you heard none of them -- i heard you talk about this earlier. h1n1, it took six months for the obama administration and 1,000-plus deaths before anything really happened in this country. yet, it was crickets from the mainstream media."}
{"original": "it's so obvious what's going on to people. donald trump and the administration have done an amazing job here."}
{"original": "hannity: ok, fastest travel ban quarantine implemented in history, billions of dollars already done. billions now going to industries impacted record time. money for workers impacted. our scientists, we know coronavirus dangerous to one group of people."}
{"original": "l. trump: oh, they look so stupid. when this is all over and the economy rebounds and everything is back to normal, these people have completely lost any support that they had out there. their ratings are going to go even lower if that's possible, sean. so, too bad for them."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. all right. it's about the truth, especially when it's our health. we've got -- we've got to give people the truthful information."}
{"original": "all right. when we come back, new york has created a, quote, containment area in one part of the state because of coronavirus and the outbreak. we'll have a full report."}
{"original": "also, dr. anthony fauci, he's the adult in the room. well, we know everyone is worried. well, we'll ask him the things you need to know for your family to protect your family. the truth, straight ahead."}
{"original": "hannity: fox news alert. today, new york governor andrew cuomo announced the state would establish a containment area in a new york suburbs in order to combat the virus."}
{"original": "joining us now is the member of the white house's coronavirus task force, dr. anthony fauci."}
{"original": "dr. fauci, i have a lot of respect for you. you've been around many administrations and done a lot of work."}
{"original": "i want to do a quick lightning round and then i want you to expand out so people fully understand."}
{"original": "dr. anthony fauci, white house coronavirus task force: yes."}
{"original": "hannity: -- the quarantine that the president did within three weeks. do you believe --was the fastest ever, do you believe it likely prevented thousands of americans from contracting the virus and was a smart thing to do? and the president --"}
{"original": "fauci: yes, i think there's no question. yes, there's no question that if we had not done that in a timely way, there would have been many more travel-related cases from china. and as you know, the outbreak that we're having here in the country, these cases originated from travel-related cases that came from china and the then we had the issue in washington state and what we're seeing now in other states."}
{"original": "so, coming from outside within was the thing that started it. so, i think doing that saved us a lot of -- a lot of concern and a lot of suffering, i think."}
{"original": "hannity: and that was fairly unprecedented. you've been around for a lot of these pandemics, a lot of these viruses."}
{"original": "you do this for a living. you're a professional guy, professional virus guy."}
{"original": "hannity: but it was unprecedented. you've never seen anything like it. i've never seen anything like it, right?"}
{"original": "fauci: well, no, i have not. the reason is that there's a lot of skepticism about whether when you do a travel ban, whether or not you're really going to interfere with any aspect of an outbreak, because you might delay it, but what's going to happen is that you'll wind up having a big outbreak anyway. that's true. when you have multiple different countries at the same time who have outbreaks and you can't exclude the entire world."}
{"original": "but the unique situation with china back at the end of december, the beginning of january, was that they were the sole source of that at first. and to block them from coming in was unquestionable the right move. even though it was a controversial move, it was the right move."}
{"original": "hannity: well, the president was called xenophobic. we're in a political season, so everything has to be seen through that prism of politics. in 238 days, there's an election."}
{"original": "but now, we have approved billions of dollars for every aspect of this. the president and his economic team have put aside -- putting aside money specifically for industries directly impacted, for hourly workers that are impacted. so, if they're not feeling, they're not going to lose their job. there are no co-pays to get a test."}
{"original": "that's fairly unprecedented, too. did the president do the right thing in a timely manner on these issues?"}
{"original": "fauci: well, the reason for that, it was an important decision. you know, we discussed that about the kinds of things that would happen if you say the way that you mitigate an outbreak is that if a person is infected or exposed, they need to stay home. and when they stay home for the incubation period, if you have an hour by hour job, it becomes untenable for you."}
{"original": "so, in order to make it that you give an even playing field to someone, to give them the opportunity that if they want to abide by the recommendations that we make the public health recommendations, they have to have some sort of safety net. otherwise, it wouldn't work."}
{"original": "fauci: so the decision was made, we're going to give those people backup and that's what we did."}
{"original": "hannity: let me -- i have one more very important question. so, is it -- so the average age mortality for corona is 80. so, it -- this virus is --"}
{"original": "hannity: -- impacting people with compromised immune systems, underlying other medical conditions are the most vulnerable. what about the other 99 percent? if people got the virus, worst case scenario, how dangerous is it to them --"}
{"original": "hannity: -- compared maybe to the regular virus -- regular flu?"}
{"original": "fauci: ok. so that's a good question. about 80 percent of the people that get infected will do well. they'll get sick. they're going to be uncomfortable. they're not going to feel well. but they're going to spontaneously recover."}
{"original": "about 15 percent of them, according to the data from china, korea, et cetera, that those are individuals that are going to get into trouble and the mortality in that group is very high."}
{"original": "but, sean, to make sure your viewers get an accurate idea about what goes on, you mentioned seasonal flu. the mortality for seasonal flu is 0.1. the mortality for this is about 2, 2.5 percent. it's probably lower than that. it's probably closer to 1."}
{"original": "but even if it's 1, it's ten times more lethal than the seasonal flu. you got to make sure that people understand that."}
{"original": "hannity: no, no, no. i think -- now, are we doing everything possible that you would do up to this point?"}
{"original": "fauci: you know, i believe so. i mean, always, when you have an outbreak, there's a little bit of the fog of war associated with that. you're trying to do the right thing, you're trying to keep up with an evolving situation."}
{"original": "but i think in the context --"}
{"original": "fauci: -- of what we're being challenged with, i think everybody is doing really well."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. dr. fauci, you're a voice of reason. thank you for being with us."}
{"original": "the architect, karl rove. can bolshevik bernie come back? straight ahead."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. now, more election results moments away. breaking moments ago, james clyburn of south carolina told npr, the dnc should step in and cancel the rest of the debates so, oh, biden doesn't do anything risky. karl rove joins us on that in the whiteboard."}
{"original": "karl rove, fox news contributor: good evening."}
{"original": "hannity: they're afraid he will make a mistake. cancel those debates quick."}
{"original": "rove: yes, that would just inflame sandernistas even more, and it'd be -- it'd make them even -- more difficult enough to unite the party. it's already going to be difficult enough because bernie is not a conventional democrat and he's not going to act like a conventional politician in all this."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. what do you got tonight, karl? can bolshevik come back?"}
{"original": "rove: yes. well, it's going to be hard for bernie, and this is why. this is coming in tonight. biden has 670 delegates. he needs 1,321 for the nomination, which means that going into tonight, he only needed to win 51.4 percent of all the delegates who remain, about 60 percent of the delegates remain to be chosen tonight and in subsequent weeks."}
{"original": "but he's running ahead of that in missouri. he's like 63 percent. in michigan, he's 57 percent."}
{"original": "he's on the verge of taking all the delegates in mississippi unless sanders who's at 14.9 percent can inch above the 15 inch mark, in which case he'll take a larger chunk of the delegates."}
{"original": "but right now, biden is on the verge of taking virtually all, if not all of mississippi's delegates."}
{"original": "now, sanders on the other hand, he got 574. he needs 1,417. that means he's got to win 55.1 percent of all the delegates starting tonight and to the rest."}
{"original": "he's not going to win -- he ain't going to win it tonight. we don't know what washington state and idaho and north dakota look like. but the three contests that are in -- he's not going to -- he is well below that 55 percent number."}
{"original": "and next week is not going to be any better. he lost all four states last time around who are going to vote next week."}
{"original": "rove: arizona, illinois, florida -- and yes, sir?"}
{"original": "hannity: what about joe biden? it's obvious. he's got problems here. seven- minute speeches, 12-minute speeches, nothing more than 15. and now, well, shush him away."}
{"original": "rove: yes, no, they're trying to find the right way to handle all this, but it's clear he's got difficulties stringing together two sentences. and, you know, frankly, this all -- the coronavirus may give him a respite he needs. they need to get his act together or he's going to have big problems by the time the fall rolls around."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. karl rove's whiteboard is brought to you by -- we should get a sponsor for this. that's a great idea."}
{"original": "rove: yes, we should. yes, it'd be nice of you to say sponsor, but it's my white board. it's not your whiteboard. you keep claiming you're going to send them to me and they've never shown up."}
{"original": "hannity: i ordered you a whiteboard, wait until you see it."}
{"original": "rove: oh, yes, right, right. well, i brought two of my own from texas."}
{"original": "hannity: oh, no, no, you have to use mine. you have to use mine."}
{"original": "rove: no, no, forget it. not happening, because you had your chance, my friend. these are sponsored by the texas cowboys and the houston texans."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. karl rove, thank you."}
{"original": "when we come back, oh, hunter is using the coronavirus to not be deposed or give over financial information on the paternity case, ah, in a state where they have no known cases of coronavirus. trace gallagher, next."}
{"original": "hannity: all right. hunter biden's attorneys -- they are saying he cannot appear for his deposition for financial information about the paternity case in arkansas because of the coronavirus. his wife is due to give birth."}
{"original": "unfortunately, no coronavirus outbreaks thankfully in arkansas. sounds like an excuse."}

{"original": "rep. beth van duyne, who offered to work with president biden on bipartisan solutions, says the democratic president has turned off some republicans with a flurry of executive orders reversing the former administration's policies."}
{"original": "looking at what he did in his first day, it's not off to a great start, van duyne, r-texas, told fox news."}
{"original": "she led a group of 17 gop freshmen to send biden a letter on inauguration day offering to help with passing legislation on targeted coronavirus relief, protecting americans with pre-existing health conditions, improving infrastructure and restoring the economy."}
{"original": "house gop freshmen offer to work with biden: 'americans are tired of the partisan gridlock'"}
{"original": "during biden's inauguration speech, he spoke repeatedly of unity and the importance of listening to and respecting differences of opinions. he pledged to be a president for all americans."}
{"original": "biden, however, kicked off his presidency with a series of executive orders that took direct aim at president trump's signature policies related to border security, energy production and climate change that were popular among the gop base."}
{"original": "biden signs 17 executive orders reversing trump policies, restoring obama-era programs"}
{"original": "van duyne is not alone in her disappointment."}
{"original": "other republicans pleased with biden's calls for unity in his wednesday speech were frustrated that his first executive actions reflected the priorities of the left. sen. mitch mcconnell, r-ky., accused biden of taking several big steps in the wrong direction."}
{"original": "van duyne called biden's immigration actions very dangerous and said the democrat's reversal of the keystone xl oil and gas pipeline project on environmental grounds would kill jobs and lead to higher energy costs for struggling americans."}
{"original": "it's $1.6 billion of wages he just knocked out with a signature, van duyne said of the reversal. it's thousands and thousands of jobs that were just decimated overnight. you think about the folks that democrats claim that they represent -- working poor, people on fixed incomes -- and literally with one movement of the pen he has now raised their electricity rates, raised their gas rates. ... they're now going to have their utility costs go skyrocket."}
{"original": "tc energy, the canadian company behind the pipeline, said it laid off 1,000 workers as a result of biden's executive action. trump had approved construction of the $9 billion, 1,200-mile pipeline that would transport up to 830,000 barrels of crude oil daily from alberta, canada, to nebraska."}
{"original": "biden ending keystone pipeline would kill thousands of american jobs"}
{"original": "according to the keystone xl website, the project, initially proposed more than a decade ago, would sustain about 11,000 u.s. jobs in 2021 – including 8,000 union jobs – and generate $1.6 billion in gross wages."}
{"original": "in other action, biden ordered a stop to building the wall along the southern border, ended trump's so-called muslim travel ban and reversed one of trump's early executive orders that made anyone in the country illegally a priority for deportations."}
{"original": "responding to the latter action, the department of homeland security announced a 100-day moratorium on certain deportations. the pause does not apply to people who entered the country illegally on or after nov. 1, 2020."}
{"original": "van duyne said that under trump's policies her home state had finally made headway on improving border security."}
{"original": "texas rep.-elect beth van duyne says obamacare was 'one of the biggest lies' of history"}
{"original": "he's basically now given an invitation for gang members, for the drug cartel and for human traffickers to come on into our country ... that to me is very dangerous. and it's going to affect border states, specifically states like texas, van duyne said."}
{"original": "van duyne led the letter of gop freshmen to biden because she saw how the country suffered when democrats worked for four years to resist trump and were too concerned with impeachment and russian collusion to find solutions, she said."}
{"original": "i quite honestly think i'm pretty much like most americans who are sick of that fight, van duyne said. they want to move forward. they want to know that there are adults who actually are elected who are willing to work on policy issues that will affect them. and i raised my hand and i got 16 of my fellow freshmen to do the same thing."}

{"original": "she said biden needs to work more closely with republican lawmakers in order to avoid issuing more damaging executive orders."}
{"original": "you need to have republicans at the table that are talking about how to best defend and fight for working families, and that right now is being completely missed, she said."}
{"original": "fox business' audrey conklin contributed to this report."}
{"original": "president biden on thursday signed a pair of executive orders expanding access to the affordable care act during the coronavirus pandemic and rolling back some of the anti-abortion measures implemented by the trump administration."}
{"original": "the actions add to the spate of executive moves taken by biden during his first week in office as he seeks to reverse his republican predecessor's policies. so far, biden has signed more than three dozen presidential orders and memos, a record."}
{"original": "biden signs climate change orders amid concerns over jobs: 'it is time to act'"}
{"original": "the latest order will create a special enrollment period on healthcare.gov, making it easier for the uninsured to obtain health coverage through obamacare during the pandemic, which has killed close to 430,000 americans. close to 22 million americans lost their jobs as a result of the virus-induced recession, and there remain 9.8 million individuals out of work compared to february, before the crisis began."}
{"original": "the department of health and human services will open a three-month enrollment period from feb. 15 to may 15. an administration official told fox news to expect a robust outreach program on the new enrollment period, but did not provide any estimates on enrollment figures or budget projections."}
{"original": "the annual enrollment period for healthcare.gov closed in mid-december for americans living in the 36 states that rely on the federal marketplace."}
{"original": "under current law, people who lose their job and employer-based insurance qualify for a special enrollment period through obamacare, but must provide proof that they lost their coverage. by establishing a special enrollment period, the white house is allowing people who chose not to buy health insurance this year but want it now would have been eligible to participate."}
{"original": "obamacare still working despite individual mandate's repeal"}
{"original": "biden will also direct federal agencies to reconsider rules and other policies that may undermine the affordable care act, the landmark health care law passed while he was vice president. he will also request a review of policies that may reduce enrollment in medicaid, the federal health insurance program for low-income americans, such as work requirements for recipients."}
{"original": "during a brief signing ceremony in the oval office, biden said the orders were intended to undo the damage that trump has done."}

{"original": "boston globe: with the party's first national debates less than three months away, and the new hampshire primary less than 11 months away, the big challenge for … [candidates:] how to stand out in such a crowded pack, without doing anything so bold it could backfire. … a big field without an obvious front-runner could shake out in any number of ways, but history suggests it will most likely end up following one of two paths. the first is the long, (mostly) collegial search for a consensus candidate. that's what we saw with the relatively large democratic field in 1988 (11 candidates, plus a few fringe). in that race, the big names either sat out or flamed out early, and the campaign turned into a slow-moving grind… the 2004 campaign started out in similar fashion… the model for the second possible path is a lot more recent: the republicans in the 2016 campaign. … after all, what an effective primary campaign does is put the candidates through a punishing stress test that toughens and strengthens them, giving everyone confidence that they have identified the strongest possible contender for the general election. … so this is the tightrope that democratic contenders will have to walk: they'll need to be unfiltered and distinctive enough to break out of the pack, but not so candid that they get disqualified by the wrath of summary judgment on social media."}

'i think there's a lot to that. because you had an election in 2016 where the loser got 3 million more votes than the victor,' o'rourke said in a video posted online. ... 'if we really want everyone to vote, to give them every reason to vote, we have to make sure their votes count and go to the candidate of their choosing. so i think there's a lot of wisdom in that.' o'rourke's support for potentially abolishing the electoral college came one day after sen. elizabeth warren, d-mass., pushed a similar proposal. 'every vote matters and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the electoral college,' warren told an audience at the historically black jackson state university in mississippi."}

{"original": "this year american astronauts will go back to space on american rockets. in the 20th century, america saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great american adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century."}
{"original": "an amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach. we can make our communities safer, our families stronger, our culture richer, our faith deeper, and our middle class bigger and more prosperous than ever before. but we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance and retribution -- and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise and the common good. together, we can break decades of political stalemate. we can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of america's future. the decision is ours to make. we must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction. tonight, i ask you to choose greatness. over the last two years, my administration has moved with urgency and historic speed to confront problems neglected by leaders of both parties over many decades."}
{"original": "in just over two years since the election, we have launched an unprecedented economic boom -- a boom that has rarely been seen before. we have created 5.3 million new jobs and importantly added 600,000 new manufacturing jobs -- something which almost everyone said was impossible to do, but the fact is, we are just getting started. wages are rising at the fastest pace in decades, and growing for blue collar workers, who i promised to fight for, faster than anyone else. nearly 5 million americans have been lifted off food stamps. the u.s. economy is growing almost twice as fast today as when i took office, and we are considered far and away the hottest economy anywhere in the world. unemployment has reached the lowest rate in half a century. african-american, hispanic-american and asian-american unemployment have all reached their lowest levels ever recorded. unemployment for americans with disabilities has also reached an all-time low. more people are working now than at any time in our history -- 157 million."}
{"original": "we passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit. we virtually ended the estate, or death, tax on small businesses, ranches, and family farms. we eliminated the very unpopular obamacare individual mandate penalty -- and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try. my administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to our historic reductions in taxes and regulations."}
{"original": "we have unleashed a revolution in american energy -- the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the world. and now, for the first time in 65 years, we are a net exporter of energy. after 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and america is winning each and every day."}
{"original": "members of congress: the state of our union is strong. our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before. on friday, it was announced that we added another 304,000 jobs last month alone -- almost double what was expected. an economic miracle is taking place in the united states -- and the only thing that can stop it are foolish wars, politics or ridiculous partisan investigations. if there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. it just doesn't work that way! we must be united at home to defeat our adversaries abroad. this new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the senate -- some after years of waiting. the senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country. now is the time for bipartisan action. believe it or not, we have already proven that it is possible."}
{"original": "in the last congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new farm bill, historic va reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed va accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans. and just weeks ago, both parties united for groundbreaking criminal justice reform."}
{"original": "last year, i heard through friends the story of alice johnson. i was deeply moved. in 1997, alice was sentenced to life in prison as a first-time non-violent drug offender. over the next two decades, she became a prison minister, inspiring others to choose a better path. she had a big impact on that prison population -- and far beyond. alice's story underscores the disparities and unfairness that can exist in criminal sentencing -- and the need to remedy this injustice. she served almost 22 years and had expected to be in prison for the rest of her life. in june, i commuted alice's sentence -- when i saw alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, i knew i did the right thing -- alice is here with us tonight. alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny."}
{"original": "inspired by stories like alice's, my administration worked closely with members of both parties to sign the first step act into law. this legislation reformed sentencing laws that have wrongly and disproportionately harmed the african- american community. the first step act gives non-violent offenders the chance to re-enter society as productive, law-abiding citizens. now, states across the country are following our lead. america is a nation that believes in redemption."}
{"original": "we are also joined tonight by matthew charles from tennessee. in 1996, at age 30, matthew was sentenced to 35 years for selling drugs and related offenses. over the next two decades, he completed more than 30 bible studies, became a law clerk, and mentored fellow inmates. now, matthew is the very first person to be released from prison under the first step act. matthew, on behalf of all americans: welcome home."}
{"original": "now, republicans and democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis. congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border. now is the time for congress to show the world that america is committed to ending illegal immigration and putting the ruthless coyotes, cartels, drug dealers, and human traffickers out of business. as we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the united states. we have just heard that mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. i have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught. this is a moral issue. the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security and financial well-being of all americans. we have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. this includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. i want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally. tonight, i am asking you to defend our very dangerous southern border out of love and devotion to our fellow citizens and to our country."}
{"original": "no issue better illustrates the divide between america's working class and america's political class than illegal immigration. wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. meanwhile, working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration -- reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net."}
{"original": "tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate -- it is cruel. 1 in 3 women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country. human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery. tens of thousands of innocent americans are killed by lethal drugs that cross our border and flood into our cities -- including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl. the savage gang, ms-13, now operates in at least 20 different american states, and they almost all come through our southern border. just yesterday, an ms-13 gang member was taken into custody for a fatal shooting on a subway platform in new york city. we are removing these gang members by the thousands, but until we secure our border they're going to keep streaming back in. year after year, countless americans are murdered by criminal illegal aliens. i've gotten to know many wonderful angel moms, dads and families -- no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured. here tonight is debra bissell. just three weeks ago, debra's parents, gerald and sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their reno, nevada home by an illegal alien. they were in their eighties and are survived by 4 children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren."}
{"original": "also here tonight are gerald and sharon's granddaughter, heather, and great- granddaughter madison. to debra, heather, madison, please stand: few can understand your pain. but i will never forget, and i will fight for the memory of gerald and sharon, that it should never happen again. not one more american life should be lost because our nation failed to control its very dangerous border."}
{"original": "in the last two years, our brave ice officers made 266,000 arrests of criminal aliens, including those charged or convicted of nearly 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 killings. we are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ice special agent elvin hernandez. when elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the united states from the dominican republic. at the age of eight, elvin told his dad he wanted to become a special agent. today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. elvin says: if i can make sure these young girls get their justice, i've done my job. thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars."}
{"original": "special agent hernandez please stand: we will always support the brave men and women of law enforcement -- and i pledge to you tonight that we will never abolish our heroes from ice. my administration has sent to congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border. it includes humanitarian assistance, more law enforcement, drug detection at our ports, closing loopholes that enable child smuggling, and plans for a new physical barrier, or wall, to secure the vast areas between our ports of entry. this is a smart, strategic, see- through steel barrier -- not just a simple concrete wall. it will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down. san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. in response, a strong security wall was put in place. this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings. the border city of el paso, texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime -- one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our nation's most dangerous cities. now, with a powerful barrier in place, el paso is one of our safest cities. simply put, walls work and walls save lives. so let's work together, compromise, and reach a deal that will truly make america safe."}
{"original": "as we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace. no one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before -- and exactly one century after congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in congress than ever before. as part of our commitment to improving opportunity for women everywhere, this thursday we are launching the first ever government-wide initiative focused on economic empowerment for women in developing countries. to build on our incredible economic success, one priority is paramount -- reversing decades of calamitous trade policies."}
{"original": "we are now making it clear to china that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of american jobs and wealth has come to an end. therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion dollars of chinese goods -- and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars. but i don't blame china for taking advantage of us -- i blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. i have great respect for president xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with china. but it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect american jobs."}
{"original": "another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as nafta. i have met the men and women of michigan, ohio, pennsylvania, indiana, new hampshire, and many other states whose dreams were shattered by nafta. for years, politicians promised them they would negotiate for a better deal. but no one ever tried -- until now. our new u.s.-mexico-canada agreement -- or usmca -- will replace nafta and deliver for american workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding american agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with the four beautiful words: made in the usa."}
{"original": "tonight, i am also asking you to pass the united states reciprocal trade act, so that if another country places an unfair tariff on an american product, we can charge them the exact same tariff on the same product that they sell to us. both parties should be able to unite for a great rebuilding of america's crumbling infrastructure. i know that congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill -- and i am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. this is not an option. this is a necessity."}
{"original": "the next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs -- and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions. already, as a result of my administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years. but we must do more. it is unacceptable that americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. this is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it."}
{"original": "i am asking congress to pass legislation that finally takes on the problem of global freeloading and delivers fairness and price transparency for american patients. we should also require drug companies, insurance companies, and hospitals to disclose real prices to foster competition and bring costs down. no force in history has done more to advance the human condition than american freedom. in recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against hiv and aids. scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. my budget will ask democrats and republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the hiv epidemic in the united states within 10 years. together, we will defeat aids in america."}
{"original": "tonight i am also asking you to join me in another fight that all americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer. joining melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10 year old girl, grace eline. every birthday since she was 4, grace asked her friends to donate to st. jude children's research hospital. she did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. last year, grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. immediately, she began radiation treatment. at the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 dollars for the fight against cancer. when grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: last day of keemo. grace -- you are an inspiration to us all."}
{"original": "many childhood cancers have not seen new therapies in decades. my budget will ask congress for $500 million dollars over the next 10 years to fund this critical life-saving research. to help support working parents, the time has come to pass school choice for america's children."}
{"original": "i am also proud to be the first president to include in my budget a plan for nationwide paid family leave -- so that every new parent has the chance to bond with their newborn child. there could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days. lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. these are living, feeling, beautiful, babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. and then, we had the case of the governor of virginia where he stated he would execute a baby after birth. to defend the dignity of every person, i am asking congress to pass legislation to prohibit the late-term abortion of children who can feel pain in the mother's womb. let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. and let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children -- born and unborn -- are made in the holy image of god. the final part of my agenda is to protect america's national security. over the last two years, we have begun to fully rebuild the united states military -- with $700 billion dollars last year and $716 billion dollars this year."}
{"original": "we are also getting other nations to pay their fair share. for years, the united states was being treated very unfairly by nato -- but now we have secured a $100 billion dollar increase in defense spending from nato allies. as part of our military build-up, the united states is developing a state-of-the-art missile defense system. under my administration, we will never apologize for advancing america's interests."}
{"original": "for example, decades ago the united states entered into a treaty with russia in which we agreed to limit and reduce our missile capabilities. while we followed the agreement to the letter, russia repeatedly violated its terms. that is why i announced that the united states is officially withdrawing from the intermediate- range nuclear forces treaty, or inf treaty. perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding china and others, or perhaps we can't -- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far."}
{"original": "as part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the korean peninsula. our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. if i had not been elected president of the united states, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with north korea. much work remains to be done, but my relationship with kim jong un is a good one. chairman kim and i will meet again on february 27 and 28 in vietnam."}
{"original": "two weeks ago, the united states officially recognized the legitimate government of venezuela, and its new interim president, juan gwydo [guaido]. we stand with the venezuelan people in their noble quest for freedom -- and we condemn the brutality of the maduro regime, whose socialist policies have turned that nation from being the wealthiest in south america into a state of abject poverty and despair. here, in the united states, we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. america was founded on liberty and independence -- not government coercion, domination and control. we are born free, and we will stay free. tonight, we renew our resolve that america will never be a socialist country."}
{"original": "one of the most complex set of challenges we face is in the middle east. our approach is based on principled realism -- not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. for this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of israel -- and proudly opened the american embassy in jerusalem. our brave troops have now been fighting in the middle east for almost 19 years. in afghanistan and iraq, nearly 7,000 american heroes have given their lives. more than 52,000 americans have been badly wounded. we have spent more than $7 trillion dollars in the middle east. as a candidate for president, i pledged a new approach. great nations do not fight endless wars. when i took office, isis controlled more than 20,000 square miles in iraq and syria. today, we have liberated virtually all of that territory from the grip of these bloodthirsty killers. now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of isis, it is time to give our brave warriors in syria a warm welcome home."}
{"original": "i have also accelerated our negotiations to reach a political settlement in afghanistan. our troops have fought with unmatched valor -- and thanks to their bravery, we are now able to pursue a political solution to this long and bloody conflict. in afghanistan, my administration is holding constructive talks with a number of afghan groups, including the taliban. as we make progress in these negotiations, we will be able to reduce our troop presence and focus on counter- terrorism. we do not know whether we will achieve an agreement -- but we do know that after two decades of war, the hour has come to at least try for peace. above all, friend and foe alike must never doubt this nation's power and will to defend our people. 18 years ago, terrorists attacked the uss cole -- and last month american forces killed one of the leaders of the attack. we are honored to be joined tonight by tom wibberley, whose son, navy seaman craig wibberley, was one of the 17 sailors we tragically lost. tom: we vow to always remember the heroes of the uss cole."}
{"original": "my administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in iran. to ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, i withdrew the united states from the disastrous iran nuclear deal."}
{"original": "and last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country. we will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to america and threatens genocide against the jewish people. we must never ignore the vile poison of anti-semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. with one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs. just months ago, 11 jewish-americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh."}
{"original": "swat officer timothy matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. timothy has just had his 12th surgery -- but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. officer matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil."}
{"original": "tonight we are also joined by pittsburgh survivor judah samet. he arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. but not only did judah narrowly escape death last fall -- more than 7 decades ago, he narrowly survived the nazi concentration camps. today is judah's 81st birthday. judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. suddenly the train screeched to a halt. a soldier appeared. judah's family braced for the worst. then, his father cried out with joy: it's the americans. a second holocaust survivor who is here tonight, joshua kaufman, was a prisoner at dachau concentration camp. he remembers watching through a hole in the wall of a cattle car as american soldiers rolled in with tanks. to me, joshua recalls, the american soldiers were proof that god exists, and they came down from the sky."}
{"original": "i began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on d-day in the second world war. one of them was herman zeitchick. but there is more to herman's story. a year after he stormed the beaches of normandy, herman was one of those american soldiers who helped liberate dachau. he was one of the americans who helped rescue joshua from that hell on earth. almost 75 years later, herman and joshua are both together in the gallery tonight -- seated side-by- side, here in the home of american freedom. herman and joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire nation."}
{"original": "when american soldiers set out beneath the dark skies over the english channel in the early hours of d-day, 1944, they were just young men of 18 and 19, hurtling on fragile landing craft toward the most momentous battle in the history of war. they did not know if they would survive the hour. they did not know if they would grow old. but they knew that america had to prevail. their cause was this nation, and generations yet unborn. why did they do it? they did it for america -- they did it for us."}
{"original": "everything that has come since -- our triumph over communism, our giant leaps of science and discovery, our unrivaled progress toward equality and justice -- all of it is possible thanks to the blood and tears and courage and vision of the americans who came before."}
{"original": "think of this capitol -- think of this very chamber, where lawmakers before you voted to end slavery, to build the railroads and the highways, to defeat fascism, to secure civil rights, to face down an evil empire."}
{"original": "here tonight we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. you have come from the rocky shores of maine and the volcanic peaks of hawaii; from the snowy woods of wisconsin and the red deserts of arizona; from the green farms of kentucky and the golden beaches of california. together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history. what will we do with this moment? how will we be remembered?"}
{"original": "i ask the men and women of this congress: look at the opportunities before us! our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. our most exciting journeys still await. our biggest victories are still to come. we have not yet begun to dream. we must choose whether we are defined by our differences -- or whether we dare to transcend them. we must choose whether we squander our inheritance -- or whether we proudly declare that we are americans: we do the incredible. we defy the impossible. we conquer the unknown. this is the time to re-ignite the american imagination. this is the time a to search for the tallest summit, and set our sights on the brightest star. this is the time to rekindle the bonds of love and loyalty and memory that link us together as citizens, as neighbors, as patriots. this is our future -- our fate -- and our choice to make. i am asking you to choose greatness. no matter the trials we face, no matter the challenges to come, we must go forward together. we must keep america first in our hearts. we must keep freedom alive in our souls. and we must always keep faith in america's destiny -- that one nation, under god, must be the hope and the promise and the light and the glory among all the nations of the world! thank you. god bless you, god bless america, and goodnight!"}
{"original": "texas gop sen. ted cruz, a potential 2016 presidential candidate, made clear this weekend his foreign policy strategy for dealing with the militant group islamic state: bomb them back to the stone age."}
{"original": "they want to go back and reject modernity, he said. well, i think we should help them. we ought to bomb them back to the stone age."}
{"original": "cruz made his remarks saturday in dallas at a summit for americans for prosperity, the political arm of the billionaire gop donors charles and david koch."}
{"original": "the influential gathering of conservatives also included speeches by a few other potential 2016 gop white house candidates -- kentucky sen. rand paul, texas gov. rick perry and indiana gov. mike pence."}
{"original": "cruz also staked out his position on such domestic issues as the u.s. border-illegal immigration crisis and the affordable care act."}
{"original": "in the year 2017, a republican president in the rose garden is going to sign a bill repealing every word of obamacare, he said."}
{"original": "cruz joked about inviting president obama to the southern border to see where thousands of unaccompanied immigrant children have poured into the country. the president declined such an invitation from perry."}
{"original": "i figured out the only way there is a chance in heaven he might come (is if) i'm inviting him to come to a golf course, cruz said."}
{"original": "a crowd of more than 3,000 at a hotel ballroom serenaded him with calls of run ted, run."}
{"original": "however, cruz ignored direct questions about a presidential campaign when he met with reporters after the speech."}
{"original": "he told conservatives in the audience, each of you is here because we are part of a grassroots fire that is sweeping this country. … we are building an army."}
{"original": "on friday, perry and paul pounced on obama's we don't have a strategy yet comments earlier in the week regarding the violent militant faction of islamic state attacking cities in iraq."}
{"original": "yesterday, the president admitted he had no strategy to deal with isis, perry said, drawing hoots and hisses from a packed convention hall. the deepening chaos in iraq, syria, gaza, and ukraine is all the clear and compelling evidence the world needs of a president one step behind, lurching from crisis to crisis."}
{"original": "paul fired up the audience by suggesting that obama's lack of leadership showed he'd been on the job too long."}
{"original": "republicans criticizing obama's foreign policy is nothing new, but there are deepening divisions within the gop over how to move forward."}
{"original": "the broader debate pits those who favor the gop's traditional muscular foreign policy -- a group that includes perry and florida sen. marco rubio -- and those, like paul and cruz, who prefer a smaller international footprint. the so-called isolationist approach plays well with grassroots activists and a war-weary public, but worries many republican officials and donors who prefer an aggressive american role in world affairs."}
{"original": "the intra-party divisions largely weren't much on display at the americans for prosperity event, but will become clearer as the crowded group of possible presidential candidates tries to distinguish themselves in the coming months."}
{"original": "pence didn't mention obama's comments. he told the associated press afterward only that the president of the united states is the commander of chief of our armed forces. i wouldn't want to prejudge what his military advisers counsel."}
{"original": "the associated press contributed to this report."}
{"original": "it's been two years since the end of the obama presidency and in that span, the mainstream democratic party has made an extreme shift to the far left. in 2019 the democrats have put their weight behind increased taxes, universal health care, open borders, and third-trimester abortions."}
{"original": "how do we account for this radical trend?"}
{"original": "a journalist friend of mine reports that his generally liberal college son was somewhat somnolent and indifferent during the obama years, lulled into quiescence by liberal policies and moderate talk. then came trump. a huge splash of cold water hit his face and he and his cohorts were galvanized into angry action."}
{"original": "click here to read more from bill bennett"}
{"original": "flannery o'connor wrote that sometimes you have to, push back against the age as hard as it pushes against you. trump pushed hard, and the liberals have become the left, pushing back even harder."}
{"original": "the problem is that their blind indignation for president trump is clouding their judgment and pushing them to the brink. they're punching back at their magnified perception of trump, not his actual policies."}
{"original": "trump's policies are conservative, but mostly traditionally so with a good dash of moderation and compromise."}
{"original": "this isn't a newtonian 'equal and opposite reaction' by the democrats. it's unequal and opposite and may cost them dearly."}
{"original": "trump's policies are conservative, but mostly traditionally so with a good dash of moderation and compromise."}
{"original": "it's not a new concept for democrats to favor higher taxes than republicans. what is new, however, is the momentum around dramatic tax increases for the super wealthy, which would have a large impact on the economy."}
{"original": "specifically, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-ny, is proposing a 70 percent marginal tax rate on individuals making $10 million a year or more. sen. elizabeth warren, d-mass., is proposing a 2 percent annual tax on citizens with a net worth of over $50 billion. currently, the highest tax rate in the us is 37 percent. it was 39.6 percent under obama."}
{"original": "as it always does, tax increases on the very wealthy will lead to tax increases on the not so wealthy and middle class in order to even approach getting the revenues needed for the left's hugely expensive schemes."}
{"original": "building on the socialist momentum from her party, 2020 democratic presidential candidate kamala harris, d-calif., has said she wants to do away with private health insurance in favor of medicare for all. unlike with obamacare, health insurance companies are not on board here and will fight this tooth and nail."}
{"original": "sen. chuck schumer, d-n.y., was on record as supporting border and immigration control, including walls and barriers in 2009. now its chief opponent, he recently tweeted, the shutdown cost the u.s. economy $11 billion…what a devastating & pointless exercise this has been. with an estimated cost of $5 billion dollars, schumer could have approved the wall, saved $6 billion dollars, avoided a shutdown, and been in line with his party's stance on immigration reform during the obama administration."}

{"original": "that's quite an assertion, especially given the broad consensus among economists that minimum-wage hikes actually cause job losses for the least skilled. a congressional budget office study examined the effect of the $15 minimum wage that enjoys broad support among the democratic presidential candidates. the cbo said, under the $15 option, 1.3 million workers who would otherwise be employed would be jobless in an average week in 2025. 1.3 million workers not working is the median estimate. the cbo estimates that job losses could be lower or as high as 3.7 million."}

{"original": "in a paper on the effect of the minimum wage, neumark wrote: the potential benefits of higher minimum wages come from the higher wages for affected workers, some of whom are in poor or low-income families."}
{"original": "the potential downside is that a higher minimum wage may discourage employers from using the low-wage, low-skill workers that minimum wages are intended to help. if minimum wages reduce employment of low-skill workers, then minimum wages are not a 'free lunch' with which to help poor and low-income families, but instead pose a tradeoff of benefits for some versus costs for others."}
{"original": "both the journal of epidemiology and the lancet studies caution that many factors go into why someone commits suicide, and association is not necessarily causation. but the consensus among economists is the higher the minimum wage, the greater the job losses caused by the mandated wage hike. it certainly could be true that increasing the minimum wage decreases suicides among the so-called unskilled who work. but what about those who lose their jobs, or do not get a job, due to a minimum wage hike that prices of them out of the market?"}

{"original": "that's bad enough. but pelosi has also had to deal with the mess created by another left-wing insurgent, rep. ilhan omar, d-minn., whose anti-semitic remarks have exposed a virulent strain of anti-jewish hatred that is gripping the left. a resolution condemning omar's anti-semitism faced such intense internal opposition that pelosi had to replace it with a watered-down version that condemned not just anti-semitism but also all forms of hate -- including anti-muslim discrimination and bigotry against minorities -- rendering it meaningless."}
{"original": "pelosi's next move was to try and head off a suicidal impeachment drive gaining strength on her left flank. anticipating that special counsel robert mueller may not find incontrovertible evidence that trump engaged in a criminal conspiracy with russia to steal the 2016 election, pelosi announced that unless there's something so compelling and overwhelming and bipartisan, i don't think we should go down that path. that won't stop rep. rashida tlaib, d-mich., who vowed on taking office to impeach the motherf -- er and has announced she plans to introduce a resolution to start impeachment proceedings."}

{"original": "billionaire former new york mayor michael bloomberg, a likely opponent to warren in the crowded democratic 2020 presidential field, has said of her proposal, the constitution lets you impose income taxes only, so i think it's unconstitutional."}
{"original": "she fired back that billionaires like him and possible independent candidate howard schultz want to keep a rigged system in place that benefits only them and their buddies. … not on my watch."}
{"original": "warren has offered two letters from 17 law professors defending the constitutionality of the proposed tax."}
{"original": "the issue comes down to the type of tax in question. the levy could be considered a direct tax imposed on people or the ownership of property, as opposed to an indirect tax on the use of property, such as buying, selling or transferring."}
{"original": "if that's the case, then warren would run into the tricky issue of apportionment — taxing residents differently based on the state where they live."}
{"original": "article 1, section 9 of the u.s. constitution states, no capitation, or other direct, tax shall be laid, unless in proportion to the census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken."}
{"original": "so, the government can tax services or property transfers, but can only tax net worth if the tax is applied to each state in proportion to its census population, argue critics of the warren plan. making a tax proportional to population is called apportionment."}
{"original": "this is how it might work: state a and state b have the same population -- but a large number of wealthy people live in state a, while only a tiny number of rich people live in state b. the tiny number of rich people in state b would have to pay the same amount as all the rich people in state a. so, individually, rich people living in poor states would be taxed more than rich people in rich states, according to an analysis by devin watkins, attorney with the competitive enterprise institute. for example, under apportionment, the wealthy in mississippi would pay far more than the wealthy in connecticut."}
{"original": "a small state with a lot of rich people would not pay as much as a small state with only a few rich people, watkins told fox news."}
{"original": "warren and legal experts backing her plan say it wouldn't require apportionment, but the matter would face a constitutional fight similar to the obamacare battle, said ilya shapiro, director of constitutional studies at the cato institute, a libertarian think tank."}
{"original": "simply a tax on wealth would be a direct tax that would have to be apportioned among the states, so it would probably have to be done as changing tax rates, depending on how much wealth you have, or some other kind of legal gimmick, shapiro told fox news. then the question is raised: how does the irs determine your wealth? are you supposed to self-report? how does it count?"}
{"original": "irs enforcement raises a separate issue."}
{"original": "no one seems to be looking at the practicality of the proposal. it's like whack-a-mole. it's easy to avoid taxes, said eileen j. o'connor, former assistant attorney general for the tax division of the justice department. a valuation of what something is worth can be based on how much someone is willing to pay for it. governments, estates and lawyers are always arguing over the value."}
{"original": "the first of the two letters advocating warren's plan points to the 1895 ruling in knowlton v. moore, regarding taxing inheritances, and concludes, it follows that your wealth tax proposal is plainly constitutional."}
{"original": "knowlton confronted an inheritance tax that directly hit the property itself, said the letter signed by professors from yale, columbia and american university among others. like your proposal, this wealth tax was progressive, increasing the rate from .75% to 3% as inherited property increased in value from $10,000 to $1 million. nevertheless, the court unanimously held that the tax was 'indirect.'"}
{"original": "the second letter contends, we believe such a law would be a constitutional exercise of congress' article i power. … constitutional text and history demonstrate that 'direct' tax is best interpreted as a narrow category that would not include a net worth tax."}
{"original": "however, more recent supreme court precedent strongly suggests warren's plan would be a direct tax, said watkins of cei."}
{"original": "watkins said the knowlton ruling on inheritance dealt with transfer of a property, irrelevant to the warren proposal on net worth. the only supreme court precedent that would back up warren's tax plan, he said, is the 1796 ruling in hylton v. united states, that held taxes on carriages were not a direct tax, and only taxes on people or land were."}
{"original": "however, the hylton precedent was overturned by the 1895 case of pollock v. farmers' loan & trust company, in which the high court held taxes on personal property, or on the income of personal property, are likewise direct taxes."}
{"original": "click here to get the fox news app"}
{"original": "this ruling prompted the eventual passage of the 16th amendment—which excluded taxes on income from requiring apportionment. however, this did not change the pollock ruling on personal property, watkins noted."}

{"original": "on the roster: tom coburn, r.i.p. - trump extends shutdown through end of april - as bernie fades, ocasio-cortez positions for future - president tries to pit cuomo against biden - look out below"}
{"original": "it wasn't really until the obamacare battles of 2009-10 that a lot of people in washington started to realize that sen. tom coburn wasn't like all the others."}
{"original": "coburn, a family physician from muskogee, okla., put himself at the center of the fight against what would become the 44th president's signature legislation. coburn worked tirelessly to try to stop the law, which he said was a policy disaster and fiscal abomination."}
{"original": "my mission is to frame this health care debate in terms of the fiscal ruin of this country, he said at the time."}
{"original": "and yet, he was a good friend of barack obama, whom he had first met at orientation for freshmen senators elected in 2004. coburn, 13 years obama's senior, had already served three terms in the house while obama had just skated into town, but they hit it off."}
{"original": "coburn took heat from some radicals in his own party for the friendship, including his physical embrace of the new president after obama delivered his first address to a joint session of congress."}
{"original": "at a time when republicans were defining themselves in the totality of their opposition to obama – when some were even suggesting he was a secret kenyan or a stealth muslim – coburn was proud of his relationship with the president."}
{"original": "as he told the oklahoman at the time: you need to separate the difference in political philosophy versus friendship. how better to influence somebody than love them?"}
{"original": "but coburn never, ever wavered on his principles or his purpose. we suspect he would have been thrilled to have read the description of himself in the first paragraph of his nyt obituary on sunday: an ultraconservative … who in 16 years in congress crusaded for limited government, using a rule-book technicality to block so many bills that frustrated legislators called him 'dr. no.'"}
{"original": "he was certainly an ultraconservative – social and, lord knows, fiscal – and loved that word, no. so much so, that he hung it, framed and larger than life, above his desk in his senate office."}
{"original": "it's worth thinking about why this person who took so much pride in being loving – who delivered babies for free when some suggested senate ethics payment could constitute an improper emolument – was so proud of saying no. why did this man, who defined himself by his service to his family, patients, nation and creator, take such pride in frustrating the ambitions of his fellow lawmakers?"}
{"original": "for all of the lavish, bipartisan encomiums offered after his passing, coburn many times in his career found himself where rep. thomas massie, r-ky., was on friday when he tried to force house members to record their votes on a $2 trillion bailout bill: the most hated man in washington."}
{"original": "for all we talk about the depth of partisan division in this city, the truth is that there is broad bipartisan accord on how congress should conduct itself in regard to its most important job. both parties want to spend, spend, spend. and if you get in the way of that, you will find yourself the enemy of leaders on both sides of the aisle."}
{"original": "so why did coburn do it? was he a miser? did he not want to help the economy with federal spending? did he want to deprive needy people of government services? was he just trying to get attention?"}
{"original": "in his 2014 farewell address in the senate, coburn offered this answer: the effort to rein in spending exposes where we lose our liberty and our essential freedoms."}
{"original": "or as he told mark leibovich in 2009, if you look historically, every great republic has died over fiscal issues. that is the biggest moral issue of our time."}
{"original": "coburn believed, like the founders, that it was wrong to burden future generations with the costs we are unwilling to pay ourselves. to take on debts to win a war, to cope with an emergency (like an epidemic) or some crucial task that will benefit future generations is one thing, but not just to avoid paying the bills."}
{"original": "but there was a larger moralism in his objection to pork barrel spending financed by debt: to him, it was illiberal."}
{"original": "coburn was a small-government conservative, an always-rare species that now appears to be nearly extinct in washington. the constitution and the courts provide the tallest guardrails for the expansion of government power, but in practical terms, there has been no greater limitation to the power of governments than their need to raise revenues."}
{"original": "there would have been no magna carta if king john could have borrowed against the social security trust fund to finance his continental misadventures."}
{"original": "the remaining budget hawks left in this rookery expound often on the practical reasons to control spending: inflation, the insolvency of entitlement programs, being beholden to foreign creditors and on and on. but unlike coburn, they're not making moral points."}
{"original": "if, as the leaders in both parties seem to agree, deficits don't matter in the era of the new liquidity, the practical arguments can be shooed away as long as the predicted consequences aren't at hand."}
{"original": "whether you agreed with him or not, coburn was asking a different, more challenging question: if the government never needs to raise taxes or cut other programs to finance its initiatives, what real limits are there on the expansion of government power beyond the courts?"}
{"original": "if the government never needs to make hard fiscal decisions that might provoke a response from the governed – a tax hike, a spending cut, a change in priorities – then the government has only obtained an empty consent."}
{"original": "coburn's example of separating the political from the personal is a good one. just as good, though, was his willingness to let big ideas inform even his smallest actions."}
{"original": "that is how real debate happens."}

{"original": "warren – a former front-runner in the democratic nomination race who saw her poll numbers slip even before disappointing third- and fourth-place finishes in the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary – was a strong supporter of a government-run medicare-for-all health care system, although her stance on a single-payer plan has moderated in recent months."}

{"original": "while frustrating, it should not be surprising. federal legislation is simply one front in the democrats' ongoing war to change the rules by which we vote to make it easier for democrats to win (since they have realized quite correctly that most americans are not interested in medicare-for-all, socialized everything, and sacrificing thousands of jobs on the altar of climate change)."}
{"original": "democrats have been trying to change the rules for elections for years through the courts. consider what they are doing this week in wisconsin. wisconsin had an election scheduled for tuesday for a variety of important races. the governor delayed it monday morning, but that evening the wisconsin supreme court determined he had exceeded his authority under state law. so now the election is going forward as scheduled, for thousands of races."}
{"original": "what americans need during this time of crisis is confidence in our election systems and outcomes and the ability to vote safely while still being confident that their votes count."}
{"original": "democrats, led by democratic national committee lawyer marc elias, had already sued to change some of the rules governing the election in light of the covid-19 pandemic."}
{"original": "normally wisconsin requires absentee ballots to be received by election day to be counted. this is a common-sense rule in many states. it allows ballots to be counted quickly, gives finality to the election, and prevents shenanigans with ballot harvesting and attempts to change the result after election day."}
{"original": "the democrats asked the district court to allow absentee ballots postmarked by election day to be counted even if received after, due to delays in processing a large number of absentee ballot requests and speculative delays in the mail. instead of just granting the requested relief, the court went even further. its order allowed absentee ballots received by next monday, april 13, to be counted, regardless of when postmarked."}
{"original": "that meant that people could vote almost a week after election day."}
{"original": "while the democrats did not ask for that rule change (probably because it would have been a ridiculous request), when the court granted it, they defended it on appeal and claimed that it was really what they wanted all along."}

{"original": "democrats understand that not only do elections have consequences, but the rules governing elections also have consequences. that is why they leave no stone unturned in their efforts to undermine election integrity protections. they see this pandemic as a great opportunity to advance their election procedure agenda: ballot harvesting, absentee ballots submitted after election day, no voter identity verification, same-day voter registration without eligibility confirmation, and so on."}

{"original": "approving tax cuts: as a candidate, trump promised to simplify the tax code and create massive cuts for americans. he signed the $1.5 trillion tax overhaul with the most extensive rewrite of the tax code in decades in december 2017. it cut the corporate tax rate and doubled the standard deduction, among numerous other changes."}
{"original": "exiting from the iran deal: calling it decaying and rotten, trump withdrew the u.s. from the iran nuclear deal in may 2018. by november, the trump administration said it restored previously lifted sanctions on iran. trump had promised to tear up the deal while on the campaign trail."}
{"original": "upping nato nation spending: trump often criticized nato countries for not paying their fair share and had suggested he would only come to the defense of nations that fulfilled their financial obligations. after some – at-times controversial – discussions between trump and other leaders, nato leaders pledged their unwavering commitment to boost defense spending in july 2018."}

{"original": "blocking white house officials' foreign lobbying: one of the very first campaign promises trump kept was banning white house officials for life from lobbying on behalf of a foreign government. this, he achieved by way of an executive order."}
{"original": "exiting from the paris climate accord: as a candidate, trump promised to cancel the paris climate agreement, a pact by nearly 200 nations to voluntarily reduce their greenhouse gas emissions to fight climate change. former president barack obama used his power as president to join the agreement without a vote in the legislature. trump announced in june 2017 that the u.s. was pulling out of the agreement."}
{"original": "bombing isis: trump famously vowed to bomb the s--- out of isis as a candidate. in april 2017, the u.s. military dropped its largest non-nuclear bomb on an isis tunnel complex in afghanistan."}
{"original": "moving a key embassy: in may 2018, trump fulfilled a key campaign promise by opening the u.s. embassy in jerusalem and recognizing the city as the true capital of israel. the international community largely does not recognize jerusalem as israel's capital as it is claimed by both israel and the palestinians. previously, the u.s. kept its embassy in tel aviv, like other countries."}
{"original": "ending obama's health care law: trump often promised to completely repeal the affordable care act, widely known as obamacare. that hasn't happened – despite multiple legislative attempts – but trump has dismantled portions of the landmark health care law throughout his presidency. his administration rolled back the individual and contraceptive mandates, paved the way for alternatives to health insurance and ended certain cost-sharing subsidy payments."}
{"original": "reducing north korea's nuclear arsenal: trump said he would talk to north korean leader kim jong un regarding his nuclear arsenal during the campaign – and the pair did meet in june 2018. however, there's been little tangible progress on the vague denuclearization agreement the two reached at that meeting in singapore. in fact, since then, several private analysts have published reports detailing continuing north korean development of nuclear and missile technology."}
{"original": "reversing obama's cuba policies: during the campaign, trump promised to roll back the concessions his predecessor gave to cuba. in 2017, trump reinstated some restrictions, but largely left many of obama's measures in place."}
{"original": "building a border wall with mexico's money: trump's two-year anniversary comes amid the nation's longest-ever government shutdown as he and democrats are at an impasse over funding for a border wall. the president has demanded more than $5 billion for the wall, which was one of his most oft-touted campaign promises. trump also repeatedly said mexico would pay for the wall. it remains unclear whether trump will make progress on building more sections of a border wall during his time in office, but he has seemingly acknowledged mexico won't directly pay for the project (though the president still maintains that money resulting from a new trade pact with mexico can still cover costs)."}

{"original": "now, i'm going to give you a vocabulary term: budget reconciliation. you're going to hear a lot about that over the next couple of weeks. schumer and liberals may not be able to advance much of their legislative agenda due to filibusters. but, they still have one annual option to advance certain legislation with fiscal impacts: it's called budget reconciliation. this is the same gambit democrats used in 2010 to pass the final version of obamacare when they lacked the votes to overcome a filibuster. republicans also used the same tactic to repeal and replace obamacare – but could never come up with enough votes."}
{"original": "and, it has been said in recent days that democrats are increasingly looking to budget reconciliation to potentially pass the next covid package."}
{"original": "budget reconciliation essentially robs the senate of its two major features: unlimited debate and an unlimited amendment process. in other words, no filibuster. but, budget reconciliation can only be used on fiscal measures, such as tax policy. obamacare qualified because it dealt with all sorts of taxation issues. guns? doubtful. immigration? that's pushing it, although there could be tax and budget issues for new citizens. statehood for dc? maybe an outside chance because you are dealing with taxation and representation issues for 700,000 americans. but that could be a stretch."}
{"original": "it depends on how creative they can get."}
{"original": "this is more art than science."}
{"original": "and, you can pass something with only 51 votes in the senate."}
{"original": "in order to have a budget reconciliation vehicle to use for legislation, the house and senate must first adopt a budget. in fact, they could do this as a shell. this process probably takes a few weeks, even if you are moving at an accelerated pace."}
{"original": "you only get one budget reconciliation package a year – providing you can adopt a budget."}
{"original": "now, as we said, there is an issue of policy needing to be fiscal in nature to qualify for budget reconciliation. in other words, you can't put a bill which deals with federal lands policy in budget reconciliation. and, it must be budget neutral. the measure cannot add to the deficit."}
{"original": "talks between mcconnell and schumer stalled over power-sharing agreement"}
{"original": "budget reconciliation has more consequences for the senate than the house. debate time is capped at 20 hours and restricts amendments. such strictures for debate and amendments aren't rare in the house. but budget reconciliation curbs senate filibusters. it takes 60 votes to hurdle a filibuster – often twice – on garden variety bills. senators can block an effort to summon a piece of legislation to the floor and again to halt debate. but the elite nature of a budget reconciliation package prohibits senators from gumming up the works at either stage. it takes a mere simple majority to approve amendments and adopt the final product. in fact, senators may only make points of order (suggesting that the senate isn't operating properly) to certain amendments or other provisions in the package and then vote to waive the budget act. but waiving the budget act requires a supermajority of 60 votes."}
{"original": "it's one thing to roll out reconciliation for standard-issue budgets. but it's a high parliamentary art form to use reconciliation for other controversial policy goals. that's where lawmakers take advantage of reconciliation's special rules – and sidestep a filibuster which otherwise would have torched a stubborn piece of legislation."}
{"original": "but caveat emptor. there is an inherent landmine which comes with reconciliation. it's called the byrd rule, the namesake of the legendary, late senate majority leader robert byrd (d-wv). the practical impact of the byrd rule is that extraneous legislative priorities can't fall under reconciliation. some examples include whether a provision cuts or raises taxes or revenues, adds to the deficit or isn't related to budgetary matters. senators may make a point of order to flag a non-compliant provision. as mentioned earlier, it takes 60 votes to waive the budget act and to overcome the byrd rule."}

{"original": "the bill was introduced by reps. pramila jayapal, d-wash., and debbie dingell, d-mich., and is co-sponsored by more than 100 house democrats including rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y., showing the extent to which the policy has drifted from the fringe of the party to the mainstream."}
{"original": "bernie sanders says 'no' to americans who want to keep private insurance under 'medicare-for-all'"}
{"original": "it would move america to a virtual single-payer system, like systems used in the u.k. and canada, and promises to prevent healthcare corporations from overcharging for the costs of their services and profiting off illness and injury."}
{"original": "it's time to put people's health over profit. our bill will cover everyone. not just those who are fortunate enough to have employer-sponsored insurance, jayapal said in a statement. not just children. not just seniors. not just those who are healthy. everyone. because healthcare is a human right. we will need every single person in the country to help us, to stand with us, to organize and to fight for this."}
{"original": "everybody in, nobody out, jayapal said at a press conference, according to the guardian, where she hailed the bill as a complete transformation of our healthcare system."}
{"original": "the legislation, though, revives a controversy over what such a health care overhaul would mean for private insurance. under the new proposal, private insurance plans could only be used to supplement coverage that is offered by the government, for any additional benefits not covered by this act."}
{"original": "but the text of the proposal makes clear that private policies would largely be eliminated. one clause in the bill makes it unlawful for a private health insurer to sell health insurance coverage that duplicates the benefits provided under this act. the text also prohibits employers from doing the same."}
{"original": "america's health insurance plans, an advocacy group for the private health insurance industry, said the vast majority of americans are happy with their coverage as it is."}
{"original": "americans want to improve what's working for them and fix what's broken. this bill will hurt patients, consumers, and taxpayers: americans will pay more, to wait longer, for worse care, spokeswoman kristine grow told fox news in an email. let's focus on real solutions that deliver real results, not a one-size-fits-all government system."}
{"original": "republicans immediately painted the plan as disastrous, pointing to studies that suggest the price tag could be as high as $32 trillion."}
{"original": "medicare for all will eliminate private insurance, make trips to the dmv look like a caribbean vacation and cost taxpayers trillions. good luck to the vulnerable house democrats who will be forced to defend this $32 trillion boondoggle, national republican congressional committee spokesman michael mcadams said in a statement."}
{"original": "the legislation was quiet on the question of price. according to politico, jayapal said she plans to release a separate list of suggested funding mechanisms -- which include additional taxes or mandated employer contributions."}
{"original": "according to a fact sheet from dingell's office, the transition to medicare-for-all would take two years. the coverage would include all primary care, dental, vision, maternity and newborn care, prescription drugs, mental health services and others. it would also cover women's reproductive health services. the plan would appear to leave little that could be covered by private insurers."}
{"original": "the move marks a radical shift from former president barack obama's original pitch for obamacare -- where he falsely promised: if you like your plan, you can keep your plan. that statement was eventually labeled lie of the year by politifact."}
{"original": "house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., has not co-sponsored the bill, but has indicated she would allow hearings on the bill in an apparent nod to the party's left flank. the legislation would almost certainly be dead on arrival in the republican-controlled senate."}

{"original": "sen. kamala harris, d-calif., was asked by cnn host jake tapper in january if people could keep their current health care plan under her medicare-for-all plan. she indicated that they couldn't, suggesting she wants to move toward a single-payer system rather than a mere expansion of medicare."}
{"original": "kamala harris under fire after calling for abolition of private health care plans: 'that not american'"}
{"original": "well, listen, the idea is that everyone gets access to medical care. and you don't have to go through the process of going through an insurance company, having them give you approval, going through the paperwork, all of the delay that may require, harris told tapper."}
{"original": "who among us has not had that situation? she continued. where you got to wait for approval, and the doctor says, 'well i don't know if your insurance company is going to cover this.' let's eliminate all of that. let's move on."}
{"original": "on monday, fellow 2020 hopeful sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., was asked on cnn if, under his plan, people could keep their private plans."}
{"original": "no, sanders responded mid-question as he shook his head. what will change in their plans is the color of their card. so, instead of having a blue cross/blue shield card, instead of having a united health insurance card, they're gonna have a medicare card."}

{"original": "during the first day of the house freshman orientation, ocasio-cortez joined protesters conducting a sit-in at the office of house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif. then ocasio-cortez led seminars, giving democrats tips on how to improve their social media interactions. ocasio-cortez is now one of the most recognizable figures in american politics, right up there with president trump, pelosi and sen. bernie sanders, i-vt."}

{"original": "some portray the ideas of ocasio-cortez radical. extreme. socialist. revolutionary. aoc wields an innate ability to convulse the political system. to rattle traditionalists on both sides of the aisle. to even scare some."}
{"original": "are the ideas radical? that's in the eye of the beholder. but the story of america is based on radicals. those who balked at the crown. how radical was the idea of devolving power from a monarch to not one but two legislative branches? alexander hamilton's radical idea of a nationalized financial system, binding the states and debts together? radical moves by lincoln, fdr and martin luther king, jr.?"}
{"original": "it's too early to assess ocasio-cortez's staying power and if her ideas will fundamentally alter the system. but for now, ocasio-cortez is one of the biggest things in politics. is she a game changer? ask us in a few years. america's political coastline is flecked with the jetsam of flashes-in-the-pan, one-hit-wonders and sundry political flameouts. but by definition, the disruptors who evoke the most change in america usually are cast as radicals and dangerous. it's not fair. but that's because the system is crafted to resist change. therefore change appears so radical."}
{"original": "here's what we do know: ocasio-cortez may be cutting edge now. but she won't always be. as the eagles sing, they will never forget you till somebody new comes along. that lyric is a guaranteed certainty in politics. the attacks on ocasio-cortez are nothing new. political leaders who are effective, dial up a resonant sweet spot or break through the noise are almost always targeted – often in ad hominem fashion."}
{"original": "pelosi knows this as well as anyone. some thought that pelosi may be on the outs last fall, arguing time passed her by. by the same token, republicans revealed at portraying pelosi as too liberal for democrats. just last week, house minority leader kevin mccarthy, r-calif., declared that pelosi is out of step with her party."}
{"original": "music critics deride ac/dc as a band which recorded the same album 17 times. ac/dc doesn't dispute that charge. in fact, guitarist angus young embraces it. ac/dc will tell you they have a bona fide formula which works and sells records. so why change?"}
{"original": "republicans have long pilloried pelosi. it's an effort to toxify her as the face of house democrats - taking pains to link more moderate democrats to a san francisco liberal. much like ac/dc, republicans have cut the same album about pelosi 17 times. too liberal. passed obamacare. cap and trade. used her special plane to jet around the country. but republicans maintain the pelosi strategy because it works. they don't need to find a new sound for the next album. republicans are naturally after pelosi again because she's speaker of the house and the gop is mired in the minority. so, they'll haul out everything they have against pelosi."}
{"original": "pelosi has withstood the challenge after years of attacks. that's why the knives are out for her again."}
{"original": "this also explains why the knives are out for ocasio-cortez, too. she's different. she has a lot of supporters now. it's natural that opponents – both inside the republican and democratic ranks – angle for her. that's one of the ways political opponents undercut political figures and introduce a new kid in town. if someone steps too close to the fire, there are plenty of people willing to shove them into the inferno."}
{"original": "the same phenomenon is true right now in the democratic 2020 presidential sweepstakes. lots of new kids in town there: sens. cory booker, d-n.j., kamala harris, d-calif., elizabeth warren, d-mass., kirsten gillibrand, d-n.y., and rep. tulsi gabbard, d-hawaii. and those are just the ones on capitol hill who are either running or quasi-officially eyeing a bid. the democratic primary will be brutal."}

{"original": "as for the four brave souls who voted present, including unwavering trump lackeys rep. matt gaetz, r-fla., and rep. paul gosar, r-ariz., it will only get harder for them to weasel out of actually picking a side. of course, maybe i'm not giving the other side enough credit. after all, based on the vote tally, house republicans are more unified about making the mueller report public than just about anything else. heck, even repealing obamacare got a few no votes."}
{"original": "either way, make no mistake – the battle over the release of the mueller report is going to get worse before it gets better. i suspect president trump will only want a portion of it released – a summary memo of some sort, that he'll argue proves his point that there was no collusion, even if in fact it does no such thing, just as he's done during the manafort sentencing."}

{"original": "president trump appeared to mock house speaker nancy pelosi this week by gleefully handing out souvenir pens at the usmca signing ceremony -- a move that came after pelosi was slammed for handing out souvenir pens with her name on them on the day she signed the resolution to transmit two articles of impeachment against trump to the senate."}
{"original": "pelosi, d-calif., gave out the commemorative pens jan. 15 to a number of house democrats who were involved in impeachment, a stark contrast from what she had repeatedly said was a somber and prayerful act. this led a number of commentators to condemn her as hypocritical and tone-deaf."}
{"original": "trump signs usmca, paving way for job market boom"}
{"original": "you know what you hand out pens for? accomplishments. like, say, signing a historic trade deal with china, elizabeth harrington, a spokeswoman for the republican national committee, tweeted back then in response to pelosi's gesture. so it's fitting that democrats are handing out pens for their sole accomplishment: impeachment. democrats have done nothing for the american people."}
{"original": "trump, who was celebrating one of his largest economic policy victories with the signing of the usmca trade deal between the u.s., mexico and canada -- he promised to renegotiate nafta during his campaign -- seemed to call back to pelosi's controversial moment as he shoveled handfuls of pens at lookers-on wednesday."}
{"original": "pelosi hands out souvenir pens, dems slammed for gloating as house delivers trump impeachment articles"}
{"original": "handing out ceremonial pens is a common tradition among american elected officials as when a president or other leader uses a pen to sign a historical document, it also becomes historical. president barack obama, for example, used 22 pens to sign his signature piece of legislation, the affordable care act, also known as obamacare."}
{"original": "the former president didn't catch heat for that celebratory act as the groundbreaking legislation he boosted became law, but obama had not made it a point to wear dark colors for the solemn act of signing the aca, as pelosi did with impeachment."}

{"original": "byron york, chief political correspondent for the washington examiner, reacted on the story with martha maccallum to president trump's fox news town hall, and said the president came across relaxed."}
{"original": "here he was much more relaxed. and it was interesting to see him defend his administration, certainly on coronavirus and on a number of other issues, said some really interesting things about obamacare, york told maccallum. [trump] said that he had basically inherited the carcass of obamacare and would like to kill it altogether if republicans could somehow come up with something better, which they haven't been able to do."}

{"original": "the fox news contributor also reacted to the president answering questions about the wall on the southern border with mexico."}
{"original": "most of it, by the way, is putting new wall in place of dilapidated old fencing that could easily be gotten over. so it's replacing virtually no, no barrier with a real barrier, york said. so that's progress. but the president has to talk about that because this was one of his biggest campaign promises in 2016."}
{"original": "the green new deal is certainly worthy of its color if nothing else. it would cost an unfathomable amount of green to fund this amorphous, flashy proposal. it's also a showcase for a young, wildly idealistic, and increasingly influential congresswoman."}
{"original": "some rational opponents of the deal have rightly and thoughtfully begun to pick apart these and additional proposals on health care, taxes, and other matters, pointing to practical unworkability and huge cost. but some conservatives have been dismissive, waiving them off as an anchor around liberal necks and a blessing to conservatives and president trump."}
{"original": "but such a view and attitude misses the larger point -- it is not the factual reliability of these socialist ideas that matters as much as their political appeal."}
{"original": "bill bennett: democrats have made a sharp left turn – here's what's behind it"}
{"original": "first, let's look at a couple of facts."}
{"original": "the since-stricken faq page for the green new deal promised to provide economic security to all who are unable or unwilling to work and it guaranteed health care for all. the core of the plan aims to make america run on entirely clean energy sources within the next ten years and sustain the whole population with a green economy."}
{"original": "the estimated cost of medicare for all and universal basic income are $3.2 trillion and $3.8 trillion annually, respectively. simply put, we cannot afford this."}
{"original": "yet millennials support the green new deal by 24 percentage points. this same poll found that 81 percent of people polled support the broad outline of the proposal. this summer, a reuters ipsos poll showed that 70 percent of americans support a single-payer health system. furthermore, a january harris hill poll showed that 59 percent of people support raising the top tax rate to 70 percent."}
{"original": "it's clear these proposals are not remotely plausible, yet they are getting considerable support from leading rank and file democrats, the media and large swaths of the public. why?"}
{"original": "it has to do with the power of an idea. victor hugo wrote, nothing is as powerful as an idea whose time has come. to update hugo, it's true even if it's a bad idea."}
{"original": "it would be easy to dismiss the plans and their supporters, given that they're unworkable, but that would not be wise. while these ideas may not be practical in the real world, as political ideas they're extremely viable. even if all the proposals die on the table, winning public opinion would provide return on investment."}
{"original": "again, smart conservatives have focused on debunking the feasibility of these proposals, but the greater alarm bell here isn't how crazy they are, but rather that they have wide-ranging support despite their obvious fatal flaws."}
{"original": "consider what house speaker nancy pelosi said, echoing her comments about obamacare in terms of embracing it without understanding it: the green dream, or whatever they call it, nobody knows what it is, but they're for it, right? just as the public, with pelosi, supported obamacare before knowing what was in it and passed it, the same thing could happen here."}
{"original": "we've seen democratic presidential hopefuls cory booker, elizabeth warren and kamala harris get behind the plan. this isn't a fringe movement."}
{"original": "this isn't an effective game plan from a policy perspective because it lacks tactical direction, but it can be powerful as a strategic political idea."}
{"original": "rep. ocasio cortez understands this power and has established herself as a true symbol of liberal millennial ideology."}
{"original": "this generation has been groomed in academia's leftist echo chamber and is now coming to age with a weak grasp on reality. it has been indoctrinated to revile the energy industry, corporate america, and our economic system as mechanisms of oppression. these lessons are now coming home to roost."}
{"original": "click here to get the fox news app"}
{"original": "there is a narrative being propagated by the liberal media that the right is obsessed with rep. ocasio cortez. that's not accurate or fair. republicans are tracking her rising star because she has a prominent, albeit severely misguided, voice. they would be fools not to examine her and her allies' agenda."}
{"original": "the democrats made a grave mistake in disregarding the populist momentum president trump generated during his election campaign. the republicans should not return the favor and discount the new extreme left's ideas, no matter how wrong they are."}

{"original": "cornell law school professor and media critic william a. jacobson told fox news that threats of 'deprogramming' trump supporters have become common among liberal journalists."}

{"original": "the hill columnist and fox news contributor joe concha made a similar observation of a growing trend among members of the media who have called for deprogramming and silencing 75 million americans."}
{"original": "this sort of rhetoric from couric — which comes across as so condescending and elitist — underscores the divide between our media, which primarily resides in new york and washington, and the rest of the country, which is moderate to center-right per multiple polls. and it's why the industry is so mistrusted and frowned upon, concha told fox news."}

{"original": "if you commit a crime and then you move, does that means we're not going to charge you with a crime because you're moving out of the neighborhood? i mean, it's ludicrous, couric told maher, who expressed opposition to trump's second impeachment. i think there have to be guardrails on presidential power. he incited violence. ... he was really, really inciting violence."}

{"original": "this isn't the first time couric has landed herself in political hot water. back in 2016, the journalist admitted to deceptively editing a focus group of gun rights enthusiasts for her pro-gun control documentary under the gun, which omitted responses to her question about how felons or terrorists could be prevented from purchasing a gun without background checks. their answers were replaced with several seconds of silence, portraying the group as ignorant of the subject."}

{"original": "but now, we hear, biden has a plan; politico reports that obama's former wingman will offer a shadow coronavirus briefing each day, to let the world know how he would handle the crisis and to call out what he deems are the lies and failures of the president."}
{"original": "heads-up to joe: this is not a good idea."}
{"original": "each day, the white house briefing details the distribution of medical supplies, new therapies being tested and vaccines under development, how the states are managing, the numerous ways our businesses are contributing to the fight and what the president and his team are doing to get the nation through this crisis."}
{"original": "in contrast, what will biden have to offer?"}
{"original": "we can get a glimpse by reviewing the comments he has already made about the coronavirus, starting with his march 15 debate with bernie sanders."}
{"original": "asked how he would manage the epidemic, biden proclaimed that, first, we have to do testing. to get test kits, biden said he would go to the world health organization which, he claimed offered the testing kits that they have available but we refused them."}
{"original": "that is simply false. according to factcheck.org, the u.s. was not offered test materials from the who because their kits are primarily intended for lower-income nations without testing capacity."}
{"original": "i encourage everyone to imagine the uproar which would have followed should the u.s. have demanded the who turn over scarce tests to our prosperous nation, stranding ghana or tunisia or some other nation that has actually received those materials from who. that was not going to happen."}
{"original": "next up: biden recommends more hospital beds and drive-through test sites. check and check: trump announced two days before the debate that his administration would arrange for drive-through testing, in partnership with large retailers like walmart and target, which would donate portions of their vast parking lots to facilitate the operations."}
{"original": "in addition, the president has directed navy hospital ships to help cities in crisis and ordered the military to set up hospital tents where needed."}
{"original": "in the debate, joe biden then proposed efforts that would mitigate the economic impact of the virus, including loans to small business owners and making sure that people who in fact lose their job, don't get a paycheck, can't pay their mortgage, are able to pay it, and pay them now, and do it now."}
{"original": "clearly at risk of losing an already fragile thread, the former v.p. shut himself down, concluding without evidence, i see my time is up here. you're going to hold us tightly, i assume, but that's what i would do. it is not the first time biden has thrown himself on the mercy of the debate moderators."}

{"original": "one wonders why the obama-biden administration failed to do that, especially since the h1n1 aka swine flu outbreak (and ebola) occurred under their watch, revealing many deficiencies."}
{"original": "biden frequently boasts that his management of the swine flu epidemic should convince voters that he is better equipped than trump to combat the coronavirus. that disease, which broke out in 2009, infected 60.8 million americans, hospitalized 274,000 and killed 12,469, according to the cdc."}

{"original": "what did the obama-biden administration do? according to biden, they frequently gathered in the situation room, occasions he references the way an old-timer reminisces about the country club bar."}
{"original": "in fact, biden had little to do with the response to the swine flu outbreak; rather, the cdc managed the epidemic. reviewing comments about the swine flu issued from the white house at various press briefings and statements in 2009, numerous officials are mentioned; vice president biden is not."}
{"original": "even as who declared a global pandemic, and even as hundreds of americans began to die, it took the cdc two months to hold its first public press conference on the disease. ten days later it was estimated that one million americans had been stricken."}
{"original": "the obama government never closed borders or insisted on social distancing. not until august did the government take stock of needed medical supplies; not until october did obama declare a national emergency. the contagion quickly spread; months later ongoing schools and summer camps become the epicenters of new outbreaks. even though tens of millions were sickened, the swine flu was not even mentioned in obama's 2010 state of the union address, which focused heavily on obamacare."}
{"original": "happily for the obama administration, and the country, the swine flu was closely related to other known viruses; consequently, a vaccine became available before the death toll could climb even higher. fortunately, too, for obama and biden, the outbreak occurred during the public's honeymoon with the newly-elected president."}

{"original": "steve hilton: stop this reckless reaction"}
{"original": "and that means that congress and the trump administration will likely craft a series of measures to react and respond to coronavirus in the coming months."}
{"original": "the $8.3 billion measure okayed last week was mostly for health, readiness and vaccine development. other measures will likely address everything else."}
{"original": "the easy word to bat around is a stimulus measure. in the most conventional sense, a stimulus is an infusion of government cash to jolt the economy. president obama and congressional democrats modeled their 2009 stimulus plan to bolster the economy after the new deal of the 1930s. president franklin delano roosevelt and lawmakers authored a series of measures which changed fiscal regulations, created social security and launched a massive development of public works projects to respond to the great depression."}
{"original": "it's too early to completely understand the scope of coronavrius and if a stimulus could be required here. but we are hearing chatter on capitol hill about tax cuts. more government spending. rebates for travel. but unlike in 2009, it's doubtful any legislation will simply be an infusion of cash centered around economic recovery."}
{"original": "infrastructure was a hallmark of the much-maligned 2009 stimulus plan engineered by democrats. there are regular emanations from the trump administration about infrastructure. infrastructure week is a running joke in washington. lawmakers from both sides of the aisle would love to pursue an infrastructure package. yet nothing ever happens. the trump administration and some republicans on capitol hill spoke about tax reform 2.0 long before coronavirus hit. but those discussions largely went nowhere. that's partly because democrats now control the house."}
{"original": "there is also consternation in high tax states about how well voters received the new tax policy of a couple of years ago. there's also a question whether republicans really want to wade into the tax reform waters again."}
{"original": "so let's review what congress did the last time it faced a fiscal crisis."}
{"original": "in february, 2009, congress approved what was initially billed as $787 billion economic stimulus package to shock the american economy into action after the great recession. the price tag of the measure eventually ballooned to $831 billion."}
{"original": "the democratic house and senate passed the plan in the first month of president obama's presidency. it consumed months to develop such a plan – and a new president. no republicans in the house supported the bill. only three gop senators voted yea: sens. susan collins (r-me), olympia snowe (r-me) and arlen specter (r-pa). granted, congress responded with a $700 billion relief measure to salvage the economy in the fall of 2008 to cover losses in the financial sector. after an epic, initial failure in the house of representatives (costing the market what was then it's biggest point drop in a single day, in synchronicity with the bill blowing up on the house floor), congress finally approved troubled asset relief program (tarp) in october, 2008. that was an immediate response because the economy teetered on the brink of collapse that autumn. but, it took a new congress, a new president and time to assemble a full-blown stimulus package."}
{"original": "also, congress and president obama assembled a number of measures after the fiscal meltdown. there was the controversial dodd-frank financial re-regulation plan. there was also a federal rescue of the american auto industry."}
{"original": "a contemporary package to respond to coronavirus would likely be an amalgam of tax credits for small businesses and travel, loans or even bailouts for damaged sectors of the economy (airlines?) and health assistance. there could also be a reduction of the payroll tax."}
{"original": "if you go to the dictionary and look up the word donnybrook, you'll see a picture of the internal fight waged between congressional republicans, over extending the payroll tax holiday in late 2011. this was a pitched, christmastime battle royale. gop fiscal hawks duked it out with fellow republicans who wanted to trim taxes. and, it unfolded around the holidays because, as you know, only the zaniest worst-case scenarios unfold on capitol hill at christmas."}
{"original": "in other words, it's hard to have it both ways: keep taxes low yet reduce deficit spending."}
{"original": "so what are the politics with a possible stimulus measure for coronavirus?"}
{"original": "some republicans are close to pushing for action – but up to a point."}
{"original": "those same republicans who balked at president obama's stimulus plan will likely excoriate democrats who championed the one in 2009 – and vice versa. still, some congressional republicans may be tentative to call for major action, worried it would send a message of desperation and undercut president trump. the optics of this are going to be complicated. congressional maneuvering sends a message that lawmakers are on the case. but it can also sound alarm."}
{"original": "at his briefing this week, house majority leader steny hoyer (d-md) seemed cool to cutting taxes."}
{"original": "i don't know that talking about additional tax cuts now, other than for political purposes, is what we ought to be focused on, said hoyer. what we ought to be focused on is what is our medical response to this."}
{"original": "when pressed further, hoyer introduced an additional factor which could complicate a stimulus: obamacare."}
{"original": "the maryland democrat argued that the trump administration and congressional republicans are still trying to undo obamacare. the supreme court will soon hear yet another case to overturn obamacare."}
{"original": "it is ironic, said hoyer that the administration says it wants to fight a major health challenge that is keeping america healthy."}
{"original": "democrats are concerned that persons with junk health insurance plans won't stay home from work because if they fall ill they lack adequate coverage. that could spread coronavrius."}
{"original": "so, there could be an opportunity for republicans to finally undercut obamacare and replace it with something else to help respond to coronavirus."}
{"original": "it could mean that republicans have to halt their attacks on obamacare amid coronavirus and obamacare expands far beyond its current form. or…it could mean that coronavirus prompts a major recalibration of the american health care system."}
{"original": "public opinion - and the death toll - will play heavily in all of this. if people don't think they have sufficient health care in the coronavirus era, other options could look good. that may not mean medicare for all. but it may alter the gop's decade-plus crusade to repeal and replace obamacare."}
{"original": "on sunday night, house speaker nancy pelosi (d-ca) and senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-ny) took issue with the administration offering tax breaks for major corporations to cope with coronavirus. pelosi and schumer outlined a different set of proposals: paid sick leave. enhanced unemployment insurance. an expansion of food security programs, such as the supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap) and the food initiative for women, infants and children (wic). protections for frontline health care workers. widespread testing for coronavirus. reimbursements for non-covered coronavirus-related costs. and, measures to guard against price gouging."}
{"original": "the administration must move more quickly and seriously to address the severe impacts of the coronavirus on the financial security of america's families, said pelosi and schumer."}
{"original": "these are all proposals which will cost money. they will all likely require legislation. and, to become law, they have to go through president trump."}
{"original": "the legislative response will take a while to sort out. look at how long it took congress to counter some aspects of the 2008 financial crisis. there may be immediate steps congress takes as certain demands become evident. but the big stuff is likely a long way off."}

{"original": "if congress comes back with a plan that does not include the $5.7 billion president trump wants for his proposed wall or at least some percentage of that, he has threatened to let the government shut down again or declare a national emergency to bypass congress."}
{"original": "joining me not to talk more about this is the president's acting chief of staff, mick mulvaney."}
{"original": "mick, welcome back to fox news sunday. thanks for taking the time. i know you got back to south carolina to see your family for the first time since new year's."}
{"original": "mick mulvaney, acting white house chief of staff: john, good morning. thanks so much for having me as always."}
{"original": "roberts: so, did the president cave to democrats? i think a lot of democrats think that he capitulated here because he really came away from 35 days of a government shutdown with nothing more than he could've had at least two weeks ago when senator graham propose the same thing and maybe even back to before this whole thing started."}
{"original": "mulvaney: no, i think what you've seen here is the president seeing an opportunity. what he did -- why he did what he did was because many democrats have come to us, some of them privately, many of them spoke out publicly that they are actually starting to agree with him on the necessity for a barrier on the southern border and they had come to us and said, look, we agree with you, you're winning the battle on the importance of a barrier on the southern border but we simply cannot work with you while the government is open. that's a marked different -- excuse me, while the government was closed."}
{"original": "mulvaney: that's a marked difference from where the democrat leadership was where they said they wouldn't talk to us about border security ever. nancy pelosi famously said that even if we open the government, she wouldn't give us a single dollar for the wall."}
{"original": "so, i think the president saw a chance here to try to take the democrats at their word. some of the rank and file, also some of the leadership, dick durbin said some decent things about border barrier, jim clyburn, my former colleague from south carolina, said that the experts thought we really needed a barrier, he could vote for it."}
{"original": "so, let's give a chance for the democrats to prove whether or not they really do believe in border security and are willing to go against nancy pelosi, or whether or not they are so beholden to their leadership that they are never going to vote for a barrier on the southern border."}
{"original": "roberts: now, the president is under no illusions, mick, that this is going to be a difficult task ahead. he tweeted out yesterday: 21 days goes very quickly. negotiations with democrats will start immediately. it will not be easy to make a deal, both parties very dug in."}
{"original": "nancy pelosi is on record several times and you pointed out as saying, no money for a wall. how do you get democrats to move her off of that position? i mean, she seems to have the solidarity of the democratic party behind her."}
{"original": "mulvaney: i laugh at times she says there's no money for the wall. she actually just voted for almost a quarter billion dollars for a barrier on the southern border with this deal that just got approved last week. but i think what we simply do is go to the democrats and say, look, are you telling the people the truth? when you look at your constituents back home and say you agree with the president that we have to do something about security at the southern border, are you telling the truth or are just doing something that's politically expedient?"}
{"original": "this is a chance for them to let their actions speak louder than words. keep in mind the last time the democrats sort of follow nancy pelosi blindly down a path on policy, we ended up with obamacare and bailouts and cap and trade, they lost control of the house."}
{"original": "so, the question is, is nancy really leading the democratic party, or is she just being led by the hard left wing of her party, and will the rest of the democrats follow her?"}
{"original": "so, this is just the next step in the negotiation. we thought it was the exact right thing for the president to do at the time. and i think ultimately, he'll be judged by the end of -- by what happens at the end of this process, not by what happen this week."}
{"original": "roberts: there is some money in the continuing resolution for border security, but that's to upgrade existing fencing and that's not for construction of new mileage of border wall, which is what you want, if you can stipulate that."}
{"original": "mulvaney: absolutely -- absolutely correct. but let me jump in very quickly, when you go from a 2-foot high barrier to a 30-foot high wall --"}
{"original": "mulvaney: -- that counts. that counts as new security."}
{"original": "roberts: all right. so, the president was asking for $5.7 billion. the vice president took the congress day after christmas and offer -- i think it was $2.4 billion. are you stuck on the 5.7 or will you take less than that?"}
{"original": "mulvaney: i think the president wants his $5.7 billion. keep in mind, why is that number? it's not a number that's made up. it's what the experts have told him. he's listened to dhs."}
{"original": "i have been on the meetings. he's listened to cbp. he's listened to ice."}
{"original": "we have identified the top 17 highest priorities in terms of where we can put up barriers to discourage people from crossing the border illegally. it's about 243 miles. that's what driving this discussion. it's not a made a magical number of $5.7 billion. it's the wall, where we need it the most and where we need it the quickest. that's what driving this."}
{"original": "so, this not something where the president is married to a number, he is married to border security which is the right thing for the president of the united states to do."}
{"original": "roberts: it's not lost on me that you shrewdly ducked my question. will he take less than 5.7 in a negotiation?"}
{"original": "mulvaney: oh, i wasn't ducking your question."}
{"original": "mulvaney: just i wasn't negotiating with you on tv. you know i never do that."}
{"original": "roberts: but will -- is he prepared to take less than the 5.7? i mean, you were willing to take 2.6 going into christmas, there was the offer of 2.4. i mean, clearly, he is not hard and fast on that number."}
{"original": "mulvaney: again, if i don't answer your question, i don't mean to dodge. look, let's look at this way. the president has all ready gone to the democrats and said, look, it's not a 2,000-mile sea to shining sea wall. it's not a giant 30-foot concrete barrier that so many democrats seem to have difficulty with."}
{"original": "he even put daca and tps on the table at some point during this process and they refused to even engage. so i think the better question is, what are the democrats willing to do?"}
{"original": "the president from the very beginning here actually has been the one willing to negotiate. he was the one staying in washington, d.c., when nancy went to hawaii. he's the one who stayed in d.c. when democrats all went down to puerto rico. he was in d.c., which he tried to leave to go to europe and the middle east last week."}
{"original": "he wants to negotiate on the deal. the democrat leadership simply refused to take him up on that."}
{"original": "roberts: it is fortuitous that we have west virginia senator joe manchin coming up, mick, because we will be able to ask a question about what democrats plan to do."}
{"original": "would you recommend another shut down to the president if there's no deal by february the 15th?"}
{"original": "mulvaney: look, we look at it going backwards. what do we need to protect the country? and we need border security and that includes a barrier. keep in mind, lost in all this other request that we made for things like more technology and improving ports of entry, all of the things that go into the --"}
{"original": "roberts: but would you recommend he shut down the government again?"}
{"original": "mulvaney: no one wants the government shutdown, john. it's not a desired end, but when the president vetoes a bill that is put in front of him on a spending package, sometimes that has the effect of shutting the government down. we don't go into this trying to shut the government down."}
{"original": "roberts: he also threatened an emergency declaration and use money that's already appropriated to build the wall. omb, which you used to head and still officially do, has been looking around for pots of money."}
{"original": "how much money did you find to build a wall?"}
{"original": "mulvaney: more than $5.7 billion. the president told us several months ago to try to find money in every nook and cranny, he told every member of the cabinet to do the exact same. omb has been working on this for several months now and there's a lot more than a $5.7 billion."}
{"original": "it's better, john, to get it through legislation. that's the right way to do it, but at the end of the day, the president is going to secure the border one way or another."}
{"original": "roberts: so, when the president comes to you and says, mick, should i declare an emergency if you don't money for a wall and you don't want to shut down the government, would you recommend he'd do that? because it would certainly almost immediately be adjoined by the courts and most likely a court in the jurisdiction of the 9th circuit of appeals, and that could be playing his last card."}
{"original": "mulvaney: we are just as aware of all of those contingencies as you just laid out as everybody else's, so there is ways we can try to mitigate those risks. we certainly will. there were some pots of money that are easier to get to than to others."}
{"original": "so, again, this is not something we are shooting off at the hip. we've been working on this for months."}
{"original": "we have been hoping for months to do it through legislation with democrats because that's the right way for the government to function, but the end of the day, the president's commitment is to defend the nation and he will do it either with or without congress."}
{"original": "roberts: the $5.7 billion, you want to build about 170 miles of border wall through texas. one thing i find curious that nobody's talking about here is that in most places along the rio grande, you can't build a fence in the floodplain of the rio grande. so, you have to build it in land, anywhere from a couple of hundred yards, to in some places a mile, which might help you in interdicting drugs and human trafficking, the people who don't want to get caught."}
{"original": "but for all of those migrants, honduras, el salvador, nicaragua, guatemala, the northern triangle countries, they can still even with a border barrier get feet on u.s. soil and their goal is to be apprehended by the border patrol and get in the system."}
{"original": "so, how would building a barrier in texas affect this problem of illegal immigration of the president talks about each and every day?"}
{"original": "mulvaney: that goes back to the larger discussion about border security. yes, there is a barrier. yes, there's technology and a part that sometimes gets forgotten about and something the president has talked about many, many times, which is to change our laws because you're absolutely right. if the border -- if the wall -- if the barrier is back one foot from the border and someone can get one foot on our soil depending on what country they're from, they can claim asylum and stay here almost indefinitely."}
{"original": "it's why some of the other things we've done that deal was negotiating with mexico to allow folks who are claiming asylum here to have to go back to mexico to wait while their asylum is being adjudicated. that's been a major improvement that i don't think has gotten the attention it deserves, but it does raise -- your point does raise the larger picture that we need to change the laws."}
{"original": "that's part and parcel of this comprehensive border security concept. it is not just about a barrier. it is not just about technology, it's about changing the laws that right now act as this giant poll."}
{"original": "we encourage people to come here from other countries to enter the country illegally because of the way our laws are structured and those need to be fixed as well as part of the larger national security package."}
{"original": "roberts: we should also point out, though, that this remain in mexico policy right now only applies to people who are entering from a port of entry, not people who cross the border illegally."}
{"original": "i got to ask you quickly before we go because time is running short. venezuela, is the u.s. ruling out military action if maduro refuses to cede leadership?"}
{"original": "mulvaney: i don't think any president of any party who is doing his or her job would be doing the job properly if they took anything off the table. so, i think the president of the united states is looking at this extraordinarily closely."}
{"original": "i can tell you, without giving away anything that shouldn't, that we are in constant communication with the secretary of state, constant communication with the other parts of the federal government to find out what's going on on the ground down there, making sure that our people and our property is safe down there. and also to make sure that we can do everything we can to encourage the maduro government, which we consider to be illegitimate, to leave. and to back the new national assembly leadership that declared this week."}
{"original": "so, it's a very serious situation. the president takes it very seriously and i think it's fair to say that no options are off the table."}
{"original": "mick, thanks for taking time away from your family this weekend to be with us. really appreciate it."}
{"original": "roberts: up next, can congress strike a deal on border security and avoid to return to where all this began with a government shutdown? two key lawmakers from both sides of the aisle join us next."}
{"original": "roberts: the clock is ticking on what could be three weeks of intense negotiations over border security before the stopgap spending measure the president signed into law expires."}
{"original": "joining us here in washington, republican senator roy blunt who is part of the bipartisan conference committee to try to hammer out a deal in next three weeks, and joe manchin of west virginia, the only democratic senator to consistently vote and support for a funding to build a wall."}
{"original": "senators, welcome back to fox news sunday."}
{"original": "sen. roy blunt, r-mo: good to be with you."}
{"original": "sen. joe manchin, d-w.v.: thank you."}
{"original": "roberts: senator manchin, let's start with you."}
{"original": "mick mulvaney posted a question in our last segment, what are democrats willing to do here? what are democrats willing --"}
{"original": "manchin: i think democrats want to look at basically the holistic approach. immigration reform, pathways forward for some people."}
{"original": "basically, i've always said people came two ways, they came the wrong way for the right reason, wrong way for the wrong reason. the people came for the wrong reason, we want to make sure they go out and stay out. you need border security for that."}
{"original": "but i think that people that came for the right reason have been productive, ought to have a pathway forward. some. that would change the whole complexion of this. the whole dialogue would change if that could be done."}
{"original": "as far as the $5.7 billion, if that's the number, we are figuring how do you split that up? and let the professionals. we have proven it's hard for us because with the president and white house and the legislature, we have locked horns on this thing -- no wall, all wall, halfway in between -- let the professionals tell us what it takes to keep us safe."}
{"original": "drugs is a big problem in my state."}
{"original": "manchin: drugs are coming in. how do we stop the drugs? people the basically -- the terrorists and everything that's been reported. i don't know, i would talk to will hurd and ask will, if you're having that problem in texas?"}
{"original": "so, we need to talk to people that understand on the front lines and also professionals that can kind of be a dealmaker, if you will, help us find the right path."}
{"original": "roberts: so, senator blunt, are you going to be in on all of these negotiations, do you think that a compromise is possible here knowing that nancy pelosi has said time and time again no money for a border barrier?"}
{"original": "blunt: i think compromise is the essence of what we do and i think the american people are tired of watching the government where people get locked down for no reason except maybe political reasons. i mean, clearly, the president showed -- shown real flexibility here for a guy who's not always that flexible. i mean, he has changed his view of this as he's gotten more information about how you secure the border, about ways to do that."}
{"original": "we have consistently said that barriers were part of that. the president went from talking about a wall along the entire southern border at one point during the campaign as part of the campaign discussion, to let's have barriers where they work and let's have something else where barriers wouldn't work as well."}
{"original": "four presidents have build barriers. joe and i have both supported that when we've been in the congress, and i think there's certainly a way forward here. but part of the way forward is to look at the other issues that are out there too that need to be dealt with and deal with those, the spending issues that are going to be right in front of us as soon as we get this done."}
{"original": "one of the things we learned this year was if you do this the right way, you can -- you can have 100 percent of the government funded by the beginning of the fiscal year. at this time, we got 75 percent of the government funded. that should be one of the lessons we learn here."}
{"original": "what do we need to get on the table right now so that we get 100 percent of the government funded and how do we deal with the border as an issue? i've always thought securing the border first made the most sense and then i think the other problems related to immigration are much easier to solve and people think the government has done its fundamental job."}
{"original": "and, you know, nobody will ever had more credibility on this than president trump. if he says the border is secure at the level that the american people should expect, then the other discussions about what are the legitimate workforce needs of the country, what do you do with people who came or stayed illegally -- about half the people not illegally here came legally, and then decided, gee, we're in the united states of america, this is a great place to be. let's just not go back."}
{"original": "roberts: sounds like you've got a lot to talk about in the next 19 days --"}
{"original": "but i think these are not new issues is the other point, john."}
{"original": "blunt: these are not new issues that members of congress don't know a lot about. there is nothing we're going to learn frankly in the next three weeks. we don't know right now. so, let's get started, let's find solutions, let's not continue to disappoint the people we work for by not showing the ability to work together."}
{"original": "roberts: and ronald reagan learned back in the 1980s, the dangers of cutting a deal on one part of immigration before you get security --"}
{"original": "manchin: in 2013, we passed a major immigration reform, bipartisan bill, which took everything. it was a holistic approach. it was security -- $44 billion for security."}
{"original": "manchin: it was a pathway forward. it was a cue number that you basically got in the back of the line. we did everything humanly possible to look at the whole immigration problem."}
{"original": "so on top of that, nobody, if they went through ten years of doing everything they were supposed to do, earn -- learn english, basically get a job, pay taxes, get in the back of the line. when your time came, you still couldn't be a citizen until we had the total border secured."}
{"original": "manchin: but if we are going to have this fight back and forth, if we're not going to fix one and we would think one takes care of the other -- so security only without some pathway forward."}
{"original": "roberts: but i think the president has indicated that he's willing to negotiate a bigger package on immigration, but here's the question i have for you, senator manchin. you have voted as we pointed out at the top of this consistently for a border barrier. many of your democratic colleagues, nancy pelosi in particular don't want anything to do with that."}
{"original": "what do you know that they don't see about a border barrier?"}
{"original": "manchin: the only thing i know is i had 800,000 people that were furloughed, or not getting paid. i had 12,000 in west virginia. people were hurting."}
{"original": "roberts: but why is a border barrier acceptable to you but it's not acceptable to so many of your democrats? why do you see value in a border?"}
{"original": "manchin: i can't speak -- i can't speak --"}
{"original": "roberts: what do you see value in a border barrier?"}
{"original": "manchin: i see value in a border because i have talked custom and border patrol people, and these are the professionals that i rely on. they showed me and told me what needs to be done. there needs to be some. we already have 600-plus miles of some type of --"}
{"original": "roberts: so, why is that lost on all of your colleagues?"}
{"original": "manchin: well, i think it's lost because now, it seems like the borders going to protect us within 700 miles or so of wall or a fencing or whatever, i'll call a secured structure, is going to be the catch all, do well."}
{"original": "that's not the case. there's an awful lot more. if we can stop -- most of our ports of entries is were all of our drugs are coming through. can't we have the screening, the new sensors, things of that sort, ports of entry, where big container ships --"}
{"original": "roberts: but isn't that what the president is proposing, like a package that he puts (ph) all of that?"}
{"original": "blunt: you know, senator manchin, we are good friends. he has been consistent on this. i frankly think, and this is -- his position has been consistent. many of the democrats in the last few months have looked at the president making this a big issue in his campaign and they have decided, well, we can't be for that anymore."}
{"original": "2013, virtually every democrat who is still in the senate voted for 700 miles of barriers and a whole lot more money than anybody is talking about right now, speaker pelosi has been for barriers in the past. you know, the whole idea that somehow 650 or 700 miles of barriers are appropriate, but 702 miles are immoral, that is an incredibly interesting place to draw your line about what's moral and what's not moral."}
{"original": "i think this debate got way too political. i do think -- let me say again, i think the president has shown more room -- willingness to move so far than others have, but we need to solve this. we need to solve it in three months. it may look like right now that speaker pelosi got what she wanted, open the government and we'll talk. the we'll talk part of that now is where we really are going to see the speaker either step up and talk, along with senator schumer, or find out that we'll talk really didn't mean anything. it just meant give us what we want and then you're not going to get what you want."}
{"original": "roberts: you talked to the president a lot in december heading into the christmas holiday just before the shut down. what were you telling him then?"}
{"original": "manchin: well, basically, we talked -- i didn't think this would ever happen. i said, for the first time, mr. president, you've got six bills ready to go, totally unanimous consent, and we all voted on. mitch mcconnell put it forward."}
{"original": "the breakdown came -- basically, the fiscal year 2019 budget for the homeland security was $1.6 billion. that was appropriated. then it went to the house and the house has bumped it up to $5 billion and it became in contention. so they were going to put that one on the 30-day or let's say to february the 8th and put that one at 1.3 continuing resolution and then fight that one out."}
{"original": "i thought that's exactly where the president would go. he got pushed from the base. he jumped up and said we are not going to. never before have i ever seen when we all agreed unanimously on six bills that we've kept 90 percent of the government open, 96 percent of all money flowing for the government to operate and hold that hostage and so much harm was done."}
{"original": "i don't know if anyone realized in the white house or the president how that would react and i think they saw the push back. we can't go down this road again. we need to --"}
{"original": "blunt: well, on $1.6 billion, which is frankly what the administration asked for this time last year, $1.6 billion, that clearly included walls or barriers or whatever. i think surely we can deal with the semantics of this and then the house stepped in with a much bigger number. the president like that number better."}
{"original": "roberts: yes, 5.7, that sounds better than 1.6."}
{"original": "blunt: exactly, and lots of democrats, john, in the last week .5.7 out there as a number they were willing to do, they just wanted to be a little more specific about how you do this. you know, under president george w. bush, we had a major move going toward a virtual wall --"}
{"original": "blunt: -- for the parts of the border that the president now says needs something like a virtual wall rather than an actual wall."}
{"original": "roberts: well, he says -- he uses the word smart wall."}
{"original": "roberts: look, the clock is running. so, time is running out."}
{"original": "blunt: time is running, that's right."}
{"original": "roberts: but, senator blunt, the president has threatened, either another government shutdown or an emergency declaration at the end of this if he doesn't get what he's looking for. you have said, quote: shutdowns are bad politics and even worse government."}
{"original": "and on an emergency declaration, that precedent could create real problems in the future on other issues."}
{"original": "roberts: so, i mean, are we looking at another shutdown?"}
{"original": "blunt: -- that after 35 days of this, the president also thinks shutdowns are not such great politics and bad government."}
{"original": "i think -- i just heard mick mulvaney say the same thing, we would all prefer to see this negotiated the way it should be negotiated. i happen to agree with the president on barriers at the border and border security as an important first step. but there might be a future president that i don't agree with that thinks something else is an emergency."}
{"original": "i think it's a bad precedent. i hope the president doesn't have to go there. if we'll do our job, he won't even have to consider going there three weeks from now because we'll have reached the right --"}
{"original": "manchin: the only we can ever stop this, i have thought everything about how you ever stop this from happening, the shutdown, is it within three weeks, the one thing we can do to help the american society and the american economy and the american people is to make sure if a shutdown ever occurs by our own making, our pay stops immediately the day of the shutdown."}
{"original": "trust me, there will not be a shutdown. everything else we can talk about, all the policies. you stop the paycheck the same as everyone else got hurt -- the only people i caught her with all the people working for the government. congress didn't get hurt, nobody felt the pain."}
{"original": "roberts: predict success or failure in this negotiation?"}
{"original": "blunt: i'm reasonably optimistic. i think we've all seen everybody step out into the new world realm, republican senate, democrat house, new speaker, republican president, the initial touch of the gloves was not producing the kind of result that we need to produce here. so i am optimistic we need to work hard to see that we find how we can solve this in a way that the president gets what he needs but the american people fundamentally get the government that they deserve."}
{"original": "roberts: we will see. i mean, the very fact that we got you two on together this morning is maybe a good start."}
{"original": "manchin: we all want the same thing we want -- our borders to be safe and secure. we want to stop the flow of drugs. we want to keep the people who basically are coming for the wrong reasons and preying on our economy, keep them out -- i mean, take them out, make sure they don't come back."}
{"original": "all these things are said. but there's people that need a pathway forward that have been very productive and there should be some compassion towards that."}
{"original": "roberts: we will see where this goes."}
{"original": "senator blunt, senator manchin, good to have you on this morning. thank you."}
{"original": "up next, we will bring in our sunday group to discuss this week's winners and losers in the ongoing battle over the border."}
{"original": "roberts: coming up, the government is back open but the sticking point is the same."}
{"original": "trump: it's just common sense. walls work."}
{"original": "rep. nancy pelosi, d-calif., speaker of the house: have i not been clear on the wall? no, i have been very clear on the wall."}
{"original": "roberts: we'll ask our sunday panel which side is going to blink first, next on fox news sunday."}
{"original": "trump: after 36 days of spirited debate and dialogue, i have seen and heard from enough democrats and republicans that they are willing to put partisanship aside, i think."}
{"original": "sen. chuck schumer, d-n.y., minority leader: that bodes well for finding an eventual agreement, the fact that we have so many areas where we can agree."}
{"original": "roberts: president trump and senate minority leader chuck schumer finding common ground on ending the longest government shutdown in history, but for how long and at what expense?"}
{"original": "it's time now for our sunday group."}
{"original": "jason riley from the wall street journal is with us, along with columnist for the hill, juan williams, julie pace, the washington bureau chief of the associated press, and fox news correspondent gillian turner."}
{"original": "i love that declarative statement by the president, they're willing to put aside partisanship, i think."}
{"original": "winners and losers here. jason, who won, who lost?"}
{"original": "jason riley, contributor: well, it's -- it's hard to see how this could have turned out any other way. the president said, if we shut down the government, i'll take the blame. the government shut down and he got blamed."}
{"original": "i think nancy pelosi is, obviously, the big winner here. you know, a month ago people were questioning whether she should even be speaker again. i think she's put that to rest. but they feel like they're on a roll here. they picked up the house majority, 40 seats or so. and the president's approval rating has declined significantly during the shutdown. so, clearly, they're the winner."}
{"original": "now, the onus is now on pelosi and the democrats to negotiate, like they said they would, in good faith, if the government is reopened. and we'll see if they do that."}
{"original": "one thing that strikes me about this, the real losers here are the dreamers. i think those dreamer immigrants have just been treated like pawns, particularly by pelosi and the democrats."}
{"original": "roberts: and i think as senator manchin was saying, they're looking for a bigger deal here --"}
{"original": "roberts: not -- not just protection, but a path to (inaudible)."}
{"original": "riley: but, remember, dreamer -- but the dreamers were told -- you know, nancy pelosi keeps saying i'm -- i'm -- i'm negotiating on your behalf. i am putting you first. no, she's putting keeping funding for the wall away from trump first. and i don't know that there are a lot of dreamers who agree with that priority."}
{"original": "roberts: right. but she certainly did seem to win, julie, on that front in terms of keeping the money away from the president."}
{"original": "julie pace, the associated press: she absolutely did. i -- i share jason's winner in this situation. it is definitely nancy pelosi, not only on the shutdown itself and how she negotiated with the white house. she comes out of this with her caucus more united than they were when they were sworn in as the new democratic majority just a few weeks ago. she's got those freshmen who were emboldened coming out of their elections who are now firmly behind her because they see that she is willing to hold a tough line against the president."}
{"original": "and for the president, i think one of the things that -- that we really learned through this last few weeks is that he really does not have a strategy for dealing with a democratic house majority, not just on the shutdown, but more broadly. this is the first time in his presidency that he has an opponent that has real power."}
{"original": "pace: and he does not seem to know how to deal with that right now."}
{"original": "roberts: he certainly doesn't seem to have a strategy for dealing with nancy pelosi."}
{"original": "gillian turner, correspondent: well, so one of the losers i wanted to mention that people are not spending enough time on this week is u.s. cybersecurity defenses. i've had sources -- federal government sources ringing alarm bells all week every day for the last two weeks. one source even went so far as to say this particular week, the u.s. federal government, before the shutdown ended, was more venerable to foreign cyberattacks, phishing, spearing attacks and terrorism online than in any point in history. and it's also going to take the government -- the federal government now months to recoup the losses to get back to where they were 35 days ago."}
{"original": "roberts: i think a mutual friend of ours was saying, if you were going to attack the united states if you were a terrorist, during the shutdown would be the time --"}
{"original": "turner: now is a great time."}
{"original": "so, chuck schumer goes into the negotiations really kind of saying, i told you so, juan. let's listen to what he said and then get your reaction."}
{"original": "schumer: no one should ever underestimate the speaker, as donald trump has learned."}
{"original": "the unity of our two caucuses really worked because i believed the president himself believed and was told by a couple of his advisers, you've written about them, that, oh, just hold out and we'll get the democrats to crack and join us. he was unable to do that."}
{"original": "roberts: all right, so we've got 19 days of negotiations. can the president get the democrats to crack at all on funding for a border barrier?"}
{"original": "juan williams, political analyst: i don't see it right now, john. i mean what we know from the polling, and we've had some recent polls indicating very clearly now, i think it's 54 percent of the american people don't favor the wall. so that the wall itself, which is a huge political symbol for this president, does not seem to have the political power that he thought. we've seen his numbers drop. the ap poll, julie is here now, now him at 34 percent approval. so that's a drop for him."}
{"original": "i'm particularly in touch with the idea that independents, who i think are key as we look towards 2020 and the president and his team are increasingly focused on his re-election prospects, you look at the independents and what they're saying is disapproval of ten points now to 63 percent."}
{"original": "and so, overall, even just a general discussion of the topic of border security, republicans historically hold the advantage. what we see now is that the two sides are equal. that 42 percent trust pelosi and the democrats to 40 percent trusting trump and the republicans."}
{"original": "but let me just add one quick point here. it's one thing to hear from people who, you know, are pretty critical of trump about who won and who lost, but why don't you go ask the base and then you hear from people like ann coulter of the talk radio crowd and they think trump lost."}
{"original": "roberts: oh, yes, they think he lost big time."}
{"original": "ok, so people are staking out positions. the president tweeting, quote, only fools or people with a political agenda don't want a wall or steel barrier to protect our country from crime, drugs and human trafficking. it will happen. it always does."}
{"original": "but listen to what nancy pelosi said on friday."}
{"original": "pelosi: have i not been clear on a wall? ok. no, i have been very clear on the wall."}
{"original": "roberts: so mick mulvaney, jason, believes that pressure will arise from democrats who say, you know, maybe -- like senator manchin, maybe we do need some sort of border barrier, but it doesn't sound like she's willing to give in and can she hold her coalition together?"}
{"original": "riley: well, the democratic opposition to a wall is clearly situational, not principled. we know that because so many in the past have voted for a wall."}
{"original": "i -- i think some might -- might come around to that. i don't know that -- that -- that -- that trump will get all of the money he wants, but i think he will get -- get something at the very least, and i think there will be pressure coming from -- from democrats on nancy pelosi to do that."}
{"original": "the thing here for the president, though, he clearly believes that the -- that the border security was his ticket in 2016 and that it will be his ticket to re-election. the question is whether there are diminishing returns here for the president on this issue."}
{"original": "williams: i don't think there's going to be a wall. there's not going to be any well. and what you hear from democrats is talk about now, john, of a smart wall. more sensors, more drones, more border security agents, more immigration judges. they will take those steps."}
{"original": "and when it comes to the dreamers, to jason's point, remember, it was president trump who created the crisis by undoing what president obama had done."}
{"original": "roberts: so is this going to give him real trouble in 2020? because he was claiming that's what this was all about was 2020."}
{"original": "pace: i -- well, and i think a lot of it is all about 2020 for him at this point. i mean trump is -- politically is in a situation where he has had, for the last two years, a solid base that has been behind him no matter what happens."}
{"original": "but, john, you were at these rallies in 2016, as i was, and i was constantly struck by the fact that a lot of trump supporters, when he had the chance about build the wall, who will pay for it, that wasn't just a political talking point for a lot of these people."}
{"original": "pace: they actually wanted the policy to be implemented."}
{"original": "pace: this was not just rhetoric. and so i think he knows that that base that has been so loyal, this is one issue where they could crumble."}
{"original": "roberts: gillian, really quick answer, if i could. does this losses, as many people have put it to nancy pelosi, have coattails with his negotiations with xi and with kim and his approach to putin? are they going to look at him and say, wow, we've just got to wait him out and we'll beat him?"}
{"original": "turner: i think that that is a calculation foreign leaders across the globe, from the middle east and latin america, are making this week. they're looking at this and they're saying, you know what, it turns out that the democrats winning the house in the midterms actually did matter for the president's foreign policy agenda. everybody was saying, regardless what happens, the prerogative remains with him. he fell -- the president fell on his sword on the wall issue. he sort of had to. but it's had some real-world consequences in terms of the u.s. foreign policy around the world."}
{"original": "roberts: we'll bring you back to talk to us about some other pressing issues, roger stone, venezuela."}
{"original": "but when we come back, the house sends a message to president trump, stay in nato. but is the president right, does the u.s. pay more than its share of the military burden? we'll ask the head of the alliance, jens stoltenberg, coming up next."}
{"original": "trump: we're going to be with nato 100 percent. but as i told the countries, you have to step up."}
{"original": "rep. jimmy panetta, d-calif.: we have to realize is that nato is not just a transactional relationship. our sole focus can't just be on who pays what and who gets what."}
{"original": "roberts: democratic congressman jimmy panetta, sponsor of the house bill reiterating strong congressional support of nato after reports the president discussed pulling out of the military alliance over allies failing to pay their fair share."}
{"original": "joining me now is jens stoltenberg, he's the secretary general of nato."}
{"original": "mr. secretary general, thanks for being with us today."}
{"original": "jens stoltenberg, nato secretary general: thank you for having me."}
{"original": "robert: i want to talk about nato and spending and all of that."}
{"original": "but, first of all, another pressing issue, venezuela. and it's one that a lot of nato members are involved in. france, spain, germany, the u.k., pressuring maduro to hold elections in seven days or they will recognize juan guaido as the legitimate leader of venezuela. maduro sort of laughing at the idea."}
{"original": "the situation in venezuela, how tenuous you think it is and could it devolve into civil war?"}
{"original": "stoltenberg: it is a very serious situation and many nato allies are trying to help to find a solution. but i think that most important thing now is to avoid a civil war, avoid violence is -- has -- is going to be used. and, therefore, nato ally support also for trying to find a negotiated solution."}
{"original": "roberts: recently here in washington, d.c., the house voted overwhelmingly on a measure that would require congressional approval for the president to pull out of nato because the president has threatened that he will pull out of nato if other nato nations don't live up to their financial commitment. he has since said, i'm 100 percent behind nato."}
{"original": "do you really have any concerns that president trump would pull the united states out of the alliance?"}
{"original": "stoltenberg: so president trump has been very clear. he is committed to nato. he's stated this clearly just a few days ago and it is also at the nato summit in -- in july."}
{"original": "but at the same time, he has clearly stated that nato allies need to invest more and therefore at the summit in july, last year, we agreed to do more to step up, and now we see the results."}
{"original": "by the end of next year, nato allies will add 100 -- 100 billion extra u.s. dollars for defense. so we see some real money and some real results and we see that the clear message from president trump is having an impact. nato allies have heard the president loud and clear and now nato allies are stepping up."}
{"original": "so this is good news, meaning that we actually see more fair burden sharing."}
{"original": "roberts: so that's interesting that you say that the nato allies have heard the message and it -- and it's a good thing because president trump gets loudly criticized here in the united states and abroad for being hostile to nato, for putting too much pressure on them to live up to their financial commitments."}
{"original": "so from -- from your perspective, what he's saying, good thing or bad thing?"}
{"original": "stoltenberg: there is no doubt that his very clear message is having an impact. the message on the summit last summer was very clear with all the leaders sitting around the table. and the message was -- was that the u.s., president trump, he's committed to nato, but we need fair burden sharing."}
{"original": "roberts: right, so are you happy with what he's saying? i mean did -- did nato nations -- did nato, as an organization, need a kick in the pants?"}
{"original": "stoltenberg: i'm happy with the fact that he has helped us to now move the question of burden sharing within the alliance. and this is important for european allies, for a strong nato. it's good for europe. but it's also good for united states."}
{"original": "we have to remember that the only time we have invoked article v of our collective defense clause was after an attack on the united states. and hundreds of thousands of canadian, european soldiers have fought shoulder to shoulder with u.s. soldiers in afghanistan. we have worked together with u.s. in defeating daesh, isis in iraq and syria. so it's a great advantage for the united states to have 28 allies. russia doesn't have that. china doesn't have that. but the u.s. has allies and friends."}
{"original": "roberts: you mentioned russia. and one of the knocks on president trump is what he says about president putin and his criticisms of nato is giving putin a way to try to create divisions within nato."}
{"original": "listen to what congressman eliot engel of new york said last week."}
{"original": "rep. eliot engel, d-n.y.: today, nato plays a critical role in keeping an increasingly aggressive russia in check. and that's one of the reasons splintering the nato alliance is one of vladimir putin's top goals. and that's why it's so disturbing, so troubling to see the united states sending mixed signals about our commitment to the alliance or treating it as a burden."}
{"original": "roberts: nancy pelosi, the new speaker of the house, went so far as to tweet on friday night, why has the trump administration continued to discuss pulling the u.s. out of nato, which would be a massive victory for putin?"}
{"original": "that could be connected to other issues regarding the president and putin. but what president trump is saying about nato and the way he is saying it, is he giving an advantage to putin here?"}
{"original": "stoltenberg: what he's doing is to -- is to help us adapt the alliance, which we need, because we live in a more unpredictable world with more assert (ph) to russia using violence or force against a neighbor, ukraine, and therefore nato has to adapt, partly (ph) by increase in the readiness (ph) of our forces, we are doing that, partly by stepping up our fight against terrorism, we are doing that. we had a new training mission in iraq, but also partly by investing more. and you have to remember that the increase we now see in defense spending by european and nato allies comes after years of decline. so before they were cutting billions. now they're actually adding billions."}
{"original": "roberts: so -- so you're not concerned that he's helping putin splinter nato, like so many of his critics are?"}
{"original": "stoltenberg: what is see is that actually nato is united because we are able to adapt to deliver. north america and europe are doing more together now than before."}
{"original": "we have more u.s. troops in europe and more exercises. so we welcome that. but we also welcome the fact that european allies are stepping up."}
{"original": "and this is a clear message to russia and i think they see that."}
{"original": "roberts: and, in your mind, mr. secretary general, what is -- what is the greater threat to nato? is it that russia may move into the baltic states or is it what's happening in the black sea, in the balkan area?"}
{"original": "stoltenberg: the challenge for nato is that we are faced with many different threats at the same time. russia, using violence against neighbors, but also daesh, isil in the south, and in (inaudible) on nuclear weapons. so, therefore, we are now in the midst of the biggest reinforcement of nato since the end of the cold war."}
{"original": "roberts: there is real concerns in some circles that vladimir putin may make a play on a little part of estonia called narva. if he were to do that, estonia's a nato member, would that invoke article v?"}
{"original": "stoltenberg: first of all, we don't see any imminent threat against any nato ally, and that includes also estonia."}
{"original": "and, second, the main reason why we have nato is to prevent the conflict, is to prevent war, because as long as all nato allies make it clear that an attack on one ally would trigger a response from the whole alliance, then no adversary would try to be aggressive against nato because they know that we are by far the strongest alliance in the world, half of the world's economic might and half of the world's economic -- military might is within nato. so as long as we stand together, we prevent conflict."}
{"original": "roberts: mr. secretary general, thanks for being with us. we'll see you next december in brussels."}
{"original": "roberts: all right. had a good meeting, by the way, with the defense minister next month."}
{"original": "up next, longtime trump advisor roger stone maintains his innocence as he faces arraignment next week and the mueller investigation. we'll ask our sunday panel about his arrest, the charges and what it tells us about the state of the probe."}
{"original": "roger stone, former adviser to donald trump: i intend to fight because this indictment is -- is -- is fabricated. this indictment is thin as -- as can be. my attorneys are highly confident that they can win an acquittal."}
{"original": "roberts: longtime trump confidant roger stone talking to tucker carlson hours after his arrest by fbi agents on charges of lying, obstruction and witness tampering in robert mueller's ongoing investigation into russian interference in the 2016 election."}
{"original": "and we are back now with the panel."}
{"original": "the president tweeting about the saying cbs reports that in the roger stone indictment data was released during the 2016 election to damage hillary clinton. oh, really? what about the fake and unverified dossier, totally phony conjob, that was paid for by crooked hillary to damage me and the trump campaign? roger stone didn't even work for me anywhere near the election."}
{"original": "so this indictment connects somebody close to the president with wikileaks, but doesn't make the connection all the way to russia."}
{"original": "pace: no, it doesn't. and that's certainly what the president and his allies are leaning on here that the charges against stone relate to lying. and that's actually what we've seen with most of the people who mueller has indicted through this process. it hasn't gotten to the core of -- of russian interference in the election or any kind of conspiracy."}
{"original": "that being said, you know, one thing we know about robert mueller is that we don't know everything that he has right now --"}
{"original": "pace: and there is -- there is definitely a whole avenue in terms of the relationship between people around trump and around stone and wikileaks that haven't been touched yet. so i think it's an open question on whether the charges that we've seen filed against stone thus far are the extent of those charges."}
{"original": "williams: just to pick up on that just very quickly."}
{"original": "williams: why are all these people lying? why did they feel they need to perjure themselves? what -- i mean it's like you think, oh, there's a lot of smoke here. i don't (inaudible) the fire."}
{"original": "roberts: yes, everybody keeps talking about this being process crimes with no underlying crimes."}
{"original": "riley: they are. i mean roger stone is a gadfly. he's a clown figure. we --"}
{"original": "roberts: but a process crime is still a serious crime."}
{"original": "riley: but to the -- to the president's tweet, the president's right, digging up dirt on a political opponent is called opposition research. it is not collusion. i mean it may be sleazy politics, but it is not criminal activity here."}
{"original": "roberts: but, if you're working with an organization that's working with russia."}
{"original": "pace: but to john's point there, i mean the -- the issue here isn't that they were just trying to dig up opposition research, it's that they were trying to see what roger stone knew about wikileaks having information that they obtained via russia. that's -- that's the hard press (ph)."}
{"original": "riley: i think roger stone was trying to dig up dirt to impress the trump campaign. and then he lied to congress about it."}
{"original": "pace: but you -- ultimately you're trying to -- ultimately if you're trying to work with a foreign government to do that, that's the problem."}
{"original": "turner: despite that, both sides, i think, are to blame here. republicans and democrats both fell short on messaging. the democrats had a real opportunity to go in for the kill here, but they stuck -- you know, nancy pelosi specifically stuck with this, well, you know, you can tell a lot about a person by their friends and president trump doesn't have good friends. when it's incumbent upon them, as you said, john, to make the connection of collusion between russia, between wikileaks, and between roger stone. the republicans, by contrast, failed by saying, you know, the president -- they stuck to the tired line of no collusion, which everybody has heard a million times and didn't go any further."}
{"original": "roberts: let me connect a couple of dots here. all right, so this is a, quote, process crime. and roger stone says he's broke. listen here."}
{"original": "stone: no matter how much pressure they put on me, no matter what they say, i will not bear false witness against donald trump. i will not do what michael cohen has done and make up lies to ease the pressure on myself."}
{"original": "roberts: that -- that -- that -- that -- that was actually the wrong sound. let's play the right sound."}
{"original": "stone: this has been financially devastating. the leaks from the general -- from the special counsel's office have devastated my private consulting business."}
{"original": "i am this close. i mean, in all honesty, i struggled to pay my lawyers, first and foremost, pay my rent, pay my taxes. it is not a fun existence."}
{"original": "roberts: he's in exactly the position that robert mueller wants him in. i'm broke. i can't pay my taxes. i might have to sell my dog. so, oh, well, why don't we cut a deal and you tell me everything you know about president trump?"}
{"original": "riley: roger stone is in this position because of the action of roger stone. and i don't think people are going to be shedding a lot of crocodile tears for his situation."}
{"original": "i will overall though, john --"}
{"original": "roberts: but he's in the perfect position for mueller to squeeze him."}
{"original": "riley: he is. he is in a position for mueller to squeeze him. that's true. and what this also tells us is that mueller isn't done yet. he's still out there searching for scalps (ph) and this is something -- this is going to be a cloud over the administration for the foreseeable future. and that is the -- the long-term consequences of this. these may be small fry figures, but it's going to keep this story in the press going forward and off of the president's agenda, to the extent that he has one."}
{"original": "roberts: we've got limited time left. let me just swing to another topic, venezuela. here's what the secretary of state said after a u.n. security council emergency meeting yesterday."}
{"original": "mike pompeo, secretary of state: now it's time for every other nation to pick a side. no more delays. no more games. either you stand with the forces of freedom or you're in a league with maduro and his mayhem."}
{"original": "roberts: all right, so we are between an irresistible force and an immovable object."}
{"original": "gillian, maduro says, you know what, you all -- i'm not going anywhere."}
{"original": "turner: you're either with us or you're against us. more sort of axis of evil talk."}
{"original": "i spoke to the national security council just as morning, john, and they told me they're putting a lot of stock this weekend in the fact that venezuela's defense attache here in washington yesterday publicly switch sides. he's now thrown his support away from maduro. they're saying that, you know, armed -- the possibility of armed conflict, as mick mulvaney said earlier, is alive and well. this thing could go either way over the -- over the course of the next month (ph)."}
{"original": "roberts: fifteen seconds, juan. make your point."}
{"original": "williams: well, i mean, we don't want to see american intervention, but i am a little put off by russia telling us, given their experience with ukraine, what we can't do. that's not good. and i think that might alarm president trump. as to civil war within venezuela, that also remains a possibility."}

{"original": "i didn't know they were coming, i didn't know until i saw them there, mccain said in an interview with people magazine. i looked over and saw them and well… they got to listen to what i had to say."}
{"original": "president trump did not attend the funeral service for the war hero, with whom he had a contentious relationship. ahead of his second state of the union address on tuesday night, the new york times reported that trump again recalled that mccain in 2017 voted no on an obamacare repeal."}

{"original": "mccain, in reply to the report, tweeted that trump's obsession with her father, almost six months after his death, is pathetic and telling — even at a time when he should be focusing on his message to the american public and the state of our union — the greatness of my father's life and legacy haunts you."}
{"original": "during her father's funeral, mccain did not mention trump's name, but she knocked the president with an apparent reference to his campaign slogan, saying: the america of john mccain has no need to be made great again because america was always great."}

{"original": "fox news primetime host trey gowdy began wednesday's program by sounding off on what he called jail jesus moments for biden appointees who suddenly feel remorse for incendiary things they had done and said in the past."}
{"original": "gowdy focused on the nominations vanita gupta and neera tanden. tanden, he noted, received so much blowback for her past tweets and remarks about top republicans that she ultimately withdrew her nomination to lead the office of management and budget. gupta remains nominated for the third-highest-ranking position in the justice department."}
{"original": "there is a difference between a mistake and a series of calculated decisions that turned out poorly for you, gowdy said. most of us know the difference."}
{"original": "gowdy, a former prosecutor, used the example of someone who declares in court that they made a mistake when they set their own home on fire to commit insurance fraud."}
{"original": "vanita gupta is biden's wealthiest nominee"}
{"original": "that is not a mistake. it's actually called arson, he said. a mistake is calling somebody by the wrong name or putting on the wrong color socks or making a wrong turn in the neighborhood. systematically tweeting or otherwise criticizing your political enemies is a conscious decision you made that has real consequences now."}
{"original": "gowdy recalled that tanden sunk her own nomination with tweets like one declaring sen. lisa murkowski, r-alaska, was high on her own supply when she touted a tax cut proposal."}
{"original": "gowdy added that tanden had referred to senate republican leader mitch mcconnell as moscow mitch, which came back to haunt her when she needed his caucus' support to be confirmed."}
{"original": "those were calculated decisions she made at the time because she thought it was politically expedient to do it, he said. then she was nominated for a job which, unfortunately, required those same senators to confirm her. so, of course, she then expressed deep regret, because it was only then she realized saying those things might possibly be hurtful."}
{"original": "white house reporters ushered away after asking biden questions"}
{"original": "i mean i have heard of 'jail jesus' before -- people finding religion right before the judge is about to sentence them. i guess this is 'confirmation clarity', the former congressman continued. you finally realize how hurtful your comments may have been right before you have to ask the person to vote for you."}
{"original": "for gupta's part, she called the 2020 republican national convention three nights of racism, xenophobia and outrageous lies."}
{"original": "now, less than one year later she deeply, deeply regrets saying that, said gowdy, recalling his tussle with obamacare 'architect' and mit professor jonathan gruber on the stupidity of the american voter."}
{"original": "in a 2014 hearing, then-rep. gowdy asked what gruber meant by that phrase, to which the obama adviser responded he was being glib and frankly trying to make myself seem smart."}
{"original": "you are a professor at m.i.t. and you are worried about not looking smart enough? gowdy asked at the time."}

{"original": "democratic presidential candidate and vermont sen. bernie sanders has made health care the signature issue of his campaign — and with good reason."}
{"original": "a fox news voter analysis on the michigan democratic presidential primary showed that 41 percent of voters saw health care as the most important issue facing the u.s., with the economy and climate change coming in a distant tie for second at 18 percent. that breakdown has been similar in many other states on the democratic primary calendar."}
{"original": "here's where sanders stands on health care as he tries to turn americans' concern about the issue into votes at the polls."}
{"original": "race for delegates: biden grows lead over sanders after midwest victories"}
{"original": "sanders is the author of the original medicare-for-all bill in the senate and is fond of reminding people of that fact. he wrote the damn bill, as he has said on the democratic presidential debate stage. and sanders' bill has moved the goalposts on the health care issue, forcing every major democratic presidential candidate who joined the 2020 race to embrace government-backed health care to a certain degree."}
{"original": "many candidates supported what's known as a public option -- a government-backed health insurance plan designed to compete with private insurance, driving down prices and giving guaranteed coverage to individuals who cannot afford private insurance or can't get accepted to a plan. before he dropped out of the presidential race, former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg called his plan medicare-for-all-who-want-it."}
{"original": "former president obama tried to include a public option in the affordable care act, which is also known as obamacare, but couldn't secure enough votes in congress to include it in the bill."}
{"original": "but sanders would go further, eliminating the private health insurance market and putting all americans on a single, government-run plan. that is what sets the medicare-for-all plan sanders advocates for apart from other options for reforming the u.s. health care system."}
{"original": "even massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, who eventually wants to move to a full, single-payer health care system, said before she dropped out of the presidential race that she wants to move incrementally when it comes to eliminating private health insurance."}
{"original": "bernie sanders: 5 things to know"}
{"original": "one of the top benefits of his approach, sanders says, would be to ensure americans are no longer paying out of pocket for their health care. his campaign website says medicare-for-all would be free at the point of service and would have no networks, no premiums, no deductibles, no co-pays and no surprise bills."}
{"original": "another advantage to a medicare-for-all plan, sanders says, would be that there would be a single insurance provider – the government – negotiating prices with drug companies and hospitals. this would supposedly increase the bargaining power held by the government, which already has managed to negotiate favorable prices for seniors currently on medicare, and result in a net savings for the average american, even though their taxes would increase to pay for the plan."}
{"original": "the committee for a responsible federal budget released a report on ways the government could fund medicare-for-all late last year, estimating that the government would need to raise $30 trillion to over 10 years to fund the program. though there have been estimates higher than that for the eventual cost of medicare-for-all, the watchdog said that funding the program through only taxes on the rich would be impossible."}
{"original": "sanders, for his part, has at times refused to even name a cost estimate for medicare-for-all."}
{"original": "i don't give a number and i'll tell you why, he told the washington post. it's such a huge number and it's so complicated that if i gave a number you and 50 other people would go through it and say, 'oh..."}
{"original": "click here to get the fox news app"}
{"original": "recently, sanders released a fact sheet explaining how he would pay for some of his programs, including medicare-for-all. that fact sheet estimates that the total cost of medicare-for-all will be $47 trillion in ten years, a savings of $5 trillion compared to the amount that currently goes into the u.s. health care system."}
{"original": "by redirecting the currently estimated $30 trillion in local, state and federal health care spending over that timeframe to the medicare-for-all program, sanders would bring the price of new spending down to $17.5 trillion, his website says. sanders then proposes a variety of options, including a medicare-for-all premium deducted from the paychecks of people making more than $29,000 per year, increasing the top income tax rate to 52 percent and taxing capital gains as income."}
{"original": "however, sanders' estimates rely on best-case scenarios that could end up ballooning the federal debt even more if they don't pan out. he has consistently acknowledged that taxes for almost all americans would go up under medicare-for-all, but says that the net price americans are paying for health care will be significantly less after factoring in the fact there will be no out of pocket costs."}

{"original": "the super pac, priorities usa, will utilize facebook ads in addition to multiple on television that highlight the coronavirus' spread under trump's leadership. ads will focus on voters in four key battleground states -- florida, michigan, wisconsin, and pennsylvania -- and contrast trump with former vice president joe biden, his likely competitor in the 2020 presidential election."}
{"original": "priorities usa chairman guy cecil, who previously worked for hillary clinton's 2008 campaign, asserted that trump's failure to lead created life and death consequences."}
{"original": "former warren, clinton aides leading 'coronavirus war room' targeting trump's response to pandemic"}
{"original": "from the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, donald trump has repeatedly misled the american people and exposed us to unnecessary danger. his failure to lead continues to have real life and death consequences as hospitals, local and state governments, small businesses, and millions of americans are left without the tools and information they need, cecil said in a press release."}
{"original": "cecil's ad was just the latest in a series from democrat-aligned groups who sought to target trump's coronavirus response. a pac tied to former obama aide david plouffe is also planning to spend millions in attack ads targeting several key swing states."}
{"original": "one of priorities usa's ads, tweeted on monday, is almost identical to another mysterious ad that surfaced on twitter last week. fellow americans, a 501(c)(4) nonprofit, ran the ad but it's unclear where the group originated. its website is sparse and vaguely refers to opposing political division in the united states. both ads splice together trump's statements while displaying a chart that shows the increasing number of coronavirus cases in the united states."}
{"original": "latest anti-trump ad passes twitter scrutiny as dark money targets pandemic response"}
{"original": "americans for public trust, an outside group led by former nevada attorney general adam laxalt, a republican, raised concerns last week about the networks behind the pandemic-related attacks on the president."}
{"original": "the group is claiming that similar anti-trump messaging is coming from a series of organizations tied to arabella advisors -- a dark money nonprofit providing help to liberal groups. specifically, it manages the new venture fund (nvf) and the sixteen thirty fund, both of which have supported another democrat-aligned group -- american bridge -- that's hitting trump on the coronavirus response. the new venture fund has also supported acronym, the nonprofit led by plouffe."}
{"original": "in a statement provided to fox news, new venture fund clarified that it had nothing to do with pacronym's ad."}
{"original": "new venture fund is an independent 501(c)(3) organization that provides fiscal sponsorship to nonprofit projects, providing them with tools and administrative support including human resources, legal, financial and compliance services. we are a non-partisan organization — not a superpac — and have nothing to do with the activity at pacronym in your report, the group said."}
{"original": "protect our care, which has been described as a project of the sixteen thirty fund, has also been running an ad against sen. steve daines, r-mont., reportedly tying his opposition to obamacare to the coronavirus. on thursday, protect our care announced a coronavirus war room staffed with former aides to hillary clinton's and elizabeth warren's campaigns."}

{"original": "tim murtaugh, communications director for the trump campaign, blasted the group's ad in a statement to fox news."}
{"original": "it used to be that americans faced national adversity with unity, but joe biden and his allies have abandoned that principle in favor of rank, despicable politics. they offer nothing but partisan sniping from the sidelines and seek to undermine the federal response to the crisis by misinforming and frightening people, he said."}
{"original": "he continued: the ad also contains the already disproven lie that president trump called the virus a 'hoax,' when in fact he was referring to democrat and media criticisms of the federal response as 'their new hoax.' all joe biden knows about handling a public health crisis is that the obama white house had to apologize for his irresponsible remarks during the swine flu outbreak in 2009. americans can see that president trump is out front and leading this nation and is the clear choice to see us through the crisis."}
{"original": "coronavirus: what you need to know"}
{"original": "fox news previously reported on how multiple media outlets similarly omitted context surrounding trump's comments to a rally audience in february. the ad splices several statements from trump, playing them against the backdrop of a chart showing the escalation of coronavirus cases in the u.s."}
{"original": "one of those quotes includes trump's hoax comment but does so by combining two separate statements and not providing the words trump said before he used the hoax label. the coronavirus, this is their new hoax, the ad says. according to the washington post, trump never made that exact statement but it was included in another ad released by former vice president joe biden's campaign."}

{"original": "commentators spilled a lot of ink this week, forecasting the end of the senate filibuster."}
{"original": "they didn't have to. the filibuster's days have been numbered for years."}
{"original": "senate moves to speed up confirmation of nominees"}
{"original": "senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., deployed an artful parliamentary gambit this week on a related front. mcconnell's goal was to prune the amount of time the senate can burn after it breaks a filibuster -- before confirming lower-level administration nominees. congressional observers suggested that mcconnell's maneuver spelled doom for the filibuster itself."}
{"original": "the senate's tinkered around the edges of the filibuster – as it pertains to nominees – three times in five-and-a-half years. squeezing available debate time was the case this week. the chamber lowered the bar to crush filibusters for nominees via what's billed as nuclear option #1 in 2013 (under democratic control) and nuclear option #2 in 2017 (under republican control). but both of those schemes only dealt with nominations. there is nothing in the mix yet about abolishing filibusters for legislation."}
{"original": "mcconnell says the senate doesn't have the votes to euthanize the legislative filibuster. he's right. but only for now. that may change. the senate previously lacked the votes to lower the standard to squelch filibusters for executive branch nominees, except the supreme court. that was the case until then-senate majority leader harry reid, d-nev., deployed nuclear option #1 in 2013. mcconnell then dropped the requirement of 60 votes to quash a filibuster on supreme court nominees with nuclear option #2 in 2017. the senate didn't have the support to accelerate the confirmation of lower-tier nominees -- until mcconnell meddled with senate procedure this week."}
{"original": "like everything on capitol hill, it comes down to the math. that's why reid and mcconnell carried out these ploys. they had the votes on their side. so they went ahead and executed their plans."}
{"original": "reid and mcconnell both administered their filibuster-related contrivances to boost presidents obama and trump, respectively. so why wouldn't a senate majority try to boost a president of their own party by ending the legislative filibuster?"}
{"original": "trump repeatedly browbeat mcconnell over the current filibuster rule for legislation. sixty votes are necessary to terminate a legislative filibuster. a filibuster prevented trump from scoring a big win two years ago to repeal and replace obamacare. at the time, republicans only held a 51-49 advantage in the senate. senate republicans fretted that eliminating the legislative filibuster could backfire. democrats would only have to poach the votes of a couple of republican senators to advance their own legislative priorities – despite gop senate control. for instance, a coalition of republican senators worked with senate democrats last year to undercut a trump administration policy about net neutrality."}
{"original": "it would take a lot to kill the legislative filibuster."}
{"original": "forty-four standing rules govern the senate's operations. senate rule xxii (22) deals with filibusters. rule xxii enables the senate to thwart a filibuster. sixty yeas are needed to halt a filibuster on legislation (called invoking cloture). a simple majority of senators are needed to end debate or a filibuster on nominations, thanks to nuclear options #1 & #2."}
{"original": "the senate can vote to change any of its rules. but altering the rules is subject to a filibuster itself. the threshold to kill the filibuster of a proposed rules change is an eye-popping 67 yeas. two-thirds of the senate."}
{"original": "so, it's nearly impossible to change the senate's rules."}
{"original": "but there's the rub. the senate conducts much of its business via precedent. there are only 44 standing rules. yet the book of senate precedents is immense. neither reid nor mcconnell could amass 67 votes for a rules change. but they sure could steer the senate into the appropriate parliamentary posture to implement a precedent change. a precedent change entails a mere 51 votes (or a simple majority). that's precisely how reid and mcconnell effectuated the latest parliamentary shifts for filibusters. and if the senate would ever eliminate the legislative filibuster, senators would likely follow the course burnished by reid and mcconnell for the nuclear option."}
{"original": "americans romanticize the filibuster. they think of stem-winding, all-night orations and jimmy stewart. but most filibusters aren't that intriguing."}
{"original": "seizing the senate floor and speaking for hours on end isn't always a filibuster. blocking something constitutes a filibuster. remember the filibuster just before the 2013 government shutdown by sen. ted cruz, r-texas? cruz spoke on the floor for 21 hours and 18 minutes. it was the third-longest speech since 1900. but cruz wasn't filibustering. cruz had to yield the floor around noon the next day because reid locked the senate in for a procedural vote. so, even though cruz spoke for a really long time, it truly wasn't a filibuster. the texas republican simply delivered an exhausting speech."}
{"original": "the public rarely notices filibuster, even though they go on all the time. dozens of bills never make it to the floor because a senator or a group of senators are filibustering the bill. you just don't see them doing it publicly. the senate majority leader knows if he has the votes to complete a bill. if he doesn't, the leader usually doesn't try to force the issue because of a phantom filibuster. so the senate never even tackles those bills."}
{"original": "that said, the senate votes to break filibusters constantly. the senate vanquishes filibusters by invoking cloture. in those instances, the filibuster is real. senators usually aren't on the floor talking all day and night. but in order to move on, the majority leader initiates the process via rule xxii to bring debate to a close. the leader typically knows he has 60 votes to invoke cloture and kill the filibuster."}
{"original": "there is some thought on capitol hill that the filibuster could evaporate if republicans maintain control of the senate in 2020 and trump wins a second term. perhaps the same scenario is in play if democrats win the senate and the white house in 2020, too. others suggest the demise of the legislative filibuster won't come until 2025."}
{"original": "but one thing's for sure: a weapon exists to get rid of the filibuster. harry reid invented the nuclear option stratagem. mcconnell's now perfected it. the only difference is if the senate has the political will to eliminate this senate tradition."}

{"original": "so much of politics is scripted."}
{"original": "so much of what we've seen over the past week or so in the senate trial of president trump was not."}
{"original": "the outcome of president trump's trial was settled long ago. try 1787. that's when the founders finished the constitution, asserting in article i, section 3 that it would take two-thirds of the senate to convict and remove someone from office."}
{"original": "it was clear long ago that the contemporary senate wouldn't have anything close to 67 votes to bounce president trump from office. but how everyone navigated the trial waters was mostly unscripted."}
{"original": "take the issue of witnesses. it was far from clear last week if the senate would summon witnesses. it would come down to less than a handful of votes. sens. susan collins (r-me) and mitt romney (r-ut) were well documented in their support for witnesses. republicans now hold a 53-47 edge in the senate. so the attrition of collins and romney likely brought the vote tally on the witness gateway to just 51. in play were sens. lamar alexander (r-tn) and lisa murkowski (r-ak). but it was thought that collins and romney may constitute the entire universe of gopers willing to open the door to witnesses."}
{"original": "the gateway vote on witnesses could have presented the senate with a rabbit warren of options for what would happen next in the trial. if the senate agreed to the witness gateway, would that just be it? would the senate only support the concept of witnesses – but vote to reject various slates of witnesses or individual witnesses? that's why the gateway vote last week was so important. democrats obviously pushed for witnesses – most significantly, former national security advisor john bolton. many republicans thought they'd like to hear from former vice president joe biden and his son hunter biden. but the gateway vote on witnesses was like opening a parliamentary wormhole. if the senate approved the motion to theoretically call witnesses, then senators never truly knew where'd they come out on the other side. \\"}
{"original": "would this extend the trial for weeks? months? so much for a quick acquittal for the president, pushed by many of the president's loyalists. sure, some gopers thought it would be amusing if not politically helpful to drag the bidens into the senate to testify. but in the minds of mr. trump's senate supporters, was testimony from the bidens more important than clearing the chief executive expeditiously? the same with the idea of calling the whistleblower. lots of republicans liked to talk a good game about hearing from and exposing the name of the whistleblower. but to what political end? incinerating national security law? annihilating whistleblower statutes which many senators worked so hard to pass over the years? exposing persons who work undercover in the national security community?"}
{"original": "the idea of voting to have the whistleblower testify was never going to happen. but it was sure a good way for some republicans to gin up their base and call into question what lead impeachment manager and house intelligence committee chairman adam schiff (d-ca) or his staff allegedly knew about the whistleblower."}
{"original": "one more vote in favor of witnesses would present the senate with a tie on the gateway vote. by rule, tie votes in the senate lose. would chief justice john roberts vote to break the tie? senate impeachment rules note that the role of the vice president – who is eligible to break other ties in the senate – devolved in an impeachment trial. so there would be no role or possibility of the vice president breaking a tie. in president andrew johnson's impeachment trial in 1868, chief justice salmon p. chase broke two of three ties in the senate. could roberts break a tie in this instance and prolong the trial, forcing witnesses?"}
{"original": "unclear. and, in real time, senators were looking at what an elongated trial may mean. president trump's counsel jay sekulow argued that calling witnesses would take a long time and may consume senate business for months."}
{"original": "schiff disputed this, suggesting they could call and depose witnesses in a week."}
{"original": "that's a nod to what the senate did in 2018 when christine blasey ford came forward to raise questions about the conduct of supreme court justice brett kavanaugh during his confirmation process. after much debate and negotiation, the senate postponed a confirmation vote on kavanaugh until the fbi completed a probe of blasey ford's allegation. the supposition was that if republican senators were willing to pause kavanaugh's confirmation for a week, then surely they could take a week to hear from witnesses in president trump's impeachment trial."}
{"original": "it was also a red herring that calling witnesses would devour all senate business. if the senate voted to call witnesses, it's likely the trial would go dark on the floor for a week or two. maybe just meet in trial session for a few minutes each day as the senate took the depositions offstage. senate impeachment rules don't require the trial to meet until 1 pm et each day. so it's possible the senate could still debate and vote on legislation and nominations either before or after the trial sessions during this period."}
{"original": "but, it turns out, the senate lacked the votes to swing open the gateway to the possibility of witnesses. lamar alexander announced his opposition to the witness option. lisa murkowski followed suit the next day. the senate wouldn't call witnesses."}
{"original": "that left the senate with but a handful of unanswered questions: when would the senate finish the trial? would any republicans vote to remove mr. trump? would any democrats vote to acquit the president?"}
{"original": "we now have an answer to the first question. the senate will vote sometime after 4 pm et wednesday on both articles of impeachment: abuse of power and obstruction of congress. it's unclear if we will know how everyone will vote until just before the senate takes those roll call tallies. but friday afternoon – once the senate knew the math on the witness question, there wasn't an obvious answer to how it got from point a to point c."}
{"original": "many republican senators and the white house wanted to conclude the trial friday night or in the wee hours of saturday morning. on capitol hill, when you have the votes, you move, regardless of the hour. you don't tempt fate. there's a reason why the senate voted on the first version of obamacare before dawn on christmas eve morning in 2009. you never know when some new allegation may come tumbling in over the transom to alter the calculus."}
{"original": "but, here was the problem. the senate had heard nothing but arguments from the impeachment managers and mr. trump's defense counsel for weeks now on the floor. would the senate suddenly just call votes on the articles of impeachment without allowing senators to actually speak and debate on the floor the guilt or innocence of the president?"}
{"original": "so, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky) held off on the witness gateway vote until late friday afternoon. it was only then that he could secure an agreement between gopers and democrats on how to finish the trial. it wouldn't wrap over the weekend. things would extend through late wednesday – punctuated by president trump's state of the union speech in the middle."}
{"original": "some gopers wanted the president cleared before the tuesday address. but democrats noted that president clinton presented a state of the union message during his impeachment trial in 1999."}
{"original": "there was naturally some grumbling from those close to the president."}
{"original": "it's a terrible thing, said one source familiar with mr. trump's thinking. (republican) senators should have stayed in on saturday. they got rolled."}
{"original": "but mcconnell was hamstrung on having the votes to finish the trial immediately."}
{"original": "it was the best deal mcconnell could get, said one republican source. the administration is pleased that this is the best the republican senate could do to shorten the process."}
{"original": "white house director of legislative affairs eric ueland put a different spin on things. ueland thought having state of the union one night – followed by the trial verdicts – would boost mr. trump."}
{"original": "it's a strong, one-two punch to have the state of the union with a clear vision, clear agenda and clear focus for 2020 followed immediately by acquittal on this fake articles of impeachment the next day, said ueland."}
{"original": "and even though it was a moot point by the weekend, we finally got some clarity as to if john roberts could break a tie in the senate trial."}
{"original": "a book of 44 standing rules govern senate practice. but what is more voluminous is a catalogue for thousands of senate precedents. in fact, the senate conducts much of its business based on precedent. so on friday night, senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-ny) posed a parliamentary inquiry to roberts as to whether he could break ties in an impeachment trial. roberts answered schumer from the dais."}
{"original": "i think it would be inappropriate for me, an unelected official from a different branch of government, to assert the power to change that result so that the motion would succeed, declared roberts."}
{"original": "and with that, roberts and the senate established a new precedent."}

{"original": "the democratic members of congress attending the state of the union address appeared petty, showing that they were politicos first and elected officials second. some democratic representatives did not show up. others walked out. some hectored trump. some would not stand up — even when ordinary americans were being applauded for their extraordinary lives."}

{"original": "rulings have changed as some circuit courts have flipped, and others are close to flipping"}
{"original": "the supreme court gets the most attention, but it only rules on about one-tenth of one percent of all appeals court cases, so the final appeals courts (called circuit courts) almost always get the last word."}
{"original": "during the trump administration, three federal appellate courts have flipped from being majority democratic-appointed to being majority republican-appointed. the flipped courts (the 2nd, 3rd, and 11th circuits) have jurisdiction over many populous eastern states: florida, georgia, alabama, new york, pennsylvania, new jersey, connecticut, vermont, and delaware."}
{"original": "supreme court refuses to hear expedited obamacare appeal"}
{"original": "more than a quarter of all federal appeals court judges have now been appointed by trump."}
{"original": "the 9th circuit, which has jurisdiction over california and many other western states, has long been known for left-wing legal decisions. when trump became president, the balance on the court was 18 democratic-appointed judges to just 7 republican-appointed ones."}
{"original": "but after trump's appointees filled the court, the balance is now a much more even 16 to 13, still with a majority of democrats."}
{"original": "as the court has become more balanced, its rulings have changed as well."}
{"original": "in july 2018, the court issued a surprise ruling striking down a california ban on firearm magazines capable of holding 10 bullets or more."}
{"original": "in june 2019, it allowed the trump administration to withdraw federal funding from any medical facility that provides abortions or offers abortion referrals."}
{"original": "in july 2019, it allowed the administration to direct community policing grants to cities that are not sanctuary cities."}
{"original": "legal experts say more is down the road."}
{"original": "what's happened so far is a very small part of what's to come, john o. mcginnis, professor of constitutional law at northwestern university, told fox news. the biggest thing is that these judges will create a cultural change in the legal profession... lawyers, law schools... will study their decisions and that will shift their thinking... toward interpreting the original meaning of the constitution."}
{"original": "trump's judicial picks are better qualified than usual"}
{"original": "they are better-credentialled than usual, mcginnis said. this is acknowledged even by people who don't like the trump judges."}
{"original": "an analysis by the left-wing news site vox found that: based solely on objective legal credentials, the average trump appointee has a far more impressive résumé than any past president's nominees."}
{"original": "it based that on the fact that, as it found: approximately 40 percent of trump's appellate nominees clerked for a supreme court justice, and about 80 percent clerked on a federal court of appeals. that compares to less than a quarter of obama's nominees who clerked on the supreme court, and less than half with a federal appellate clerkship."}
{"original": "mcginnis said that having smart appointees also matters because they are more influential than their colleagues."}
{"original": "in these appointees, we see some very strong judges who are likely to be more influential than average, he said."}
{"original": "other legal scholars also say trump's appointments are uniquely intellectual."}
{"original": "as someone who is not a trump fan, i think the appointments have been excellent, overall a brilliant, interesting group of judges... [with] a lot more professor/former professor types than bush appointed, david bernstein, a law professor who teaches constitutional law at george mason university, told fox news."}
{"original": "trump's judicial picks are younger than usual"}
{"original": "bernstein added that trump has been appointing very young judges."}
{"original": "they are young... i think age 55 has been the [informal] cutoff, and many are substantially younger, so they will be on the courts for a long time, bernstein said."}
{"original": "the numbers back that up, and the trump administration touts it. the white house reported in a november fact sheet: the average age of circuit judges appointed by president trump is less than 50 years old – a full 10 years younger than the average age of president obama's circuit nominees."}
{"original": "the young and credentialed appointees appear to be part of a conscious effort by the administration to remake the courts."}
{"original": "we have to pick a great one, we have to pick one that's going to be there for 40 years, 45 years, trump said during a 2018 rally. we need intellect, we need -- so many things."}
{"original": "bernstein noted that the judges fit the mold of conservative legal philosophy broadly."}
{"original": "click here to get the fox news app"}
{"original": "i think there was a fear in some circles that trump would appoint cronies and hacks. hasn't happened, he said."}
{"original": "they're very distinctly originalist judges, mcginnis said. they'll follow precedent -- but when there isn't clear precedent, they will look at the original meaning of the constitution."}
{"original": "senate republicans are on track to fill all current judicial vacancies"}
{"original": "when trump took office, there were 114 unfilled court seats. in addition to those, 157 new seats opened in the last three years."}
{"original": "trump's judicial confirmations got off to a slow start, with only 18 confirmed in 2017. in 2018, 65 were confirmed – still far too slow a pace to clear the backlog."}
{"original": "but in april 2019, senate majority leader mitch connell passed a senate rules change that allowed much faster approval of judges. as a result, 105 judges were cleared in 2019."}
{"original": "if the senate is able to continue its rate of approval (10 judges a month) since the rules change, all current vacancies (79) will be filled by the end of trump's term. if the current speed is maintained, there is also room to fill most new vacancies that will arise in 2020."}
{"original": "but bernstein said that, even with all the new judges, trump's many appointees have merely brought the legal system back towards balance ideologically."}
{"original": "the judiciary still leans left because of holdover obama and clinton appointees. you would need a second trump term to change that, bernstein said."}
{"original": "the ninth circuit has definitely changed dramatically thanks to trump appointees, but would flip right back if a democrat is elected in 2020, he added."}

{"original": "sources say roberts will be ready, having quietly reached out to associates in recent weeks over the role he would play in managing the trial. he may rely on the rehnquist model: how former chief justice william rehnquist deftly handled the 1999 impeachment trial of president clinton."}

{"original": "despite voting as a member of the high court a year earlier to allow a sexual harassment lawsuit against clinton to proceed -- which set the subsequent impeachment process in motion -- there was no real objection to having rehnquist preside. the paula jones case led to clinton being tried over perjury and obstruction of justice, for his later statements made under oath where he denied an affair with white house intern monica lewinsky."}

{"original": "senate leaders -- both republicans and democrats -- are working to finalize the trial length, testimony and exact role of the president's counsel. and it will be lawmakers -- the jury, in effect -- who would establish the exact rules of trial, not the judge."}
{"original": "[rehnquist] was content to allow the senate to control its own procedures, said schaffer. and really, he viewed himself as a guest of the senate during the impeachment trial."}
{"original": "but that does not mean roberts would be marginalized. rehnquist issued important rulings guiding senators on impeachment procedures."}
{"original": "and he spoke from experience, writing a 1992 history book on the 1868 impeachment of andrew johnson, grand inquests."}
{"original": "the importance of the acquittal [of president andrew johnson] can hardly be overstated, rehnquist wrote, something trump today might approve. with respect to the chief executive, it has meant that as to the policies he sought to pursue, he would be answerable only to the country as a whole in the quadrennial presidential elections, and not to congress through the process of impeachment."}
{"original": "when it was done, rehnquist described his role, by using a line from a favorite gilbert and sullivan operetta, i did nothing in particular, and i did it very well."}

{"original": "roberts' main role would be to make any rulings on procedure raised by senators, the house impeachment managers or the president's counsel. but while he could decide on evidentiary questions or objections, the chief could choose to have senators instead vote on those matters. or the lawmakers could override any roberts rulings with a majority vote."}
{"original": "and since the senators are not allowed to speak, any questions they submit in writing would be read aloud by the judge."}
{"original": "the chief's main power may be in breaking any tie votes. chief justice salmon p. chase made two such votes during the johnson trial."}

{"original": "congresswoman alexandria ocasio cortez, d-n.y., recently announced that democrats should increase the top personal income tax rates as high as 70 percent. that would be the highest income tax rate in the developed world, higher than all of our major trading partners and competitors."}

{"original": "ocasio-cortez is not alone. the democratic party in the house chose to begin 2019 demanding higher taxes. they have already voted down an amendment offered by republican ways and means ranking member kevin brady to make the standard deduction and child tax credit permanent (now they expire in ten years like the bush tax cuts of 2001.)"}
{"original": "if democrats allow all of the personal income tax cuts in the tax cuts and jobs act to lapse, it will result in a significant tax hike of $2,058 per year for a family of four earning $73,000."}
{"original": "then democrats got rid of the republican house rule that required a three-fifths majority vote to hike taxes. democrats refused to require a three-fifths vote to hike taxes on low or middle-income americans. they made it easier to raise taxes on all americans."}
{"original": "ocasio-cortez was a toddler when the democrats controlled the house, senate, and white house in 1993. they raised the income tax—not to 70 percent—but to 39.6 percent. the democrats then lost the house and senate in 1994."}
{"original": "ocasio-cortez was 19-years-old in 2008 when once again the democrats won the house, senate and presidency. obama and pelosi (who should now know better) raised the income tax top rate to just over 40 percent and lost the house and their senate supermajority in 2010."}

{"original": "but wait, there is more. the democratic party platform calls for a tax on carbon dioxide, an energy tax. one carbon tax plan introduced by democrat congressman ted deutch of florida would increase taxes on energy by $1 trillion over the next ten years and that energy tax would automatically increase without any vote by congress."}
{"original": "should we care about the threat to hike the top personal income tax rate to 70 pecent? ocasio-cortez promises that her top rate would only hit those earning more than $10 million a year. maybe most of us are safe?"}
{"original": "let's first look at some history. the personal income tax was imposed in 1913. the top tax rate on the very rich was 7 percent. we were all promised then that the new income tax was a tax on the rich. the one percent. in today's dollars that 7% rate only hit those earning more than $11 million (sounds like the plan democrats like aoc are pushing.) but within a few years, the lowest rate went above 7 percent. today the bottom rate is 10 percent -- higher than the punitive tax rate that was supposed to hit only the kennedy and rockefeller kids."}
{"original": "new taxes are often imposed on the rich or them. then over time, they trickle down to hit all of us. that is what happened with the personal income tax. once targeted to the top one percent but now hitting half of americans."}
{"original": "then there was the spanish american war tax, a tax on long distance phone calls in 1898 when only the very rich owned phones. over time all americans had phones at home and we all paid the federal excise tax on every long-distance phone call—for one hundred years."}
{"original": "tax hikes on the rich never stay so focused. they slip down to hit the rest of us."}
{"original": "promising to soak the rich is a popular ruse to misdirect the attention of voters to ignore taxes."}
{"original": "politicians like to misdirect your attention by talking about taxing the rich while they are enacting energy taxes that hit everyone who drives a car, heats their home or uses lights or air conditioning. and taxes on businesses are simply hidden taxes placed into the higher cost of everything we buy each day."}

{"original": "the decision by sen. rand paul (r-ky) to vote in favor of blocking president trump's national emergency declaration for the border sets two things in motion on capitol hill:"}
{"original": "1) it all but guarantees passage of the resolution overturning the declaration in the senate."}
{"original": "2) it tees up president trump's first veto effort."}
{"original": "the senate math is currently 53 republicans and 47 senators who caucus with the democrats."}
{"original": "all 47 democrats are expected to vote in favor of the resolution, including sen. joe manchin, d-wva. when asked last week how he'd vote, manchin told fox he'd vote yes. manchin also cited the fact that he now held the seat of the legendary, late senate majority leader robert byrd, d-wva. byrd was very protective of congressional prerogatives. he was also a longtime chairman of the senate appropriations committee. in other words, byrd would probably take a dim view of manchin if he voted otherwise."}
{"original": "paul becomes the fourth republican senator to support the effort to reject the national emergency. others are sens. susan collins, r-maine, thom tillis, r-n.c., and lisa murkowski, r-ark. the first two face competitive re-election bids next year. also keep an eye on sens. lamar alexander, r-tenn., mitt romney, r-utah, cory gardner, r-colo., and perhaps mike lee, r-utah. others could be in play as well. pay particular attention to appropriators."}
{"original": "senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ken., has not set a firm date to deal with the national emergency disapproval bill on the floor. mcconnell's simply indicated the senate would tackle the plan sometime before mid-march. fox is told to keep an eye on march 14. fox is also told the senate would likely work out an arrangement to handle the issue in one day. the statute provides for up to three days of debate in the senate."}
{"original": "a vote to overturn the resolution is yet another example of senate gop dissension when it comes to president trump. in recent months, republican senators broke with the president on a speedy withdrawal from syria, how the administration dealt with saudi arabia following the death of jamal khashoggi and the cancellation of some russian sanctions. fox is told mr. trump was close to facing a jailbreak of gop defections had the government not re-opened when it did following the shutdown."}
{"original": "if the senate approves the package, the house and senate are in alignment and the package goes to president trump. this likely begs mr. trump's first use of a veto."}
{"original": "president obama vetoed his first piece of legislation after only 11 months on the job. president george w. bush never vetoed a bill until he was in office for five-and-a-half years. president bill clinton didn't use a veto until two-and-a-half years into his presidency."}
{"original": "successful veto overrides are rare. the gambit requires a two-thirds vote by both bodies of congress. that's 67 votes in the senate, provided all 100 senators cast ballots. 427 house members cast ballots on the bill to block the national emergency last week. so the yardstick there is 285 yeas. 245 members voted in favor of the bill. thus, the house fell 40 votes short."}
{"original": "we are not expecting a successful override of a prospective veto of the national emergency. the math simply isn't there."}
{"original": "it's possible there could not be an attempt to override. the last unsuccessful attempt to override a veto came in january, 2016. president obama vetoed a republican effort to repeal and replace obamacare. the house voted 241-186, well short of the 285 yeas needed to override. the maneuver never went to the senate since the override maneuver failed in the house."}
{"original": "note that the vote to override is based on how many lawmakers actually take part in the override attempt, not on how many members voted on the bill when it passed both bodies. so, determining a precise number is impossible until the veto override vote is actually concluded."}
{"original": "the last successful veto override came in september, 2016. president obama vetoed the justice against sponsors of terrorism act. the measure allowed families of 9/11 victims to sue those responsible or the attacks, including saudi arabia. the senate voted 97-1 to override mr. obama (66 voted were needed). the house voted 348-77 with one lawmaker voting president. 284 yeas were needed for the override."}
{"original": "prior to 2016, the last three successful overrides came on bills vetoed by president george. w. bush. the house and senate overrode the president's veto on two versions of the farm bill in may and june of 2008. the house and senate then overrode mr. bush's veto of a medicare expansion plan in july, 2008."}
{"original": "bernie sanders may have dropped out of the presidential race, but he's still insisting he won the ideological war."}
{"original": "i don't quite get the claim, since he was absolutely clobbered by joe biden in primary after primary. once his let's-abolish-private-insurance agenda was front and center, democratic voters went for the former vp in some cases by landslide margins. maybe sanders was just trying to soothe his supporters."}
{"original": "much of the insta-punditry suggests that the party is lucky that sanders is bowing out now, rather than take the fight practically to the convention, as he did against hillary clinton. but the more important question for biden is whether he can win over most bernie supporters in his effort to beat president trump."}
{"original": "trump's ig firings: how 'loyal' should investigators be?"}
{"original": "biden issued the obligatory praise, saying his rival was leading a movement and that he hears and sees their concerns. that's standard-issue politics."}
{"original": "but the danger for joe biden is that if he moves too far left, he'll be swallowing a poison pill that is much more likely to kill his candidacy in november."}
{"original": "biden is already running on a far more liberal platform than anything he and barack obama espoused in their winning campaigns. he's already shifted to the left on such issues as abortion funding, climate change and a public health insurance option (after helping to pass obamacare). but it's precisely biden's image as a safer alternative--one who opposes medicare for all and zillions in new spending--that enabled him to beat two dozen opponents."}
{"original": "two washington post columnists say biden's first pivot is about to be announced: lowering the medicare age to 60, and forgiving all student debt for low- and middle-income borrowers who went to public colleges or historically black universities."}
{"original": "in his withdrawal speech, the strongest praise that sanders could muster was that joe is a decent guy. he knows full well that a lack of enthusiasm will prompt some of his fans to stay home, and some of the populists among them to defect to trump (as happened in 2016)."}
{"original": "subscribe to howie's media buzzmeter podcast, a riff of the day's hottest stories"}
{"original": "plus, what's this baloney about asking people in upcoming states to vote for him so he'll have more delegate clout at the convention? what kind of withdrawal is that? you're either in or out."}
{"original": "sanders told stephen colbert that while he knows biden won't adopt his platform, i hope to be able to work with joe and move him in a more progressive direction so he can attract new people."}
{"original": "but a further move to the left would also turn off some of the reliable democratic voters that biden, not the most charismatic of politicians, needs to get excited. and since when does the vanquished get to dictate the terms of surrender?"}
{"original": "biden's larger problem is that the coronavirus has frozen the campaign to the point where bernie bowing to reality is a one-day story. it was way down on the home pages of major newspapers yesterday morning."}
{"original": "here biden essentially becomes the democratic nominee--something most pundits predicted would never happen--and he doesn't even get a victory lap. in normal times, if sanders was so inclined, they could stage a rally in the midwest and raise their hands together."}
{"original": "instead, biden takes the crown at a time when trump has a huge platform, with lengthy white house briefings, on the only issue anyone cares about. biden has no role in the crisis, other than kibitizing from the sidelines--he and trump did have a call that the president praised--and that puts his campaign in limbo. he can't even meet with donors to try to close the huge financial gap in resources."}
{"original": "the 77-year-old democrat will make big news exactly once between now and august, when he announces which woman he's picked as his running mate."}
{"original": "and will the convention actually come off? biden himself says there's a good chance it will be a virtual event."}
{"original": "the lack of a four-day infomercial with screaming crowds, and 15,000 journalists in town, would definitely hurt the challenger. a convention that is little more than a web show wouldn't get many people excited. if the dems go virtual, it's likely the republicans would as well the following week, rather than going to charlotte. but the incumbent doesn't need a convention bump as much as biden does."}
{"original": "the flip side, as biden waits in the wings, is that trump will probably win or lose based on his handling of the pandemic. the only silver lining for biden is this will effectively be a much shorter campaign, leaving less time for the gaffes and missteps that marred his primary run."}

{"original": "the obama administration repeatedly sought to cut hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), yearly budget requests show -- seemingly undercutting former vice president joe biden's repeated attacks on the trump white house for its pandemic preparedness."}
{"original": "numerous democrats, including biden, have falsely claimed that trump slashed the cdc budget, and biden has suggested that he would never pursue similar cuts. the associated press has noted that those claims distort the facts, with factcheck.org pointing out that cdc funding has actually increased under the current administration, largely because congress insisted on maintaining funding levels for both cdc and the national institutes of health (nih)."}
{"original": "nevertheless, speaking to abc news' this week on march 1, biden claimed: they've cut the funding for the cdc. on friday, biden stepped up his attacks, writing on twitter: donald trump's careless, shortsighted actions left our nation ill-prepared and now americans are paying the price."}
{"original": "in its fiscal year 2013 budget, while biden was vice president, the obama administration sought a total funding level of $5.9 billion from the cdc, or a $569 million cut from the 2012 budget of $6.46 billion. in fiscal year 2015, the obama administration wanted a $414 million cut year-over-year, and again in the fiscal year 2017 budget, the obama administration looked to eliminate $251 million in cdc funding."}
{"original": "the proposed cuts take into account money budgeted for the prevention and public health fund, which was established under the patient protection and affordable care act of 2010 to bolster the nation's health care system. when not including that fund, the obama administration sought cdc cuts in five of its eight years."}
{"original": "some of the obama administration's cuts specifically took aim at the cdc's preparedness initiatives."}
{"original": "now, president obama's 2012 budget calls for paring some of that spending. funding for a public health emergency preparedness program run by the centers for disease control and prevention was cut by about $72 million below fiscal 2010 levels in the budget proposal. the wall street journal reported in 2012."}
{"original": "those cuts would later intensify. the us centers for disease control and prevention (cdc) takes a hit of about $270 million in the obama administration's proposed fiscal year 2014 budget, including significant cuts to biodefense and emergency preparedness programs, according to a 2013 post from the center for infectious disease research and policy."}
{"original": "us was best-prepared country in world to handle pandemics, johns hopkins found"}
{"original": "then, in 2015, president obama called for $50 million in budget cuts amid a measles outbreak -- and white house press secretary josh earnest's claims that obamacare would pick up the slack were rated false by the washington post's fact-checker."}
{"original": "chipping away at 317 funds — even if the majority of cuts are going toward vaccine purchases — jeopardizes the immunization system in general, public-health officials and advocates say. it restricts the ability of local public health departments to prepare for and respond to outbreaks and educate providers, chris aldridge, senior director for infectious disease at the national association of county and city health officials, told the washington post in 2015."}
{"original": "during the current coronavirus pandemic, money that government disease detectives first tapped to fight the latest outbreak was a congressional fund created for health emergencies. congress, which has strongly supported the cdc and nih, rejected a trump administration budget that might have cut their funding."}
{"original": "biden's coronavirus press blitz marred by distracting gaffes"}
{"original": "while some public health experts have said a bigger concern than white house budgets is the steady erosion of a cdc grant program for state and local public health emergency preparedness — the front lines in detecting and battling new disease. but that decline was set in motion by a congressional budget measure that predates trump."}
{"original": "the cdc's response has been excellent, as it has been in the past, said john auerbach, president of the nonpartisan trust for america's health, which works with government at all levels to improve the nation's response to high-risk health crises. some democrats have charged that trump decimated the nation's public health leadership, but auerbach said cdc's top scientific ranks have remained stable the past three years."}
{"original": "and, it emerged this week united states was ranked the best-prepared country in the world to handle a pandemic in late 2019 by the nuclear threat initiative (nti) and the johns hopkins center for health security (jhchs) -- an assessment seemingly at odds with claims by democrats that the trump administration left the country vulnerable to the ongoing coronavirus outbreak."}
{"original": "the global health security index was developed with guidance from an international panel of experts from 13 countries, with research by the economist intelligence unit from 2018 to 2019, the washington post reported last year. more than 100 researchers spent a year collecting and validating publicly available data."}
{"original": "at the same time, the paper noted that the u.s. score was still not perfect, and that factors driving down the u.s. score include the risks of social unrest and terrorism, and low public confidence in government."}
{"original": "see the full 2019 global health security index rankings"}
{"original": "trump's campaign has argued in recent days that misinformation may be one of the leading causes of that lack of confidence. for example, trump's team has pointed to biden's claims that no one on the national security council staff was put in charge of pandemic preparedness, based on a report that in may 2018, then-national security adviser john bolton eliminated the nsc's office of global health security and biodefense in a reorganization effort."}
{"original": "rear adm. r. timothy ziemer reportedly was ousted as senior director, and no replacement was named. but, factcheck.org has determined that the matter amounted to a reorganization, and that some team members [of the nsc pandemic office] were shifted to other groups, and others took over some of [the top official's] duties."}
{"original": "separately, the biden team has repeatedly argued that the president once referred to coronavirus as a hoax. that claim has been refuted by numerous fact-checkers, including the post's, which found that trump was clearly referring to democrats' efforts to blame him for the pandemic, not the virus itself. biden's advisors nonetheless were repeating the claim on friday."}
{"original": "further, a recent report by reuters that the u.s. had recently terminated a cdc position in china was widely cited by democrats and reporters as evidence of a lack of preparedness, and formed the basis for a reporter's question at a recent white house coronavirus briefing."}
{"original": "but, the article itself made clear that experts didn't think the move had anything to do with the spread of coronavirus in the united states."}
{"original": "one disease expert told reuters he was skeptical that the u.s. resident adviser would have been able to get earlier or better information to the trump administration, given the chinese government's suppression of information, the outlet noted."}
{"original": "in the end, based on circumstances in china, it probably wouldn't have made a big difference, former cdc epidemiologist and emory university professor scott mcnabb told reuters."}

{"original": "as the calendar flips to 2020, we're coming up on a decade since the passage of obamacare."}
{"original": "but democrats aren't celebrating 10 years of the affordable care act, signed into law march 23, 2010. that's largely because president obama's signature legislative achievement hasn't yielded the affordable care democrats promised."}
{"original": "let's start with that opening adjective – affordable. obamacare's champions insisted that their elaborate system of subsidies, taxes, regulations, public insurance expansions and state-level insurance exchanges would ultimately drive down the price of health coverage. obama himself promised it would save the typical family $2,500 a year."}
{"original": "paul batura: routine physical saved my life – here's how to make your health a priority in the new year"}
{"original": "but the cost of health insurance has skyrocketed over the past decade. premiums on obamacare's exchanges have increased 75 percent since the marketplaces went live. off the exchanges, the average employer-sponsored family health plan now has annual premiums of over $20,000."}
{"original": "that was all too predictable. obamacare required insurers to cover 10 essential benefits, including things like substance abuse treatment and children's dental services, even if consumers didn't want or need them."}
{"original": "the law also ordered insurers to charge all people of the same age the same rate, regardless of health status or history. and it capped premiums for the old at three times those for the young, even though health costs for older people are about five times those for younger people."}
{"original": "all those mandated benefits and extra regulations raise costs for insurers – which they pass along in the form of higher premiums."}
{"original": "many employers and individuals have not been able to bear the higher costs obamacare has brought about. for example, the slice of small firms offering health benefits to their employees fell by one-quarter between 2012 and 2016."}
{"original": "despite a growing economy and falling poverty rate, the national uninsured rate ticked up last year, from 7.9 to 8.5 percent."}
{"original": "meanwhile, the only people who can afford coverage through the exchanges are those who receive subsidies from the federal government. more than 87 percent of exchange enrollees in 2019 were subsidized."}
{"original": "and so, despite a growing economy and falling poverty rate, the national uninsured rate ticked up last year, from 7.9 to 8.5 percent."}
{"original": "obamacare was also supposed to give people more insurance choices. those who liked their health plans could keep them, obama repeatedly promised. for those who didn't have good coverage, the affordable care act would supposedly be a godsend."}
{"original": "things didn't turn out that way. many patients have seen their insurance choices dwindle. aetna, for example, exited in 2018 after years of ratcheting down its presence on the exchanges. executives reported they'd lost $900 million due to what they euphemistically called marketplace structural issues."}

{"original": "the average number of insurers in each state declined 10 percent between 2014 and 2020. consumers shopping for coverage on the exchanges in delaware and wyoming have just one choice of insurer this year. in 15 states there are just two insurers on the exchanges."}
{"original": "democrats allege that sabotage by the trump administration deserves much of the blame for obamacare's problems. but without the administration's intervention, things could have been worse."}
{"original": "take the waivers the administration granted to seven states to give them more flexibility over how to spend obamacare's individual-market premium subsidies. a heritage foundation analysis found that average premiums in the waiver states for benchmark plans – which determine overall subsidy levels for everyone in the market – fell more than 7 percent last year. the result is lower premiums for customers – and lower subsidy bills for taxpayers."}

{"original": "president trump declares a national emergency to go around congress and build his border wall."}
{"original": "donald trump, president: we are talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs."}
{"original": "wallace: what showdowns lie ahead in congress and the courts?"}
{"original": "we'll ask one of the president's top integration hardliners, senior advisor stephen miller."}
{"original": "trump: the only reason we're talking about this is because of election, because they want to try and win an election, which it looks like they're not going to be able to do."}

{"original": "all, right now, on fox news sunday."}
{"original": "wallace: and hello again from fox news in washington."}
{"original": "congress used the power of the purse to deny president trump all the money he wants to build a wall on the southern border. so the president invoked executive powers to free up billions of dollars to do it anyway. the president says there's a crisis at the border, but critics, including some republicans, say the president's move has created a crisis of its own."}
{"original": "in a moment, we'll speak with white house senior policy advisor stephen miller, but first, let's get the latest from kevin corke at the white house -- kevin."}
{"original": "kevin corke, correspondent: chris, the president may have avoided other shutdown fight by signing off on a funding bill, but his use of executive power will very likely create a new battle in the courts."}
{"original": "trump: we have tremendous amount of drugs flowing into our country, much of it coming from the southern border. i'm going to be signing a national emergency."}
{"original": "corke: in laying out the reason for declaring a national emergency, president trump lit a political fuse, reigniting a separation of powers debate and setting the stage for a possible constitutional crisis. an issue: border wall funding, illegal immigration and the use of power given to the president by congress."}
{"original": "but the criticism has come from both the left and the right, with senate minority leader chuck schumer and speaker nancy pelosi issuing a statement calling the president's declaration unlawful over a crisis that does not exist. meanwhile, trump loyalists howled because they believe the president signed off on a funding bill that restricts much of what and where a wall could be built, accusing mr. trump of setting up an illegal immigration stimulus."}
{"original": "ann coulter: the only national emergency is that our president is an idiot."}
{"original": "corke: chris, if the white house spends the money sequentially as they currently plan to do, they would spend over $5 billion before any emergency funds are tapped. that's money to get moving, if you will, while this battle makes its way through the courts -- chris."}
{"original": "wallace: kevin corke reporting from the white house, kevin, thanks for that."}
{"original": "and joining us now for an exclusive interview, white house senior policy advisor, stephen miller."}
{"original": "stephen, welcome back to fox news sunday."}
{"original": "stephen miller, white house senior policy advisor: great to be here thank you."}
{"original": "wallace: i want to start with something that president trump said friday when he was declaring a national emergency."}
{"original": "trump: i could do the wall over a longer period of time. i didn't need to do this but i'd rather do it much faster."}
{"original": "wallace: i didn't need to do this. how does that justify a national emergency?"}
{"original": "miller: well, as you know chris, we already have 4,000 troops on the border in light of a national emergency, a decision that was made almost a year ago, as we see an increasing number of people crossing the border as well as increasing violence in mexico. what the president was saying is that like past presidents, he could choose to ignore this crisis, choose to ignore this emergency as others have. but that's not what he's going to do."}
{"original": "wallace: the president talks about an invasion, used that word multiple times on friday -- an invasion on the southern border. but let's look at the facts, i want to put them up on the screen: 1.6 million people were stopped crossing the border illegally back in 2000, less than a quarter that many were caught last year. the government's own numbers show, for all the president is talking about drugs streaming over the border, 80 to 90 percent of the cocaine, heroin and fentanyl seized at the border is seized at ports of entry, not along unfenced areas."}
{"original": "and in 2017, twice as many of the new people in the country illegally were from visa overstays, as were from crossing the border. again, where's the emergency -- the national emergency to build a wall?"}
{"original": "miller: there's a lot of values presented there so i'd like to go through it each one piece at a time if i could."}
{"original": "so let's start with your point about the border crossings in the year 2000. as you know, when george bush came into office, illegal immigration total - - doubled from 6 million to 12 million by the time he left office. that represented an astonishing betrayal of the american people."}
{"original": "i'm not going to sit here today and tell you that george bush defended this country on the southern border because he did not. one of the biggest changes that's happened since then and now is the mass release of illegal aliens due to a patchwork of court rulings and loopholes in our federal laws and changing tactics from smugglers and transnational organization --"}
{"original": "wallace: i want to go into all of this, but let's just focus on that one issue. four times as many people were coming across the border in 2000 as now, so why is that --"}
{"original": "miller: back then, when 95 percent could be turned around in a matter of days. as a result of loopholes, activist judicial rulings, and increasing sophistication from cartels, the reality is that more than half the people crossing the border are what we call non-impactable. they can't be turned around."}
{"original": "and so what you see is sophisticated operations and smugglers will actually push out migrants, and children, and family units to divert border agents and then because there's not secured areas with the wall, they'll then cross after the border agents have been diverted to those areas."}
{"original": "at a fundamental level, we could go down to the details -- and you know, chris, i could go down to details as much as you want to but the bottom line is this."}
{"original": "miller: but the bottom line is this, you cannot conceive of a nation without a strong, secure border. it is fundamental and essential to the idea of sovereignty and national survival to have control over who enters and doesn't enter the country."}
{"original": "and we can get into statistics. you want to talk about drugs? there's been a huge increase in drug deaths since george w. bush and barak obama were in office."}
{"original": "wallace: i understand that, but 80 to 90 percent of those drugs, don't come across in unfenced areas, they come from ports of entry. those are your own customs and border patrol numbers."}
{"original": "miller: which is the reason why we also ask for additional resources at the ports of entry."}
{"original": "wallace: but this is what you got."}
{"original": "miller: but, chris, the problem with the statement that you're apprehending 80 to 90 percent of the drugs at the ports of entry, that's like saying, you apprehend this contraband at tsa checkpoints at airports. you apprehend the contraband there because that's where you have the people. that's where you have the screeners."}
{"original": "i assure you, if we had people at that same density and screeners at that same density across every single inch and mile of the southern border, you'd have more drug interdicted in those areas. you don't know what you don't know and you don't catch what you don't catch."}
{"original": "but as a matter of national security, you cannot have uncontrolled, unsecured areas of the border where people can pour in undetected."}
{"original": "miller: one more point, i guarantee you this, if donald trump had said he's invoking the national emergency military construction authority to build a security perimeter in iraq or afghanistan or around a military installation in syria, there would not have been one word of objection from congress. this is defending our own country."}
{"original": "wallace: i question whether in fact that's the case, but in any case, let's talk about the constitutional aspects of this because i've talked to you over the years. i know that you are a constitutional conservative and you believe the constitution should be interpreted as written, correct?"}
{"original": "wallace: ok, here's article 1, section 9, clause 7, of the constitution as written. no money shall be drawn from the treasury but in consequence of appropriations made by law."}
{"original": "isn't what president trump wants to do a clear violation of what the founders -- of what james madison talked about as giving congress the power of the purse?"}
{"original": "miller: no, because congress in 1976 passed the national emergency act and gave the president the authority, as a result of that, to invoke a national emergency in many different circumstances but among them the use of military construction funds."}
{"original": "and that was the point i was making earlier. if the president were to say we're going to use military construction funds to, say, increase a perimeter around a base in bagram, around a base in syria, nobody would even say anything about it, and we have 4,000 troops on the border right now and as a result of that mission, they need to secure those areas where they're patrolling."}
{"original": "wallace: but let's talk about national emergencies. national emergencies have been declared 59 times since 1976 when the law was passed, the national emergencies act."}
{"original": "can you point to a single incident, even one, where the president asked congress for money, congress refused to give him that money, and the president then evokes national emergency powers to get the money?"}
{"original": "wallace: can you find one case?"}
{"original": "miller: what you're missing, chris, is that national emergencies don't have all the same authorities and the same justification."}
{"original": "wallace: i assume that, but there have been 59. can you find one case like that?"}
{"original": "miller: this authority specifically refers to using military construction funds. other emergencies, for example, were to --"}
{"original": "wallace: if you want to talk about military constructions, do you know how many times military construction has been invoked as a national emergency? that would be only be twice."}
{"original": "wallace: twice. once by george h. w. bush during the middle of the gulf war and the second time by george w. bush right after 9/11."}
{"original": "miller: chris, can you name -- can you name one foreign threat in the world today, outside the country's borders that currently kills more americans than the threats crossing our southern border?"}
{"original": "wallace: you know the joy of this is i get to ask you question and --"}
{"original": "wallace: answer my question, can you name one case where a president has asked congress for money, congress has refused and the president has then evoked national policy to get the money anyway?"}
{"original": "miller: well, this current situation --"}
{"original": "wallace: just yes or no, sir."}
{"original": "miller: the current situation pertains specifically to the military construction authority."}
{"original": "wallace: when congress asked for money for military construction, congress said no and he's then --"}
{"original": "miller: the meaning of the statute, chris, is clear on its own terms. if you don't like the statute or members of congress don't like the statute --"}
{"original": "wallace: but you agree the answer is no that --"}
{"original": "miller: but the premise of your question is also false because congress has appropriated money for construction of border barriers consistently. this is part of the national security --"}
{"original": "wallace: but they've never done this under a national emergency where the president --"}
{"original": "miller: who declared national emergency to promote democracy in belarus, to promote democracy in zimbabwe?"}
{"original": "wallace: but it didn't involve taking money that congress refused to appropriate."}
{"original": "miller: they didn't refuse to appropriate it. they passed a law specifically saying the president could have this authority. it's in the plain statute. that's the decision that congress made and if people don't like that they can address it."}
{"original": "but to my -- but to my point that i made, this would not be even an issue if the president was invoking that statute to support some foreign adventure overseas. you and i both know that that presidents for years have engaged in one military adventure after another, not to mention the fact that we do operations to destroy drug fields in foreign lands in afghanistan or in colombia and we can't even deal with the criminal cartels operating on our border?"}
{"original": "wallace: ok, let's talk about --"}
{"original": "miller: -- these two organizations are destabilizing the western hemisphere."}
{"original": "wallace: i want to move on respectfully. let's talk about the logistics here. if the president gets access to the entire $8 billion he's seeking, how many miles of barrier wall would he be able to build and how quickly?"}
{"original": "miller: well, if you look at the authorities we have both in terms of drug corridor funds, in terms of national emergency funds, in terms of treasury funds, as well as appropriated funds and other reprogramming authorities that may exist. in combination with the existing --"}
{"original": "miller: you're looking at hundreds of miles collectively."}
{"original": "miller: well, you're going to see probably a couple hundred miles in time i would say by the end of the next appropriation cycle. all together in terms of what we already have underway, what's underway right now and then what we're going to complete --"}
{"original": "wallace: so, by the end of this year and hundreds of miles?"}
{"original": "miller: no, next fiscal year, one more after this."}
{"original": "wallace: ok, by september of 2020."}
{"original": "wallace: right in the middle of the presidential campaign."}
{"original": "miller: my point is that if you look at what we've already outlaid, we have 120-odd miles that are already under construction or are already obligated, plus the additional funds we have and that we're going to outlay, we're going to look at a few hundred miles."}
{"original": "wallace: ok, final question. if both the house and the senate approve a resolution of disapproval, which they're allowed to -- it's specifically called for in the national emergencies act and if they pass it in the senate, it would be with bipartisan support, because there's republican control."}
{"original": "if they pass a resolution of disapproval, will the president veto that, which would be the first veto of his presidency?"}
{"original": "miller: well, obviously, the president is going to protect his national emergency declaration, chris. and i know that we're out of time, but i again want to make this point. there's not threat --"}
{"original": "wallace: so, yes, he would veto?"}
{"original": "miller: he's going to protect his national emergency declaration guaranteed. but the fact that they're even talking about a resolution of disapproval show you this is a statutory issue and a statutory delegation that congress made."}
{"original": "but again, i want to make this point. this is a deep intellectual problem that is plaguing this city which is that we've had thousands of americans die year after year after year because of threats crossing our southern border. we have families and communities that are left unprotected and undefended. we have international narco terrorist organizations."}
{"original": "this is a threat in our country, not overseas. not in belarus. not in zimbabwe. not in afghanistan or syria or iraq but right here. and if the president can't defend this country, then he cannot fulfill this constitutional oath of office."}
{"original": "wallace: thanks for coming in. it's always good and always challenging to talk to you."}
{"original": "wallace: up next, we'll bring in our sunday group to discuss the legal and political battles ahead, as the president tests his powers to make his border wall a reality."}
{"original": "plus, rush limbaugh joins us live. you don't want to miss that."}
{"original": "trump: we're talking about an invasion of our country with drugs, with human traffickers, with all types of criminals and gangs."}
{"original": "rep. nancy pelosi, d-calif., speaker of the house: you want to talk about a national emergency? let's talk about today, the one-year anniversary of another manifestation of the epidemic of gun violence in america. that's a national emergency."}
{"original": "wallace: president trump justifying his declaration of a national emergency at the border while house speaker pelosi warns republicans of the president's action may set."}
{"original": "and it's time now for our sunday group. marc short, former director of legislative affairs for president trump, charles lane from the washington post, bob woodward, author of the best-selling book fear: trump in the white house, and katie pavlich from townhall.com."}
{"original": "well, bob, as we saw from the aforementioned book, you spend a lot of time reporting on this president. how do you explain, why do you think he declared a national emergency over warnings from top senate republican leaders and from some of his own top lawyers?"}
{"original": "bob woodward, author, fear: trump in the white house: two reasons. it's a political promise and even though what he's saying or trying to do here is unsupportable in terms of the facts, he looks tough. he looked strong. i'm protecting you and that's very appealing not just to his base, but to lots of people."}
{"original": "and so, it's not out of the zone of plausible presidential action but as a constitutional matter, it's absurd and, you know, everyone knows that and he's found an angle, and my god, he looks tough to lots of people. you know, this is going to go to the courts, but that will be resolved in about a year or so. and so, it's not going to be on the way there."}
{"original": "wallace: all right. marc, i'm going to give you an opportunity to respond to all that but it isn't just coming from bob woodward, it isn't just coming from democrats, there's been considerable blowback from some republicans, especially in the senate. they say it's a violation of the separation of powers under the constitution. they say you're taking money that had been specifically appropriated for some important military projects and know the president faces the possibility of a resolution of disapproval, passed not just by the house, controlled by democrats, but by the senate, controlled by republicans."}
{"original": "marc short, former white house legislative affairs director: yes, i think that the reality is that this is actually a statue that has been authorized by congress to the executive branch. not just in 1976 but in 1982, military construction act under title ten, code 50 that basically says that the secretary of defense can reallocate dollars."}
{"original": "so, it's fair that congress want to say we want to vote disapproval, because they never liked the executive branch exerting that sort of influence, but they've given them the executive branch this influence. if they want to change it, they should change the statute. that's the reality."}
{"original": "any republican who eventually would choose to vote against this is really not voting against the statue, what they would be voting against is the president's commitment to try to secure the border and that would be a pretty perilous vote for any republican."}
{"original": "wallace: katie, whatever you think of the wall, the president defends it using, as i discussed, some would say even argued about with stephen miller was some very questionable facts, for instance, facts from his own administration from cpb, customs and border protection that the vast majority of drugs that are seized come through ports of entry, not through unfenced areas."}
{"original": "here's how the president responded to that on friday."}
{"original": "trump: when you listen to politicians, particularly certain democrats, they say it all comes through the port of entries. wrong. it's wrong. it's just a lie."}
{"original": "wallace: does that bother you, the president dismissing facts, as they say, from his own administration as democratic lies?"}
{"original": "katie pavlich, townhall.com editor: i wouldn't say that -- the statistic was coming through ports of entry are not true however, think that there are no drugs coming through these non-ports of entry with no fencing is kind of like saying a tree falls in the forest, did anybody hear it or see it? if you don't have anybody there to look and see or to confiscate --"}
{"original": "wallace: but that's all supposition. you're going to declare a national emergency and spend billions of dollars because a tree may have fallen?"}
{"original": "pavlich: well, you can't prove it's not happening. we do know that walls work. in yuma, 98 percent of the illegal traffic both in terms of drugs and human traffickers went down."}
{"original": "human trafficking is a billion-dollar industry. this is not, with all due respect, about the president simply trying to look tough. the fact is that in the bill that he signed, take away the wall, the unaccompanied minor crisis in the central american migrant crisis is about to get a lot worse because it allows anybody, any adult who has any connection to an unaccompanied minor to get amnesty and not be deported by ice."}
{"original": "that means that people are not going to use children as human shields, they've been doing since 2014 under barack obama, to come into the country illegally. there are 22 million people here who are underground in the economy, both republicans and democrats have not decided what they want to do with them. they created an underclass of people, which is anti-american and instead of saying they want to do with a resolution condemning the president on trying to fix the problem, maybe they should try and fix the problem of illegal immigration, changing the asylum loss and making sure the crisis stops at the border before there is one."}
{"original": "charles lane, the washington post: what t strikes me about this whole crisis is if you really stop and think about an issue of just getting money for the wall, the president could have done a lot of that without the national emergency. it's gotten too little attention that almost half of the money he's reprogramming within the executive branch does not require a declaration of national emergency."}
{"original": "wallace: that's right. more than two a half of the $6 billion."}
{"original": "lane: correct. and if you put that together with the 1.4 appropriated, you are within shouting distance of the famous 5.7."}
{"original": "so, clearly, he feels it is in some other way to his advantage to declare this national emergency and precipitate a crisis. and i would argue it is a political calculation. that he believes that putting pressure on these wavering republicans in the senate by arousing his base, by doing something dramatic to keep the political promise, this is to his long-term benefit."}
{"original": "he said himself i don't need it, i don't need an emergency, he is doing it because if parameterize is this issue politically and allows them to play a role."}
{"original": "wallace: all right. then there was the president predicting the legal journey of his declaration of national emergency over the next few months or years. take a look."}
{"original": "trump: and they will sue us in the ninth circuit even though it shouldn't be there, but we possibly get a bad ruling and that we will get another bad ruling and that will end up in the supreme court, and hopefully, we'll get a fair shake."}
{"original": "wallace: which is actually about how this is going to play out."}
{"original": "here's the question. as our court watcher, how do you think this will go in the courts because obviously there's some feeling, there are some people in the court, brett kavanaugh, expensive presidential powers. on the other hand, if you're a strict constructionist, a textual list, article one, as there were two stephen miller, seems pretty clear."}
{"original": "lane: well, you know, i think where this boils down legally, basically it's true as mark said, congress can do my kind of created a loophole for the provision of the constitution in the event of national emergencies in certain specific contexts such as this military construction. so, the question is going to come down to two questions, one, is it really a national emergency? and two, is this military construction?"}
{"original": "on the first one, courts would be very loath to start weighing what's an emergency and what's not."}
{"original": "wallace: and try to overrule the president on it?"}
{"original": "lane: correct. but the military construction thing, i mean, we're talking about a wall in the middle of nowhere. it's nowhere near a military base and that one is tougher."}
{"original": "the question i have is where the opponents are going to immediately find somebody with standing to sue over this because by the president's own account, the money isn't going to start flowing for months and months."}
{"original": "wallace: ok. we got 30 seconds."}
{"original": "short: yes. when you go back to what obama did in the borough, he appropriated money out of thin air and told the treasury to pay those payments to people on obamacare. this is different. you can be a strict constructionist and support this decision because congress is giving this authority in statute to the president to do this."}
{"original": "if congress wants to change it, they can. but it's perfectly legal and constitutional to do what the president is doing."}
{"original": "pavlich: if i can just say real quickly, it's not in the middle of nowhere, it's on the sovereign international border, and the president certainly has the military authority to protect that."}
{"original": "wallace: you know what? nobody ever gets the last word."}
{"original": "all right. panel, thank you for listening to me, bob. we have to take a quick break here."}
{"original": "when we come back, we want to save time because we are joined by the king of conservative talk radio, rush limbaugh, to get his take on the national emergency, the mueller investigation and democrats' move to the left."}
{"original": "wallace: coming up, rush limbaugh joins us to discuss the president's declaration of a national emergency at the border."}
{"original": "trump: for three hours, he speaks. he's got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world. i mean, this guy is unbelievable."}
{"original": "wallace: we'll ask rush what he thinks about the wall, the fbi and the race for 2020, next."}
{"original": "wallace: he is the most listened to talk show host in america who this week said the budget deal congress handed the president was an outrage by both parties. rush limbaugh joins us live from his eib studio in florida."}
{"original": "rush, welcome back to fox news sunday. we're delighted to have you for your annual visit."}
{"original": "rush limbaugh, the rush limbaugh show: yes, and it's great to be back, chris. thank you very much for having me, as always."}
{"original": "wallace: all right, so i know that you are a constitutional conservative and originalist. do you really have no problem with president trump declaring a national emergency and taking money that congress refused to give him?"}
{"original": "limbaugh: you know, no, i don't. i -- i just listened to your panel and i think so many -- it's all minutia. all you guys were talking about was minutia. katie pavlich had it right, we have an emergency. this is an invasion. the very existence and definition of american culture, american society, the rule of law. why does nobody talk about the fact that millions and millions and millions of people are breaking the law coming here illegally and that the democratic party wants that to happen? we can't have the breakdown of rule of law and law and order this way. that alone would suggest that this has gone on way too long and we need to stop it."}
{"original": "the argument about where drugs come into the country. can anybody deny that they're coming in and it needs to be stopped and its destroying future generations of the country? we're -- we're so caught up in the game of how washington debates issues, is this a fact, is that not a fact, it is undeniable that we have a major immigration problem and a political party that needs a permanent underclass of voters that wants that parade of illegal people who are uneducated --"}
{"original": "limbaugh: don't even speak the language, they want them here."}
{"original": "wallace: all right. and -- and you and i have disagreement --"}
{"original": "limbaugh: it's a crisis. it really is a crisis."}
{"original": "wallace: but i can interrupt you so i can keep things moving because as donald trump said, you can go for three hours."}
{"original": "wallace: all right, but i want to ask you about the game that you say we play in washington, because the fact is that when president obama took executive actions, you were outraged. and, as you would expect, i've got a couple of examples of rush limbaugh over the years. let's put them on the screen."}
{"original": "in june of 2012, when president obama deferred action against the dreamers you said this, 40 years ago richard nixon was hounded out of office supposedly for his illegal actions. and i'm telling you that whatever nixon did pales in comparison to just this move by obama today."}
{"original": "in november of 2014, on reports that mr. obama was going to protect millions of parents of dreamers you said this, we can't just stand idly by and try to find some political opportunity while the president basically shreds the constitution and flushes it down the toilet."}
{"original": "so here's my question, rush. i understand that you like what president trump is doing and you didn't like what president obama was doing. but i -- that's the concern here is that to the degree that you give the president more and more powers, yes, you're going to get some things, executive powers from one president you like, but you're going to get things -- executive powers from another president that you don't like."}
{"original": "limbaugh: you may look at it that way. i don't. i look at it as right and wrong. and what obama was doing was furthering this existing problem in a - - he was politicizing this, using whatever executive powers he wanted to use. yes, i objected to that, but primarily because of what he was doing with these executive powers. he was taking action that i deemed to be harmful to the country."}
{"original": "i look at what trump is doing as something he has to do because he's not getting any cooperation what so -- both parties, chris, let's be honest here. both parties have people that are still trying to get rid of donald trump."}
{"original": "i read this bill, this spending bill. this bill is outrageous. the things - - welcoming centers for newly arriving illegal aliens and all kinds of medical care for. the purpose of this bill, i think, was to eventually be used by the democrats and some republicans to tell the american people, see, electing trump was pointless, worthless, he can't protect you, he can't stop us, he can't do what he said he was going to do because we hate him so much we're not going to allow him to do that. that's what this bill is."}
{"original": "so, to me, all of this boils down to where the heck are we going as a country and what kind of country are we going to have. and if anybody is willing to go to the limit to make this country remain as founded, they're going to have my support."}
{"original": "president trump talked about you on friday. there he is."}
{"original": "trump: rush limbaugh, i think he's a great guy. he's a guy that can speak for three hours without a phone call. try doing that sometime. for three hours he speaks. he's got one of the biggest audiences in the history of the world. i mean this guy is unbelievable."}
{"original": "wallace: now, you've gotten upset with me and some others for saying that president trump listens to you. but let's go back to what we were talking about, which was last december, vice president pence goes to the republican senate leaders and he says, you've got a continuing resolution and i'm -- the president has authorized me to tell you he's going to sign it. and then you get on the radio and some others get on the radio and the house freedom caucus gets up and they say, look, this continuing resolution doesn't have a dime for the wall and he shouldn't sign it. and the very next day, after they told the senate republican leaders he's going to sign it, the president says, no, i've changed my mind and you put on the radio that he sent a message directly to you saying, hey, i'm not going to sign this bill."}
{"original": "so look, i'm not saying that you're a puppet master, but would you agree that he cares about what you say and what you're millions of listeners here?"}
{"original": "limbaugh: of course he does. he cares about what everybody thinks. but i don't make policy."}
{"original": "can i take just a brief few seconds to correct what happened here?"}
{"original": "i'm on the radio. i'm reviewing this bill. it's horrible. it doesn't even have the 1.6 billion that the senate bill had --"}
{"original": "wallace: this was back last december."}
{"original": "limbaugh: so i said he's -- yes. last december. he's getting less than nothing. and i said, he can't sign this thing. this is crazy."}
{"original": "i get an instant message at that moment from somebody close to the president with the message, don't worry, he's not going to sign it. he was never going to sign it. so i report that."}
{"original": "the media then take that to say that he was almost ready to sign it. he had the d in his first name sign and then somebody ran and said, no, no, mr. president, rush limbaugh says no."}
{"original": "and if these people in the media, chris, really thought that i was telling trump what to do and when they'd be calling me, they'd be asking me about it. they would -- they'd want to get down to the -- the dirty details. i haven't had one call. i haven't had one inquiry."}
{"original": "people don't really believe what they're saying about this. it's just another effort to continue to try to diminish the president, diminished trump as somebody that doesn't know what he's doing, can't do it without guidance from the so-called wacko right. it's not at all the way he's governing and there isn't anybody doing what i do that has a thing to do with actually making policy for this president."}
{"original": "i'm going to switch subjects now. we've had enough about the wall."}
{"original": "former acting fbi director andrew mccabe is going to say on 60 minutes tonight, i'm not predicting this, he's already done the interview, that after james comey was fired, the deputy attorney general, rod rosenstein, raised the possibility of invoking the 25th amendment to remove the president. here is mccabe."}
{"original": "andrew mccabe, former acting fbi director: the discussion of the 25th amendment was -- was simply rod raised the issue and discussed it with me in the context of thinking about how many other cabinet officials might support such an effort."}
{"original": "wallace: now, mccabe says that there was no serious conversation. as you just heard, he says, this was raised."}
{"original": "rosenstein says, to the degree he ever discussed it, it was sarcastic."}
{"original": "why do you call what was going on inside the fbi a silent coup?"}
{"original": "limbaugh: because these people are unelected. they took it upon themselves to overthrow the election results of 2016, ignoring the potential real collusion and conspiracy between democrats and russians to undermine the trump candidacy and the trump presidency."}
{"original": "the mueller investigation, i believe, is a cover-up of all of that. it's to distract everybody's attention."}
{"original": "you know, again, the washington game. we're losing sight of what happened here. people unelected simply because they don't like a guy's hairstyle or like where he came from decided the american people's decision was invalid and began a systematic process to get him thrown out of office. this is a silent coup. these guys, if you ask me, ought to be the ones in jail. they ought to be the ones under investigation. what they have done, working with agents from the obama intelligence agencies, is simply unprecedented. this is a kind -- this is one of the greatest political hoaxes that has ever been perpetrated on the people of this country, certainly in a couple of generations."}
{"original": "wallace: federal prosecutors -- speaking of people in jail -- federal prosecutors have recommended that paul manafort, for a few months the president's campaign manager in 2016, that he serve up to 25 years in prison. basically be a life sentence. he's 69 years old now."}
{"original": "wallace: what do you think of the sentence, and should the president -- the president pardon paul manafort?"}
{"original": "limbaugh: i do not know about presidential pardons on something like that. i just think that every one of these things that has happened here is designed to make it look like there was some kind of collusion between trump and russia. manafort is probably going to die in prison. they have him in solitary confinement. all of these are process crimes that have been committed. there isn't one crime that has been found under the umbrella of what they were ostensibly looking for, collusion between trump and russia."}
{"original": "it's serious, chris. i saw a poll the other day, 42 percent of the american people, after two years of this, believe the russians tempered with votes and affected the outcome of elections. there is no evidence to suggest so and rosenstein's even said that that's the case when the indictment of those russian internet trolls was announced."}
{"original": "but wearing a wire to somehow entrap the president of the united states? this is classic."}
{"original": "you know, you asked me one time when i was here, deep state, you liked the term, this is it. i mean this is -- and it's all of washington, d.c., and it's all arrayed against donald trump and it's designed to get his approval numbers down maybe into the 30s or 20s. they can then go to him and say, mr. president, you've lost all support. you have no support. or then -- you know, this has been an effort to impeach him. the -- the effort that was underway for collusion didn't work. now the mueller report that may not happen is going to be used to continue to leak things that may be in it. they're going to ratchet this up for the next election and we're going to face two more years of this collusion stuff. and it's -- i think it's just -- it's -- it's something people need to be paying a heavy price for, for what they've done on the investigatory side of this."}
{"original": "wallace: all right. let's talk about the next election, 2020. is there anyone in either the announced or potential democratic presidential field who you think would offer president trump a real challenge?"}
{"original": "limbaugh: well, i think -- you know, i -- first thing i'm doing here, i'm trying to be one of the first to book a first-class seat on a train to hawaii after we enact the green new deal or whatever it is from alexandria ocasio-cortez."}
{"original": "i think what we're going to have -- these people are -- they're so convinced they're going to win that that's why so many of them are running. and they are going to be in a contest to see who can out extreme the other. who can move the country furthest to the left the soonest. it's going to be very entertaining to watch. i hope it is eye-opening for the american people."}
{"original": "right now, if i had to pick somebody i thought --"}
{"original": "wallace: do you see -- do you see anybody in that field, though, who you think, that -- that person could give the president a run?"}
{"original": "limbaugh: well, i think maybe -- well, i don't know that any of them right now give the president a run. but i think the front runner would probably be right now joe biden. seventy-seven years old, plagiarist, nicknamed plugs. i think he's the guy that they probably are thinking is the leader in the polls right now. but it's going to be very crowded. they're going to be knocking each other off. that's going to be fun to watch."}
{"original": "incumbency carries with it a lot of power, as you know, and i think they're convinced that they've already won this election, like they were convinced in 2016. they're getting way ahead of game. and i don't think it's going to be as easy as they think to win the presidency."}
{"original": "wallace: ok, let -- let me ask you about that because you talked about the green new deal and the trains to hawaii. you've also got --"}
{"original": "limbaugh: right. great. isn't that wonderful?"}
{"original": "wallace: well, yes, you know, where, what was it, in back to the future, where we go we don't me roads, or apparently tracks."}
{"original": "the calls for medicare for all calls for huge increases on taxes on the very wealthy."}
{"original": "how potent an issue do you think the president has and how much do you think he will make this case that the democrats want to make this a socialist country?"}
{"original": "limbaugh: i think it's a huge case because we're not a socialist country and even a fox news poll the other day pointed out how many people prefer capitalism."}
{"original": "we've done a real disservice to our young people. you look at this new green deal and you look at the things that they think are true. they live in the greatest country ever. they have more opportunity for contentment, happiness, success than ever and they think they live in a country that's unjust and immoral. they have an ill-educated, mal (ph) educated and it's really a shame."}
{"original": "i know young people, chris, who really think that by the time they're 65, the country, the world is not going to be habitable because of climate change, which is another hoax! there's no evidence for it. climate change is nothing but a bunch of computer models that attempt to tell us what's going to happen in 50 years or 30. notice the predictions are never for next year or the next ten years, they're always for way, way, way, way out there, when none of us are going to be around or alive to know whether or not they were true. in the meantime, they get to push for more government, big government, more tax increases, more control over people."}
{"original": "i -- it's sad what has been done in -- in k-12 education and higher education to these young -- i mean graduating economics degree graduates, like cortez, it doesn't know what you could put on a thimble about economics. it's really a shame. and it's a -- it's a problem going forward. they're going to have to be defeated, beaten."}
{"original": "wallace: thank you. thank you for joining us again."}
{"original": "limbaugh: oh, my gosh, that's at? we're out of time. oh, geez."}
{"original": "wallace: we were out 14 minutes."}
{"original": "wallace: we -- we flew by."}
{"original": "limbaugh: it really did. it always --"}
{"original": "wallace: anyway, it's always good to talk with you. anytime you want to come back, you're always welcome, sir."}
{"original": "limbaugh: thank you. i appreciate. thank you very much. see you next time."}
{"original": "wallace: up next, our sunday group returns to discuss andrew mccabe's account of what happened in the days after the president fired fbi director james comey."}
{"original": "plus, what would you like to ask the panel about how the fbi has handled the trump-russia investigation? just go to facebook or twitter, @foxnewssunday, and we may use your question on the air."}
{"original": "andrew mccabe, former acting fbi director: i was speaking to the man who had just run for the presidency and -- and -- and won the election of the presidency, and who might have done so with the aid of the government of russia."}
{"original": "wallace: former acting fbi director andrew mccabe explaining the reaction at the bureau after president trump fired james comey. first, trying to protect the russia investigation, and then some even discussing invoking the 25th amendment to remove the president."}
{"original": "and we're back now with the panel."}
{"original": "well, we asked you for questions for the panel and we got this on facebook from timothy pullen, does everyone on this panel believe that mccabe and rosenstein were talking about the 25th amendment? what do you think should happen to these individuals if it is found to be true?"}
{"original": "katie, how do you answer timothy?"}
{"original": "katie pavlich, contributor: well, the reporting by the new york times a couple of months ago showed that rod rosenstein did talk about this."}
{"original": "now, president trump called him to the white house. the reporting at the time was he thought he was getting fired. he did not get fired. that could be for political reasons, the president not wanting to show that he was firing anybody, it had to do something with the special counsel. but the idea that this was even brought up is terrifying to everyday americans because of the implications it has, not for high-powered government officials who may have a lot of money for their legal defenses, but for individual people who the fbi could go after."}
{"original": "but, keep in mind, that andrew mccabe had been referred to the u.s. attorney in washington, d.c., for criminal charges after lying under oath to both doj inspector general investigators and the fbi. and so you have to take what he says with a grain of salt. however, the fact that this was going on at the department of justice after donald trump was elected the president by the american people says a lot about the way that the fbi used to run."}
{"original": "and i do think that christopher wray, the new fbi director, has done a decent job of cleaning the place up. however, there is much more to be done and there has to be accountability for the people who were engaged in this kind of behavior."}
{"original": "wallace: all this was happening in the immediate aftermath in may of 2017 of donald trump firing then fbi director james comey. and here's how mccabe talks about that."}
{"original": "andrew mccabe, former acting fbi director: i was very concerned that i was able to put the russia case on absolutely solid ground, in an indelible fashion, that were i removed quickly or reassigned or fired, that the case could not be closed or vanished in the night without a trace."}
{"original": "wallace: chuck, what do you make of what mccabe says about those days in may of 2017, first of all, that he was trying, as he said there, to protect the russia-trump investigation and make sure the people at justice didn't just sweep it away, and, secondly, that -- and there seems to be some question how seriously this was discussed, but that there was any discussion of invoking the 25th amendment to remove the president?"}
{"original": "charles lane, the washington post: you know, on the 25th amendment part, i -- it sounds very desultory what they were doing. it was sort of blue skying (ph) this idea and there is some discrepancy between rosenstein's account and mccabe's account about this matter."}
{"original": "wallace: but what about what katie says, the idea that they're even discussing it?"}
{"original": "lane: no, i -- to the -- to the extent -- i was about to say, to the extent it was serious, it's very troubling, because it's way above their pay grade to be getting involved in like a head count of which cabinet officers might vote for it or might not. on the other hand, i -- i don't think it went any further than this one or two desultory conversations. it's the attitude is a little bit troubling."}
{"original": "on the question of the comey firing and preserving the obstruction of justice case, i mean i think this gets right down to the heart of this paradox we've all been wrestling with since the beginning here, is like, who is really watching the watchmen and who is really the top law enforcement officer of the united states? is it the president, which is -- he's the top guy of the executive branch. or are there people somehow below the president in the chain of command who do have the authority or should have the authority to hold him accountable when necessary?"}
{"original": "we went through -- bob knows it well -- we went through all of that in watergate. we've wrestled with this for decades as a country. the expedient we've come up with now is the special counsel. and i think that's ultimately going to be how this one gets worked out."}
{"original": "lane: and bill barr will tell us how much we learn from this report."}
{"original": "wallace: it seems to me, marc, looking back on this, there are two theories of the case when it comes to the fbi. one is that the fbi and now special counsel robert mueller have been involved in a legitimate, don't know how it's going to turn out, but a legitimate investigation of possible collusion and possible obstruction of justice. the other theory of the case is that the real scandal here is how comey and mccabe and lisa page and peter strzok and bruce ohr have behaved and -- and how they acted and particular how they acted -- well, to some degree in the clinton case, but even more so in the trump case."}
{"original": "marc short, former white house legislative affairs director: well, i think that the actions of some of those actors cast a dark spell on the fbi, and that's unfortunate. i don't know keenly why we continue to talk about andrew mccabe and listen to him. the reality is that the own inspector general determined that he lied multiple times, including three times under oath. andrew mccabe, in theory, was supposed to be leading an investigation into hillary clinton and he says he's concerned about russia collusion and that's what he was all worried about as far as this being uncovered. there's $145 million from russians given to the hillary and bill clinton foundation when she was secretary of state. $145 million and he's sitting here saying that he's worried -- that he was really worried as to how this was going to interfere with his investigation into president trump? i mean i don't know why we still listen to the guy. he's been proven to be a serial liar again and again."}
{"original": "wallace: bob woodward, you have been covering and dealing with fbi officials for more than 40 years, since watergate. how do you think they have conducted themselves in all of this?"}
{"original": "bob woodward, the washington post: not well. i think there are a lot of legitimate questions. but -- but they're gone. comey's gone. mccabe is gone. the really interesting point here is bill barr. he's now attorney general. he was attorney general for bush senior 30 years ago and he has a record. he's a very interesting man. he believes that at the time it was the end of the iran contra investigation by lawrence walsh. he was very -- he said at one point that he had an itchy finger for 18 months to fire walsh. and he was very upset about what he called the drag-netting (ph) in that investigation going down every possible trail."}
{"original": "wallace: so are you suggesting he might interfere with mueller?"}
{"original": "woodward: no. he's made it clear he will not, but he's going -- he's going to look at it. and he's got a very interesting perspective on all of this. at the end of the iran contra investigation, with then president bush senior decided, oh, well, let's pardon caspar weinberger, who was indicted. it was barr who said, well, let's pardon more people. the cia people and elliott abrams. so he's somebody who is going to protect the president, but i think he also knows legally and politically it's very important that the mueller investigation proceed."}
{"original": "so the spotlight should be, as marc suggests, not on the past, but on the future. we don't know who's going to run against trump if trump runs in 2020. we know who now is the attorney general. and this is the important player in the coming months, maybe coming two years."}
{"original": "wallace: and, katie, i've got less than -- i've got about 45 seconds left. how transparent should barr be -- when the mueller report comes out, how transparent should he be in saying here, i'll let you --"}
{"original": "pavlich: i think he should release as much of it as possible without, you know, compromising any kind of a technique. but the american people, because this has been used as a political weapon, absolutely deserve to know what is in the mueller report. and as we're looking in the future, yes, the guys at the fbi, comey and mccabe, they're gone. however, i think that the senate judiciary committee, with the new chairman, lindsey graham, are going to be looking into fisa abuse, what happened during the 20 --"}
{"original": "wallace: he's talking about subpoenaing some of these people."}
{"original": "pavlich: right, looking at the -- looking at that kind of abuse, going back to the 2016 campaign and looking at how the fbi used those tools because they don't want that it to happen again and there should be account ability for it."}
{"original": "wallace: ok. thank you, panel. see you next sunday."}
{"original": "up next, we'll be back with a final word."}
{"original": "wallace: please stay tuned to this station and fox news channel for the latest on the president's declaration of a national emergency at the southern border."}

{"original": "most democrats identify as liberals for the first time, according to an analysis released tuesday -- marking the latest sign of a leftward shift of the democratic party as it lurches to the fringes on issues such as medicare-for-all, amnesty for illegal immigrants and a green new deal."}
{"original": "according to the gallup study, based on polling data, the percentage of democrats identifying as liberal averaged 51 percent in 2018. that was up from 50 percent in 2017, but underscores a steady increase over the years. in 1994, only 25 percent identified as liberal and another 25 percent identified as conservative. among americans overall, conservatives outnumbered liberals by nine points, although that is down from 19 points in gallup's first poll in 1992."}
{"original": "the study is the latest evidence of a party that is swinging to the left, adopting positions in its mainstream that were once on the fringes of party debate -- particularly on health care, economics and immigration."}

{"original": "on tuesday, new york city mayor bill de blasio announced plans to launch the largest, most comprehensive plan in the nation to guarantee health care for all in the city -- including illegal immigrants."}
{"original": "while the federal government works to gut health care for millions of americans, new york city is leading the way by guaranteeing that every new yorker has access to quality, comprehensive access to care, regardless of immigration status or their ability to pay, he said in a statement."}
{"original": "de blasio's announcement came after california's new democratic gov. gavin newsom outlined a similarly ambitious health care agenda for his state, aimed at offering more benefits to illegal immigrants and protecting obamacare. medi-cal, the state's health insurance program, now will let illegal immigrants remain on the rolls until they are 26, up from 19, according to newsom's new agenda."}
{"original": "those left-wing voices presenting once-fringe ideas are also growing louder in washington, particularly among the new intake of members in the house who have been bolder in embracing left-wing policy proposals and terms like democratic socialism."}
{"original": "a new york times analysis found that one-third of senate democrats and more than half of house democrats have endorsed medicare-for-all proposals -- including a number of possible 2020 presidential hopefuls."}
{"original": "rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y., one of the new members in the house and a rising democratic star, has pushed universal health care as well as a 70 percent tax on top earners to fund an expansive green new deal that she said would be a wartime-level, just economic mobilization plan to get to 100% renewable energy."}
{"original": "a draft text circulated around congress calls for a select committee to be formed to create a plan, and lays out a framework that includes eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources."}
{"original": "if that wasn't ambitious enough, the proposal describes this as a historic opportunity to virtually eliminate poverty in the united states and to make prosperity, wealth and economic security available to everyone participating in the transformation. its proposals on the economic front include a job guarantee program that offers a living wage job to every person who wants one, a just transition for workers affected by climate change, basic income programs, universal health care and any others as the select committee may deem appropriate to promote economic security, labor market flexibility and entrepreneurism."}
{"original": "so far a number of house members, as well as top 2020 prospects, have offered their support to the proposal."}
{"original": "it is therefore no surprise that ocasio-cortez has embraced the term democratic socialism. another new house member rashida tlaib, d-mich., was a member of the democratic socialists of america. in the senate, sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., has called himself a democratic socialist and ran a vigorous 2016 primary challenge to ultimate nominee hillary clinton."}
{"original": "the mood in congress has extended to voters, in particular young people and democrats, who polls have shown are warming to socialism over capitalism."}
{"original": "americans warming to socialism over capitalism, polls show"}
{"original": "a gallup poll in august showed that 51 percent of 18-29 year-olds back socialism, compared with 47 percent who back capitalism. meanwhile, 57 percent of democrats say they hold a positive view of socialism, compared with just 47 percent who support capitalism."}

{"original": "while democrats spent the year of 2019 obstructing, president trump spent the year achieving."}
{"original": "neither an almost $35 million mueller investigation, ending in an exonerating report, nor a sham impeachment effort could deter trump from moving forward with the business of the american people."}

{"original": "in 2019, the president continued to make good on his promise to rip up nafta and negotiate and push a new, modern, america first trade deal through the halls of congress."}
{"original": "for more than a year, democrats held up the trump-negotiated u.s.-mexico-canada agreement. but in an effort to distract from their increasingly unpopular impeachment, democrats finally permitted a vote on the usmca, advancing the trump-negotiated deal that would create almost 200,000 jobs and add $68.2 billion to the economy."}
{"original": "in addition to a japan trade deal that would bring in $7 billion in new agricultural trade, trump completed a phase-one china deal. china agreed to an additional $200 billion in u.s. purchases in addition to rectifying much of the unevenness and unfairness that has characterized the u.s.-china relationship for decades."}
{"original": "these landmark breakthroughs on trade come on top of the hottest economy in modern history, which is making gains for all americans."}

{"original": "the dirty, dishonest impeachment process by democrats cannot obscure a blazing, simple and happy truth: americans are doing better — much better — under president trump than they were before he was elected. and with a few strategic policy moves, particularly in health care and taxes, the white house can fire up even more impressive gains in the new year."}
{"original": "first, let's look at the record of what has been achieved thus far, an achievement almost no reputable observer forecast three years ago."}

{"original": "wages are rising with the greatest rates of growth among lower-income workers. with new trade deals on the verge of becoming a reality, our economy is poised to boom as never before."}
{"original": "the trump administration has made impressive and unprecedented strides in attacking growth-suffocating regulations. these nitty-gritty efforts don't get headlines but they are powerful stimulants for economic progress."}
{"original": "the trump team has cut more than eight regulations for each new one, resulting in savings of $50 billion, which is expected to grow to $220 billion as these actions are fully implemented. here's something democrats won't tell you: deregulation will save each american household an average of $3,100."}
{"original": "health care policies have also improved. for example, coverage for people with chronic illnesses has been expanded for patients with certain types of hsa-eligible (health savings account) plans. the hugely unpopular obamacare individual mandate is gone."}
{"original": "click here to get the opinion newsletter"}
{"original": "three foolish and destructive obamacare taxes have been eradicated: the job- and innovation-killing medical device tax; the so-called cadillac tax that penalized people (including many union workers) whose employers provided them with comprehensive health care coverage; and a pernicious tax on insurance companies that would have led to higher premiums."}
{"original": "the white house is pushing hospitals and health insurance providers to publish prices, thereby enabling consumers to make informed choices and encouraging competition for their business."}
{"original": "and the future? for 2020, the president can do even more to benefit patients and their families by tackling the root cause of sky-high costs: the lack of robust free markets in health care. the sector is dominated by third parties—insurance companies, government (primarily medicare and medicaid) and employers—not individual patients."}
{"original": "government policies must push policies that put patients — not government bureaucrats and other third parties — in charge. in addition to the move for more pricing transparency, here are other initiatives that would be immensely helpful."}
{"original": "the jungle of restrictions on health savings accounts (hsas) should be chopped away to make them more responsive to patients' needs. you should be able to use your hsa to pay for over-the-counter medications, not just prescriptions."}
{"original": "you should be allowed to get your own hsa if your employer doesn't provide one or even if you don't have a health insurance policy. (and the same freedom should apply to those on medicaid.) contribution restrictions should be scrapped or enormously expanded."}
{"original": "another welcome white house move would be to push for the abolition of certificate-of-need (con) laws. thirty-five states and the district of columbia now impose con restrictions on health care entities, forcing them to obtain government permission before they can open or expand facilities or in some cases purchase certain devices or technologies."}
{"original": "forcing providers to prove a community needs a new service — something that can be challenged by existing competitors — limits supply and prevents the competition that would bring down medical costs. does starbucks need to get a con if it wants to open a facility near dunkin' donuts, or does in-n-out burger need one if it wants to open a restaurant across from mcdonald's?"}
{"original": "the president could also mandate sweeping transparency about the pricing and rebate practices of pharmacy benefit management organizations that many experts believe are a prime cause of high drug prices."}
{"original": "needless to say, taxation is another ripe area for beneficial change. the original trump tax cut has been a huge success, leading as it did to higher economic growth, higher wages and the creation of millions of new jobs. an american family in most states earning $75,000 a year saw its tax bill cut by more than $2,000."}
{"original": "while it is unfortunate that the white house is not willing yet to go for the flat tax — the ideal system that would reduce everyone's taxes, dramatically simplify people's lives and powerfully propel the economy; more than 30 countries have adopted it — officials are considering what is dubbed tax cut 2.0. among the ideas under discussion are reducing the 22 percent tax rate to 15 percent to help middle-class earners and reducing the number of brackets from seven to three or four."}
{"original": "a productive package should include cutting the capital gains levy, which helps productive investment and makes equities more attractive to own. this would be good news for the tens of millions of people with 401(k)s and similar plans. it should cut income tax rates across the board, not just the 22 percent bracket, which would help both the economy and take away the sting of the 2017-enacted limits on state and local tax deductions."}
{"original": "click here to get the fox news app"}
{"original": "likewise, the package should include reviving the fica payroll tax reduction, which was in effect for 2011 and 2012, to insure that everyone who works gets to keep more of what they earn; and reforming and expanding the earned income tax credit (eitc), a method far more efficacious in helping people escape poverty through work and far less harmful to job creation for the unskilled than raising the minimum wage."}

{"original": "stelter pointed to several examples of headlines and commentary as proof as pelosi hijacking attention in the media."}
