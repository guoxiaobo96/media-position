Just four weeks in, however, sticking to that pledge is proving difficult. The possible clashes will be on display Tuesday morning when the new House Democratic Caucus meets for the first time to discuss Mueller's investigation into President Donald Trump's ties to Russia, a probe with no clear end in sight and ever-expanding subplots. For Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her committee chairs, the uncertainty surrounding the special counsel's work presents a major challenge for keeping their liberal, rabble-rousing members in check… For now, the Democrats say they are proceeding on two tracks: Letting Mueller pursue criminal charges like the ones unsealed Friday against longtime Trump associate Roger Stone; while lawmakers get to work examining whether anything the president has done rises to 'high crimes and misdemeanors' definition for impeachment.", "augmented": []}

The president takes a special oath, a little different from the congressional oath. In fact, he takes an oath that was taken by President George Washington, the patriarch of our country, in front of whose picture we stand here. It's so sad, so tragic for our country that the actions taken the president to undermine our national security, to violate his oath of office, and to jeopardize the security of our elections, the integrity of our elections has taken us to this place. So today, we will make history. When we walk down -- when the managers walk down the hall -- across the threshold in history, delivering articles of impeachment against the president of the United States for abuse of power and obstruction of the House. Making that history we are making progress for the American people, progress in support of our Constitution, progress in honor of the sacrifice and divisions of our founders.

That means the West Coast state, and its famously liberal voters, will hold extra influence this cycle. And while the 2020 candidates still have to connect with supporters in earliest-voting Iowa and New Hampshire – with their more moderate-leaning electorates – California's combination of an early primary and massive delegate count could motivate the field to run decisively in the progressive lane from the start. … In another sign of California's emerging influence this cycle, putative front-runner Sen. Bernie Sanders plans to visit the state this week. … Not only is California's primary now slated for Super Tuesday in March, but early voting is set to start around the time of the Iowa caucuses. With that in mind, Sanders' visit this week is likely the start of a political gold rush of sorts, as the 2020 candidates look west for electoral gold.", "augmented": []}

The governor has emphasized he would not wage a quixotic primary against Trump. But even though Trump appeared stronger politically post-Mueller, Hogan was still weighing several factors, and did not plan to make a definitive decision about running for president until as late as early fall. 'It's not moving the needle one way or the other,' the Hogan aide said of Mueller's findings, in an email exchange with the Washington Examiner. … But Hogan appears patient, content to wait and see if other probes into Trump — by House Democrats and possibly the Southern District of New York — net more political trouble for the president.", "augmented": []}

When Hamilton wrote those words in December of 1787 he was attacking the then-governing charter, the Articles of Confederacy, as insufficient. A chief problem, he argued, was that the national government lacked the authority or practical ability to enforce the laws that it passed or to guarantee the rights of its citizens. Some 4,000 armed rebels led by Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays had staged a nearly year-long insurrection in western Massachusetts that ended just six months before Hamilton was writing. Shays & Co. were protesting what they said were heavy-handed taxation and tax collection by the government of the state of Massachusetts. Their goal was the violent overthrow of the government of the commonwealth before they were eventually crushed by a private army raised by the anxious citizens of Boston led by Revolutionary Gen. Benjamin Lincoln. Rage mobs fighting private armies is not exactly conducive to good order and predictable governance. Hamilton argued that the loose affiliation of the confederacy and weak central government was an invitation to further problems of this kind and that the national government needed the power to enforce the basic rules and keep order.", "augmented": []}

Stevens, and Queen Liliʻuokalani was put under house arrest at the 'Iolani Palace as a result. During her time there, she composed many pieces mourning the treatment of her homeland and people. One such song was 'Mai Wakinekona a Iolani Hale.' Liliʻuokalani anonymously wrote the song's lyrics and published them in a weekly Hawaiian language newspaper, subversively messaging how she came to be imprisoned. The following week, someone published a response in song lyrics, 'We have heard you, oh heavenly one, our ruler, and we support you.' … This piece was only recently discovered. Many of the Queen's lesser-known compositions are now being newly appreciated as the Hawaiian language is making a comeback after years of oppression.", "augmented": []}

It is an open question whether a subpoena would have survived the court challenge that Trump's lawyers say they would have mounted. The Supreme Court has never issued definitive guidance on issuing a subpoena to a president, but had Mueller pursued one, the courts could have established a precedent for future presidents.

This is a smart, strategic, see- through steel barrier -- not just a simple concrete wall. It will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down. San Diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. In response, a strong security wall was put in place. This powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings. The border city of El Paso, Texas, used to have extremely high rates of violent crime -- one of the highest in the country, and considered one of our nation's most dangerous cities.

It is an open question whether a subpoena would have survived the court challenge that Trump's lawyers say they would have mounted. The Supreme Court has never issued definitive guidance on issuing a subpoena to a president, but had Mueller pursued one, the courts could have established a precedent for future presidents. In assessing whether to pursue such a high-stakes move, the special counsel was not operating with complete autonomy.

And I remember the pageantry that we're about to watch or we're anticipating here in the next few minutes with Speaker Pelosi. It was a different Speaker and different Congress. The Senate now has a responsibility. You have to hope that both Democrats and Republicans will take their pledge to be impartial in a very serious way. Although there is a foregone conclusion that he will be acquitted, I think all of the jurors have to be willing to listen. But if you are on the political team with President Trump this evening, you think how big of a moment this is from a positive standpoint, the jobs numbers, the economic numbers, the phase 1 of the China deal, the USMCA agreement, the incredible effort in Iran, the killing of this general. Any other person would be riding so high. But all of this news does put a damper here. As it goes to the Senate, Bret, I hope Democrats do one thing, that they focus solely on the national security implications of the president's actions. Whether he is convicted or not, I think going forward -- if we take anything from this in terms of a history lesson, it would be that no president should take any actions that would undermine national security in an effort to advance their own political interest.", "augmented": []}

In that race, the big names either sat out or flamed out early, and the campaign turned into a slow-moving grind… The 2004 campaign started out in similar fashion… The model for the second possible path is a lot more recent: The Republicans in the 2016 campaign. … After all, what an effective primary campaign does is put the candidates through a punishing stress test that toughens and strengthens them, giving everyone confidence that they have identified the strongest possible contender for the general election. … So this is the tightrope that Democratic contenders will have to walk: They'll need to be unfiltered and distinctive enough to break out of the pack, but not so candid that they get disqualified by the wrath of summary judgment on social media.", "augmented": []}

A chief problem, he argued, was that the national government lacked the authority or practical ability to enforce the laws that it passed or to guarantee the rights of its citizens. Some 4,000 armed rebels led by Revolutionary War veteran Daniel Shays had staged a nearly year-long insurrection in western Massachusetts that ended just six months before Hamilton was writing. Shays & Co. were protesting what they said were heavy-handed taxation and tax collection by the government of the state of Massachusetts. Their goal was the violent overthrow of the government of the commonwealth before they were eventually crushed by a private army raised by the anxious citizens of Boston led by Revolutionary Gen. Benjamin Lincoln. Rage mobs fighting private armies is not exactly conducive to good order and predictable governance.

In fact, they are continuing their investigation. And as we have been discussing, they are throwing, not only this new evidence, but the prospect of perhaps more impeachment articles. Perhaps more witnesses who are just emerging coming forward. And my beef is that no federal judge would put up a situation -- a trial judge where he was being asked to try a defendant in a case, and at the same the prosecutors were continuing in the grand jury to investigate the defendant on the same charges and broadcasting whatever evidence they find to the media which, of course, would prejudice the trial.

We haven't seen it since 1998. We will show you that event live and talk about what is happening with the impeachment and where we go from here.

It remains unclear whether Trump will make progress on building more sections of a border wall during his time in office, but he has seemingly acknowledged Mexico won't directly pay for the project (though the president still maintains that money resulting from a new trade pact with Mexico can still cover costs).", "augmented": []}

In these cases ignoramus indicated 'we take no notice of (i.e., we do not recognize) this indictment.' Such a reference would have been most appropriate for Ruggle's satire of the judiciary.

The Senate now has a responsibility. You have to hope that both Democrats and Republicans will take their pledge to be impartial in a very serious way.

Any other person would be riding so high. But all of this news does put a damper here. As it goes to the Senate, Bret, I hope Democrats do one thing, that they focus solely on the national security implications of the president's actions.

In fact, they are continuing their investigation. And as we have been discussing, they are throwing, not only this new evidence, but the prospect of perhaps more impeachment articles. Perhaps more witnesses who are just emerging coming forward. And my beef is that no federal judge would put up a situation -- a trial judge where he was being asked to try a defendant in a case, and at the same the prosecutors were continuing in the grand jury to investigate the defendant on the same charges and broadcasting whatever evidence they find to the media which, of course, would prejudice the trial.

The title character, whose name in Latin literally means 'we do not know,' is a lawyer who fancies himself to be quite shrewd but is actually foolish and ignorant. Ruggle may have been inspired in his choice of name for his character by a proceeding in the English judicial system. The term ignoramus was written on bills of indictment when the evidence presented seemed insufficient to justify prosecution. In these cases ignoramus indicated 'we take no notice of (i.e., we do not recognize) this indictment.' Such a reference would have been most appropriate for Ruggle's satire of the judiciary.

A baby was born in the toilet paper aisle of the Walmart at Sunshine and West Bypass. One Walmart customer didn't have a chance to get any of those groceries she came for, but she left with something much more special. 'We were like oh my gosh, is this actually going to happen,' said store manager Jessica Hinkle. Hinkle said the woman warned store associates that her last child came in just 30 minutes. When the woman's water broke in the toilet paper aisle, she was prepared to go into labor right then and there. 'We were like what do we do now?' she said. 'Another lady comes around the corner and she says 'I'm a labor nurse, can I help?' and we said yes, yes please. She had gloves in her pocket [and] she was ready.' Hinkle said she grabbed a sheet and blocked the aisle to give the woman as much privacy as possible. … Springfield firefighters rushed into the store and helped deliver the baby girl. 'They're the typical fire department that shops in our store, so they were pretty proud of themselves,' Hinkle said. She said the entire process took about 45 minutes and customers were cheering for the woman the whole time."}

But Democrats aren't yet finished with their work and may need a convention to fill in gaps left by what has become a very uncertain primary process. I can certainly see Democrats opting to hold a virtual convention in which the 4,753 delegates would participate remotely. But I'm certainly with you on getting MLB back on its feet.

When the woman's water broke in the toilet paper aisle, she was prepared to go into labor right then and there. 'We were like what do we do now?' she said. 'Another lady comes around the corner and she says 'I'm a labor nurse, can I help?' and we said yes, yes please. She had gloves in her pocket [and] she was ready.' Hinkle said she grabbed a sheet and blocked the aisle to give the woman as much privacy as possible. … Springfield firefighters rushed into the store and helped deliver the baby girl. 'They're the typical fire department that shops in our store, so they were pretty proud of themselves,' Hinkle said.

'These provisions will be enforced,' the governor said at a briefing in Albany. 'These are not helpful hints.' They will take effect Sunday night. Even as he told New Yorkers to stay indoors, Mr. Cuomo added that if they did go out — whether to do essential shopping or to exercise — they must stay six feet away from each other."}

That has opened the path for Democratic officials to start picking favorites — from a socially safe distance. In discussions with The Times since Mr. Biden's big primary victories on Tuesday, 60 Democratic National Committee members and congressional and party leaders most frequently proposed three former rivals of Mr. Biden as his running mate — Senator Kamala Harris of California, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota. Next up was Stacey Abrams, a former state House leader whose defeat in 2018 Georgia governor's race remains disputed by many in the party. Other popular suggestions included Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada and Representative Val Demings of Florida. The Democrats interviewed also proposed seven other women, including Govs. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan and Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico."}
