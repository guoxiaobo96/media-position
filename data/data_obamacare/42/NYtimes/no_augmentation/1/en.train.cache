These guessing-game questions about congressional intent are irrelevant in this context because it was Congress, not a court, that did the eliminating. Moreover, in doing so, Congress expressly left the rest of the statute in place — including the insurance protections the Justice Department now says, in the name of congressional intent, must fall. We don't have to ask what Congress intended because we can see what Congress did. Game over.
That figure has grown to 37 states and the District of Columbia, as more Republican-controlled states have signed on. Many academic studies have found that the program increases enrollees' access to medical care. A more limited body of research shows that the program also reduces mortality rates.
Medicare for all got its first congressional hearing on Tuesday, albeit in one of the House's tightest meeting rooms, in an area of the Capitol off limits to the scores of people who assembled in Washington to show support.
A graduate with a professional degree expects to earn $2.3 million more than a high school graduate. The Brookings Institution's Adam Looney estimated that under Senator Warren's plan the bottom 20 percent of borrowers by income get only 4 percent of the savings.
Medicare for all. It's Wednesday, March 13. Margot, the 2020 Democratic primary, which is now officially underway, is very much starting to feel like the Medicare for all primary. Where does this idea, Medicare for all, come from?
At age 19, Senator Warren married her high school sweetheart, a computer engineer, Jim Warren. She gave up a full scholarship to George Washington University for the marriage, and they later split in part because he didn't support her career ambitions.
It is hardly premature to ask, in this light, how the Trump administration might manage the fallout from the economic downturn that everybody knows will happen. Unfortunately, the United States could hardly be less prepared.
But Bannon — Bannon is right about the Democrats. But if Trump is the one talking about race, that doesn't help him. Right? I mean we went through this with the midterm elections. Trump went out and talked up the border caravan and how the Democrats were going to let illegal aliens into the country as his closing argument. And there's no evidence that it worked. Trump is helped when the media elevates Ilhan Omar or A.O.C. as the face of the Democratic Party because they are far left. And I think most voters aren't remotely close to where they are. But if Trump is the one doing race talk, I think he's losing.
The decline by itself isn't that meaningful, but several snapshots over previous months had shown that sign-ups were on track to overtake last year's enrollment. It was only in the final two weeks of enrollment, when there's typically a deadline-driven surge, that the numbers dropped. Fewer than 400,000 people signed up for Obamacare plans over the last two weeks. Last year, more than 700,000 people signed up in the last week alone.
A month later, Heritage Action turned up the heat on the 34 Democrats — most of them so-called conservative Blue Dogs — who voted against Obamacare in March but had yet to sign King's discharge petition. In a press statement, Needham declared, I know their constituents, who will be attending town halls this August, are eager to hear why they do not support the repeal effort. In September, a single Democrat, Gene Taylor of Mississippi, added his signature. The tally reached 173, well short of what it would take for King's bill to make it to the House floor — much less to get it passed and then sent over to the Senate, where Republicans' appetite for abolishing Obamacare altogether was less acute than it was in the House.
To see what I mean, consider three stories about health care policies.
— Lindsey Graham was extremely outspoken about how the president should not have spoken out seemingly in favor of the white nationalists.
The rise of short-term policies that cover fewer benefits and charge higher prices to sick customers might pull some healthier customers out of the Obamacare markets. And the association plans, which, under the proposal, would be open to small businesses and self-employed sole proprietors, may also pull some healthier, younger customers from Obamacare plans.
His substantive policies, however, have followed the standard right-wing agenda: In 2017 he passed a huge tax cut, largely for corporations, that disproportionately benefited the wealthy, and almost succeeded in repealing Obamacare, in the process gutting Medicaid.
What will President Trump's first recession look like?
He loved the contest. He loved being relevant. He kept himself relevant.
A growing divide has emerged among unions over whether to support Medicare for all. Roughly 95 percent of union workers had health care access in 2019, while just 68 percent of nonunion workers did.
Trump is back to interruptor-in-chief. That didn't work the first debate, and I think will work less well after the recording. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
It will be an invitation to come, he said of decriminalization, going on to add that he and Barack sought to increase the total amount of immigration and stressing his support for asylum seekers.
Mr. Trump's speech on Tuesday was delivered in Monessen, Pa., the sort of place that typifies the overlooked Democratic resilience among white working-class voters, and that Mr. Trump needs in November. The area was once one of the most reliably Democratic parts of the country, and even today, Democrats still fare fairly well among white working-class voters. President Obama won Monessen by a 66-33 percent margin, and the town is at the tip of a region along the Monongahela River where Mr. Obama won among white working-class voters.
I'll second that and also note that she'll be on the show on Tuesday. So if you want to tune in then. And then finally, your favorite children's book?
There are smaller decisions ahead, too, about how to administer programs, whether to enforce the law's individual mandate, and whether to recruit insurers to participate in markets where competition is thin.
Mr. Trump suspended H-1Bs and other work visas through at least the end of the year, denying employment permits for hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers like programmers. Seasonal hospitality workers and work-study students are also affected.
In place of a common vision is a truly unappetizing stew. Modest subsidies to help people buy insurance are the Mini-Me versions of Obamacare policies, so reduced as to be almost completely useless to millions of people, especially older and lower-income people and those in states with high medical costs, such as Alaska, North Carolina and Oklahoma — all of which happen to have voted for Mr. Trump. Another provision is an old conservative hobby horse championed by people like House Speaker Paul Ryan: cutting federal spending on Medicaid, which provides insurance to 74 million poor, disabled and elderly Americans. The main goal here is to cut taxes for the rich, even though the change would devastate beneficiaries, state government budgets and public hospitals.
What unites both of these blunders, apart from simple political stupidity, is that neither has much to do with actual policymaking. There is little chance that John Roberts, having declined to do away with Obamacare when the law faced a reasonable constitutional challenge, will rule in favor of a more implausible attack. There is zero chance that the Special Olympics will be defunded; the budget that imagined doing so was a symbolic statement that gets ignored by Congress every year.
I have no idea how these bills will fare in the Republican-controlled Senate (and they have not yet even been passed by the full House), although I will note that the Senate is the same institution which devoted itself in 2017 to the noble dream of taking away health care coverage from 29 million people by repealing the Affordable Care Act. That effort failed by a single vote, of course — the last great political act of John McCain, who, although no fan of Obamacare, hated even more the idea of bullies picking on the little guy.
A new effort to pass the Republican health care bill has been propelled by an amendment that would allow states to waive certain insurance regulations in Obamacare. We examined the probable effects when the idea surfaced in April. Now that those ideas have become part of the legislative package, we've updated our analysis.
Americans shouldn't be punished by its failure to provide choices, she said, referring to the Affordable Care Act. Until the law changes, we won't stand idly by as Americans suffer.
South Africa has given emergency approval to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and is reviewing applications by rival manufacturers, the country's medicines regulator said on Wednesday. Helen Rees, the chairwoman of the regulator, the South African Health Products board, announced the decision during a news briefing and said that the minister of health would share more details on the country's next steps later in the day.
It is amazing that the whole article never talks about cost controls. With the hospitals and doctors charging exorbitantly, why would you expect the insurance rates to be lower, whether it is a single-payer system or multipayer system?
Some health policy experts say that if large numbers of healthy people buy short-term coverage, it could drive up premiums for those who remain in Affordable Care Act plans.
While the investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III did not conclude that Mr. Trump or his campaign coordinated with Russia, according to a summary of Mr. Mueller's report by Attorney General William P. Barr, the special counsel stopped short of absolving Mr. Trump on obstruction.
Along similar lines, the liberal, pro-Democratic Center for American Progress issued a report on Monday warning that progressive supporters of liberalized immigration have ceded powerful rhetorical ground to immigration restrictionists, who are happy to masquerade as the sole defenders of America as a nation of laws.
Let me tell you about Senator McCain.
This syndrome demands an explanation, and I'll get there eventually. Before I do, however, let's document the things that make G.O.P. health care lies unique.
The list of new policies goes on. There is money in the American Rescue Plan to expand food stamps, bolster state welfare programs, and increase federal support for child and dependent care. Put all this together and the bill is expected to reduce overall poverty by more than a third and child poverty by more than half. It is, with no exaggeration, the single most important piece of anti-poverty legislation since Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society, itself the signature program of a man who sought to emulate F.D.R.
7 million fewer people will be covered by their employers.
Should Illegal Entry Be a Crime?
Mr. Trump has unsettled markets with trade threats aimed at China, which The Times has editorialized against. He famously boasted Trade wars are good, and easy to win. But a recent Axios report noted that China's exports to the United States dropped 23.1 percent this year.
The Congressional Budget Office recently said that around 24 million fewer Americans would have health insurance in 2026 under the Republican repeal plan than if the current law stayed in place.
Well, the state is one that is unique in its political history.
How do they solve their dilemma — a dilemma with real-life consequences for many people? It's one of the biggest mysteries of 2017. I'll continue to hope that those Kentucky voters have their optimism rewarded, but it's a deeply wishful form of optimism.
In fact, as Republicans moved closer to a vote, public support for Obamacare went up — 49 percent of those polled this month by the Kaiser Family Foundation had a favorable view of the law, up from 43 percent in December. Obamacare, though not without flaws, has done a world of good. The percentage of Americans who do not have health insurance has fallen to 9.1 percent, from 16.3 percent in 2010. A 2016 Kaiser study of people who gained insurance in California found that 77 percent of them said their health needs were being met very well or somewhat well. By comparison, only 49 percent of those people said their needs were being met three years earlier.
BS: Well, you had your fire.
It's a mistake to doubt the sincerity of Ms. Collins's and Ms. Murkowski's dedication to questions of women's health. Ms. Collins was one of only three Republican senators to vote against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Last year, she and Ms. Murkowski broke ranks to cast the deciding votes against defunding Planned Parenthood. And this year, the two senators again voted with the majority of Senate Democrats to oppose a ban of abortion after 20 weeks. Both have been solid defenders of family planning and birth control. Both have earned high ratings with pro-choice groups — Ms. Collins has been rated higher than 90 percent by groups like NARAL in multiple years. To cave on this particular issue would be a tragic abrogation of personal, as well as political, conviction. Which is why the Supreme Court battle may at last compel both women to abandon the party they should have abandoned already.
Let's hope voters are smarter than that. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me 70 times and counting, shame on me.
He clearly recognizes the problem — he said he spends a lot of time thinking about it — but he also knows the solutions will come only when he is long out of office. Many citizens, he said, back on Air Force One, have to worry about retraining at some point in their careers, because they can't anticipate being in one place for 30 years. The occupational mix in the economy places greater demands on people because it's changing more rapidly. And all of this makes people feel that they don't know what's around the corner. For whatever sense of uncertainty business leaders lament, this may be a much more profound sense of uncertainty.
Should Illegal Entry Be a Crime?
The Democratic Party establishment wants to bring us Bernie Sanders supporters into the fold, so it urges Mr. Sanders to join the pro-Clinton, anti-Trump cause right now, not later. The Republican establishment is engaged in the very different enterprise of asking its candidate to pretend to be what he is not.
In the October Democratic debate, Times national editor Marc Lacey asked Mr. Yang to comment on Senator Warren's calls to break up companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google. Mr. Yang said Senator Warren is correct in her diagnosis of the problem but breaking up the companies isn't an adequate solution because using a 20th-century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new tool kit.
Here's a look at what may follow as the pandemic starts to settle:
Even as the state voted for Barack Obama twice —
Mark Zuckerberg has held the line on Facebook's decision to allow political ads, even as Twitter banned them. The company's approach came under scrutiny after it said Mr. Trump's re-election campaign would be allowed to run an ad with false claims about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter. Mr. Zuckerberg said this is about free speech and not the profit motive.
So what you have described is a pretty radical idea that would upend a huge segment of the U.S. economy. It would require major changes to the tax code. So I wonder if there's any practical chance that this actually could get through our legislative and political process to become the U.S. health care system.
A growing divide has emerged among unions over whether to support Medicare for all. Roughly 95 percent of union workers had health care access in 2019, while just 68 percent of nonunion workers did.

MC: And nobody does well at this question.
I do think, though, that ultimately, they won't win elections in this way, that the combination of a kind of bizarre personal charisma with a way of harnessing the anger of some of the base with a sort of grasp on how to get the kind of attention that puts you at the center of every conversation helped Trump to do this very narrowly. I don't think there are other politicians right now in the Republican Party who could pull that off. And so at the very least, if they ask themselves, how do we get anywhere? They should consider that getting somewhere might mean offering voters something they want. And I do think there are politicians in the party who do see that and who want to get to that place. You mentioned Marco Rubio. And there are others who have been more hostile to Trump who, I think, can see their way to that, too. There are others in the middle on the Trump question, people like Ben Sasse or Mike Lee or Ted Cruz, who represent very different views of Donald Trump, but who, in different ways, try to be attuned to what voters want. And I think, ultimately, the model of Trumpism is not a durable model for how the party can function. But that's as much a hope as it is a fact. And so I hope it's true.
A 25-person Maskforce team at Salesforce is coordinating the effort. The company's partnership with the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba proved crucial — a call from Mr. Benioff to the Alibaba chief Daniel Zhang set the plan in motion.
They have spent, at this point, several days on the defensive about some of the claims that they made about what was likely to be in Robert Mueller's report. They are desperate to get away from their own divisive fights about the nature of liberal health care policy. You have had, in the presidential primaries, in the House of Representatives, even in the Senate where Democrats aren't in control, just endless tugs of war between moderate liberals, very liberal Democrats, far-left Democrats over what kind of health care system the country ought to have in an ideal world. Should it be European-style single-payer health care? Should it be a system that just totally does away with private health insurance? All these kinds of divisive debates on the left that have had Democrats tripping over each other. But President Trump weighs in the way he does on the Affordable Care Act, and all of a sudden all those conflicts hit pause.
President Trump has found strong support in Oklahoma; he took 65 percent of the vote there in 2016 in a 36-point victory, and recently held a campaign rally in Tulsa, his first since the start of the pandemic.
The authors of this fantasy are right that we need to do something about global warming and inequality. But simple attempts to realign incentives, like the carbon tax, would be more effective and more realistic than government efforts to reorganize vast industries.
And was always, again, very derivative of the energy that John McCain brought to everything that John McCain did. So, 2015.
Oh, I'm not going to do names.
They say that in order to go through reconciliation, policies have to have sort of a primary impact that is budgetary. It's like an organization passing a primary purpose test. You can't have a procedure or a policy that is sort of ancillary in its budgetary effects or sort of indirect. For instance, something like DC statehood, its advocates could sort of argue that there is some budgetary impact to statehood. And I'm sure that that's true. But it would never pass muster because it's very clear that the primary impact of creating a new state is not a budgetary impact. And so, it limits what can go through reconciliation to issues that have big impacts on revenues, spending, and that sort of thing.
Yeah. I mean, that's precisely it. I feel like gender and gender constructs have too big of a place in society in the way that we think about the world, in the way that people understand their preferences. I have a son and a daughter who are six and eight. And it's just crushing to me that they feel so strongly attached to very gendered expectations. They play with girl toys and boy toys and listen to what they call girl music and boy music. And it seemed to happen kind of automatically in a way that was difficult to think about how they were being kind of hemmed in by these gender expectations. I don't know if changing the pronouns we use will have a huge effect on this. But it feels like a small thing we could do to kind of free ourselves from what I think of as this kind of prison of gender expectations in society.
The formula was simple: when he was a foil against Senate Republicans, he was a straight-talking American hero; when he was running for president against Mr. Obama, he was a dangerous madman. It didn't help that his behavior in the 2008 election was quirky to the point of being erratic. Remember that at one point during the financial crisis he unilaterally suspended his campaign and flew back to Washington, and then began campaigning again a few days later having done nothing noteworthy. It demonstrated for the nation the sort of impulsiveness Arizonans had grown used to. It was supposed to be a grand gesture that demonstrated that he was above politics and therefore more worthy of the presidency than his opponent. It actually demonstrated self-indulgence and a lack of political maturity. As a result, when he faced Mr. Obama and his substantial political talents, he lost the Electoral College by 2 to 1.
That's right, and Joe Biden was — maybe not by then, but certainly in the '80s, into the '90s. I'd put it this way. I think it is now the case that each party is divided internally over economic questions. Even the core question of the role of government, which I think would have been the essential dividing question between the Republicans and Democrats 20 years ago, is now a question that divides Republicans, where there is a rising group, which have been identified kind of as populists in recent years and in some ways that's right, who have a much greater openness to aggressive government action for certain purposes, who are much more open to government spending than Republicans have tended to be. In some ways, Donald Trump was one of these people, but I think they mostly attached this to him. But if you think about where Marco Rubio is now or Josh Hawley has been, they are very much at odds with traditional Republican views about spending and taxes and the role of government. And a fair amount of the energy among younger people on the right is on their side, on the side of these more populist conservatives. And in some ways, the same is true in the left, where there are traditional neo-liberal Democrats. Maybe nobody would call themselves that anymore but people with a traditional, kind of Clinton-era sense of what government should be about.

But with no guaranteed coverage and no standard premiums, it would be impossible to know whether you could buy any particular plan, or at what price. Customers would need to apply to each plan separately, filling out detailed medical histories — and in some cases submitting blood and urine samples — to find out what they would be allowed to buy. Those steps would make shopping much more difficult. Obamacare currently limits the period during the year when people are allowed to shop for insurance, meaning that customers might have to submit multiple applications at once in order to be able to buy insurance before the shopping period closed.
And we should go back to a system like we had before on every other issue, where if you could secure a majority in the House, a majority in the Senate, get a president to sign it, and could sustain scrutiny from the courts, that's the system Madison designed. And that should be what makes a bill a law.

There is a very long list of site visits planned and face-to-face meetings continue.

We continue to be hopeful that all of the data and all of the meetings that they need will be had. And and just to reconfirm that all hypotheses are on the table, and we're looking forward, hopefully, to a successful conclusion of the mission. Success in the case of animal human interface investigations is not measured necessarily in absolutely finding a source on the first mission. This is a complicated business, what we need to do is gather all of the data, all of the information, summarize all of these discussions and come to an assessment as to how much more we know about the origins of the disease, and what further studies may be needed for the release of.
We should be grateful that the president at least realizes that he has to spend some airtime with medical experts. (How long will it take before he's driven crazy by the great press Dr. Anthony Fauci is getting? Feel free to place your bets.) But you know he always was, and always will be, a guy who likes pretending everybody in the Fortune 500 is just a comrade in commerce.
And to be fair, I actually agree that Obama was much too cautious on some fronts. Back in 2009 I was very publicly tearing my hair out over the obvious inadequacy of Obama's economic stimulus, which I predicted (correctly) would be a political disaster, because the failure to achieve dramatic results would play into Republican hands. And I believe that Obama could have gotten much more if he had been willing to use reconciliation to bypass the filibuster, the way Republicans did in ramming through the 2017 tax cut.
That means that in 10 years, the number of uninsured Americans would be closer to what it was before the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature health law, took effect.
I've spent 25 years as a journalist and have repeatedly seen the discomfort that journalists feel about proclaiming one political party to be more successful than the other on virtually any substantive issue.

But it did not go as far as Texas and the other states, which argued that all of the Affordable Care Act and the regulations issued under it were now invalid.
What about the idea that anti-poverty programs create a poverty trap, reducing the incentive for people to work their way to a better life? That's a very popular notion on the right. But the reality is that there are very few Americans getting food stamps or Medicaid who could and should be working but aren't.
She ran as a Republican, but in both Alaska and Washington, the party seemed comfortable moving on without her. The National Republican Senatorial Committee spent more than $1 million funding Miller, with the Tea Party Express adding $600,000. Not long after she started the campaign, Murkowski learned, while she was in Alaska, that Senate Republicans were considering voting the next day to remove her from her position as the ranking member on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I have basically been written off by the senatorial committee, she said, recalling her state of mind in a memoir by Arlen Specter, the moderate former senator from Pennsylvania, and I'm not going back begging and pleading. My relationships will either stand on their own or not. In the end, she held on to her post.

MC: And nobody does well at this question.
I'm Ezra Klein, and this is The Ezra Klein Show. [MUSIC PLAYING] So before we begin today, we are still looking for an associate producer on the show. That is a position which requires two years of audio experience, but it's going to be involved in everything from researching guests, to booking, to transcripts, to cutting and editing episodes. If that sounds like something you have the experience for and want to do, we have the listing right now in the show description. So go check it out. Today's episode is about one of the core obsessions, or themes, that this show is going to have. And that is how do we get — can we even get a more responsible Republican Party? And one way I define that is, a Republican Party that is more centered around an actual governing agenda. The Republican Party we actually have, has spun off too much to culture war and grievance politics, as, depending on how you want to frame it, a distraction from an absence of consensus on more direct policies that would improve the lived economic lives of the voters. Or another way of looking at it is, it's trying to distract from opposition to those policies. But there are Republicans who are trying to diagnose the problem, who are trying to push the party back in a more policy-centric direction and trying to push the party, also towards a policy-centric direction that, I think, would be healthier.
And if Republicans are going to fight or undermine them, market-based programs probably aren't going to happen. Such programs are often designed to be a compromise between the two parties — policies that essentially use the market to correct a market failure. I realize that some people would argue that Democrats should still promote market-based programs even if Republicans won't.
Yeah, I do agree that deconstructing the power that has gone to leadership to control every aspect of the floor agenda, trying to democratize power in the Senate would be a good thing. I think that the ability of leadership to control every minute detail of what happens on the floor is a bad thing for the institution. I just think that the political pressure on Murkowski, Collins, and Ayotte, who did feel a lot of pressure in this and lost her Senate race that year, to break ranks would have been enormous if the three of them alone could have been the difference in proving that there was a majority for Garland. What the cushion of 13 allowed Republicans to do was dodge accountability. Because when reporters came to Ayotte or Collins or Murkowski or whoever, they could just sort of point that way, and point at their other colleagues, and say, don't ask me. I'm not the decisive vote here, even if I came out and demanded a hearing. And they sort of did lean a little bit in that direction. It wouldn't have made a difference. And the insurmountability of that 13-vote cushion just took the steam out of the issue. It was very hard. We were trying to sort of mount a campaign and put pressure on Republicans to do this. But what I kept hearing from reporters again and again was, how are you going to get to 13? They're never going to break ranks.
Ms. Warren was likely referring to reporting by Sarah Kliff in The Times in November chronicling a rise in hospitals' suing patients over overdue bills.
It is not as if Democrats are lacking powerful immigration issues on which to run. An April University of Maryland Study of American Attitudes on Immigration and Refugees found that the Trump administration's family separation policies are opposed 64-25, including by independent swing voters (67-18) and even by Republicans whose partisan allegiance is not strong (51-34). Only strong Republicans support the policies, 55-26.

For one thing, Democrats haven't yet hit on a successful strategy for turning out voters in midterm elections. That hurts them in congressional and governor races, as well as in state legislatures, which in turn allows Republicans to control the gerrymandering process.
China cancels Lunar New Year celebrations for millions of migrants. Hankou Station in Wuhan, China, last week. A year ago, the station was among the first places to be closed after the coronavirus outbreak. Credit... Roman Pilipey/EPA, via Shutterstock Every winter, Pang Qingguo, a fruit seller in northern China, makes the 800-mile trip to his ancestral home to celebrate the Lunar New Year, the biggest holiday of the year in China, with his family. The coronavirus ruined the festivities last year, stranding Mr. Pang in the northern city of Tangshan as many Chinese cities imposed lockdowns. Now, as China confronts a resurgence of the virus, the pandemic is set to spoil the holiday again, with the authorities announcing onerous quarantine and testing rules to dissuade migrant workers like Mr. Pang from traveling for the new year, which begins this year on Feb. 12. Mr. Pang, who describes his home in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang as the happiest place, is anguished by the rules. He has taken to social media in recent days to express frustration about his situation and post photographs of his 7-year-old daughter, whom he has not seen in more than a year. Society is so cruel, he wrote in one post. Many of China's roughly 300 million migrant workers face a similar reality as the government tries to avoid a surge in cases during what is typically the busiest travel season of the year.

The decline could be because Trump's increasingly moonstruck tweets have lost their power. Or maybe it's because all of the people around him believe he's an idiot and they're going public with the consensus inside the White House (another reason to get a dog). But I think Trump's base is showing some erosion because his followers feel he finally crossed a line: He's now insulting them.
Throughout the debate to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, President Trump and Republican congressional leaders have insisted they would retain a crucial, popular part of the health law: the promise that people can buy insurance even if they've had illnesses in the past.
Senator Warren published an op-ed in The Washington Post in 2015 attacking the investor-state dispute settlement clause in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which she argued would tilt the playing field in the United States further in favor of big multinational corporations.

March 3, 2020, 11:19 p.m. ET March 3, 2020, 11:19 p.m. ET Two North Carolina Democrats are poised to join the House after redistricting. Democratic voters on Tuesday selected Deborah Ross, an unsuccessful 2016 Senate candidate, to run in North Carolina's newly redrawn second congressional district this November, all but assuring she will become a member of the House. The district, surrounding Raleigh, is one of two House seats that will be a virtual lock for Democrats after a court ordered the state to redraw its congressional map last year. Kathy Manning, a lawyer and small business owner, was on track to win the other, the state's newly drawn sixth district around Greensboro. If Democrats do win the seats in November, it would help insulate their House majority from Republicans seeking to reclaim control. Read more
Here, in the collection of lightly edited emails that follow, are the very beginnings of those stories. 1:36 a.m., 4:14 a.m., 5:22 a.m. Time of third-shifters and insomniacs.
A Senate no longer in the Republican grip could rescue women's reproductive rights on multiple fronts: maternity coverage, access to contraception, teen-pregnancy prevention, breast-cancer treatment. It could protect us from planned eviscerations of Social Security and Medicare, and stop the gutting of Obamacare, the greenlighting of partisan gerrymandering, and the enshrining of an ethically shameless kleptocracy. It would thwart the authoritarian dream of seamless one-party rule across all three branches of government. Even a threat of leaving would send a salutary shock through the party.
Finally, in the pettiest move of all, Mulvaney said he would change the order of the words in the bureau's name — to the bulkier Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. Administration officials acknowledged to The Times that the move was meant to diminish the agency's public profile. It also seems like an unsubtle attempt to erase the old C.F.P.B. from everyone's memory.
CW: That's just a process of fact-checking and you want that to be independent, because then there's the issue of Facebook getting involved.
But I take your question seriously. The place I might be most likely to fail is to get only part. Now, part's better than none, right? But only part. And that's a deeply worrisome thought.
And I wonder, did you ask Graham about how McCain felt about this developing relationship between Graham and Trump, considering their past and McCain's place in it?
No. This is on budget reconciliation.
And that was before the recent messy departure of Rob Porter as staff secretary in the wake of spousal abuse allegations, or the announcement on Wednesday by the White House communications director Hope Hicks — the fourth person to hold the job — that she, too, was leaving.
BA: Are tariffs the leverage that you use to secure those types —
Or three. I mean, how do you want to count it? [LAUGHTER] One is to reduce the cost for families on the first day. I mean, the cost savings doesn't come in on the first day, but you sign the papers that need to be done, so you reduce costs on the first day. The second is to give people the opportunity to be in Medicare if they want, anyone who's 50 or older, and expand the coverage for Medicare. It's to offer Medicare for all complete health care coverage to everyone else who wants it.
In The Wall Street Journal last month, under the headline John Roberts's 'Illegitimate' Court, the newspaper's editorial columnist, William McGurn, wrote: For those not fluent in modern Beltway, let us translate: It's a threat, aimed at John Roberts. If the chief justice does not produce the desired progressive outcome, the Roberts court will find itself attacked as institutionally illegitimate. This week, The Journal's editorial board took aim at the new development in the census case under the headline Census Target: John Roberts. Whenever you read 'legitimacy' in a sentence about the court, you know it's a political missile aimed directly at Chief Justice John Roberts.
KK: As student loan debt has come up a couple of times, I want to make sure we have a question.
There we go. But the point is there are some things about tech that are special. I mean, that we're seeing for the first time. Ways that you can be anti-competitive that we hadn't seen before, just like that was true in the early 1900s about, you know — you had the oil supply, and you also owned all the gas stations and how that one worked. We broke that apart.
In his early months on the job, Zucker laid off journalists. Lately, he has been on a hiring spree, in particular for CNN's digital operation. He brought on the veteran investigative reporters Carl Bernstein and James Steele to write for CNN's website and appear on TV and poached BuzzFeed's four-person investigative political-research team, K-File, led by Andrew Kaczynski. CNN.com has scored some big scoops in recent months. It was the first to report that U.S. intelligence officials briefed Trump about claims that Russia was in possession of compromising information on him, and it broke the story that the White House had asked the F.B.I. to publicly reject media reports that people close to Trump were in contact with the Russians during the campaign. Not only do stories like these generate traffic for CNN's website, but they provide news for its hosts to discuss on-air. And while the numbers are dwarfed by those on the TV side, the network's digital operation has become a revenue generator in its own right, bringing in $300 million in 2016.
So this is one of my things where I recommend not so much a show as a performance within a show. But I'm going to recommend Meryl Streep's performance on the second season of Big Little Lies on HBO. The season as a whole has been a little bit more forced. But Streep has showed up, basically, as the mother of a character who was killed by the female characters in the first season. It's sort of a cliche to praise a Meryl Streep performance, but it really is just a tremendous performance as this particular kind of older, WASP-y, slightly passive-aggressive—
Mr. Trump released his short list of potential Supreme Court nominees in May 2016. In September 2016, he released a second list with several more women and people of color, following criticisms of the white and male bias in his first.
The legislation that the House passed would cover 85 percent of COBRA premiums through September. The Senate plans to bump up the amount to 100 percent, meaning the government would pay the full cost of premiums. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the more generous Senate version will cost $35 billion.
I mean, I feel like I see in my children a response to society in sort of everything they do. I mean, they're incredibly molded by their friends, by what they hear in school, by us parents. And my worry is not for them at their age right now. As I said, they're eight and six. It's like how they think about gender and the role of gender, and how they think about, especially, their preferences and their interests, how those are shaped by society at large. At an early age, they're being pushed in these directions that I don't know accurately reflects how they would live in another kind of society. This is all just a little bit academic though. Because changing pronouns or just my writing a column about changing pronouns isn't going to effect any of this. But it's the larger backdrop to my feeling that the importance that we put on gender and the kind of almost invisible role in our day-to-day lives that gender plays on what we do is just too high. And much of my desire in writing this or in talking about pronouns is to just point out how stifling some of this can be.
Peters said he hoped to draw on his experience in last year's campaign during what will be a challenging and complex election year. Any time a new president reaches the midterm elections, that president's party is likely to lose seats. But the Senate map is looking relatively favorable for Democrats again in 2022, and they have their sights set on possible seat pickups in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.
That it is about outcomes, that I've got an opportunity up here working with the president to get some outcomes that could be really good for the country and I think, from my point of view, good for the world.
The savings would have been substantially larger, but Republicans would also eliminate about $600 billion in taxes imposed under the Affordable Care Act, including taxes on investment income, prescription drugs and indoor tanning.
But Mr. Azar said, We certainly are not able to regulate in time for the plan year that starts in January.
I'm not going to do this. I'm just not. I'm not here to take on Joe Biden and what Joe Biden has done. I'm glad to talk to you about why I'm running for president, but not to attack him.
Times reporting from Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley found that Senator Warren's wealth tax plan has broad support, including from 77 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of Republicans, with the exception of one demographic: Republican men with college degrees.
BA: What is the specific standard that you would apply in antitrust? Right now we basically have a consumer pricing setup.
He was becoming one of the smart people. He was talking to me, wise guy to wise guy. And he was essentially giving away the game, as if his Senate office in Washington and a luncheon hall in Greenville, South Carolina were completely different worlds that have nothing to do with each other.
In Des Moines, where Mr. Biden addressed an audience of about 200 Iowa AARP members who had gathered on the campus of Drake University, the former vice president said he would not criticize my opponents before leaning into a harsh critique of the system favored by Mr. Sanders.
A Washington Post tally of President Obama's campaign promises found that he kept 11 promises (expand hate crime statutes, insure more Americans, establish a credit-card Bill of Rights), compromised on 12 (end the war in Iraq in 16 months, increase the earned-income tax credit) and failed on 17 (raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation, create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants).
The Bevin administration has estimated that the plan will result in 100,000 fewer Medicaid recipients after five years and save $2.4 billion, mostly in federal Medicaid funds. But Mr. Bevin couched the policy change as a moral rather than a fiscal decision, saying he did not care about the savings and saw it as an opportunity for Kentucky's poor not to be put into a dead-end entitlement trap but rather to be given a path forward and upward so they can do for themselves.
But a few questions caught her off guard: how to safeguard American nuclear weapons in Turkey; how to respond if China cracked down violently on protesters in Hong Kong; and what she was likely to fail at as president.
# #3 Medicaid work requirements New change States can make some Medicaid recipients prove they are working or looking for work. Previously States could apply for waivers to impose work requirements, but they might not get approved. Who's happy with this change Conservatives, particularly members of the Republican Study Committee, a conservative House group that met with President Trump last week
Still, voters there broke with him on this issue, albeit by the margin of one percentage point. The ballot initiative drew 30,000 more voters than the state's Senate primaries, suggesting that some Oklahomans came out specifically to support the insurance expansion.
SS: So you mean getting rid of the combat troops there now, or preclude sending any combat troops there in the future?
The Kaiser Family Foundation's Health Care Tracking Poll has found a decline in public support for Medicare for all since the start of the year. Now roughly 51 percent of American adults are in favor of a single-payer system and 47 percent are opposed, whereas earlier this year 57 percent backed it and 37 percent were opposed.
Senate leaders are now hastily trying to rewrite a sprawling tax bill — one that touches almost every part of the economy — and then pass it mere hours later. They need to do so because an independent Senate analysis late yesterday made clear what everyone already knew: The bill would add to the deficit enormously. In a normal legislative process, the Senate would have received that analysis long before taking any vote.
We have moved in a direction that in fact, the progressive — now 'progressive' means 'Bernie,' said Mr. Biden, who is a relative centrist but added that throughout his career he had been considered a liberal liberal.

KK: We're running out of time here.
It is undoubtedly difficult to differentiate Trump policies from the Trump persona, because the Trump persona dominates news coverage. But Republican candidates for Congress have to try. Tactically, that means being laser-focused on generating local news coverage of policy accomplishments, even when the national cable news fixates on the latest Trump outrage.
Your book is Kill Switch. It is my favorite book on the modern U.S. Senate. And believe me, you did not get the full of it listening to this conversation. So if you want to understand why the place works the way it does or doesn't work the way it does, you should read Kill Switch. Adam Jentleson, thank you very much.
The investment giant announced this morning that it is converting to a corporation from a publicly traded partnership, following peers in making the move. The company also made another huge change: It is giving shareholders more say in how it's run.
Mr. Looney, of the Brookings Institution, estimated that the benefits from Senator Warren's plans are skewed — he estimated that borrowers with advanced degrees will claim 37 percent of the annual benefits, while representing only 27 percent of borrowers overall.
We all do, chimed in four other women seated with her on a porch.
Individuals with Democratic congressional representatives experience a fundamentally different type of representation than do individuals with Republican representatives. Individuals with Democratic representatives encounter a mode of representation best described as populist.
The House speaker, Paul Ryan, claimed on Tuesday that Republicans would try to repeal and replace the law concurrently. He offered few details, but his statement suggests Congress won't repeal the A.C.A. for several months at least. On Monday, five Republican senators — Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Bob Corker of Tennessee, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rob Portman of Ohio — faced up to that reality. They proposed slowing down a budgetary process designed by congressional leaders to effectively kill the most important parts of Obamacare by defunding them.
There is, in fact, no problem so big or so complex that Mr. Trump has not boasted of his ability to fix it quickly and painlessly. Repealing and replacing Obamacare with a better, cheaper system? Easy. Returning domestic manufacturing to its heyday? Easy. Lowering gas prices? Ending the drug problem? Dealing with China? Easy, easy and easy. Restoring cultural and economic security by erecting a big, beautiful border wall that Mexico will pay for? Piece. Of. Cake.
Governors of several states also asked the administration to grant a special enrollment period, including Republican governors in Arizona and New Hampshire, and Democratic ones in Oregon, Michigan and New Jersey.
The Republican governor of Idaho, C. L. Otter, known as Butch, issued an executive order last month to combat what he called the overreaching, intrusive nature of Obamacare. And on Jan. 24, the state Insurance Department issued guidelines for the sale of insurance policies that do not meet coverage requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
Lindsey Graham, as John McCain's best friend, was extremely — took great umbrage at this.
Mr. Looney, of the Brookings Institution, estimated that the benefits from Senator Warren's plans are skewed — he estimated that borrowers with advanced degrees will claim 37 percent of the annual benefits, while representing only 27 percent of borrowers overall.
No, I know he did, but I don't know what that means.
That means that middle-income Americans earning just above the cutoff for Obamacare subsidies would get substantially more help paying for their health insurance.
BS: Just to tie in with Charlie here, let's just take the prescription problem.
A short history: During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said he would produce a health care plan that provided universal coverage and also promised that he would not cut Medicare or Medicaid. Everybody's got to be covered, Mr. Trump told 60 Minutes, a position that he repeated regularly until he took office.
The insurers, some which have already started leaving the marketplaces because they are losing money, say they need a clear commitment from the Trump administration and congressional leaders that the government will continue offsetting some costs for low-income people. They also want to keep in place rules that encourage young and healthy people to sign up, which the insurers say are crucial to a stable market for individual buyers.
Both choices carry risks. If the Democrats pursue the former route and their base sees them as having capitulated, that might depress turnout in November. If they succeed at the latter, that might energize the Republican base. And if they fail to take back the Senate, Judge Kavanaugh will sail through after all, and the Democrats will look weaker still for having attempted a tactic that backfired.
I mean, the most obvious reason is because it's just he or she is not inclusive. It does not precisely refer to everyone. A lot of people feel that they don't fit within that gender binary. And referring to them as they, it solves the kind of inadvertent misgendering problem. You know, some people say that it's a huge accommodation to make because it doesn't affect that many people. But I feel like we don't really know how many people this affects. And I think those numbers are increasing as people think about this more. It doesn't seem like a huge task for the rest of society to start thinking about language in a way that is more inclusive.
KK: Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
Goldwater's convention was a harshly factional affair, with conservative Republicans doing their damnedest to expel the moderate wing of the party. In its aftermath, George Romney, then the governor of Michigan and a leading light of moderate Republicanism, wrote a twelve-page letter outlining his disagreements with Goldwater. Dogmatic ideological parties tend to splinter the political and social fabric of a nation, lead to governmental crises and deadlocks, and stymie the compromises so often necessary to preserve freedom and achieve progress, he wrote, rather prophetically. (Decades later, his son, who had carried on his father's legacy as the popular moderate governor of Massachusetts, would win the Republican nomination for the presidency by recasting himself as severely conservative.)

Mr. Biden has repeatedly said he will support whoever the Democratic nominee is, though he did not reiterate that point in his answers on Wednesday.
It's that you don't get the tariff benefit. This is what it's really about. Where's the baseline? Right? And is the baseline one that says, across the board, you've got to give plenty of notice. You've got to work through, make sure you've got something that's achievable for countries we trade with. But this is not like trying to institute a trade war. This is not like saying we're mad at you and therefore we're going to impose all these tariffs on you, and doing it as Donald Trump has done by tweet.
That is also the message of a lawsuit — the first of its kind — filed this month in federal court in Maryland. Brought by several plaintiffs including the cities of Chicago, Cincinnati and Columbus, the lawsuit recounts the relentless and unlawful campaign to sabotage and, ultimately, to nullify the Affordable Care Act. Taken individually, some of the Trump administration's actions may be defensible. Taken together, they amount to a derogation of his constitutional duties.
Depreciation is a gift to tycoons. They buy real estate because it will appreciate–then claim a tax break for nonexistent depreciation. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
And millions of Americans finally had the same chance to buy quality, affordable health care, and the peace of mind that comes with it, as everybody else.
I don't think this was the most efficient way to do this, said Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic congresswoman from Washington State, who is the lead sponsor of the House's Medicare for All bill. She proposed legislation that would have allowed unemployed Americans transition to Medicare rather than staying on their former employers' plans.
Such an appropriation cannot be inferred, the judge said in her opinion. She blocked further spending under the program but said that order would be suspended pending an appeal by the Obama administration. No immediate disruption in the program was anticipated.
Re President Ending Health Subsidies for Poor People (front page, Oct. 13):
So the effect is that the promises that are put into trade agreements like T.P.P., they may all look the same on paper, but man, they are nowhere close to each other in terms of what happens with enforcement. Multinational corporations are given the opportunity basically to opt out of laws they don't like, where protections that are supposed to be written for our workers, for the worldwide environment, for human rights standards, just get left by the curb.
I'm going to get, in honor of my friends, full funding of $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which you have been trying to get for over 30 years.
To be sure, the embrace is not without reservation. A group of conservative states recently unleashed another legal challenge to the law. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah recently called it the stupidest dumbass bill that I've ever seen. But in arranged marriages, love often grows over time.
Republican county chairs and folks in the state legislature say a couple things. The first is that their position hasn't changed. They thought the governor didn't have the power then, and they don't think he has the power now to change how the election is run. The other point is that they see Wisconsin, again, as a microcosm of the conservative fight that could happen largely, and what could be a new reality of how American elections are run in this pandemic era. And in that view, dramatically expanding the electorate in these ways are not something that Republicans are all that keen on. Because what they're worried about is an election in which people who may not have participated, or may not have come out, all of a sudden have the opportunity to do so and to cast a ballot. And that kind of changes the center of power within the state.
So what I've done for Trump is I don't think inconsistent with what I've done with others. But here's the difference. It's more important, and he's receptive.
An important note: We still don't know the details of a repeal bill, and passage is not guaranteed. But Republicans passed a similar package in 2015, vetoed by President Obama, that provides a rough template. Republicans have also said they hope to make further changes through additional legislation. We'll provide updates when new legislative language arrives, expected in several weeks.
In 1950, Thomas Dewey, the former governor of New York and the GOP's 1944 nominee for president, freely admitted that if the measure of a real political party was a unified organization with a national viewpoint on major issues, neither the Republican nor Democratic Party qualified. Dewey thought this a great strength, since no single religion or color or race or economic interest is confined to one or the other of our parties. Each party is to some extent a reflection of the other. . . . This is perhaps part of the secret of our enormous power, that a change from one party to the other has usually involved a continuity of action and policy of the nation as a whole on most fundamentals. He allowed that there were those who rail at both parties, saying they represent nothing but a choice between Tweedledee and Tweedledum. If the critics had their way, he said, they then would have everything very neatly arranged, indeed. The Democratic Party would be the liberal-to-radical party. The Republican Party would be the conservative-to-reactionary party. (Narrator: They would have their way.)
The Affordable Care Act of 2010 set up a system where people could buy insurance on online marketplaces. People below the income threshold could qualify for subsidies if insurance in their area became too costly. People above the income threshold could buy insurance in the marketplace, or they could buy a different set of plans directly from an insurance company or through a broker.
My view on that one is that really you can be the umpire in the baseball game or you can have a team in the baseball game, but you don't get to do both at the same time. So breaking the platform off from the competitive business, yeah, that would give a lot of small businesses a much more level playing field and ability to compete.
One could argue that it has already proved problematic for Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been one of Medicare for all's top champions in this race, along with Senator Bernie Sanders, who has been touting the idea nationally since his 2016 presidential run. Under pressure to explain how she would pay for her proposal, in November Ms. Warren released a detailed accounting of where the estimated $20.5 trillion that her plan would cost over 10 years would come from.
About 10 million Americans lost their homes to foreclosure sales between 2006 and 2014, the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis.
You know, he lost. So I never liked him as much after that, because I don't like losers.
Another angle: Many Asian-Americans say they have experienced growing racism in the form of verbal and physical attacks. President Trump, who has made repeated use of the phrase Chinese virus, said on Monday that they should not be blamed for the pandemic.
There are also smaller categories of care that may be left off these plans. Research from Kaiser and the consumer advocacy group Families USA found that limitations on specific treatments were common. Details differ by plan, but examples include:
If the standard in judging the Democratic Party is whether it would support a radical upheaval vastly expanding the federal government, Rhodes continued, then
But more generally, a kind of frustration with the way that our institutions function and are led, and that points you to a political outlook that comes to be defined by frustration, a sense that people with power, people with privilege in American life routinely abuse that power for their own gain and advantage. They lie to the public. They look down on everybody else's way of life. And this is populism. There's a kind of left-wing populism. There's a kind of right-wing populism. It's always been an intensely powerful force in American political life.
Roughly 50 percent of Pennsylvania's population supports the fracking industry.
Even if Democrats sweep the 2020 elections, the incrementalist history of health policy reform in the United States suggests that an expansion of the current Medicare program is the most probable outcome. And yet the sizable role private insurers already play in Medicare is largely overlooked, even as they cause substantial administrative burdens for beneficiaries.
Five. Five percent. We are widening racial wealth gaps in this country right now. Opportunity is shrinking for our children, and people see this. It's 12 years later. It's 20 years later from a whole set of promises that this was going to get better, and it hasn't gotten better, but people watch at the same moment. They don't look around and see a country that's getting poor. Look out your window, right? They don't look around and say, God, America's really on a downslide. They look out and they say, America is doing great. G.D.P. keeps going up. The stock market keeps going up, unemployment is down, but my family is stretched to the breaking point. My debt load is bigger than ever, and I look over the edge and see where my children are headed. I don't even see my children able to replicate what I have. I don't see them able to buy my house. I don't see them having even the job stability I had. I see them carrying more debt at 19 than I carried at 35.
So, first off, investment – typically spending on infrastructure or research, but there may be some room at the margin for including spending on things like childhood development in the same category. The defining characteristic here is that it's spending that will enhance society's future productivity. How should we pay for that kind of outlay?
And you had an African-American president who was seen as an outsider by a lot of older white Americans. And into that mix stepped Trump with this mix of superficial economic populism, and birtherism, and bigotry. Was it inevitable that Trump was going to be the Republican nominee? I don't think, in hindsight, it actually was. Is it inevitable that the party has to be Trumpified permanently? I don't think it is. I mean, I think the failure of Republican politicians right now is their failure to say, what can we offer to our voters instead of America, love it or leave it? That as much as the failure to condemn Trump more forcefully is the problem for the Republican Party going forward. It has to figure out what it makes of the Trumpist turn.
archived recording (tony evers) So today, I'm asking the legislature to come together to take bipartisan action to ensure that every registered voter receives an absentee ballot to vote in the upcoming election.
It's still very early, but Joe Biden has emerged as the clear front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Bernie Sanders is in second place, although he appears to be fairly far behind, and one poll shows him in a statistical tie with Elizabeth Warren. So what should we think about the men currently leading the field?
But something deeper and more systemic is at work here that has little to do with the Affordable Care Act or John Roberts. The scapegoating of Chief Justice Roberts is the clearest demonstration yet of a profound shift in the political polarity of judicial activism. For decades, conservative politicians railed against the judicial activism of judges who overturned democratically enacted legislation, accusing such judges of seeking to use the power of the courts to impose their own political and social agendas. It was one of the easiest ways to score political points.
Senate leaders are now hastily trying to rewrite a sprawling tax bill — one that touches almost every part of the economy — and then pass it mere hours later. They need to do so because an independent Senate analysis late yesterday made clear what everyone already knew: The bill would add to the deficit enormously. In a normal legislative process, the Senate would have received that analysis long before taking any vote.
It's not that I'm opposed to debate. I do think that people should have to debate. I mean, one of the insidious things about the filibuster as it operates right now is that people don't just get to raise the threshold for passing a bill all the way up to 60 votes, but they get to do it in silent and never have to explain themselves. They never have to explain why they oppose this bill that is supported by a majority. So I do think we should find a way to restore the requirement to debate in sort of a use it or lose it way. But to me, the essential question of reform really comes down to, can a majority, within a reasonable amount of time, end the debate section of a bill's consideration? Because just so your listeners know, that's where the bills get held up. Every time a bill comes to the floor, it is entitled to debate under the rules. And the 60-vote hurdle is the vote to end that debate period and then go to the voting period. The voting period still is at a majority threshold. It's because you can't end the debate period, which is the 60-vote requirement, that bills die. You have to clear a bill's path to passage from introduction to final passage to be majority votes all the way through. I don't mind, and I think it would probably be healthy if the path to passage was slower than in the House.
Football Team at the Obamacare Buffet, by Margot Sanger-Katz (The Upshot, Economic View, Sept. 25), looked at the difficulty the health insurance markets have with pricing to account for healthy and sick customers — a problem likened to that faced by an all-you-can-eat buffet when a high school football team arrives.
But at the very moment he was called upon to teach the American people of the value of their republican Constitution, Chief Justice Roberts asserted the judicial restraint of the democratic constitution and turned them away. And that, my friends, was the end of our constitutional moment. That was the beginning of the end of constitutional conservatism as a political movement. And it kindled the resentment and populism that led to Donald Trump.
While President Obama himself didn't personally appear in court to defend the Affordable Care Act, the legal challenges hurled at the legislation demanded years of government and legal resources, not to mention public attention — so the legal dimension of the health care fight can't be discounted.
Now that you've insured an additional 20 million people, you can't just take the insurance away from these people, he added. It's just not the right thing to do.
The candidates were asked if it should be a civil offense instead of a crime to cross the United States border without documentation. Mr. Bennet appeared to be the only candidate not to raise his hand, while Mr. Biden simply said that he would not emphasize the deportation of undocumented immigrants who have not committed a serious crime.
The Affordable Care Act was an imperfect and incomplete reform. The political compromises needed to get it through Congress created a complex system in which too many people fall through the holes. It was also underfunded, which is why deductibles are often uncomfortably high. And the law has faced sabotage both from G.O.P.-controlled state governments and, since 2017, the Trump administration.
The first thing he wrote was, I was contacted by Leonard Leo.
This framing is crucial. When voters think about clean energy rather than climate change, some of the usual partisan patterns break down. Even many Republican voters support clean energy. In Michigan, the recently departed Republican governor, Rick Snyder, helped negotiate a 2016 deal that created performance standards for utilities. After signing the bill, he claimed it would reduce energy costs.
BS: You speak of these people standing around at rallies, are a lot of these people you're talking about. A lot of people standing around at Trump rallies are the very people you're talking about.
That is, he writes, the right's best health care minds believe that markets and competition can deliver lower costs and better care, and they believe it even though there is no clear example of a modern health care system built along the lines that they desire.
Vice President Biden has cast the Medicare for all plan as anti-labor, arguing that unions have already painstakingly negotiated health care benefits, progress that could be undone by a single-payer system. But Senators Warren and Sanders argue that the plan is pro-labor because it would mean union members are guaranteed health care and can focus their negotiations on wage increases, family leave and other benefits.
Well, I think there certainly was a way in which the populism of white Southerners moved from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party in the course of the mid-20th century. And that certainly played a part in the transformation of our politics that created the kind of modern arrangement of our parties as we know them so that by the 1990s, it was natural to expect that Republicans would win elections in the South and lose elections in the Northwest and the Northeast and the parties were fighting for the Midwest. American politics hasn't always been like that, but it's been like that for some time, as a result of that transformation. I think it's certainly not all that's going on, but what you point to is a process that happens in both parties, where there are populist energies, which have a lot to do with the base energy of the party. There's also a kind of elite, more intellectual-minded consensus at the top that tries to, as you say, harness this in constructive ways, that tries to use it to the good but also to contain some of what's dangerous about it. The Democratic Party, obviously, has had to struggle with itself in this way over and over in the course of the second half of the 20th century. At times, it has been unable to contain that and has brought itself to the point of really dramatic electoral losses. Think about '72 or '84.
But the underlying faith of the Green New Deal is a faith in the guiding wisdom of the political elite. The authors of the Green New Deal assume that technocratic planners can master the movements of 328 million Americans and design a transportation system so that air travel stops becoming necessary. (This is from people who couldn't even organize the successful release of their own background document.)
The strange glitch exists because the law originally required all states to expand Medicaid, and thus did not set up a system of subsidies for the poorest Americans to buy private coverage. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that states could opt out of expanding Medicaid, but Congress, bitterly divided over the law, never fixed the glitch.
CW: Andrew Yang said in one of the debates that you're applying a 20th-century framework to antitrust when it comes to Big Tech. Why is he wrong on that, and what makes your proposal to break up Big Tech adequate for the unprecedented profits of Silicon Valley?
But what about speech that mentions candidates long before an election? Or ads that don't mention a candidate at all? For example, groups funded by the Koch family ran ads in the congressional elections of 2014 attacking Obamacare without ever mentioning a congressional candidate by name. When party and ideology are as tightly aligned as they are, an ad doesn't need to connect all the dots to push a voter who dislikes President Obama's health insurance program to vote Republican or an environmental activist to vote Democratic. But this kind of robust open debate about public issues is exactly what the First Amendment is intended to protect.
MC: So as you're out there trying to convince people to join you on this mission, at certain times, and certainly in the debates it's come up that people who do not embrace your path lack the political courage or will, or they're scared, as you've said, to embrace big change. Now, certainly this will appeal to a lot of Democratic voters, but there are also a lot of more moderate swing voters, Democratic voters who will be put off by the idea that just because they don't embrace your particular policies, they somehow are not courageous or that they're wrong in their ideas. So how do you reach out to these people, because you can't win the nomination just with the progressive base. You've got to kind of convince these people who are nervous about the big ideas. For instance, Medicare for all that you're pitching is not a overwhelmingly popular idea.
In recent statements, the administration has not made any commitment to pay the subsidies beyond this month.
Well, I thought you were going to recommend Lane Kenworthy's book, actually.
People understand this is good for our economy. It's good for our worldwide security. If you're not willing to get out there and fight, nothing is going to change. And yeah, the fights have to be realistic. It's why I start everything with, Here's how I'm going to pay for it. You may not like how I did, but at least I laid it out there. You don't have any doubt, and I show you where every single nickel comes from because I want it to be realistic. I didn't start with free college. I started with a 2-cent wealth tax, because we can do a 2-cent wealth tax. I started with it and said, and here's how much revenue it produces. It produces a staggering amount of revenue, far more than raising income taxes, because that's what the wealth curve looks like.
I've been struck that one of the most interesting populist ideas to come out from the Republican, at least, Senate caucus, after the election, was not from one of the post-Trump populist , players like Hawley or Cotton, but it was from Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee. And he's got this idea, which, I think, is genuinely exciting and possibly bipartisan, for a child allowance. But I haven't seen even one other Republican Senator endorse it. So can you walk me through the idea first and then the debate over it on the right?
After months of ideological sparring, they seemed to have just one thing left to tell caucusgoers: If you want to beat President Trump, you had better pick me.
Reed: I thought he was pretty realistic in talking about the need to make various fixes to the law. That's been an issue since it was passed in 2010. There is a fairly broad consensus that the law could be changed to make it work better, even among its supporters. What did surprise me was the president's admission that affordability remains a real concern for many people, even with subsidies.
The bill is still subject to amendments and debate. The two House committees that wrote the legislation have scheduled hearings in the coming days. But the legislation was drafted in consultation with House leadership and Republicans on the other committees that oversee health care. President Trump, in a tweet and a brief statement from his press office Monday, signaled his general support for the plan.
The case the justices will hear was brought by Republican state officials, who argued that when Congress in 2017 zeroed out the penalty for failing to obtain health insurance, lawmakers rendered the entire law unconstitutional. The Trump administration sided with the state officials, arguing that the rest of the health care law could not survive without a penalty for flouting the requirement that most Americans have health insurance, sometimes called the individual mandate.
Medicare for all has created deep divisions on the left, particularly over questions like: How much would it really cost? Is Senator Warren's plan for raising the money for it progressive enough? Is it politically prudent to debate the issue now?
Throughout his presidential campaign Donald J. Trump extolled his business acumen and management skills, and just before his inauguration he insisted the transition to his administration was going very, very smoothly.
JI: But one of the premises for massive health care reform is that the Affordable Care Act is not working in a lot of ways, right? So you support Medicare for all presumably because you think the Affordable Care Act has a lot of holes in it, and we need to do something different, so you'll be defending that.
It's hard to say exactly, because we're talking about an unprecedented situation. But we do know that the people who are typically benefited from early voting, from early registration, from online registration, or a vote-by-mail are people who usually don't participate in the process — younger voters, minority voters, people that lean Democratic. And just in the ways that Republicans limited early voting in that special session they had after Evers won, it's the same thought process. That when more people get involved, when people who typically sit out get involved, that helps Democrats.
And I think right now, the push should be not to expand because that's the issue that's on the table.
Now senators are searching for changes to make the bill more politically palatable. But the notion of making those changes today and then speeding immediately to a vote is madness. There would be no time for experts to consider the consequences — to discover the sort of problems and unintended effects that last-minute changes are bound to create. By the time they did, the Senate would have passed it.
If I were writing the choice on a ballot, it would read: Are you in favor of electing a majority of Democrats in the House and/or Senate to put a check on Trump's power — when his own party demonstrably will not? Or are you in favor of shaking the dice for another two years of unfettered control of the House, the Senate and the White House by a man who wants to ignore Russia's interference in our election; a man whose first thought every morning is, 'What's good for me, and can I get away with it?'; a man who shows no compunction about smearing any person or government institution that stands in his way; and a man who is backed by a party where the only members who'll call him out are those retiring or dying?
Novavax's Vaccine Works Well Except on Variant First Found in South Africa Fauci urges a speedy return to school. Pregnant women are getting conflicting advice about vaccines. And New York seriously undercounted virus deaths in nursing homes, investigators say.
So let me do both of these, because I think there are two answers. There are two pieces in this answer. One is, I think attacking the corruption in Washington brings a lot more people together than most folks recognize, and that it really does reach across party lines.
I think we need to get our combat troops out. I don't think that combat is advancing the interests of the United States in the Middle East, and it's time to end combat operations. Of course we'll have a continuing presence in the Middle East. We have interests in the Middle East with our allies. We have interests in the Middle East and keeping shipping lanes open, and we will continue to have a presence there, but I don't think combat troops are how we best advance that presence.
And what happens after a week?
As waves of sick people crash onto undersupplied hospitals, doctors are preparing to make choices about who will get access to ventilators and other equipment, and who will get only palliative care.

But if forced, they ask, how do they make the least terrible decision?

Senator Warren's anti-corruption plan includes provisions to extend conflict-of-interest laws to the president and vice president, compel government to divest from privately owned assets and restrict the ability of lobbyists to be hired for government jobs. It takes aim in particular at many of the practices that the Trump family has used to profit from office, which The Times has editorialized against.
WASHINGTON — The heavens part. The light shines down. The rise in the oceans begins to slow. The world is once more bathed in the mystical glow of a messiah. Our redemption from Donald Trump is at hand.
When told that former Vice President Biden criticized her health care plans, Senator Warren answered with a critique of moderate Democrats: Democrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies. She also suggested Mr. Biden is running in the wrong primary.
One parallel Senator Warren has used in her plans for breaking up Facebook is the government's antitrust case against Microsoft in 1998, which Senator Richard Blumenthal and Tim Wu wrote in The Times made Microsoft a gentler giant.

And finally, a recommendation. And it may be a cliche, but greatness is good. [MUSIC PLAYING] This week, President Trump used a racist trope to criticize four women of color in Congress — Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib. Trump told them to, quote, go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came. Then the president doubled down on the sentiment.
I talked to a lot of Republicans in Washington, including some people we've been talking about, about these policy questions. I spent a lot of time talking to Scott Winship, who is a former Mike Lee staffer, now he's a colleague of yours at AEI, about this. And I would say that there's a very high level of abstraction when conservatives begin talking about things like work, right? I mean, that it's important for children to see their parents and going to work. And I agree, of course. But that is a really different situation when you're dealing with a parent who has a good, flexible job, then you have a parent whose only job they can get has just-in-time scheduling behind it. And so, that their parent is constantly not being able to be there when they said they were, they're not being able to come to school functions, that their whole home life is unstable. In my piece I talked to a woman named, Wanda Lavender, who was working at a daycare. She was there for 12 years. Her wages never went above $9. So then she began working at a daycare and a Popeye's. She's working more than 60 hours a week. She never has time to see their kids — her kids. She has rheumatoid arthritis, so it's really hard on her body. Work is great. I think it's good for my son to see me as a New York Times columnist.

They will also visit the Wuhan Institute of Virology and a laboratory operated by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The question of the pandemic's origin has caused friction between China and the United States, with officials in each country at times blaming the other for unleashing the virus on the world. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday that the United States hoped for a robust and clear international investigation. Chinese officials, in response, defended the country's handling of the inquiry. We hope the U.S. side will work with China, take on a responsible attitude and respect facts, science and the diligent work of W.H.O. experts, Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday. Chinese officials said on Friday that several passengers traveling to China from the United States had falsified coronavirus test results so they could gain entry to the country. The Chinese consulate in San Francisco said the passengers had changed their test results from positive to negative and that other travelers had lied about test results. The consulate did not provide details about the passengers or the punishments they might face. China maintains strict border control rules, including a requirement that travelers present results from antibody and nucleic acid tests before they fly. The consulate said the passengers had violated public health laws. The way they put others at risk is odious, the statement said.
At the same time, he accused the pharmaceutical industry of trying to protect its profits by opposing any constraints on drug prices.
So is there any alternative to Obamacare? Of course there is. We could go back to being a country in which people with pre-existing conditions and/or low incomes can't get health insurance, where for a large fraction of the population illness either goes untreated or leads to bankruptcy. That would, in part, mean becoming a country in which Americans who caught Covid-19 during the pandemic would be uninsurable for the rest of their lives.
The process is subject to strict rules that limit what can be included.
WASHINGTON — The Trump administration's decision to ask a federal appeals court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act has given House Democrats a new opening to pursue what they see as a winning political strategy: moving past talk of impeachment to put kitchen-table issues like health care front and center.
The president feels compelled to have something specific to counter Medicare for all. Still, people close to Mr. Trump suggested that if he did release something within a month or two, it might not be a comprehensive plan but a series of smaller proposals that would potentially help, such as ideas for bringing down prescription drug costs, for giving states more flexibility on Medicaid expansion and for promoting more access in the marketplace.
Democrats, who consider health care a winning issue and worry about possible changes in the composition of the Supreme Court, had urged the justices to act quickly even though lower courts had not issued definitive rulings. They wanted to focus political attention on the health law's most popular provisions — like guaranteed coverage for pre-existing medical conditions, emergency care, prescription drugs and maternity care — and to ensure that the case was decided while justices who had rejected earlier challenges to the law remain on the court.

But some progressives have questioned the decision to route patients into private health plans, which will cost the government more because of the high prices they pay for care.

Ms. Harris's background as a prosecutor is woven into her identity as a presidential candidate. Her campaign's tagline is Kamala Harris For The People, which mimics what she used to say when appearing in court.
But not everywhere. Several states are considering whether to adopt their own versions of the individual mandate, Obamacare's rule that people who can afford insurance should pay a fine if they don't obtain it. A few are looking to tighten rules for short-term health plans. Some states are investing heavily on Obamacare outreach and marketing, even as the federal government cuts back.
For example, you still hear complaints that spending on food stamps and unemployment benefits increases the deficit. Now, Republicans never really cared about budget deficits; they demonstrated their hypocrisy by cheerfully passing a huge tax cut in 2017, and saying nothing as deficits surged. But it's just absurd to complain about the cost of food stamps even as we offer corporations hundreds of billions in loans and loan guarantees.
And health care was something that they considered including in the package of reforms at that time when they made social security and a lot of these other programs, but it was too controversial, and it actually dropped out of that proposal.
WASHINGTON — For a long time, Republicans have brandished the same old narrative to try to scare their way into the White House.
While President Obama himself didn't personally appear in court to defend the Affordable Care Act, the legal challenges hurled at the legislation demanded years of government and legal resources, not to mention public attention — so the legal dimension of the health care fight can't be discounted.
The better bet seems to be an all of the above approach: Organize a climate movement around meaningful policies with a reasonable chance of near-term success, but don't abandon the hope of carbon pricing. Most climate activists, including those skeptical of a carbon tax, agree about this. Gunn-Wright says she is open to a price on carbon. NextGen's Foser says he thinks the next federal climate bill should err on the side of ambition. Podesta, who has spent as much time as anyone thinking about how to pass federal legislation on climate change, says he thinks a carbon price needs to be in a bill, so long as it isn't the focus. One option, he suggested, would be a carbon price that was both delayed until future years and initially low, increasing later. Such a price could still have a major effect on investments in clean energy, because those investments tend to be long-term.
Yeah, I think, of course, there's a lot of truth to that. And I would say Hawley is his own separate example because of his behavior in the last month, which I have had a lot to say about it and I think has been horrible and indefensible. In some ways, Hawley has been a populist longer than a lot of the people who discovered populism in the Trump era. You can find Hawley writing, even in National Affairs 10 years ago, in ways that suggested a different attitude about the role of government, about public policy. What you also find in Hawley is something that's very important to understand about populist politics, I think, which is that there's a distinction made by political scientists between a politics of who rules and a politics of the direction of policy. Both of these are part of the political life of any democracy. People care about who's in power. Do they look like me? Do they speak for me? That's very important. And people care about, what is the government doing, and do I agree with it? Populist politics often will incline to be a politics of who rules, of we should be in charge and they have too much power. And we and the they can be defined in various ways, some of them uglier than others, more dangerous and sinister than others. I think there is an inherent tendency in a populist political culture to think in terms of who rules.
Spain's first case of the South African variant of Covid-19 was detected in the port city of Vigo, in the northwestern region of Galicia. Health authorities in Galicia said a 30-year-old man who works in the shipping industry returned from a recent work trip to South Africa and tested positive for the variant earlier this month. He had light symptoms and was not hospitalized, they said. Javier C. Hernández, Richard C. Paddock, Benjamin Novak and
The A.C.A. was less sweeping than it could have been because of the constraints imposed by a powerful health care lobby, but it was more sweeping than anything that had come before, Rhodes wrote by email. The fact that significant health care legislation was enacted in spite of substantial resistance was a testament to the strength of progressive mobilization at the time.

Washington also had a higher than usual rate of younger people among the 7,000 who took advantage of that state's extra enrollment period last spring.
And there needs to be a set of internal arguments and fights and struggles for the character of the party. And my hope is that the side that thinks about how to use politics to advance good ideas and use government to help people live better lives is the side that wins.

The president has repeatedly promised something better than the A.C.A. but has never come up with a plan himself, and the congressional plans he endorsed were definitely not better for everyone, said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The Affordable Care Act continued to grow in popularity after Republican efforts to repeal the legislation in 2017 — a recent poll found that over half of the public favors the legislation.
Mr. Trump's statement last week that a replacement plan should go hand in hand with repeal efforts had already ignited a sense of urgency among Republicans on Capitol Hill. Over the weekend Mr. Trump said he was close to completing a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act with the goal of insurance for everybody, but congressional aides said Tuesday that they had not seen an actual proposal.
Under the A.C.A., the poorest Americans are covered by Medicaid, so private premiums don't matter. Meanwhile, many of those with higher incomes — up to 400 percent of the poverty line, or more than $95,000 for a family of four — are eligible for subsidies. That's 59 percent of the population, but because many of those with higher incomes get insurance through their employers, it's 83 percent of those signing up on the exchanges. And here's the thing: Those subsidies aren't fixed. Instead, the formula sets the subsidy high enough to put a limit on how high premium payments can go as a percentage of income.
The president seemed to have gotten the message.
Shutdowns that included furloughs in 1984, 1986 and 1990 cost taxpayers at least $128 million, according to government estimates.
Credit Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times The United States is 43rd in the world in its ability to track potentially dangerous new mutations of the coronavirus, according to President Biden's coronavirus czar, who used the White House's first public health briefing to issue a stark warning that the United States will remain vulnerable to the deadly pandemic unless Congress quickly passes a coronavirus relief bill. We are 43rd in the world in genomic sequencing — totally unacceptable, said Jeffrey D. Zients, Mr. Biden's Covid-19 response coordinator, citing December data from the GISAID Initiative, which provides a global database of coronavirus genomes. In a brief interview later, he corrected himself, saying he had since learned that the United States was now behind 31 other nations. At the briefing, he also warned that the federal government still faces shortages of personal protective gear and other essential supplies that it will not be able to buy if Congress does not pass Mr. Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan. Scientists have warned that, with no robust system to identify genetic variations of the coronavirus, the United States is woefully ill-equipped to track dangerous new mutants, leaving health officials blind as they try to combat the grave threat. Dr. Anthony. S. Fauci, the president's senior adviser for Covid-19, who also spoke during the briefing, said the National Institutes of Health is now working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on research aimed at adapting vaccines so that they have on the ability to neutralize these mutants.
We will be lower than that number, Mr. Trump told reporters as the death count kept by Johns Hopkins University approached 38,000. But I really believe it could have been millions of people had we not done what we did.

Obamacare's subsidies were calculated to ensure that middle-class people didn't have to spend more than a set percentage of their income on insurance. And a timely analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation (based on a slightly earlier draft) shows that, in most parts of the country, low-income people would face a much larger gap between the value of their tax credit and the retail price of insurance than they do now.
A short history: During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump said he would produce a health care plan that provided universal coverage and also promised that he would not cut Medicare or Medicaid. Everybody's got to be covered, Mr. Trump told 60 Minutes, a position that he repeated regularly until he took office.
The cost of prescription drugs is another big problem for people with or without coverage. The average price of brand-name medicines jumped 164 percent from 2008 to 2015, according to Express Scripts. And 24 percent of Americans find it very or somewhat difficult to afford prescription drugs, according to a 2015 Kaiser Family Foundation survey.
So it's possible to imagine that at least some in the party will try to resolve, or at least start acknowledging, some of these questions.
If you've tuned in to the N.F.L. playoffs or the Golden Globes, or even tried to watch a Minecraft video on YouTube, you've probably seen Bloomberg's ad about health care. The 60-second TV spot begins with creepy music that sounds as if it were borrowed from a horror-movie soundtrack and footage of Trump saying things like Obamacare is a complete and total disaster and Let Obamacare implode. The music then turns upbeat, and a narrator touts Bloomberg's health-care-related accomplishments as New York's mayor: lowering the number of uninsured and infant mortality rates, increasing life expectancy. There's a multi­racial cast of smiling professionals in scrubs and white coats, pushing happy patients in wheelchairs and checking the heartbeats of adorable toddlers.

Polling has consistently shown Senator Warren to be in the top tier of candidates, but not the front of the pack. She trails Joe Biden — and Donald Trump — in key swing states.
Robert Bork was President Ronald Reagan's failed Supreme Court nominee in 1987. He wrote extensively on antitrust legislation and redefined it from a focus on helping small businesses to promoting economic efficiency, according to Barak Orbach, professor of law at the University of Arizona.
In the senate, Mr. McCain was the Democrats' near-perfect instrument for hectoring Republicans. He relished his role as a gadfly, and Democrats were eager to encourage him because doing so made the Republican conference less united and less effective. Of course, the paeans to Mr. McCain ended briefly when he ran for president against Barack Obama.
Well, the biggest thing we learned is that the politics of health care have been turned on their head in the last couple of years, and that the Affordable Care Act is no longer a liability for Democrats, and that Republicans, whether they want to acknowledge it or not, have largely abandoned the fight.
NF: But it's also about the Medicare for all plan.
So I had this really interesting and instructive experience about a year ago. I went with Bernie Sanders to Toronto, and we went on a tour of the Canadian health care system. And I would say that Canada's system is the closest analog to what a lot of these politicians are proposing. And one thing that just really struck me about Canada is that people are all in on the values piece. There is just a real sense of kind of social solidarity around the idea that health care is a right, and everyone should have it in the country, and there shouldn't be any restrictions, and that it should be sort of radically fair. And that just struck me culturally as so different. And the thing that I couldn't untangle when I was in Canada is, do they have those values because they have that system, or do they have that system because they already had those values? And I think, you know, part of what will be interesting if Democrats, you know, retake power, and if they start moving us on this path towards something more like single-payer is, how hard will it be to shift those values? We see them. There definitely are people in the Democratic base who believe them deeply in their hearts, but I don't think that most Americans feel that health care is a fundamental right and that everyone should have it. And I don't know if that will change.
About 10 million Americans lost their homes to foreclosure sales between 2006 and 2014, the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis.
The $4.4 trillion budget Mr. Trump released on Monday spends as much over 10 years as any budget offered by President Barack Obama, whose policies Republicans blamed for ballooning the size of the federal government and hobbling the economy. It does not attempt to achieve balance at the end of that time, despite optimistic economic growth projections that far exceed what most economists say is possible.
WASHINGTON — House Democrats, moving to sharpen the distinction between themselves and Republicans as the coronavirus pandemic rages, passed legislation on Monday that would ensure that Americans paid no more than 8.5 percent of their income for health insurance and would allow the government to negotiate prices with drug makers.
Then when you actually had the beer summit, did President Obama say anything helpful, or was that whole thing pro forma? Oh, that's interesting. I was at Martha's Vineyard, and I had been getting instructions from the White House, through Glenn Hutchins. They told me not to wear a bespoke suit. We don't want it to be about class. All of the sudden I was the upper-class black person against the working class. I go, I'm the victim! They go, No, don't wear one of those suits. I go: These are the only suits I have. I'm not going out to Sears and Roebuck and buying a suit. Then they go, Do not fly down in a private plane. Glenn Hutchins owns a private plane. Glenn's a billionaire. He's one of my best friends. The only way we could get to Washington was on Glenn's plane, because there was fog. Anyway, we got to the White House, and we and Sgt. Crowley's family all got to the library at the same time. I walked over to Sgt. Crowley. He had his kids there, and I said to them: Hi, I'm Professor Gates. Hope you come to Harvard one day. Maybe you'll take one of my classes. Then I said to him, Can I have a word with you? He and I went off and did the beer summit ourselves. I said, Look, I don't know about you, man, but I just want this to go away. He goes, This is a nightmare.
In Des Moines, where Mr. Biden addressed an audience of about 200 Iowa AARP members who had gathered on the campus of Drake University, the former vice president said he would not criticize my opponents before leaning into a harsh critique of the system favored by Mr. Sanders.
During a 10-day break for the Supreme Court in April 2012, several justices left Washington to give lectures or take short vacations. But both John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy remained in Washington, and Roberts used the time to try to win over Kennedy on Obamacare.
A 2018 Gallup poll found that a record-high 75 percent of Americans say immigration is a positive, including majorities of all parties. Yet immigration reform has become a wedge issue in Congress, with the government brought to a shutdown multiple times over issues like the treatment of Dreamers and the funding for Mr. Trump's border wall.
That's why the lack of progressive optimism is so keenly felt. In recent decades, progressives drank too deeply of instant-doomsday claims. If their predictions had come true, today petroleum would be exhausted, huge numbers of major animal species would be extinct, crop failures would be causing mass starvation, developing-world poverty would be getting worse instead of declining fast. (In 1990, 37 percent of humanity lived in what the World Bank defines as extreme poverty; today it's 10 percent.)
Senator Warren published an op-ed in The Washington Post in 2015 attacking the investor-state dispute settlement clause in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which she argued would tilt the playing field in the United States further in favor of big multinational corporations.
As for the notion that young voters and politicians care more about the future because they have more skin in the game: Show me even one decent parent who doesn't vote with his or her kids in mind. Show me one decent grandparent. I can't see how anyone would invest so much time, money and heart in a child's tomorrow only to ignore that future in the political realm.
The Trump administration came into office with its top legislative priority clear: Repeal the Affordable Care Act. It failed. Then, when a group of Republican states tried to throw out Obamacare through a lawsuit, the administration agreed that a key part of the law was unconstitutional.
No. It's a process. This is an example.
WASHINGTON — Since the 2008 financial crisis, conservative economists and Republican politicians have claimed several policy errors were holding back economic growth and contributing to a painfully slow recovery, including lackluster wage growth. The government was spending too much, it was borrowing too much and it was sowing uncertainty in the business world with expiring tax cuts and other bitter policy battles, they said.
A graduate with a professional degree expects to earn $2.3 million more than a high school graduate. The Brookings Institution's Adam Looney estimated that under Senator Warren's plan the bottom 20 percent of borrowers by income get only 4 percent of the savings.
KK: Lauren, I wanted to make sure we got to you.
Official Washington's fixation on the media is, of course, familiar to anyone who breathes these days. But the administration's filing resonated with something else I've been noticing lately — a meme in conservative media that there is a concerted effort on the liberal side of the ideological street, media and elsewhere, to invoke concern about the Supreme Court's legitimacy as a tool for prying Chief Justice John Roberts away from his conservative soul mates on the court.
But even those issues — narrow, practical and still contentious — point to some of the limits of reform right now. A century ago, reform meant coming up with inspiring new ideas that would lead to greater justice, a confidence that human planning and ingenuity could accomplish grand and transformative things. Now it seems to mean, at best, restrained corrective measures — and far more often than that, actively undoing the policies of the past, an act of hardheaded resignation rather than of collective hope. Reform once promised a future of unparalleled opportunity. Today, it often marks the opposite, a loss of faith in the idea of progress itself.

In the context of protecting Republican control, there's little reason to think that Mr. Ryan would be a liability to Republicans' prospects of holding a majority. A February Politico/Morning Consult poll put Mr. Ryan's national favorability at an anemic 36 percent, but he has not been used — at least to this point — as a high-profile symbolic figure in Democrats' campaigns to retake the House of Representatives. An analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project of roughly 300,000 House and Senate campaign ads aired since January 2017 indicates that unfavorable mentions of Mr. Ryan (1.9 percent of airings) were much less common than negative depictions of President Trump (6 percent) and the minority leader, Nancy Pelosi (9.9 percent).
Those county governments don't like the current system because they have to pay their share out of property taxes. The change would instead require state government to pick up the bill. The result: Either the state will have to find more money, or Medicaid funding could be cut substantially. If this sounds like a weird parochial concern you might not expect in a piece of major federal policy legislation, that's because it is. But its inclusion signals congressional leaders' concerns about securing enough votes for passage. Some similar local policy giveaways were part of the Affordable Care Act. Many had memorable nicknames. On Twitter, possible names for this maneuver have begun circulating.
Yeah, I think that's an extremely accurate way of looking at it. And then you add on to it. You have basically a massive cheering section, cheering you on to oppose your boss and throwing hundreds of millions of dollars at you and providing you unlimited resources to run ads against your boss and do everything you can to obstruct him. I'm taking the analogy too far, but that is what you have, is you don't just have the opportunity to do it, but you have structural factors encouraging you to do it. You have donors demanding that you do it. You have your base demanding that you do it. So it's not just taking the initiative. It's, in many ways, just sort of going with the flow that is already carrying you in that direction of obstruction and sort of legislative sabotage. I think about Merrick Garland in this context and the decision to block him in 2016. Because, look, in retrospect, this turns out to be one of the greatest political gambles, successful gambles, in recent history. But all McConnell was really doing was trying to cover his ass at the time. And people forget that in 2015 and 2016, McConnell was in a lot of trouble. And I think his job as leader was seriously in question. Republicans had just taken back the majority, but that was the only successful election cycle that they'd had under him, aside from 2010.
As far as you can tell, how much is Biden's appeal to black voters solely about his association with Obama? Biden, wisely, has wrapped his arms so tightly around Barack Obama that they're inextricably intertwined, at least in his speeches. He's polling so positively among black people because of the Obama residue. But that could change overnight. I haven't endorsed any candidate, because I have too many friends. Elizabeth Warren was my colleague. I did Bernie Sanders's family tree. In 2018, I got an award in Delaware, along with Joe Biden and Ron Chernow. I spent a whole evening with Biden, and I liked him. All of this is to say that I have been sort of watching the field. But, I mean, I'm going to vote for whatever Democrat emerges. I want to say this right, because I haven't said this to anybody: Among all the candidates, the person who I believe could stand toe-to-toe, strongest and longest with Donald Trump is Mike Bloomberg.
Virtually the entire decrease came in the 39 states that use the marketplace run by the federal government, HealthCare.gov. In the 11 states that sell coverage for the Affordable Care Act — popularly known as Obamacare — through their own marketplaces, enrollment remained the same as last year. Seema Verma, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, congratulated her agency in a Twitter post on the most cost-effective and successful open enrollment to date!
The answer, judging by his words, is no differently than he did before.
Fighting corruption is, indeed, an issue with cross-party support. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last year, people ranked as the country's second most important issue reducing the influence of special interests and corruption in Washington.
The insurance industry, which usually supports tight limits on insurance enrollments, is backing the extra enrollment period now. Around 15 million Americans are uninsured and eligible for marketplace coverage, according to a recent analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Most would qualify for some form of financial assistance if they bought such coverage — and about four million could sign up for a high-deductible plan that would cost them nothing in premiums. For the four million people who could be getting free coverage who are instead uninsured — that, to me, is screaming out for outreach, said Cynthia Cox, a vice president at the foundation and a co-author of the analysis. It remains unclear how many people lost health insurance last year because of the pandemic, but most working-age Americans receive coverage through their employers, and millions have lost jobs. Enrollment in Medicaid, the public health insurance program for the poor and disabled, has grown substantially during the pandemic. And consumer advocates say there are also many Americans who were uninsured before but might want coverage now because of the public health crisis. Several states that run their own marketplaces established special enrollment periods last year and saw increased sign-ups.
That sure gets a lot done.
But is it really about the money? No, it's about the cruelty. Over the past few years it has become increasingly clear that the suffering imposed by Republican opposition to safety-net programs isn't a bug, it's a feature. Inflicting pain is the point.
We are rightly proud of the high standards of medical care we know how to provide in the United States.
The Obama administration frequently published information about enrollment in the official marketplaces, where more than 80 percent of customers qualified for subsidies each year. But researchers had been relying on informal estimates from the insurance industry about enrollment from those who bought coverage directly. The new report provides more official numbers on those who bought insurance themselves. It shows that signups among people who didn't use a subsidy fell by 1.3 million people between 2016 and 2017, the most recent year with full data.
By the way, some people seem surprised by the administration's moves here, since Donald Trump has promised many times to protect people with pre-existing conditions. But remember: The campaign against the Affordable Care Act has been based on lies every step of the way.
This appears to be a misrepresented statistic. A 2019 report from the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University found that the median white student borrower has paid back 94 percent of his or her student debt, while the median black student borrower has paid back 5 percent. Read the report here.
So my plan to forgive student loan debt is capped at $50,000 and an income of $250,000. And the reason for that is because it is the best way, not only to give maximum forgiveness to a lot of people who are struggling, but it also helps close the black-white wealth gap, and is part of the reason that the N.A.A.C.P. endorsed it along with the other parts I was doing about investment in our colleges. But I really worked through hard on these numbers to deal with exactly that question and that's why I got the numbers where they are. I don't think they raise that same issue. I'm not ——
Gloria Hernandez knew it best for something else: Working there meant she could become a member of the Culinary Union, which would give her medical benefits that were far better than what her husband had through his job.
You know, this is a hard hypothetical to take on until you actually know what's happening. Again, you've got to back this one up on where we should have started. When the unrest first started unfolding in Hong Kong, for Donald Trump to step back and say in effect, gee, I think China's going to crack down on Hong Kong, and effectively inviting it, I think is the wrong place for the United States to be. I think that we should have been in a position from the beginning, saying to China, we support these efforts in Hong Kong. That's part one.
CLINTON: ... before the invasion, he supported it. And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it. Google Donald Trump Iraq. And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq.
Yeah. I think we need to bring our combat troops home.
Well, I think that's part of the story. I would broaden it a little to say that the threat of communism for more than half a century, and really from the beginnings of the modern conservative movement in the 1950s, say, the danger of communism organized Republican thinking about both foreign and domestic issues. Certainly, it unified the party around a fairly aggressive stance in the Cold War, especially after the Nixon years and into the Reagan years, where Republicans moved from a party of detente to a party of confrontation and rollback. But the opposition to communism also organized the domestic coalition in a variety of ways. Opposing communism meant defending religious traditionalism. It meant opposing a kind of threat that was, at the very least, secularizing, if not atheistic. And so the party became a home for Christian conservatives over the decades, gradually, slowly. Opposing communism meant making the case for capitalism, and the party became the home of the case for capitalism, gradually, of market thinking, and not just about global economic affairs, but about domestic policy. And so there were certainly a lot of ways in which understanding the American situation is fundamentally oriented by the challenge of communism. It gave a logic to the Republican coalition that helped it take shape. I think the Democratic party was much less organized around that question and much more organized around the character of American society itself, and the question of the Soviets was just never as central an organizing principle.
For now, I'd only nominate him for the Ignoble Prize. It's given to the leader who uses his presidential prerogatives to undermine the personal security of his citizens and values of his nation in more ways in just one year than any leader before him.
Such restrictions are central to Republican efforts to profoundly change Medicaid, the safety net program that has provided free health insurance to tens of millions of low-income Americans for more than 50 years. The ballooning deficits created by the budget deal that President Trump signed into law Friday and the recent tax bill are likely to add urgency to the party's attempts to wring savings from entitlement programs.
On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he would remain in the job as long as that is appropriate after Mr. Trump criticized him for recusing himself in the Russia investigation.
It is a big improvement from the last recession, he said, when he became uninsured for several years after losing his job and getting divorced. But for Mr. Exum, 53, the law is imperfect.
But Democratic leaders appeared to be focused less on the substance of the measures than on their likely demise in the Republican-controlled Senate.
And that's the next few years, but it's very much a party wrestling over its own identity.
KK: O.K., the Electoral College is really important to Jesse. So much of the biggest change in recent years has come through the Supreme Court. Who would be your Supreme Court nominees?
Mr. Looney, of the Brookings Institution, estimated that the benefits from Senator Warren's plans are skewed — he estimated that borrowers with advanced degrees will claim 37 percent of the annual benefits, while representing only 27 percent of borrowers overall.
So it is with budget policy. Get this: Since 1977, the three presidential administrations that have overseen the deficit increases are the three Republican ones. President Trump's tax cut is virtually assured to make him the fourth of four. And the three administrations that have overseen deficit reductions are the three Democratic ones, including a small decline under Barack Obama. If you want to know whether a post-1976 president increased or reduced the deficit, the only thing you need to know is his party.

Beware the glass cliff. Ms. Fraser will be the first woman to lead a major American bank. Given Citi's faltering fortunes, she will contend with the perception — backed by research — that women are more likely than men to be given tough cleanup jobs when promoted to top roles, setting them up for failure. (See also: Ginni Rometty at IBM and Mary Barra at G.M.) Here's what Ms. Fraser had to say:
Right. Which comes first, the values that say that health care is a right, or the national health care system that dictates that? And from everything you've described, something like 80 years of U.S. history suggests that there has not been an appetite for this kind of a system. So the only way it would work is if we believe, right, that the system could come first and the values would flow from it.

Senator Warren, then a Harvard professor, first introduced the idea of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in a 2007 paper in the journal Democracy. President Obama assigned her to build the agency after the 2008 financial crisis.
I'm Ezra Klein, and this is The Ezra Klein Show. [MUSIC PLAYING] There's a book I've been thinking about a lot lately. It's by Daniel Ziblatt, who's a Harvard political scientist, and it's called Conservative Parties and the Birth of Democracy. And what he shows in that book is that democracies live or die based on how responsible their conservative parties are. [MUSIC PLAYING] In particular, the question is whether the center right quarantines the anti-democratic far right, in which case democracies tend to live and thrive, or it allies with them, in which case, the far right often takes over and democracies often fall. We are in that kind of moment right now. There is a rising far right that has become explicitly, dangerously anti-democratic. It will not be stopped by the Democratic Party because it does not care what the Democratic Party thinks, and it does not rely on the Democratic Party's voters for its support. It will not be stopped by the mainstream media because it doesn't care what the media says about it. It will either be stopped by more sober members of the Republican Party, it be purged by them, as has happened before, or it will take over the Republican Party. And right now, right now it feels like it is taking over the Republican Party. The most important division between the parties right now is not over deficit reduction or capital gains taxation or the proper role of government in the health care system.
Government, declared Ronald Reagan in his first Inaugural Address, is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem. Republicans have echoed his rhetoric ever since. Somehow, though, they've never followed through on the radical downsizing of government their ideology calls for.
In an email, Starr described these developments as a genuine puzzle.
The administration would drastically change the way states are allocated funding for programs that support disadvantaged K-12 students. The budget proposes consolidating 29 programs into a $19.4 billion block grant that would dispense funding to states, who would then determine how to use it. Among the programs that would be zeroed out to fund the grant are 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which funds after-school programs for low-income students; funding for programs in rural schools and magnet schools; and funding for homeless and migrant students.
When I was a girl, you had a better than 50/50 chance of doing better than your parents. Today, that seems to be slipping under a 1-in-10 chance. Opportunity is shifting away from not just the poor kids. It's shifting away from everybody who's not born into the top. And sure, a few people roll the dice and make it big and we should celebrate that, but it's like this fundamental question of who we're going to be as a country. And yeah, I do fight for a lot of things. I fight for a big vision, but if we don't start there, if we start by compromising, if we start by saying, Hey, everybody line up. We're going to knock 2 cents off your student loan debt, who's showing up for that?
The first presidency is mostly real; the second presidency has been mostly imaginary ever since the failure of Obamacare repeal left Ryanism neutered. Trump hasn't done some of the biggest heterodox things he promised (an infrastructure bill, most notably). But he has ended austerity budgeting, ignored entitlement reform, reformed Obamacare around the edges while leaving its coverage guarantee intact, embraced protectionism and jawboned the Federal Reserve to be more inflationary.
The House of Representatives approved the nearly $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan this afternoon — a landmark moment for President Biden. The plan, which passed without any Republican votes, will send direct payments of up to $1,400 to many Americans, expand a child tax credit and extend a $300 weekly unemployment supplement. Mr. Biden is expected to sign the bill into law on Friday.
The Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee rebuffed calls to recuse himself from the panel's investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election.
President Obama's health care battles foreshadow some of what Senator Warren might face in trying to institute her single-payer system. Mr. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in March 2010 after a protracted fight in Congress, and by November 2011 the Supreme Court had agreed to hear a case challenging its constitutionality.

Bashing Obamacare instantly became a winning Republican message — an indictment of its polarizing namesake, of big-spending Democrats and of the boogeyman of creeping socialism all rolled into one. During the 2010 midterm election cycle, opponents of the A.C.A. spent $108 million on ads pillorying it. As a reward to the 87 Republican freshmen whose victories had enabled the party to retake the House, Eric Cantor devoted part of his first day as the House majority leader to introducing H.R. 2, the Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act. It would become the first of more than 50 bills that would pass the House over the ensuing four years designed to repeal, defund, restrict or delay implementation of Obamacare. None of them stood any chance of becoming a law — they were dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate. But to Heritage Action, they served a purpose: in the organization's parlance, to lock in members, to orient the Republican Party to conservative principles so that it would do the right thing.
In a sense, he uses the notion of relevance as a catch-all.

Her financing plan drew heavy fire as misguided and unrealistic, including from some of her Democratic competitors. Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign dismissed it as mathematical gymnastics, while Mr. Sanders charged it wasn't progressive enough and would have a very negative impact on creating jobs. Around this time, Ms. Warren's poll numbers and fund-raising took a turn for the worse.
Attempts to restart the economy even though the pandemic is far from controlled will lead to many more deaths, and will probably backfire even in purely economic terms as states are forced to lock down again.
One week after the Kentucky primary was conducted, The A.P. declared Ms. McGrath the winner after a campaign that was shaped by the coronavirus pandemic and protests against racial injustice. She narrowly defeated Charles Booker, an African-American state lawmaker who harnessed anger over a pair of fatal shootings by the authorities in Louisville to roar into contention in the final weeks of the campaign.
SS: So you mean getting rid of the combat troops there now, or preclude sending any combat troops there in the future?
I have not heard that, nor do I believe it's accurate, Mr. Azar said. There are many major providers that are providing insurance packages and frankly making a ton of money off of providing in the Obamacare markets.
Senator Warren introduced the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act in August 2018, which includes provisions to block government officials from becoming lobbyists, bar federal judges from owning stocks and more, all to be overseen by a new Office of Public Integrity. Much of what's outlined in that bill made its way into Senator Warren's campaign plan to end Washington corruption.
It was a big political discussion in a very small room.
They principally try to appeal to voters using small d democratic ideals — the general, basic American principle that everyone should be given the easiest access to vote. They try to appeal to people through public health measures, noting how unsafe it is for people to gather at polls. But when you ask folks in Democratic circles, they know that when the electorate expands, particularly in national and statewide elections, that's usually good news for Democrats.
No, but look. All right, so what do you want to do? You want just give up? Say, Aw, gee, Mitch McConnell ….  Let's go get the begging bowl and say give me a crumb or two, and I will say thank you. That's what it means now to be a Democrat to the party in opposition.
It'll be free for anybody who's under 18. It'll be free for a family of four making less than $50,000 a year, and it will have a small price for everyone else. This is the advantage to having already identified how you can pay for this.
Well, the way I've thought about it is that Trump exploded an old Republican synthesis program and agenda, without really replacing it with anything coherent and fleshed out. So, the Republicans are left in a state of disorientation and don't really know what they stand for and are feeling their way forward in that respect. The divergence you're talking about between, let's say, the donor base and the voting base of the Republican Party, there's always been a difference, as there is in the Democratic Party. I think that divergence got a little bit wider during the Obama years. And it's not just a matter of interest groups within the Republican Party. I think it's also intellectually, the Republican agenda became further and further detached from reality, because it wasn't adapting with the times and it was still keyed towards the circumstances of America in 1981. So, I go on this tangent a little bit, because there is this tendency, sometimes, to think of the history of conservatism as though Obama-era conservatism is the way it was always. But in some ways that extremely anti-government and somewhat rigid and doctrinaire economic libertarianism was unusual for the Republican Party. It wasn't the way the party was under Reagan, or under George W. Bush. And so, in some ways, Trump was a correction to an aberration that got the party back in an odd way towards more of its historical self definition.
These are the fights we need to have. These are the fights we should be bringing forward. We don't bring those fights forward. We — oh, well, we could — around the edge a little bit. Then we're just going to be the ones who stood by while America became fundamentally a country that lost even a hope that all the kids would have opportunity. That we just extinguish that and say, Nope. Better be born into it, because that's the only way to make it in America. That's not the America I want to see.

The answer is that both are indicators of how Trump views his job. He doesn't seem to see actual policymaking as important; instead, he treats it all as an exercise in reality TV.
Governors of several states also asked the administration to grant a special enrollment period, including Republican governors in Arizona and New Hampshire, and Democratic ones in Oregon, Michigan and New Jersey.
On a Saturday afternoon in early December, inside a soaring auditorium on the campus of Stockholm University, William Nordhaus gave the crowning lecture of his half-century career as an economist. The occasion was his acceptance of the Nobel Prize in economics, which Nordhaus, a trim, soft-spoken Yale professor, had been jointly awarded. The title of the lecture was Climate Change: The Ultimate Challenge for Economics.
Britain was roiled by economic and demographic changes. There were financial crises, bad harvests and a severe depression. There was crushing inequality. The average life expectancy nationwide was 40, but in the industrial cities of Manchester and Liverpool it was around 28. There were widespread riots and government crackdowns. In 1819, 1,206 radicals were given the death sentence, though only 108 of them were executed.
They were, until the virus intensifies in the state and cases increase. As the deaths increase, that's when you see a real shift from the governor.

The arguments did reveal some tensions between the Republican states that brought the case, led by Texas, and Mr. Trump's Justice Department. For example, a lawyer for Texas took issue with a puzzling new Justice Department position — revealed in a May brief — that the ruling should apply only in the 18 plaintiff states, not nationwide. The Republican states would need to evaluate if they had been the victim of a bait and switch, said the Texas lawyer, Kyle D. Hawkins.
And what about putting a price on carbon?
At the same time, I think that the kinds of people who were uncomfortable with the Affordable Care Act, who were uncomfortable with some of these more universal health care systems in the past think it's sort of a laughable idea. It's really, really far from where we are right now, it's far from anything that's really been debated in a serious way in the Congress, and it would be extremely expensive to implement. It would require huge tax increases. And that is the kind of political debate that doesn't typically get very far when it's outside the confines of a campaign.
archived recording (tony evers) And here is the bottom line — folks need to start taking this seriously. So today I'm asking for your help.
There are certainly bills that have been killed by Democratic filibusters in this Congress — just as there was legislation torpedoed by Republican obstruction during the Obama administration. The need to overcome a filibuster in the Senate on spending bills, and the influence that gives Democrats, was a primary cause of the protracted budget conflict that produced a brief government shutdown in January.
And guess what? Despite breathless coverage of the daily outrage generator in the White House, the economy is improving. The tax cuts will, and in fact already are, spurring growth, freeing capital for investment, creating jobs and returning overseas profits to our shores. There is a message to sell. So sell it.
The House on Thursday passed a new version of a healthcare bill after the first one in March failed to get enough Republican support. This time, the debate hinged on Americans with pre-existing conditions. Here's a look at how the whole dynamic played out over the last few days: Republican leaders scrambled to scrape up support from two house republican factions: the conservative Freedom Caucus, and the more moderate Tuesday Group. Two new amendments were tacked on, making it palatable to both. The first amendment includes a waiver for states to opt out of covering patients with pre-existing conditions, a win for the Freedom Caucus. Democrats were quick to jump on this. Pelosi: This is deadly. Trumpcare means heart-stopping premium increases from anything from asthma to cancer and the list goes on along the alphabet and no Band-aid amendment will fix it. And then it was the moderates' turn to balk. They made it clear they wouldn't vote for it. Fred Upton (radio intv on Tuesday): I've supported the practice of not allowing pre-existing illnesses to be discriminated against from the very get-go. This amendment torpedoes that. It's not going to get my Yes vote the way that it is. (assuming we'll ID him and party affiliation w/ L3) Billy Long: I was always for the underlying bill. When they made what I consider the change to pre-existing conditions, that's when I said I'm a no. But by Wednesday, they had a solution.

Ms. Greene supported the QAnon movement and other conspiracies. Reporter: Madam Speaker, I want to ask you about Marjorie Taylor Greene. How concerned are you about her past posts, remarks, rhetoric — what would you like to see done about her? What I'm concerned about is the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives, who was willing to overlook, ignore those statements, assigning her to the Education Committee when she has mocked the killing of little children at Sandy Hook Elementary school. When she has mocked the killing of teenagers in high school at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school. What could they be thinking or is thinking too generous a word for what they might be doing? It's absolutely appalling. And I think that the focus has to be on the Republican leadership of this House of Representatives for the disregard they have for the death of those children. It's just beyond any understanding of any regard that the House Republicans would have for the House of Representatives, for the Congress of the United States and for the heartbreak of the families.
And that's what I admired the most about you. If you could go to Vietnam and forgive them, anybody could. If you could work with Obama, anybody could. And I want to stay in this guy's orbit.
It's a full plate, with long odds. For starters, how does a president who sees the essential goodness in everyone deal with a party whose base doesn't even believe in the legitimacy of his presidency? How does he bring the conspiracy theorists back to planet Earth, and cool the tribal passions that fueled the insurrection on Jan. 6?
BA: What is the right stance?
These dreams have not come to pass.
Senator Warren has proposed using the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice to undo anti-competitive mergers currently in place, then passing legislation designating companies worth more than $25 billion in revenue as platform utilities.
He went on to instruct listeners to go on the offensive if journalists asked about the case. The people asking the questions — those are the racists, he said. I would go at 'em.
In October, Senator Warren's campaign bought ads that read: Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election. The campaign was intended as a critique of Facebook's decision not to fact-check or remove political ads. (Updated) Facebook did not remove from the social network the ad falsely endorsing Mr. Trump.
But I take your question seriously. The place I might be most likely to fail is to get only part. Now, part's better than none, right? But only part. And that's a deeply worrisome thought.
The new statistics come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which monitors the number of Americans with and without health insurance every quarter. A smaller survey from Gallup had shown the uninsured rate rising last year. And a survey from the Commonwealth Fund showed a small rise, though it was statistically insignificant. But the C.D.C. research includes a larger sample size, and is generally regarded as a more definitive study. Tuesday's study contains data from the entire calendar year of 2017.
He made clear his influence in a pair of stunning decisions on Thursday, joining the court's liberal wing in one and his fellow conservatives in the other. In providing the decisive votes and writing the majority opinions in cases on the census and partisan gerrymandering, he demonstrated that he has unquestionably become the court's ideological fulcrum after the departure last year of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.
After the indictment was released, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House, called for Mr. Acosta to resign. Attorney General William Barr recused himself from the case, saying his former law firm had represented Mr. Epstein.
Time is of the essence, and reconciliation moves fast.
The study's senior author, Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg, a sports medicine physician with a doctorate in epidemiology, said the fact that no teachers or other staff members appeared to have been infected in school was very, very reassuring. But others, including allies of teachers' unions who oppose reopening before educators have been vaccinated, are already arguing that the study's findings should not be widely applied. The study setting was rural, and the students in the schools were mostly white. But it wasn't obvious that the conditions in the schools were very different than those in urban districts. Students ate and attended classes indoors. The students, who ranged from kindergartners to 12th graders, were in small, stable groupings of 11 to 20 students. Not all districts that have reopened created such small class settings. But in most urban districts that have reopened, only a fraction of students have returned in person, so class sizes are generally small — 9 to 12 students in New York City, for instance. On CNN on Tuesday night, President Biden's chief of staff, Ron Klain, said the study's take-home message was that schools could open safely when they had an infusion of money to do so. Mr. Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion package, which needs Congressional approval, that includes funding for reopening schools. The president is a close ally of teachers unions, which have been calling for major government investments in making schools safer. The Wisconsin districts received a $150,000 grant to purchase cloth masks for all students.
Individuals with Democratic congressional representatives experience a fundamentally different type of representation than do individuals with Republican representatives. Individuals with Democratic representatives encounter a mode of representation best described as populist.
President Obama's health care battles foreshadow some of what Senator Warren might face in trying to institute her single-payer system. Mr. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in March 2010 after a protracted fight in Congress, and by November 2011 the Supreme Court had agreed to hear a case challenging its constitutionality.
But while Trump is willing to run trillion-dollar deficits to give giant tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy, he's as determined as the rest of his party to make life harder for the less fortunate. The grand plan to repeal Obamacare fell just short, but the administration is supporting a court challenge that could declare the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. It is also supporting things like work requirements for food stamps and block grants that would de facto lead to major cuts in Medicaid compared with current law.

There's also health policy, where Trump, having failed to repeal Obamacare — which would have been a huge blow to working families — has engaged instead in a campaign of sabotage that has probably raised premiums by almost 20 percent relative to what they would have been otherwise. Inevitably, the burden of these higher premiums falls most heavily on families earning just a bit too much to be eligible for subsidies, that is, the upper part of the working class.
Then, J.F.K. made a big move to try to expand government health insurance, at least for the elderly.
I don't know anybody who's afraid of the 2-cent wealth tax who isn't already a billionaire.
Yeah, I can imagine. Nobody ever wants to answer this probably. To try this, you've got to have an optimism bias. And I do. I know that. It's an optimism bias that keeps me working 14 hours a day. It's an optimism bias that pulls you in more and more people to try to talk about it.
Gail: Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio have been hearing the restaurants' howls of pain for months now, and the last thing they wanted to do was postpone the next stage of reopenings. I give them a lot of credit for making the hard choice.
Limits on the amount of care covered
Oh, right, Steve Daines, yeah, he went on a sort of America, love it or leave it kind of thing. Yeah. But I think, in general, the Republican response is either a kind of condemnation, like the one Romney gave that is not as strenuous as it should be, or a kind of let's pretend Trump didn't say that and just say, yeah, Trump's right that it's bad that these Democrats are socialists.
Actually, I've done 175 stump speeches and I've talked about it in every one of them. You all haven't covered it. I talk about three things that I think we need to do ——
OXNARD, Calif. — Kevin de León is one of the most prominent Democratic figures in the nation's most Democratic state. He has drawn national attention from the Democratic left for a spirited challenge to Senator Dianne Feinstein and for the aggressive legislative challenges to President Trump's policies advanced by the State Senate under his leadership.
And Trump's tariffs suffer politically because some Americans are already being hurt, while the supposed beneficiaries have good reason to doubt whether they will be helped. In fact, even as Trump boasts that his steel tariffs have revived the industry, two major steelworker unions have voted to go on strike — because while corporate profits have surged, workers' wages haven't.
Exactly. A 2-cent wealth tax just means if you don't lift a finger, your fortune only grows at 4 percent, 6 percent, 8 percent. And yet how many people in this country who are so sophisticated and knowledgeable — right — say you could never get a wealth tax because the billionaires and millionaires won't let it happen? Well, what the hell? This is a democracy.
The Justice Department's argument is based on an established legal principle called severability, under which courts ask whether if one provision of a statute is struck down, the rest should fall with it. But in this case, the Justice Department gets that principle exactly backward. An unbroken line of Supreme Court cases makes clear that the touchstone of severability is congressional intent. In a decision handed down by the Supreme Court just months ago, Justice Samuel Alito explained — quoting a long-established precedent for severability — that for a court to conclude that other provisions of a statute must fall, it must be clear that Congress would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of those that are to be struck down. In other words, what would Congress have done had it known a provision of the statute would be eliminated?
I'm not going to do names. That's enormously presumptuous.
The long sweep of American history is filled with presidential elections that took place during times of war and upheaval, but there is little modern precedent for a campaign unfolding against a backdrop of such widespread national fear.
The number of uninsured will grow by 24 million in 10 years.
Senator Warren published an op-ed in The Washington Post in 2015 attacking the investor-state dispute settlement clause in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which she argued would tilt the playing field in the United States further in favor of big multinational corporations.
And I came here to talk with you all about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And the very short version of this story is I went around Washington talking to people about how, do not in this crisis, simply outlaw the practices that were bad, that were used on the mortgages, that are used on credit cards, because they'll be like fence posts on the prairie with nothing strong in between. And it'll take the banks and Wall Street about three minutes to figure out how to run around them by redescribing their product or slightly reinventing their product. I think you've got to have an agency that when Wall Street moves, the agency can move. That's how financial crises — it's the only way we're going to make this work.
When you get the job you don't think of this in terms of: 'OK, I'm a woman getting a job,' she said. You think about: What is it that the company needs today? What needs to be the same? I certainly have a different style, but I don't think it's necessarily so much gender related.
Recent polling from Asian American Decisions shows that in 2018 Asian-Americans intend to vote Democratic by more than 2 to 1, overwhelmingly supporting taxing the wealthy, protecting Obamacare and increasing the minimum wage.
LK: There's a growing problem of harassment and trespassing at abortion clinics.
The new sign-ups — an increase of 400,000 over a similar point last year — mean the health care coverage of millions of consumers could be imperiled by one of the first legislative actions of Donald J. Trump's presidency. Hundreds of thousands of other people who took no action will be automatically re-enrolled by the federal government in the same or similar plans, officials said, and their coverage could be threatened as well. Consumers still have until the end of January to enroll.
Whether we're talking about workers or we're talking about the environment, who has to meet what standards? And there are big corporations who figured out how to game the system. Where standards are high, then move that part of the operation somewhere else where standards are low and save a nickel. Because these corporations, they don't have any loyalty to a country, they just have loyalty to their own bottom line. And they play this all around the world.
I have not heard that, nor do I believe it's accurate, Mr. Azar said. There are many major providers that are providing insurance packages and frankly making a ton of money off of providing in the Obamacare markets.
The 2017 tax cut, which did away with the individual mandate — the penalty for noninsurance — weakened the system; you can see this by the fact that states, like New Jersey, that imposed their own mandates saw a drop in insurance premiums. But the design of the subsidies, which insulated most people from rising premiums, contained the damage: The percentage of Americans without health insurance, which fell sharply as a result of Obamacare, remains near record lows.
Michael Conway, who served as counsel for the house Judiciary Committee during the Nixon impeachment inquiry, said President Nixon also tried to deny the investigators access to key materials, but Mr. Trump has gone a step further. Mr. Conway said, Nixon was equally resistant to turning materials over and documents, but he did allow people to testify.

And that leaves the G.O.P. very, very frustrated.
Bernie Sanders endorsed you. How do you compare your results with his throughout the state? He ran far behind you. What did you do that the progressive on the national ticket did not?
KK: So who would be your running mate?
The importance of a grass-roots movement is there is one thing that beats fake news, and actually the data showed this, and that's somebody you know. It's somebody who actually talks to you. It's somebody who does the face to face. It's somebody who reaches out. It's somebody who knocks on your door. It's your neighbor. It's the person who talks to you in line at the grocery store. That's part of it. It's why you have to build — when I did inside/outside, it's also about the importance of building grass roots, building it from the ground up. It's why I made the decisions I made in running for president right from the beginning, which we can talk about in a minute. But for me, that's at the heart of it, and then there's a second part. I'll push first to get the anti-corruption bill through. I'll push to deliver on a meaningful anti-corruption deal. I think you can get a lot of people on board for that, Democrats and Republicans to push for it. I dare you to vote against it, right? That is a fight I will have, and it will be a fight.
So let me push back on what your theory of change is, because the way the Affordable Care Act worked is we passed it, and then it was four years later when the benefits came in, and they kind of bumped into place, right? Look at it the other way around. What I propose is as many people can get into it as want to get into it, and then once they're in, try taking it away from them, because that's what the fight then shifts to. How did we end up hanging on to the Affordable Care Act when the Republicans had the House, the Senate and the White House? The answer was we ended up hanging on to it because enough people across this country said, You're not going to take this away from me.
There really, I think, is also just a language problem here, something I've been reflecting on in this debate, because I'm uncomfortable with it. On the one hand, I support a lot of the decisions that were made. And I wrote a Twitter thread about this because everything is recursively eating its own tail in this conversation. Trump left people with no good choices. Hard cases make bad law, and Trump was a very, very hard case, as was Parler, by the way, in the way it was positioning itself in that aftermath moment. And for societies and systems to work well, you need people to abide by certain norms and disciplines and restraints, and they didn't. And so everybody was put in a position where there were no good options. But one thing I kept seeing in this is how much I think the free speech language ends up confusing both sides. So you'll see people on the right say, they're stifling free speech. And then somebody on left will say, this is not a First Amendment issue. It's not free speech. The First Amendment does not give you access to algorithmic lift on Facebook, and then kind of think they've rebutted the argument. But it was never a free speech issue, but it is an issue. It's a corporate power issue. To some degree, it got turned into a corporate social responsibility issue and an employee retention issue inside the companies themselves, if you look at their decision-making process.
The impulse to create a highly centralized superstate recurs throughout American history. There were people writing such grand master plans in the 1880s, the 1910s, the 1930s. They never work out. As Richard Weaver once put it, the problem with the next generation is that it hasn't read the minutes of the last meeting.
We had a fire, and the fire there was millions of people who lost their homes, but the fire by itself doesn't get it done. The fire by itself wasn't enough. You had to be ready with the big structural change and had to have somebody from the inside who would fight for it.
KK: O.K., the Electoral College is really important to Jesse. So much of the biggest change in recent years has come through the Supreme Court. Who would be your Supreme Court nominees?
archived recording (nancy pelosi) This is actually an opportunity for us to speak to the American people with clarity. archived recording (chuck schumer) It's a stark reminder of the difference between our two parties. Democrats are fighting to expand and improve health care coverage and lower costs while Republicans are trying to take it all away and raise costs.
If the standard in judging the Democratic Party is whether it would support a radical upheaval vastly expanding the federal government, Rhodes continued, then
Slightly, slightly is not the right word — extremely passive-aggressive yet effective and terrifying figure.
Senator Warren's anti-corruption plan includes provisions to extend conflict-of-interest laws to the president and vice president, compel government to divest from privately owned assets and restrict the ability of lobbyists to be hired for government jobs. It takes aim in particular at many of the practices that the Trump family has used to profit from office, which The Times has editorialized against.
Henry Louis Gates Jr. is one of a handful of academics who have crossed over into something approaching true celebrity. Which is apparently what happens when you've written and edited dozens of books of popular history; had a guiding hand in 18 major documentaries on black history, the most recent of which was Who Killed Malcom X?; and spent six seasons uncovering the genealogical mysteries of famous people as host of PBS's Finding Your Roots. Gates's desire to reach beyond the ivory tower — in addition to writing landmark works of literary criticism like The Signifying Monkey, he's the director of Harvard's Hutchins Center for African and African-American Research — was motivated by some very personal feelings. My brother asked me once, says Gates, 69, recalling a time when he and his work were less well known, 'When are you going to write a book that Daddy and Mama can read?'

Michael Oreskes, NPR's senior president for news, supported the decision. In an article on the NPR website, Mr. Oreskes said that the minute you start branding things with a word like 'lie,' you push people away from you. The inherent risk, he suggested, was that news organizations would be seen as taking sides.
First, anyone expecting bipartisanship in dealing with the aftermath of the Mueller report — in particular, anyone suggesting that Democrats should wait for G.O.P. support before proceeding with investigations that might lead to impeachment — is being deluded. Trump is giving the Republican establishment what it wants, and it will stick with him no matter what.

Tying is an arrangement where to buy one product, a consumer also has to buy a different product from a separate market. An example the F.T.C. offers is a drugmaker that required all consumers buying its medicine for schizophrenia to also buy its blood-monitoring service. The Supreme Court has treated the practice as illegal in the past, but more recently lower courts have permitted it under the more flexible rule of reason.
I mean, one of the main ways we can kind of recognize this as a society and the importance of language for people who have worries about it is for cisgender people to start adopting this. I didn't think exactly that what I was advocating was to use language to change politics as much as language has to reflect how our culture and politics are changing. And the culture is changing, and we really have to match the language or at least turn out some wrinkles in the language in order to match how people feel and how the language reflects how they feel.

Right. So I've identified pay-fors, and I lay out that if you want, you can get into it, and you've got a three-year period to be able to do it at a deeply subsidized price or at no price at all.
Robinhood, a popular app that targets everyday users by offering no-fee trading and a user-friendly process, said yesterday morning that it was limiting purchases of the kinds of securities that prompted the GameStop rally. This caused GameStop's stock value to plummet (it later regained value in after-hours trading) and led to an outcry from politicians in both parties, who were eager to get on the right side of what they called obvious Wall Street hypocrisy.
And we should think about how it could better serve us in a time when we are divided, in a time when power does shift back and forth. There are a lot of ways that Congress could work better. There are a lot of ways to think about how to change the electoral system and other things. And I don't think that requires empowering narrow minorities to get their way and then after the next election, the next narrow minority reverses what they've done. I think we want more durable policy change, and I do think it's achievable. [MUSIC PLAYING]
But he didn't get rid of it under Trump. Trump wanted to get rid of it, and he said no.

I was feeling bad about my shoes at a fancy cocktail lounge the other night while talking to a woman I know. She is, I am pretty sure, greater-than-slash-equal to me in terms of poverty.

That's a really nice bag, I said, taking a sip of my light bill. Did you recently receive a settlement of some kind? She laughed heartily and poured her Obamacare deductible down her throat in one long swallow. Girl, naw, I bought this with money I should've spent on my car payment.

Alex Kingsbury: The Trump administration has made an effort to get Europeans to pay more for their own defense as being part of NATO. Is that a goal that you support even if you don't support the way he's going about it? And how might you achieve those goals?
You can take it through a constitutional amendment if you think it needs a constitutional amendment.
Since scolding member nations at the 2017 summit, Mr. Trump has followed up with strongly worded letters to NATO nations advising that if they don't increase their payments, it will be increasingly hard to justify why American soldiers continue to sacrifice their lives overseas.
Much more worrisome for those of us who think the country needs a blue wave in 2018 is the way Mr. Trump's strategy appears to be raising his job approval ratings and closing the enthusiasm gap with Democrats that has been a critical element in the handful of off-year elections since 2016. Any wave election worth its salt — like the 1974 Watergate cleansing, the 1994 Gingrich revolution or the 2010 Tea Party shellacking — is produced by the elevated energy and enthusiasm of one party and the demoralization and fracturing of the other.
When Ms. Nixon first emerged on the scene in March, Mr. Cuomo had found himself seemingly responding to her every move. Her campaign gleefully branded it #TheCynthiaEffect, as he moved toward legalizing marijuana, for example, or presided over Democrats reuniting in Albany after years of division that had helped empower Republicans.
March 4, 2020, 1:58 a.m. ET March 4, 2020, 1:58 a.m. ET Nick Corasaniti and Lines to vote in Texas were horrific. Poll closures were probably a factor. AUSTIN — The lines at polling places across Texas have been horrific: Five hours after the polls were supposed to close, some people who got in line before the cutoff are still waiting to vote. As of 1 a.m. Eastern time, some polls were still open, but even the Texas secretary of state's office could not say how many. Only county-level officials could provide that information, the office said. There are 254 counties in Texas. Several factors are involved here, including the sheer length of some of Texas' ballots: As Michael Li, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program, noted on Twitter, voters had to pick not just a presidential candidate, but also nominees for a slew of congressional, state and local races. But a major contributor is this simple fact: Texas officials have closed some 750 polling places since the Supreme Court overturned a key part of the Voting Rights Act in 2013. And most of those polling places — 542, to be specific — were in the 50 counties that gained the most black and Latino residents, according to an analysis by The Guardian.
But the House legislation and the remdesivir announcement once again put a spotlight on the cost of health care as a political and economic issue. While the House bill has no chance of passing the Republican-led Senate, Democrats — who reclaimed the House majority in 2018 on a promise to lower health costs and expand access — intend to use it to reprise that playbook in November.
In filing the brief, the administration abandoned an earlier position — that some portions of the law, including the provision allowing states to expand their Medicaid programs, should stand. The switch, which the administration disclosed in late March, has confounded many people in Washington, even within the Republican Party, who came to realize that health insurance and a commitment to protecting the A.C.A. were among the main issues that propelled Democrats to a majority in the House of Representatives last fall.

Kelly Mays, an English professor who said she favored Ms. Klobuchar and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, called it a little frightening that you can buy your way in at this late date. Standing in line to vote on Sunday afternoon, she said she thought Ms. Warren's chances in Nevada were probably not great, but I also think people are counting her out way too early.
I like markets. I believe that capitalism can produce enormous value. But capitalism without rules is theft, and one of those rules should be progressive taxation. Everybody pays their fair share. And one of those rules should be you don't get to crush the opposition. That's not how markets work. And that's a battle we had at the end of the 1800s and into the early 1900s, and it's a battle we need to have again. The giants have grown and they exercise so much economic power, but they also exercise too much political power.
Advocacy for this year's progressive causes by a number of the Democratic presidential candidates has become a source of anxiety for some well-respected, mainstream Democrats.
The rapid reduction in the number of uninsured Americans has shifted the political debate about health reform. In 2009, many Republicans were comfortable with a status quo in which many Americans couldn't get health care. Now, Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress have said their plans could cover as many people as the Affordable Care Act, although a recent C.B.O. analysis disagreed.
If you are a giant multinational corporation and any regulation comes along that you don't like, the local country raises the minimum — we've actually seen this — raises its environmental standards, you get to sue them to get them to drop those standards. And who will your case be heard by? It'll be heard by a handful of corporate lawyers, who when they're not sitting on this arbitration panel are working for big law firms that are doing work for you or other multinational corporations like you. That's one set of how the path will run.
Long before the pandemic, state and especially local health departments were way underfunded, Abby said. We saw the effects of that over the past year. Local health departments are going to have so much work to continue doing, moving forward, to prevent flare-ups of the virus and keep this kind of thing from happening again.
There's also a time to look to, a period of institution-building at the end of the 19th century, early 20th century in America, where actually, people started universities because they were unhappy with Harvard and Yale. And those universities, fairly quickly, became elite universities. Johns Hopkins, University of Chicago, Stanford, Duke all came around in that era and for those reasons. But it wouldn't be an easy thing to start a research university where you would actually want your own kids to go. It's just very hard to do. And so I think conservatives have found that rather than create alternative institutions, they've created kind of critical institutions. They've created institutions that exist to attack the left's institutions. And there's an audience for that, but that's not really mainstream work. That's not a place to just get your news when you just want news. And so I think the effort to create genuinely alternative institutions generally hasn't worked. Now, I say that with some bias because I don't think that's the right approach. I think the right should want to have a presence in mainstream institutions, that it is more important that there be a diversity of views at Princeton than that there be an alternative university, which ultimately would fight with Princeton for elite students. I think it's just both more practical and more important that the institutions of elite formation have greater diversity to them.
In fairness, President Trump has not yet provided details of how he would like to see the replacement crafted. But the House Republican leadership has been circulating a draft of their ideas for helping those without employer-based health insurance, and it is not a pretty picture.
Health plans design products that address the cost and access challenges by aligning quality and affordability together. Offering a range of coverage options allows individuals and employers to choose the plan that best fits their needs. It's only when all stakeholders — hospitals, health plans and drug companies — embrace the goals of affordability, quality and access that consumers will see true value in their care.
LK: But I wanted to ask about an aspect of it that I think gets relatively little attention.
SS: So you mean getting rid of the combat troops there now, or preclude sending any combat troops there in the future?
A White House spokesman would not confirm the number of people allowed in meetings, or the time limits on such gatherings. But he said that in-person meetings were limited and that colleagues were socially distancing. So far, officials said, the measures appear to be working. But they concede that it's a difficult way to run a White House, just as it was a difficult way to run a campaign and a difficult way to run a transition. Adjusting to doing most meetings via video and doing most of our work with colleagues remotely has not been a massive leap, said Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary. It has been a long adjustment as humans to not being able to hug old colleagues or shake hands with new ones, but so far we don't feel that it has prevented us from doing our jobs.
If your answer is the former, then it can only happen by voting for the Democrat in your local House or Senate race.

Hell of a busy time for concerned citizens. Donald Trump just kicked off his re-election campaign, leaving his supporters cheering while less enthusiastic citizens kept yelling That's just not true! at the television.
Conservatives are right to worry that feeding at the government trough breeds dependency and laziness. So I suggest we introduce pay for performance, using metrics like, say, health.
So the reason you're hearing a lot about it is, it's an end run around the filibuster and a way to avoid having to pass things with 60 votes in the Senate, which I think personally is how we should do most things in the Senate. But the reason you're hearing about reconciliation is that it is sort of one of the few ways you can avoid the filibuster without going nuclear and getting rid of the filibuster altogether. It's a process that was invented in the 1970s and was meant to apply only to the budget and things directly related to the budget. This was when the Senate decided to start passing budgets on a regular basis. The size of the government was growing. It was also an attempt, when it was created, to take back power from the executive branch and have the Congress play a leading role in setting spending priorities for the country. In order to prioritize budget-related work, it created a special fast track procedure that allowed anything that was consistent with its rules to go down this fast track. And on that fast track, there is no filibuster. It's majority votes from beginning to end. There's no point at which it has to clear a supermajority threshold. And there's no point at which opponents of the procedure can block the reconciliation package indefinitely. So Democrats are trying to use this procedure to pass Biden's COVID relief package.
I didn't call him. So he called me about six weeks after, and he said, let's talk.
As the proposal itself notes, millions of people might sign up for association plans, which could be made available to people who currently get insurance through a small business policy or buy it for themselves on the individual insurance market, as well as many people who currently lack health insurance.
That can cut either way in terms of a president's economic legacy. Critics of Obama, including the new House speaker, Paul Ryan, credit Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, and Janet Yellen, the current chairwoman, for whatever recovery we've had since the crisis, contending it happened in spite of the president. I think the Federal Reserve has done more, Ryan said at a January news conference. Frank, for his part, almost jumped through the phone when I mentioned that argument during an interview. And Bernanke and Yellen were appointed by whom? Neither Bernanke or Yellen would have been able to do what they were doing without his full backing.
I'm told by insiders that when Trump's long-shot campaign led to victory, he and Kushner became convinced not only that they'd tapped into something that everybody was missing about America, but that they'd tapped into something that everybody was missing about the two of them.
Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the majority in the 8-to-1 ruling, said the court's decision vindicated a principle as old as the nation itself: The government should honor its obligations.
The House leadership aide said that repealing major provisions of the law was a priority for the first 100 days of the Trump administration. But, he said, the date that those provisions would actually disappear would be delayed, allowing a transition period as short as two years or as long as three or four years. During that time, Republicans plan to pass one or more replacement bills.
Some years ago, Tucker Carlson mounts the stage at CPAC and says, conservatives need their own New York Times. They need a place that goes out and does that reporting and is not completely bought into the movement's incentives. And if they think The New York Times is more liberal, they need to create something that is like it but conservative. And he goes on to create The Daily Caller, which I would say is not at all that kind of operation, and then he becomes, I think, a pretty scary form of right-wing nationalism now on Fox News prime time. I'd say there are similar things in the movement against liberal academia. I could understand constructing alternative institutions. But in the effort to construct them, they seem to have created things that are very, very movement oriented and have very little defense against the movement's incentives, whereas a lot of these institutions that do lean liberal, in terms of the personnel, they also have contrasting and crosscutting incentives. They don't want to be seen as too closely allied with the Democratic Party. They want to be understood as independent. They sometimes bend over backwards to criticize Democrats to show they're independent. So why do you think there's been that different institutional construction path?
Politics abhors a vacuum, and judicial activism increasingly fills the empty space created by legislative sclerosis and political cowardice, by the unwillingness of elected representatives to act on controversial issues. This abdication, persistent and ongoing, naturally impels partisans to look to the courts and the executive to act instead. Kennedy answered this desire too readily, but he didn't invent it, and there were times when he clearly tried to act as the good emperor that our decadent system and polarized country may require — by balancing his own liberal rulings on abortion and same-sex marriage, for instance, with subsequent decisions that allowed some space for pro-life activism and protected some religious liberties against the anti-clericalism of the left.
Well, so what actually happens in the past year between Lindsey Graham and President Trump that explains this?
When it is adopted, they can celebrate the victory by appropriate self-praise. This should satisfy their big donors and loyal voters.
Some of the smartest military analysts I know think that investing in so many big, new weapons systems is the equivalent of taking sledgehammers to droplets of quicksilver, considering that so many enemies we face today are super-empowered individuals or nations that have opted to hurt us with cheap cyberweapons and cheap but massive swarming tactics.
To be sure, the embrace is not without reservation. A group of conservative states recently unleashed another legal challenge to the law. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah recently called it the stupidest dumbass bill that I've ever seen. But in arranged marriages, love often grows over time.
Before the 1970s, the federal government would in some cases spend money without prior congressional approval, said Jim Broussard, the director of the Center for Political History at Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Pa.
New Joe Biden accusations: Two more women told The Times on Tuesday that touches from the former vice president had made them uncomfortable. Mr. Biden has denied acting inappropriately but has said he will listen respectfully.
Yeah, I think that's an extremely accurate way of looking at it. And then you add on to it. You have basically a massive cheering section, cheering you on to oppose your boss and throwing hundreds of millions of dollars at you and providing you unlimited resources to run ads against your boss and do everything you can to obstruct him. I'm taking the analogy too far, but that is what you have, is you don't just have the opportunity to do it, but you have structural factors encouraging you to do it. You have donors demanding that you do it. You have your base demanding that you do it. So it's not just taking the initiative. It's, in many ways, just sort of going with the flow that is already carrying you in that direction of obstruction and sort of legislative sabotage. I think about Merrick Garland in this context and the decision to block him in 2016. Because, look, in retrospect, this turns out to be one of the greatest political gambles, successful gambles, in recent history. But all McConnell was really doing was trying to cover his ass at the time. And people forget that in 2015 and 2016, McConnell was in a lot of trouble. And I think his job as leader was seriously in question. Republicans had just taken back the majority, but that was the only successful election cycle that they'd had under him, aside from 2010.
We have driven the incidence of H.I.V. infections down dramatically since the early 1990s, Mr. Azar said, but new infections in recent years have remained at roughly the same level, around 40,000 a year.
Because they are using a special budget process, Republicans won't be able to repeal all provisions of the health law. But it seems like a good time to look at the major changes Obamacare brought to health care, which of those changes may now disappear, and what might replace them.
KK: Why? Do you mind telling?
If the Republican agenda is so unpopular, how does the party win elections? Partly by lying about its policies. But mainly the G.O.P.'s political achievements depend on identity politics — white identity politics. Exploiting racial resentment to capture white working-class voters, while pursuing policies that benefit only the wealthy, has been the core of the party's political strategy for decades. That's why, in an increasingly diverse country, Republican support has stayed overwhelmingly white.
A recent analysis from the Wesleyan Media Project showed that health care was the most common subject of televised campaign advertisements by Democrats in both the House and the Senate. This is the uniform issue across a lot of the states, and then these candidates will talk about things that are particular to their constituents, said Lauren Passalacqua, the communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
Critics of Senator Warren's student debt plan say it would unfairly benefit those on the path to becoming highly paid professionals.
It's media ecosystems are intermixed with mainstream media that has incentives that are different than the Democratic Party, and so that ends up being somewhat restraining. It seems to be Republican institutions have been taken over and have actually lost a lot of battles. And I'd be curious if, one, do you think that's true? And two, then why it is the Republican institutions are proving weaker?
In the context of protecting Republican control, there's little reason to think that Mr. Ryan would be a liability to Republicans' prospects of holding a majority. A February Politico/Morning Consult poll put Mr. Ryan's national favorability at an anemic 36 percent, but he has not been used — at least to this point — as a high-profile symbolic figure in Democrats' campaigns to retake the House of Representatives. An analysis by the Wesleyan Media Project of roughly 300,000 House and Senate campaign ads aired since January 2017 indicates that unfavorable mentions of Mr. Ryan (1.9 percent of airings) were much less common than negative depictions of President Trump (6 percent) and the minority leader, Nancy Pelosi (9.9 percent).
Clinton notes that Trump has insulted not only women but also Muslims, Latinos, the disabled, and others. He's an equal opportunity bigot. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
The only exception, the only issue where he does actually have some details to offer, is immigration reform. But here the speech's appeal to the assembled legislators to make a version of the deal he's offering on DACA — essentially an amnesty and path to citizenship now in exchange for future immigration reductions — was undercut by all the fearmongering about immigrant crime that Trump wrapped it in. For Democratic politicians whose base doesn't want to compromise and whose own political interest isn't served by any kind of major immigration deal, the bloody-shirt business with MS-13 murders was a permission slip for intransigence: Why make a bargain with a president who talks like half your immigrant constituents are gangbangers?
Let Elizabeth Warren knock herself out with policy proposals. Let Kamala Harris be the adult in the room. Let Bernie Sanders bellow away.
This tumult is happening as the administration prepares for the fourth annual open enrollment period under President Obama's heath law, which is scheduled to start on Nov. 1, a week before Election Day. Most Americans still get their insurance through their employers or government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and veterans health care.
The House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, to strengthen voting rights and ethics provisions, in March 2019 and sent it to the Senate. It is now awaiting a vote there.
So you feel a genuine —
Mm. Do Democrats acknowledge that an absentee balloting system that is suddenly much more widespread than it has been in the past would be advantageous to them in Wisconsin?
Howard Schultz of Starbucks fame told 60 Minutes on Sunday that he was seriously thinking about an independent bid for the presidency, and boy oh boy are liberals and progressives unhappy with the idea. The lifelong Democrat has suddenly morphed, in the eyes of his new detractors, into a vainglorious upstart, entitled rich guy, and potential spoiler who could hand the election to Donald Trump.
Reed: This is where the advocates point to Medicare as an example of the government's ability to run an insurance program, and they also like to point to Medicare Advantage as proof that you can have it both ways — people have a choice of the government-run program or a choice of a private plan.
In fact, let me quote you a New York Times article from just last week that I thought was terrific, and that's about a 2-cent wealth tax and how it is popular across political lines and it's popular, why? Because most of America gets that they're getting cheated in this game, and you get that wherever you are on that income scale until you get up to the very top.
Manufacturing jobs described by Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders as lost to China cannot be found there, or anywhere. As Charles Kenny of the nonpartisan Center for Global Development has shown, technology is causing factory-floor employment to diminish worldwide, even as loading docks hum with activity. This transition is jarring to say the least — but it was always inevitable. The evolution of the heavy-manufacturing sector away from workers and toward machines will not stop, even if international trade is cut off completely.
Staying at home in the U.S.
No, I know he did, but I don't know what that means.
A meritocracy seemed like an improvement — in theory. Brill argues that reformers ended up creating a new aristocracy even more entrenched than the one it supplanted. Meritocrats were able to consolidate their winnings, outsmart and co-opt the government that might have reined them in, and pull up the ladder so more could not share in their success or challenge their primacy. The winners in this new dispensation feel their privilege has been earned, rendering them self-satisfied and unresponsive.
Vice President Biden has cast the Medicare for all plan as anti-labor, arguing that unions have already painstakingly negotiated health care benefits, progress that could be undone by a single-payer system. But Senators Warren and Sanders argue that the plan is pro-labor because it would mean union members are guaranteed health care and can focus their negotiations on wage increases, family leave and other benefits.
A major reason for the moderation in prices is that insurers overshot with their premium increases in the last couple of years, said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. In other words, insurers, who underestimated their costs and often lost money in the first years under the Affordable Care Act, made corrections — and, in some cases, may have overcorrected — in the last year or two.
Michelle Cottle: So here's a question about ——
In practice, any Democrat would probably preside over a significant increase in taxes on the wealthy and a significant but not huge expansion of the social safety net. Given a Democratic victory, a much-enhanced version of Obamacare would almost certainly be enacted; Medicare for All, not so much. Given a Democratic victory, Social Security and Medicare would be protected and expanded; Paul Ryan-type cuts wouldn't be on the table.

I was at Netroots Nation last weekend. And they had converted most of the bathrooms in the convention center into all-gender restrooms. What it meant was basically that you sort of had to, if you're a woman, you kind of had to often walk by men in urinals to go use the bathroom. I thought that maybe I was the only person who was so stodgy and old-fashioned as to feel mildly uncomfortable. But there was one bathroom in another part of the building that hadn't been converted, and it had, like, three stalls. And there was this huge line of women waiting to use it. Don't get me wrong. Trans women have every right in the world to use women's bathrooms. Trans men have every right in the world to use men's bathrooms. I think that this kind of rush to pretend that gender is not an important organizing principle can end up trotting on the needs of women for whom their lived experience is that it necessarily is.

Imagine how different our politics could be if even some Republicans — à la T.R. — occasionally took the side of the little guy against corporate behemoths. And even if you disagreed with McCain on as many issues as I did, imagine if the Republican Party ultimately came to resemble him more than Trump.
archived recording The legislature — they came in, the gaveled in for about 10 seconds, gaveled out and they moved on. They said that was not a serious proposal and said the time for proposals like that was several weeks ago when the crisis began.

WASHINGTON — For a long time, Republicans have brandished the same old narrative to try to scare their way into the White House.
But the extent to which Mr. Trump is doing well among white working-class voters is important to Democrats. There are more white working-class voters than is generally believed, and Mr. Obama was stronger among these voters than typically assumed.
Medicare for all has created deep divisions on the left, particularly over questions like: How much would it really cost? Is Senator Warren's plan for raising the money for it progressive enough? Is it politically prudent to debate the issue now?
Legislation to replace the individual mandate has already been introduced in Maryland and New Jersey with prominent sponsors. Political leaders in other states, including California, Washington, Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut as well as the District of Columbia, are weighing options for replacing the mandate this year, as Stephanie Armour reported in The Wall Street Journal. The mandate was designed to give healthier people an incentive to buy insurance before they fell ill, lowering the cost of insurance for everyone who buys it.
But it's not going to be real change because so long as the lobbyists are writing it, so long as they're the ones who are in the ears of the folks in the House and the Senate, we're just going to keep making little, tiny changes, and I just don't think we can keep doing that.
In court, the Trump administration is trying to get all of Obamacare erased. But at the White House, President Trump and his health officials are busily using the law to pursue key proposals.
Listen, you know I hear you. You know I feel you on that. [LAUGHTER] So first, to the audience, the reason we need to talk about this in the detail we are is that this has become the way the Senate legislates. And it has unusual features that then change the laws that we all live under, change what problems we can and can't respond to, and change the way in which we respond to those problems. So in the '80s and then codified in 1990, there are a set of rules imposed on budget reconciliation to make sure that senates do not use it as an end run around the filibuster. Those rules are important. They're called the Byrd rules. What do they say?
The success came during the Obama administration, when she pushed for an agency to protect consumers against banks' misbehavior. The idea was new. It was also simple enough for voters to understand. She hawked it on The Daily Show With Jon Stewart. This time, Warren's side won. Trump has since constrained the agency, but it still exists and is still doing good .
Robert Bork was President Ronald Reagan's failed Supreme Court nominee in 1987. He wrote extensively on antitrust legislation and redefined it from a focus on helping small businesses to promoting economic efficiency, according to Barak Orbach, professor of law at the University of Arizona.
President Obama's health care battles foreshadow some of what Senator Warren might face in trying to institute her single-payer system. Mr. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in March 2010 after a protracted fight in Congress, and by November 2011 the Supreme Court had agreed to hear a case challenging its constitutionality.
The Republicans' initial plan would have changed the structure of the 52-year-old program, switching from a system in which the federal government paid a share of every medical bill to one in which states would receive a flat fee each year for each person signed up for the program. The amendment would give states a second option: Instead of that per capita payment, they could get a lump sum payment for children and adults under 65 who don't have disabilities, along with more control over who can sign up and what benefits different kinds of Medicaid recipients could receive. This change will please conservatives in Congress, who hope to limit the growth of the program and increase state flexibility. Members of the Republican Study Committee and the House Freedom Caucus had asked for it.
MC: I think we can agree that there are huge problems here. But to Katie's point, and then I'm going to throw it to Jesse. You have to be careful to balance the big promises with the over-promising, because then you risk the disillusionment, which I think we saw during the Obama administration. And back to kind of Katie's question about how you pay for a lot of these things. I mean comprehensive immigration for one, you can't do that through budget reconciliation.
He says, I don't have your phone number. And I said, there's a reason for that. And he laughed.
Everyone likes to talk about the party in terms of two or three wings. I think there's probably 50 wings, if we're all being honest with one another. We've always been a mosaic and where we all connect is around working families and workers.
Whitmer pleads for common ground on the pandemic, but Michigan Republicans say she has cut them out. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 0:52 - 0:00 transcript Whitmer Calls for 'Common Ground' in Pandemic Response Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan called for a unified political approach in combatting the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic during her State of the State speech on Wednesday. 2020 was a tough year. Despite incredibly hard decisions and dangerous threats, I know my burden has been lighter than many. This year didn't pan out like any of us wanted or imagined. It required compassion and strength, and a lot of Michigan grit. Now, I know you're used to me saying, Fix the damn roads. This year, let's also fix the damn road ahead. Let's find common ground to grow our economy, get families and businesses back on their feet. It starts by ending the pandemic. The health of our economy is inextricably linked to the health of our people. Effectively rebuilding our economy this year requires that we protect public health, and that hurdle is cleared easier and quicker if we work together. Gov. Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan called for a unified political approach in combatting the fallout of the coronavirus pandemic during her State of the State speech on Wednesday. Credit Credit...

Yet 18 states — all of them with Republican-controlled legislatures, governors or both — still haven't expanded Medicaid. Why?
But let me finish my point. If you fight on ground where I think you've got lots of bipartisan support and you lead a damn fight — and then — just — if you can deliver a 2-cent wealth tax, which has wide popularity, when I get to sign the piece of paper that cancels student loan debt for 43 million Americans, that's Democrats and Republicans. I think at that moment, the world starts to shift. I think at that moment, a whole generation of people who have only seen the government as debt collector starts to shift. Will we get 100 percent of the folks on board? No. But will we get a lot more? Will we begin to talk about a democracy that doesn't just work increasingly for a thinner and thinner slice of the top, or will we start to talk about a democracy that works for all of us? That 2-cent wealth tax is about child care. It's about things that touch people's lives. It's about universal pre-K for 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds. It's about a $50 billion investment in historically black colleges and universities, tuition-free. Technical school, two-year college, four-year college. You just deliver on something that matters to people. Now they've got a stake in democracy. It feels like it pays off, that it's not just marching in the street over and over and over, and the next day you wake up and it's a little bit worse than it was today.
Roughly 50 percent of Pennsylvania's population supports the fracking industry.
The major insurers, which appeared more optimistic about the marketplaces earlier in the year, have been seeing losses, and the losses have worsened, said Ana Gupte, an analyst at Leerink Partners who follows the insurance industry. In the case of Aetna, she said, its ability to withstand those losses was weakened when it became clear it might not be able to rely on the cost savings it expected from its merger with Humana.
In Colorado, John Hickenlooper, the state's former governor, survived a rough campaign to win his Democratic Senate primary, propelling him to a general election challenge to Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican and top target for Democrats looking to capture control of the Senate.
The First Congressional District in the southern strip of the state, similarly rural and Republican leaning, is also worth five delegates. The district is split among multiple media markets, including one of the smallest in the country, Mankato. Mr. Bloomberg is the only candidate spending money in Mankato, with $850,000 on air. He is similarly alone in La Crosse, a Wisconsin media market that seeps into the southeastern corner of Minnesota, spending $780,000 there.
This perceived decline and fall of the United States has inspired a 21st-century cottage industry of books devoted to how things went off course. They range from the journalistic (George Packer's The Unwinding) to the sociological (Robert Putnam's Our Kids) to the economic (Thomas Piketty's Capital in the 21st Century) to the political (Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson's Winner-Take-All Politics). Many of these books tackle similar themes: the rise of economic inequality, the increase in political polarization and the erosion of the mid-20th-century social contract that existed for white men. We are living in a golden age of authors telling Americans that we no longer live in a golden age.
What would a Republican Party more in the mold of John McCain look like?
The ruling by the G.A.O. does not directly affect a separate program with a similar purpose that was meant to limit the financial losses of insurance companies under the Affordable Care Act. But it could complicate efforts by the administration to negotiate a settlement with various insurance companies that have sued the government, saying they received much less money than they were promised under this program.
At a campaign rally in Las Vegas, President Trump said that he and Republicans will protect patients with pre-existing conditions. But his Justice Department has said that those provisions under the Affordable Care Act should be overturned.
Re Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court to Strike Down Affordable Care Act (nytimes.com, June 26):
Maintaining that carefully constructed system is a particular duty of the speaker. Mr. Ryan, though pledged to uphold the Constitution, has taken to acting as though he and the Republicans he leads are members of the White House staff.
— the governor makes his most drastic step, unilaterally postponing Tuesday's election until June, claiming that he has the emergency powers to do so. This is a affront to the Republicans.
But the people who want to take away your health care haven't given up.
I think it's almost hard to underestimate how disruptive it would be. Just to give one example, right now we have private health insurance companies that cover most Americans. These are big corporations. They're among the largest and most —
It has also put health care back at the center of the political conversation. Republicans already took a beating on the issue in the fall midterm elections, and Democrats, who released a bill in the House to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, want to keep running on it. They'll be sure to remind voters of the Trump administration's zealous commitment to taking away their health care.
If it were up to the doctors, they'd say let's shut down the entire world, Mr. Trump said. This could create a much bigger problem than the problem that you started out with.
Exactly. A 2-cent wealth tax just means if you don't lift a finger, your fortune only grows at 4 percent, 6 percent, 8 percent. And yet how many people in this country who are so sophisticated and knowledgeable — right — say you could never get a wealth tax because the billionaires and millionaires won't let it happen? Well, what the hell? This is a democracy.
But if your complaint is a labor complaint, that is, gee, here I am in America and I'm trying to compete against workers in a foreign country who are getting paid a dollar a day. What's your path? Well, first you've got to go to the U.S. government and persuade the U.S. government that they should go after this country, for which we know what has happened. U.S. government has repeatedly — and this is not just by — well, yeah, we get your point.
The logic here has been clear from the beginning. To ensure coverage of people with pre-existing conditions, you have to prohibit insurers from discriminating based on medical history. But that's not enough: To provide a decent risk pool, you also have to induce healthy people to sign up, preferably with both subsidies and a penalty for being uninsured. In other words, you need a system that is basically Obamacare.

On NPR's Morning Edition on Wednesday, Mary Louise Kelly explained that she had looked up the definition of lie in the Oxford English Dictionary. A false statement made with intent to deceive, Ms. Kelly said. Intent being the key word there. Without the ability to peer into Donald Trump's head, I can't tell you what his intent was. I can tell you what he said and how that squares, or doesn't, with facts.
And that was the neighborhood destroyed by white mobs, who looted black businesses and homes, killing probably hundreds. (We don't know how many because the massacre was never properly investigated.) The police, of course, did nothing to protect black citizens; instead, they joined the rioters.
Seriously, it's striking how many of the payments the federal government is or soon will be failing to make are for things libertarians insist we shouldn't have been spending taxpayer dollars on anyway.

THE CRITICISM As evidence that the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are failing, Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, points to some of the higher premium increases in 2017, as reported by the Obama administration: 58 percent in Alabama, 116 percent in Arizona, 69 percent in Oklahoma, 53 percent in Pennsylvania and 63 percent in Tennessee.
But I want to linger on that word opportunism, because if you look at the chronology, one view — and perhaps it's the most cynical view — is that Lindsey Graham, in the name of relevance, attached himself to the biggest star in Republican politics for a very long time, and that was Senator John McCain. And then when Senator John McCain declines and ultimately dies, Lindsey Graham looks for the next biggest star to attach himself to, and that happens to be Donald Trump. And so despite the fact that these two men disdain each other and represent very different sides of the Republican Party, the constant is Lindsey Graham seeking out the star.
Paine was easier, in a sense, because he always wrote for a popular audience. And there are two phases to Paine. There's the American Paine, where you could read Common Sense. I'd say start from The American Crisis, which is much more of a general reader, popular piece, series of essays written, really, as pep talks to soldiers, more or less, in the course of the Revolutionary War. But there's a lot of political philosophy in them and a very profound case for human liberty. And then there's Paine of the French Revolutionary period, where the thing to read is really The Rights of Man, which is a two-volume book that Paine wrote. You should read The Rights of Man after you read Burke's reflections on the revolution in France because The Rights of Man is actually a direct response to Burke, answers him in some wonderfully interesting ways, and engages, really, with some of the deepest questions of our political tradition.
Unimpressed by the litany of self-justifications offered by Mr. Acosta, House Democrats are now bringing their oversight authority to bear.
United States troops have recently resumed counterterrorism operations in Syria, suggesting that President Trump intends to leave most of the 500 troops currently stationed there (many of them in combat). Mr. Trump has been inconsistent in his strategy on troops in Syria; Senator Warren has been firm in her stance that all combat troops should come home.
Some of the Democratic candidates have been more forthright in their criticism of Hunter Biden's role at the Ukrainian gas concern; others have been cagier. Senator Cory Booker, when asked about the controversy, said I just don't think children of vice presidents, presidents, during the administration should be out there doing that. Senator Warren, on the other hand, has said: I don't know. I mean I'd have to go back and look at the details.
Political commentators and strategists write with some awe of President Trump's outrageous, gutsy strategy of ginning up his base with one more attack on black athletes, one more crackdown on Central American mothers and children on the Mexican border, one more assault on Obamacare, one more tariff on imports. They think Mr. Trump's drumbeat is intensifying loyalty and fervor among Republican partisans and that the Republican Party we used to know is taking a nap somewhere, as John Boehner, the former speaker of the House, put it.
Look, we can work — and this is what we should have done. We should have been pushing for negotiations with Turkey, with our allies, in order to protect the Kurds. And we could do that or could have done this as part of withdrawal. We could use economic pressure, we can use diplomatic pressure. We can use coalescing with our allies in order to bring pressure to protect the Kurds, and I think that's what we should have done. We've already abandoned the Kurds in the worst possible way and sent a huge signal to the rest of the world that the United States, at least under the Trump administration, is not a reliable ally.
All the finger pointing has overshadowed the discussion about the actual substance of the budget deal, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, and many lawmakers don't even seem to care that the deal they are considering — which will almost certainly include even more tax cuts following the unaffordable tax bill Congress just passed, as well as new spending increases — will add tens of billions to the deficit. There is almost zero discussion of the ongoing damage on the nation's finances.
Was this climb-down a reaction to threats of retaliation, or did the administration not at first realize that the tariffs would mainly hit our allies? Either way, Trump may have gotten the worst of both worlds: angering countries that should be our friends and establishing a reputation as an untrustworthy ally and trading partner, without even doing much for the industry he was supposedly trying to help.
But about 15 million Americans remain uninsured and are eligible for marketplace coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. It also estimates that up to three million people have lost employer-based coverage during the pandemic.
So while Mr. Bloomberg is unlikely to finish high in placement in many Super Tuesday states, his vast resources in a state like Minnesota can help amass some delegates.

While President Obama himself didn't personally appear in court to defend the Affordable Care Act, the legal challenges hurled at the legislation demanded years of government and legal resources, not to mention public attention — so the legal dimension of the health care fight can't be discounted.
When I was a girl, you had a better than 50/50 chance of doing better than your parents. Today, that seems to be slipping under a 1-in-10 chance. Opportunity is shifting away from not just the poor kids. It's shifting away from everybody who's not born into the top. And sure, a few people roll the dice and make it big and we should celebrate that, but it's like this fundamental question of who we're going to be as a country. And yeah, I do fight for a lot of things. I fight for a big vision, but if we don't start there, if we start by compromising, if we start by saying, Hey, everybody line up. We're going to knock 2 cents off your student loan debt, who's showing up for that?
KK: You seem to have avoided that approach for the most part. Can you just explain why?
Mr. Feldman and his colleagues aren't planning simply to replicate the federal individual mandate. Instead, they are trying a new strategy. People who fail to obtain insurance would still be charged a fine, but they would be allowed to use that money as a down payment on a health plan if they wished. Legislators estimate that many people subject to the penalty would not owe anything more to buy health insurance, after federal tax credits are applied.
Joseph R. Biden Jr. had just been sworn in as vice president. All he needed now was a job.
And we had a black president.
Twenty million more people have health insurance.
Well, I'm not sure I accept the premise of the question, that they actually tried what I was talking about. Look, our No. 1 leverage is everybody wants the American consumer. They want access to the American consumer. They want to be able to sell us all of their stuff because the American consumer is not only the engine of about 70 percent of our economy; it's a worldwide engine. So I think it's perfectly reasonable to say, if you want to be able to trade with United States on the best possible terms, then everybody needs to raise their standards just a little. Who wants to do that?
BOZEMAN, Mont. — The only reason to be a Democrat running for statewide office in Montana is that, alas, you are one. Just keep in mind that there will be none of that heady, audacity-of-hope-type jazz. In this cold, conservative state, your mission is to persuade the skeptics east of the Rocky Mountain Front that you are a levelheaded, friendly, capitalist adult who won't be levitating the Pentagon — a task that has gotten considerably easier since the Republican establishment lost interest in basic empiricism.
We know that Donald Trump, the first president without a pet since James K. Polk, appears to hate dogs. And the feeling is mutual, according to one of his ex-wives. He also uses pooches as pejoratives when insulting women.

Now, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare, as some of you might remember, Mrs. Clinton said at a town-hall-style event in Clinton, Iowa, on Saturday, the second time in recent days she has used the line.
Senator Warren's Medicare for all would require $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over the next 10 years. She has promised the money won't come from raising taxes on the middle class and maintains that between defense cuts and a wealth tax, the costs would be covered. But of course, that would require Senate approval — and Senator McConnell has sworn it won't happen as long as I'm majority leader.
The relative ease with which Salesforce acquired so much protective gear stands in sharp contrast to the often chaotic government efforts. While states have had to compete against each other for scarce supplies and the strategic national stockpile of protective gear is depleted, Mr. Benioff and his team simply called up their business partners in China and started writing checks.
Medicare for all builds on the idea that everyone should have access to affordable health insurance, but it kind of turbo-charges that idea. Medicare for all says everyone gets the same health care.
My primary consultant is myself, Donald Trump said back in March when asked whom he turns to for foreign policy advice. This turns out to be his approach to pretty much everything.
She added: I don't think I'm going to beat him on the airwaves, but I can beat him on the debate stage. At a forum on Sunday focused on infrastructure, Ms. Klobuchar, who won the endorsement of The Las Vegas Sun last week, mentioned Mr. Bloomberg early on, referring to President Trump's comments about his height as she stood to speak. I am the only candidate that is 5-foot-4, she joked. I want that out there now.
But the real number in many parts of the United States is more than 10 times higher than the reported rate, according to data released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The nation's health insurers, resigned to the idea that Republicans will repeal the Affordable Care Act, on Tuesday publicly outlined for the first time what the industry wants to stay in the state marketplaces, which have provided millions of Americans with insurance under the law.
The survey, presented at the American Society of Health Economists conference in Washington last summer, was conducted by the health economists John Cawley of Cornell University, Michael Morrisey of Texas A&M and Kosali Simon of Indiana University.
But precisely because there are so many legitimate avenues of inquiry, Democrats must proceed with caution to avoid looking as though they're piling on in a punitive or grossly partisan manner. While many Democrats and not a few anti-Trump Republicans would doubtless be delighted to see the president subjected to daily investigative torture, House Democrats cannot afford to alienate the independents and swing voters needed to send him packing in 2020. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that a plurality of independents already expect the new House majority to go overboard with its oversight, and even some Democratic lawmakers have expressed unease. Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the new Budget Committee chairman, recently joked that Congress would have to build an air traffic control tower to keep track of all the subpoenas flying from here to the White House.
In other words, what would look to an outside observer — or skeptical judge — as a conspiracy to mislead the public about the reason for asking people about their citizenship status was really a conspiracy between the plaintiffs and the media. What was this doing in a court filing? Either the administration's witnesses lied to Judge Furman or they didn't. Either the real reason for asking about citizenship was to help minority communities or to hurt them. What did the reporting have to do with it?

I think having people here who are working under the table is both bad for American workers and bad for the American economy. One of the reasons I propose to create a pathway to citizenship for everyone who's here to stay, a pathway that is fair and achievable, is to stop the problem of two-tier hiring: those who are hired in the legal system and then those who are hired outside the legal system. People who are undocumented have no protection and are frequently subject to wage theft, to unsafe working conditions, and that's not good for anyone. It's not good for American workers. It's not good for the American economy.
President Obama's health care battles foreshadow some of what Senator Warren might face in trying to institute her single-payer system. Mr. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in March 2010 after a protracted fight in Congress, and by November 2011 the Supreme Court had agreed to hear a case challenging its constitutionality.
And when something becomes inevitable, and it seems inevitable this is never going to happen, it's very hard to keep the issue alive. So who knows? I think probably the safe bet here is that McConnell, even if it was only three votes he had to keep in line, he would have found a way to keep them in line. But there is a big difference in the group dynamics when you have that majority threshold versus a supermajority threshold. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Health care has become a major point of contention between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, who are fighting to come out ahead in the Feb. 1 caucuses. Mr. Sanders's plan would require over a trillion dollars a year paid for with a broad set of new taxes. His campaign says the plan would save middle-class families money on co-pays and deductibles despite the tax increase. Mrs. Clinton has hit Mr. Sanders for wanting to scrap President Obama's signature domestic achievement and raise taxes on the middle class. She has promised to improve on the Affordable Care Act.

If premiums exceeded a company's medical expenses, the insurer would be required to pay some of its profit to the government. But if premiums fell short of medical expenses, the insurer would be entitled to payments from the government.
Kathleen Kingsbury: So we don't have very much time together. We all know your résumé and your bio, and many of us have met you in the past, so you don't mind if we just jump right into questions?
I like markets. I believe that capitalism can produce enormous value. But capitalism without rules is theft, and one of those rules should be progressive taxation. Everybody pays their fair share. And one of those rules should be you don't get to crush the opposition. That's not how markets work. And that's a battle we had at the end of the 1800s and into the early 1900s, and it's a battle we need to have again. The giants have grown and they exercise so much economic power, but they also exercise too much political power.

Depending on which state you live in, you may need to provide documents showing that you recently lost your job. You may also need to provide proof that your income is now lower than it was when you filed your last tax return, if it has fallen. In calculating your income for this purpose, you should include any unemployment benefits you are receiving, including the additional $600 a week that will be paid temporarily under the new economic relief legislation. You do not need to include any stimulus payment you get from the government.
The Republican health care plan being considered by Congress will significantly increase the number of uninsured people, but save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. Here are the key findings from the report.
The list is light on legislative achievements. Mr. Trump, who did not take the time to learn the levers of power, did not consistently engage with congressional leaders, beyond basking in their support or making last-minute demands to increase funding for his wall by threatening to scuttle big budget deals.
He says, I don't have your phone number. And I said, there's a reason for that. And he laughed.
How do they solve their dilemma — a dilemma with real-life consequences for many people? It's one of the biggest mysteries of 2017. I'll continue to hope that those Kentucky voters have their optimism rewarded, but it's a deeply wishful form of optimism.
Well, what exactly does that path look like, then, from where we are in the minds of these Democratic candidates to a someday-world where Medicare for all, as envisioned by someone like Bernie Sanders, could ever be a reality?
The new rule is presented as a redefinition of short-term, limited-duration insurance. But it stretches the common understanding of those terms, and some of the new policies could be an attractive option for healthier consumers who now pay high prices for major medical coverage and are willing to take more risk in return for lower prices.
Jesse Wegman: Senator, I want to just take you back for a moment to Mara's question about swing states and swing state voters and your point about large structural changes that people warn you off. The other day, you repeated your argument that you wanted to be the last president to win the Electoral College and the first to win the national popular vote. How do you expect — I'm assuming you're not talking about a constitutional amendment. How do you expect to get there in five years, unless you're the president, unless you win the Electoral College and Donald Trump wins the popular vote in 2020?
If your answer is the former, then it can only happen by voting for the Democrat in your local House or Senate race.
Mr. Jordan believes that at this time he is better suited to represent Ohioans in the House of Representatives, where, as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, he can advance an America first agenda, promote conservative values and hold big government accountable, a spokesman for Jordan's congressional campaign said.

Further complicating the measure's prospects, insurance companies, which took a leading role in the health care fights of 1993-94 and 2009-10 but have been conspicuously quiet this year, released a blistering letter objecting to Republican plans to remake Medicaid and cut its funding.

In practice, any Democrat would probably preside over a significant increase in taxes on the wealthy and a significant but not huge expansion of the social safety net. Given a Democratic victory, a much-enhanced version of Obamacare would almost certainly be enacted; Medicare for All, not so much. Given a Democratic victory, Social Security and Medicare would be protected and expanded; Paul Ryan-type cuts wouldn't be on the table.
Look, I have argued for a long time that we need not to expand our nuclear arsenal, and that is the direction the Trump administration has been taking us.
WASHINGTON — A year ago Friday, Representative Claudia Tenney of New York stood among dozens of enthusiastic colleagues in the Rose Garden to celebrate passage of a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. When President Trump made his way onstage, Ms. Tenney clapped and smiled.
When it is adopted, they can celebrate the victory by appropriate self-praise. This should satisfy their big donors and loyal voters.
Civis Analytics, a Democratic polling and data firm, has developed a detailed model to determine which Americans are likely to vote in this election. In collaboration with Enroll America, they have also developed estimates about precisely who got the new health insurance.
Private insurers make Medicare extraordinarily confusing, increasing costs for beneficiaries and their own profits. When enrolling in Medicare, and then every subsequent year, beneficiaries are required to make a series of decisions regarding their coverage. Though there is a base benefit package, there are also many and varied options, ranging from which prescription drugs are covered to the amount of premiums, co-payments and deductibles. The plans also change every year.

Senator Warren frequently refers to Frances Perkins, who was Franklin Roosevelt's labor secretary. In The Atlantic, the former Obama speechwriter Susannah Jacob wrote that Senator Warren's campaign slogan Dream big, fight hard echoes a sentence in Ms. Perkins's memoir, in which she wrote that her heart sank when President Roosevelt questioned the public works program, because Ms. Perkins realized we must fight hard now.
WASHINGTON — The most powerful and ambitious Republican-led Congress in 20 years will convene Tuesday, with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of American life — refashioning the country's social safety net, wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the Obama administration.
We are a long way off until the 2020 election, but I applaud the women who have thrown their hats into the ring now, as Americans need to get to know and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses and help choose the woman with the best chance of taking back the White House. The midterms in 2018 showed that women are on the move in American politics, and there is little doubt in my mind that the best woman will be our 46th president.
Unfortunately, what looks good on TV isn't necessarily good for America, or the world.
Now, as the coronavirus sweeps through the country, many state officials are relying on the Affordable Care Act to provide health coverage for residents who have none. On Friday, California became one of the latest states to set up a special enrollment period so people can sign up for insurance on their state-run marketplaces, and the Trump administration is considering reopening enrollment in the larger federal marketplace, which serves most states, for a limited period.

But let me finish my point. If you fight on ground where I think you've got lots of bipartisan support and you lead a damn fight — and then — just — if you can deliver a 2-cent wealth tax, which has wide popularity, when I get to sign the piece of paper that cancels student loan debt for 43 million Americans, that's Democrats and Republicans. I think at that moment, the world starts to shift. I think at that moment, a whole generation of people who have only seen the government as debt collector starts to shift. Will we get 100 percent of the folks on board? No. But will we get a lot more? Will we begin to talk about a democracy that doesn't just work increasingly for a thinner and thinner slice of the top, or will we start to talk about a democracy that works for all of us? That 2-cent wealth tax is about child care. It's about things that touch people's lives. It's about universal pre-K for 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds. It's about a $50 billion investment in historically black colleges and universities, tuition-free. Technical school, two-year college, four-year college. You just deliver on something that matters to people. Now they've got a stake in democracy. It feels like it pays off, that it's not just marching in the street over and over and over, and the next day you wake up and it's a little bit worse than it was today.
Iran's president, Hassan Rouhani, said it was important for economic activity to resume —

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said on Tuesday that 11.8 million people had signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces for 2018 — roughly 400,000 fewer than last year. The drop was relatively small, given that Mr. Trump had sharply cut federal outreach efforts and the open enrollment period was half as long as in past years.
The Frontier, one of the first casinos on what is now simply known as the Strip, had recently been sold to new owners. The Western-themed casino was popular for made-from-scratch baked goods and food.
The apology, which Mr. Bloomberg looked uneasy delivering, did not satisfy his rivals.
Another facility reported one confirmed and six presumed Covid-19 deaths to the Health Department, according to the report. The attorney general's office, however, said the facility reported to its investigators that there were more than four times that number — 31 dead — by mid-April. Deaths in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities have accounted for about a third of the nation's some 430,000 deaths. Federal and state authorities have made vaccinating staff and residents at such facilities a top priority, though that effort has been slower than hoped. In New York, where there have been more than 42,000 virus-related deaths, the toll in the state's nursing homes has been a particular source of agony for residents and their families. It has also been a political liability for Mr. Cuomo, who has pushed back on accusations that his administration did not do enough to safeguard a highly vulnerable population. The findings of Ms. James would seem to put her in rare conflict with Mr. Cuomo, the state's three-term Democratic incumbent. Ms. James was the governor's favored choice to succeed Eric T. Schneiderman after he suddenly resigned as attorney general in 2018; she readily embraced Mr. Cuomo's political backing. The attorney general asked 62 nursing homes — about a tenth of the state's total — for information about on-site and in-hospital deaths related to the virus; investigators then cross-referenced that information with public reports of deaths issued by the Health Department.
Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, cited news reports indicating that insurers around the country were using Trump administration policies to justify 2019 rate increases, in Maine, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia and Washington, among other states.
The longest shutdown in American history ended on Friday, after 34 full days. That easily exceeded the previous record, under President Bill Clinton in 1995, of 21 days.
How Has the Pandemic Changed Your Taxes? Will stimulus payments be taxed? Nope. The so-called economic impact payments are not treated as income. In fact, they're technically an advance on a tax credit, known as the Recovery Rebate Credit. The payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague Ann Carrns wrote. Read more. Are my unemployment benefits taxable? Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction? Probably not, unless you're self-employed, an independent contractor or a gig worker.
I said there were going to be two parts to this. So I've done part one about the inside/outside theory of change, but the second part, that's why we've got to do this through grass roots movement. We cannot do this through television commercials. If winning the presidency, and I'll speak only to the Democratic side, is about who comes in, and oh, let's see, drops $37 million in one week on TV ads, and that's what it takes to win a Democratic primary, then we have a democracy that's just our TV ads versus their TV ads, and at that point, they're fake news. They claim ours is fake news, right? Everybody just gets farther and farther and farther into their corners.
That was the last time there was this sort of disruption in our daily lives and change in rituals, said Doris Kearns Goodwin, the presidential scholar, noting that millions were deployed in arms and those who remained home lived with rationed goods. But at least people then could go to work, be part of the effort to win the war.
Randy Pate, a senior official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the Trump administration expects 600,000 people to buy the new insurance policies next year, with enrollment increasing to 1.6 million by 2022.
Oh, and social safety net programs can do more than limit misery: they can be liberating. I've known many people who stuck with jobs they disliked for fear of losing health coverage; Obamacare, flawed as it is, has noticeably reduced that kind of lock in, and a full guarantee of health coverage would make our society visibly freer.
People understand this is good for our economy. It's good for our worldwide security. If you're not willing to get out there and fight, nothing is going to change. And yeah, the fights have to be realistic. It's why I start everything with, Here's how I'm going to pay for it. You may not like how I did, but at least I laid it out there. You don't have any doubt, and I show you where every single nickel comes from because I want it to be realistic. I didn't start with free college. I started with a 2-cent wealth tax, because we can do a 2-cent wealth tax. I started with it and said, and here's how much revenue it produces. It produces a staggering amount of revenue, far more than raising income taxes, because that's what the wealth curve looks like.
Let's hope voters are smarter than that. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me 70 times and counting, shame on me.
KK: We're running out of time here.

O.K, we need to leave the discussion there. And we'll be right back with our second topic of the day. [MUSIC PLAYING] Our colleague, Farhad Manjoo, recently wrote a much-discussed column about pronouns and gender. In it, Farhad calls himself a stereotypical cisgender, middle-aged suburban dad. But Farhad doesn't want to be called he or him. Instead he or, more to the point, they prefers they and them. It's one way to make society less irredeemably obsessed with gender, Farhad wrote. There is a much larger debate here about degenderization, the push for a society less governed by gender. We're going to have that debate now, and we are thrilled that Farhad has joined us for it. Welcome to The Argument, Farhad.
But the law has made health care far more affordable in a number of less conspicuous ways.
Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said on Monday: We do not comment on internal deliberations or the particulars of any waiver requests. H.H.S. has been working on waivers to help states have more flexibility and provide patients access to affordable health care.
My view on that one is that really you can be the umpire in the baseball game or you can have a team in the baseball game, but you don't get to do both at the same time. So breaking the platform off from the competitive business, yeah, that would give a lot of small businesses a much more level playing field and ability to compete.
It is seen as a really long-shot challenge to the Affordable Care Act, something that, in all likelihood, will probably not result in the law being struck down as a whole, but the White House was going to have to decide at some point whether they were going to defend the A.C.A. at the highest levels of the legal system or whether they were going to take sides against a law that's on the books that Congress failed to repeal when it had the chance. And that's what they did.
Six centuries later, in the United States, a growing labor movement before World War I culminated, after the war, in stronger unions, widespread strikes and the end of the 12-hour workday. The war, in addition to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, resulted in a shortage of working men, so many of these jobs opened to women for the first time. In turn, women gained more power to argue for things like higher wages and the right to vote.
Yeah, that is a really interesting question. It is certainly true that Trump, from time to time talked about, we need a stimulus and we're better off going big, and I want the $2,000 checks. But he didn't have in him the ability to engage in a policy question in a sustained way and negotiate with people on the Hill. That just wasn't something that he displayed at any point in his presidency. He didn't do a lot of the traditional job of a president and instead, took on the mantle of the internet commenter-in-chief on his own presidency. And that's one of the things that was really bizarre about this. Because, I think, there's absolutely no question that if Trump had engaged in August and September and said, I want $2,000 checks, and made this a test of Republican support for him, he would have gotten those $2,000 checks. And there would have been some grumbling and there would have been some Republicans who voted against it, but he would have had it. He would have had the bulk of Republicans, he would have had a lot of Democrats, who would have just been with him on the policy question. And I think you have to look at psychological, more than political explanations, for why Trump did that. Now the question for McConnell, I think, is a little bit different. And I've never had a clear handle on that.
Senator Warren, then a Harvard professor, first introduced the idea of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in a 2007 paper in the journal Democracy. President Obama assigned her to build the agency after the 2008 financial crisis.
The deaths reported to the attorney general's office at most of those facilities totaled 1,914, compared to the state's much lower count of 1,229. Ms. James said that her office was investigating those circumstances where the discrepancies cannot reasonably be accounted for by error or the difference in the question posed. The attorney general said she was continuing to conduct investigations of more than 20 nursing homes across the state that presented particular concern, noting that other law enforcement agencies also have ongoing investigations relating to nursing homes.
In 2016 they disliked Hillary Clinton and were willing to give Trump a chance, telling themselves, How bad could it be — and hey, anyway, we have the Constitution to protect us. Then they witnessed just how bad it could be and that the Constitution in Trump's hands could not protect us. Democrats running in swing districts in 2018 also kept it simple, focusing on Trump's attempts to destroy Obamacare and coverage of pre-existing medical conditions.
I'll — start — I want to lie about you, that's why I ran the ad that said Mark Zuckerberg endorses Donald Trump, and they said, We'll take your money for that one, until they discovered what it actually said and said: Wait a minute. Not if you're going to talk about Mark Zuckerberg. Whoa.
One parallel Senator Warren has used in her plans for breaking up Facebook is the government's antitrust case against Microsoft in 1998, which Senator Richard Blumenthal and Tim Wu wrote in The Times made Microsoft a gentler giant.
In October 2019, Senator Warren tweeted: Facebook has incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. Mark Zuckerberg is telling employees that he views a Warren administration as an 'existential' threat to Facebook. The public deserves to know how Facebook intends to use their influence in this election.
And if you think about what the F.D.R. administration was trying to do, they were trying to build a sort of basic public social safety net for people, to protect them and prevent them from falling through the cracks.
Mr. Trump's allies said his stewardship of the economy, even after the pandemic, was his greatest legacy, an opinion shared by his aides who put together a list of about 1,000 accomplishments that has subsequently been scrubbed from the White House website.

For the record, job growth since the Affordable Care Act went fully into effect has been the best since the 1990s, and health costs have risen much more slowly than before.
No wonder President-elect Trump realizes that repeal without replace is the real disaster, said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. No wonder he has admonished the Congress not to do plain repeal.
LOS ANGELES — A big crowd showed up for the festive unveiling of President Barack Obama Boulevard here last weekend, at the intersection of hope and resistance, as one news outlet put it. Sure, it's just a three-and-a-half-mile stretch of road, a living ex-president's name added to streets honoring Jefferson and Washington.
Pursuing a legislative path was tougher and led to an uncertain outcome, but he wanted his reforms to endure, Johnson explained, and to do so they required the stubborn force of law.
It's not that I'm opposed to debate. I do think that people should have to debate. I mean, one of the insidious things about the filibuster as it operates right now is that people don't just get to raise the threshold for passing a bill all the way up to 60 votes, but they get to do it in silent and never have to explain themselves. They never have to explain why they oppose this bill that is supported by a majority. So I do think we should find a way to restore the requirement to debate in sort of a use it or lose it way. But to me, the essential question of reform really comes down to, can a majority, within a reasonable amount of time, end the debate section of a bill's consideration? Because just so your listeners know, that's where the bills get held up. Every time a bill comes to the floor, it is entitled to debate under the rules. And the 60-vote hurdle is the vote to end that debate period and then go to the voting period. The voting period still is at a majority threshold. It's because you can't end the debate period, which is the 60-vote requirement, that bills die. You have to clear a bill's path to passage from introduction to final passage to be majority votes all the way through. I don't mind, and I think it would probably be healthy if the path to passage was slower than in the House.
I didn't call him. So he called me about six weeks after, and he said, let's talk.
So why do I say the price increases are a real problem? Because those insurance exchanges are vital to the idea of universal coverage in this country. Without them, many people who don't qualify for government insurance or aren't covered through their job will be stuck without good medical care.
Last year, Senator Warren introduced a bill called the No First Use Act, which would declare that the United States would never be the first to use a nuclear weapon. Opponents say it could drive arms races in smaller countries that depend on America for protection.
According to the agency's final enrollment report, monthly premiums for federal marketplace customers before any subsidy was applied rose by 30 percent this year, to $621 from $476. Subsidies are covering about 86 percent, on average, of the premium cost for those who qualify.
And his response was to go onto Twitter and to declare that they are totally going to do all the things that he said they were going to do, but at a much later date, after the 2020 election.
Ted Kennedy has a proposal in 1970.
The implications? Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who voted against repealing Obamacare, put it best: The decision not to defend key provisions of Obamacare — in a suit filed by Texas' attorney general and 19 other states — creates further uncertainty that could ultimately result in higher costs for millions of Americans and undermine essential protections for people with pre-existing conditions, such as asthma, cancer, heart disease, arthritis and diabetes.

Consistent with whatever is revealed. You can't do speed independently of facts, right? But if that's what we've got and it's enough information for a charge of impeachment, then I think they can go forward and I think they should.
Actually, I don't do polls. I haven't looked at them, so I don't know, but I'll tell you this. I'm out there fighting for those votes every single day. I've been to 29 states and Puerto Rico. I will keep doing this. I've been to blue states and red states, and talked about how we build a future. I think that's what we've got to do. We've got what, two more months before the caucuses start, but this is the question in front of us as a country. How do we think about how to go forward? Is the message going to be business as usual after Donald Trump? It's just too damn hard to get anything done. Therefore, we're just going to just kind of nibble at that problem of all the folks who can't get child care and teachers who are working three jobs?
Mr. Trump opposed any expansion of Obamacare, even a partial one.
President Trump moved again yesterday to restrict immigration, this time targeting work-based visas. The business world — particularly Silicon Valley — is angry.
The slippage has especially hurt children — a recent analysis of new census data by The Times found that the number of children without insurance rose by more than 400,000 between 2016 and 2018.

A spokesman said that Mr. McCarthy planned to have a conversation with her about them.
Whether we're talking about workers or we're talking about the environment, who has to meet what standards? And there are big corporations who figured out how to game the system. Where standards are high, then move that part of the operation somewhere else where standards are low and save a nickel. Because these corporations, they don't have any loyalty to a country, they just have loyalty to their own bottom line. And they play this all around the world.
KK: But you have to admit, many of the things you're saying are the same pitch Obama gave us in 2008, and Obama, of course, got health care done, but with a lot of compromises and left a law that I think by everyone's estimation is flawed. So what's different in 2020 — excuse me, I don't know what year it is, 2019 — than it was in 2008?
Mr. Zuckerberg had drawn criticism for his response to how Cambridge Analytica improperly obtained data on 50 million Facebook users. In the days since the news first broke this weekend, he had not commented publicly on the crisis.
Global Roundup South Korea races to tamp down an outbreak in schools, and other news from around the world. Disinfecting a missionary training school in Gwangju, South Korea, on Wednesday. Religious groups in South Korea have driven several coronavirus outbreaks. Credit... Yonhap/EPA, via Shutterstock The South Korean health authorities said on Wednesday that they were conducting mandatory testing of dozens of religious schools, as the country struggled to tackle a wave of cases linked to a Christian missionary society. South Korea reported 559 new cases on Wednesday, including 100 linked to a school in the southern city of Gwangju. That school is one of six operated by International Mission, a Christian missionary society, that have collectively reported more than 300 infections this month. Yoon Tae-ho, a senior health official, told reporters on Wednesday that the health authorities were conducting mandatory or recommended testing of people at 32 of International Mission's facilities. The group is based in the based in the central city of Daejeon and operates schools across the country. International Mission apologized on Monday, saying in a statement that it thought the infections could have been influenza, not the coronavirus. Religious groups in South Korea have driven several coronavirus outbreaks, including one linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus last winter in the southeastern city of Daegu. An antigovernment demonstration led by a Christian church in Seoul last summer also contributed to a sharp rise in cases, forcing the government to implement tighter social distancing restrictions.

In the waning days of this year's Affordable Care Act sign-up period, the Trump administration declared war on the health law, releasing an executive order that could weaken its requirements and yanking advertisements and outreach off the air.
Hm. So despite the risks of holding an in-person primary in the middle of a pandemic, despite the fact that many states are postponing these primaries, the Republican and Democratic officials in Wisconsin say that this is necessary for the functioning of their government?
Obamacare's individual mandate is the least popular provision in the law. But it is vital because it encourages younger and healthier people to sign up for health insurance. Otherwise, people would simply wait until they got sick or injured to buy coverage. As a result, insurers would either charge much higher premiums or not sell comprehensive health policies at all. A system that allows people to purchase coverage only when they need it drives up costs for everyone, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association said in a statement on Wednesday.
Think of what that means. Do — you know that the top — just one quick — one number. I've resisted numbers while I'm in here. The 99 percent America pays 7.2 percent of your total income in taxes. Not total income. Total wealth. The top one-tenth of 1 percent, the part I want to hit with a 2-cent wealth tax, 3.2 percent. 3.2 percent. They have wealth managers who are managing these huge funds that are growing at what rate? Six percent a year, 8 percent a year, 10 percent a year?
After Senator Warren said during the October debate that the United States should get out of the Middle East, her campaign clarified that she was referring just to combat troops. Noncombat troops have long been stationed in the region for a variety of reasons including ensuring a free flow of oil.
Medicaid also helped Kansas Democrats win a 2018 election for governor, and on Thursday the state's Democratic governor, Laura Kelly, and its Republican State Senate leader, Jim Denning, announced the details of their compromise to expand the program. The state will implement the expansion, covering up to 150,000 additional Kansans. In return, Republicans will get a pilot program meant to reduce private health insurance premiums and keep people from dropping existing insurance and signing up for Medicaid, paid for an increase in the state cigarette tax by a $1 per pack. The proposal would also allow the state to charge recipients a premium of up to $25 per individual and $100 per family. If and when it becomes law, Kansas will become the 37th state to expand its Medicaid program.
After briefly trying to revive the push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, President Trump agreed on Monday to put aside the idea until after the 2020 elections. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, had told Trump firmly that Congress would not be willing to take up any such legislation before then.
AK: Sure. I'm really interested in the student loan debt issue, but there's a concern that your plan to forgive student debt really tilts a lot of resources towards the wealthy. So only 2 percent of borrowers have more than $50,000 in debt. A third of all student debt is owned by people in the top income quartile, and most student debt goes to households with advanced degrees. So these are doctors and lawyers, and they've amassed a lot of debt, but they're also investing in their own educational capacity to pay off that debt. So I'm just wondering how you square that with a plan that goes about forgiving student debt?
WASHINGTON — President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill will fulfill one of his central campaign promises, to fill the holes in the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance affordable for more than a million middle-class Americans who could not afford insurance under the original law.
The legislation comes with some numbers that we didn't know before. Young adults who buy insurance coverage get $2,000 in federal cash to help them pay health premiums. Older adults get $4,000. Those numbers are higher than we've seen in previous G.O.P. proposals. But they would still mean that the Americans who have benefited most from the tax subsidies in the Affordable Care Act — individuals earning less than about $30,000 — would get substantially less help.
It's true: If you just take Trump's mixture of positions, quasi-positions and non-positions and apply them to our current partisan divides, he does seem like he could have a large constituency in the American center. As a blue-state social liberal campaigning as an America First populist, he offers a kind of mash-up of stances taken by Acela corridor Bloombergists and Middle American radicals, and while some of those positions cost you turnout on the Republican side, on paper you could make up for that deficit by winning voters in the center who are turned off by libertarianism or neoconservatism or religious conservatism, but who'd give a tough-talking businessman who doesn't seem all that ideological a second look.
Donald Trump sort of short-circuited the process by calling him first.

Why attacking corruption and getting some structural change in our economy that actually is about not just the wealth gap top to bottom, but this fact that more and more and more of our value is being sucked up to the top, and more and more people are sliding back behind it. And not having power at the polls. How those three things are tied to each other.
A political marriage made in heaven!
It could do more to attack climate change. It could cut taxes for the middle class and poor while raising them on the rich. It could rebuild highways and invest in mass transit. It could fix the lingering problems with Obamacare. It could expand voting rights and workers' ability to join a labor union.
Their recent conversations have become a critical quest to find common ground and measure whether they have moved beyond their policy disputes of the past 20 years. Mr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, is a political moderate, a former vice president and a deal-maker who believes in the bipartisan promise of Washington. Ms. Warren is a liberal from Massachusetts, a former Harvard Law School professor as likely to throw a bomb as to shake a hand in Congress, who has clashed with Mr. Biden on issues ranging from bankruptcy law to the future of Obamacare.
The White House suffered a staff turnover rate of 34 percent during Mr. Trump's first year, a rate that would be unfathomable at nearly any for-profit enterprise. Even by political standards, it's off the charts — triple that of the Obama administration, and twice that of Ronald Reagan, the previous record-holder — according to a study by the Brookings Institution.
I think we need to get our combat troops out. I don't think that combat is advancing the interests of the United States in the Middle East, and it's time to end combat operations. Of course we'll have a continuing presence in the Middle East. We have interests in the Middle East with our allies. We have interests in the Middle East and keeping shipping lanes open, and we will continue to have a presence there, but I don't think combat troops are how we best advance that presence.
The roughly 60,000 members of the union's Local 226 rarely pay out of pocket for routine medical care. They can undergo surgery without receiving a hefty surprise bill months later. They can visit the same one-stop medical clinic for urgent care, vision, dental and the pharmacy. The clinic was a regular stop for many of the 2020 candidates.

The order does not direct the Department of Health and Human Services to ease any particular aspect of the 2010 law, but it could result in a substantial weakening of one of its central features: the so-called individual mandate that requires most Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty.
Well, I think, from the very beginning, the conservative movement itself has consisted of both. For example, the struggle around McCarthyism early in the early days of modern conservatism in the 1950s really tells this story in a lot of ways, where there was a populist force that spoke to real concerns. Some of were the same concerns that more traditional conservatives had. Some of them weren't. And the politics that arose out of the populist side of this became ugly politics fairly quickly and had to be kind of contained by the rest of the party. But the balance was where the party really existed so that this struggle between Nixon's side and, at first, the Goldwater side then the Reagan side has always been this fight between grassroots activism, which tended to be populist, and more of a Washington-centered, increasingly over the years, conservative, intellectual coalition. And the kind of arguments that, say, Pat Buchanan made in the 1990s are very similar in tone and substance to the sorts of things that worked best for Donald Trump. I think Trump found that vein and found that he could direct it to his own benefit. And he spoke to a sense in the party that had long been there, a sense that really begins from the premise that the elites in our society are corrupt, that the elites in our society are failures. This is the way Trump often spoke about them. It's the way populists generally speak about them.
KK: Why? Do you mind telling?
The move was largely symbolic and will not end the case, which was brought by Republican state officials. When it was argued in November, a majority of the justices appeared inclined to uphold the bulk of the sprawling law, which was President Barack Obama's defining domestic legacy.
Credit Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times President Biden, seeking to expand access to health care and strengthen the Affordable Care Act, used his executive authority Thursday to order the reopening of enrollment in the health law's marketplaces and a re-examination of Trump administration policies that undermined protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. His aim, he said in a brief signing ceremony in the Oval Office, was to undo the damage Trump has done. Mr. Biden also moved to protect reproductive rights and expand access to abortion, and took separate executive action to overturn his predecessor's restrictions on the use of taxpayer dollars for clinics that refer or counsel patients to terminate pregnancies, both in the United States and overseas. Taken together, Mr. Biden is trying to put a quick stamp on health policies that have been critical to a Democratic resurgence, especially those that back the Affordable Care Act, which he helped secure as President Barack Obama's vice president. President Donald J. Trump failed to overturn the health law, but he spent four years undermining it with a series of executive actions, including allowing the sale of cheap, short-term and small-business health plans that do not meet the law's health coverage mandates. Mr. Biden's first step is to reopen enrollment for health coverage offered through the federal marketplace created under the health law, also known as Obamacare.
And all of these catastrophes were related to climate change.
Fauci, addressing teachers, urges a speedy return to school. About a third of U.S. school are entirely remote. Credit... Bridget Bennett for The New York Times Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, addressing more than 6,000 American teachers in a video meeting, said Thursday evening that students need to return to the classroom for the country to begin recovering. We are not going to get back to normal until we get the children back in school, for the good of the children, the good of the parents and the good of the community, he said. Attending a meeting convened by the two national teachers unions, Dr. Fauci brought with him the message of the Biden administration: that all K-8 schools should aim to reopen within the next 100 days. He said they can expect support from Washington in the form of a new stimulus package to fund sanitation upgrades and other safety measures. As of last month, about one third of American school districts were operating entirely remotely, and Dr. Fauci acknowledged that mitigating factors may make the 100-day goal difficult to achieve in some places. Fielding questions submitted by educators, he did not hesitate to acknowledge potential dangers. He discussed the emergence of new variants of the coronavirus that appear more contagious and more resistant to vaccines. And he said that while he expected vaccines to prevent inoculated teachers from passing the virus onto their loved ones, there was not yet concrete evidence that would be the case.

The tax bill in fact set to $0 — zero dollars — the penalty for not purchasing insurance. It did not otherwise impose any kind of legal duty on people to buy insurance. Indeed, the president and his congressional supporters repeatedly cheered the law's repeal of the mandate; they, and the Congressional Budget Office, did not understand the bill to be strengthening it.
It's both capped in terms of the number of dollars, and it's capped in terms of the income.
The sad truth is that climate politics are probably not going remain as they are today. The future will almost certainly bring increasing harm, through more extreme weather. Eventually, some Republican politicians, especially in coastal states, may be willing to break with party leaders on the issue. Eventually, Americans may decide to punish politicians who deny or play down climate change. By the time a price on carbon took effect, it might not be so unpopular anymore. But we can't wait for the politics to change to begin taking action.
That's why the lack of progressive optimism is so keenly felt. In recent decades, progressives drank too deeply of instant-doomsday claims. If their predictions had come true, today petroleum would be exhausted, huge numbers of major animal species would be extinct, crop failures would be causing mass starvation, developing-world poverty would be getting worse instead of declining fast. (In 1990, 37 percent of humanity lived in what the World Bank defines as extreme poverty; today it's 10 percent.)
Simpler? Perhaps. But not fairer. The Obama subsidies and credits are tied to an individual's income — the lower the income, the larger the benefit.
But right now, two of the major contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, are having an ugly argument about health care that could hurt the party's chances. There are real, important differences between the two men's policy proposals, and it's fine to point that out. What's not fine is the name-calling and false assertions. Both men are behaving badly. And for their party's sake, and their country's, they need to stop it.
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide whether the federal government was entitled to break a promise to shield insurance companies from some of the risks they took in participating in the exchanges established by President Barack Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act.
And this wasn't just a Republican government that passed kind of conventional conservative bills. This was seen as really a laboratory of conservative ideas.

Roughly 50 percent of Pennsylvania's population supports the fracking industry.
Yes. And I think I am less worried than some about, yes, you know, elevating the profile of these four women is just what Trump wanted, in part because the symbol of the Democratic Party in 2020 is going to be the Democratic nominee, who's not going to be one of these four women. But there are also a lot of people in this country for who they are an inspiration. You know, there's a lot of new voters. There's a lot of young voters. Those are the people I think, in many cases, who are going to be knocking on doors and giving a campaign its kind of cultural vitality. And so not only do you need these four women, you also need the perception that the party supports them. It doesn't mean that the party supports everything that they do, but you certainly don't need a House speaker who's out there elevating her fights with these four women in public and kind of seeking to publicly denigrate and marginalize them.
It's true that so far repeated Republican attempts to destroy the Affordable Care Act have failed. In 2012 the Supreme Court rejected claims that the whole law was unconstitutional. In 2017 a Republican-controlled Congress narrowly failed to repeal Obamacare. And a variety of narrower efforts to undermine health reform and send insurance markets into a death spiral have fallen short: Markets seem to have stabilized, and one by one, states that initially rejected Medicaid expansion have been relenting.
These four climate changes are creating a whole new set of governing challenges. They are not the obvious challenges of communism and economic dislocation — as occurred after World War II — when building a NATO, a Marshall Plan and an E.U. were the obvious antidotes. And it is not the obvious challenge and opportunity of spreading democracy and free markets into the vacuum created by the end of communism in 1989. It's the less obvious challenge of stemming the erosion of the pillars of democracy and order built in the previous two eras — but without a single big, obvious bogeyman or falling wall to galvanize us.
We should be grateful that the president at least realizes that he has to spend some airtime with medical experts. (How long will it take before he's driven crazy by the great press Dr. Anthony Fauci is getting? Feel free to place your bets.) But you know he always was, and always will be, a guy who likes pretending everybody in the Fortune 500 is just a comrade in commerce.
And you may start out with modest increments and increase them over time, but there's no reason that we should be treating a country that is producing goods through prison labor or child labor or unsafe working standards or by polluting the earth, that we should treat a country that produces goods in that way the same way we're treating a country that produces goods with standards that are much closer to ours. We simply put our own businesses and our own workers at a competitive disadvantage, so we end up doing things like exporting pollution. Can't pollute here in the United States, but move this polluting industry. This way that you're going to paint dolls or produce chips, move it somewhere else where they have no environmental standards and then resell, and then sell those goods back in the United States.
The shift in legal position won't make much of a difference in the lawsuit itself. Because a group of blue states has intervened, the appeals court will hear a full-throated defense of the law. Most observers expect the court to uphold the Affordable Care Act; if so, the Supreme Court may choose not to hear the case.
Can I just say quickly we've exaggerated them very specifically to put women in a subservient position. Right? So that's the problem, I mean, basically saying that women aren't fit, weren't fit to vote, then weren't fit to run for office, or basically only fit to be a sort of live-in maid, and concubine, and nanny, and are built to do all of the drudgery that men don't want to do but that then kind of makes men's lives easier. That wasn't an accident. But in a way, I think you kind of have to be cognizant of gender in order to see the way that it still functions to women's detriment.
I think it includes anti-competitiveness and unfair trade practices. I think we need to resuscitate the old tying concept that we use.
Many presidents have done in spades what Donald Trump is only talking about doing. The article mentions Mr. Trump's attacks on the press, complaints about the judicial system and bold claims of presidential power.
It would also repeal the individual mandate, which requires all Americans to obtain health insurance if they can afford it, or else face penalties.
Well, the Souter choice was unfortunate, Mr. Bush said, speaking on CNN's State of the Union. He wandered off into the liberal camp for sure.
But budget reconciliation doesn't just alter liberal priorities. Social conservatives often complain that when Republicans hold Congress, their legislative asks are shunted aside for tax cuts and health care repeal laws. That is, in part, a budget reconciliation issue: You can pass tax cuts and (partially) repeal Obamacare through budget reconciliation. You cannot regulate pornography or push school prayer through the process.

The stock market tumble after the government reported an uptick in wages last month suggests just how worried investors on Wall Street are that the Federal Reserve might start increasing interest rates more aggressively to forestall inflation. And the tax cuts and spending increases pumped into an expanding economy since December shorten the odds that the Fed will step in forcefully in the not-too-distant future to bring an overheated expansion to an end.

MC: Not everybody likes Medicare for all, where you do away with private health care. Not everybody is going to appreciate if you've suggested that the candidate that they happen to back now is in the wrong primary. I'm just saying these things will come back as you have to win voters in swing states, things like that.
But a few questions caught her off guard: how to safeguard American nuclear weapons in Turkey; how to respond if China cracked down violently on protesters in Hong Kong; and what she was likely to fail at as president.
Well, I agree with that, but I think the question of what the public is asking for is a more complicated question than that would suggest. So that ultimately, the fact of our division, the fact of our roughly 50-50 country on most election days — not always — is, in some ways, the beginning here. And you're suggesting the parties could change that fact by virtue of what they get through Congress. And I think the question of whether that's quite right is related to the question of how we think about durable minorities and how we think about durable majorities. We are in a time, and we have been for now three decades, where there's not a dominant majority party. Generally speaking, in our history, there has been a dominant party, and the other party basically functions by pushing off it in one way or another, by being against this or for that, in relation to what the majority is doing. We've been living, since the 1990s, in a period where we have two minority parties, and each of them wins elections by getting the public just a little bit more frustrated with the other. And it's just a little bit, and it's generally in a negative way. Most people who win elections now win by not being the other person.
The timing of Nordhaus's Nobel Prize highlighted this political problem. While he was onstage, demonstrators in France were marching against gas-tax increases in raucous protests — the so-called yellow-vest movement — that shut down the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower. This is the ultimate challenge that Nordhaus was describing. Climate change may be an existential crisis, but in their day-to-day lives, many people are more worried about the problems created by the most obvious solution than by climate change itself.

Republicans in the State House of Representatives followed suit, offering a Covid-19 relief plan that would withhold $2.1 billion in federal funding meant to help schools cope with the pandemic until Ms. Whitmer relinquished her authority to shut down in-person learning and sports during a health crisis. That power would shift to local health departments under the Republican plan. The public — and pointed — rejections of the governor's appointments and authority come as Ms. Whitmer is preparing to run for re-election in 2022. No top-tier Republican has come forward to challenge her. Forced to speak remotely instead of in front of both chambers of the Legislature because of pandemic protocols, Ms. Whitmer offered plans to fix roads, provide extra hazard pay to teachers and allocate state resources to help residents who have lost their jobs during the pandemic find employment. But it was the coronavirus, which has infected more than 600,000 Michigan residents and killed more than 15,000 since it was first reported in the state in March, that dominated her address. Ms. Whitmer said she planned to start a statewide tour to encourage Michiganders, Republicans and Democrats alike, to try and find common ground as the state emerges from the pandemic. The tour is designed to focus on what unites us, improve how we talk to each other, she said. My mission is to find common ground so we can emerge from this crisis stronger than ever.
That's a nice one. I like that. So look, I think it's one of the things that, as a country, it's time for us to take it on.
[Read excerpts of The Times's interview with President Trump.]
I think having people here who are working under the table is both bad for American workers and bad for the American economy. One of the reasons I propose to create a pathway to citizenship for everyone who's here to stay, a pathway that is fair and achievable, is to stop the problem of two-tier hiring: those who are hired in the legal system and then those who are hired outside the legal system. People who are undocumented have no protection and are frequently subject to wage theft, to unsafe working conditions, and that's not good for anyone. It's not good for American workers. It's not good for the American economy.
I know that as you sit here it looks like, wow, this woman wants to do a lot and it's hard. And the truth is, it is. I spent my whole life studying working families. Why they go broke, what's happening in America, why America's middle class is being hollowed out. Whole books written about this. And I watch every year two things as it gets worse and worse and worse. Not fire worse. That was 2008 and — everybody is ——
Right. But giving voters a better version of health care provided by the Republican Party has always had to mean more than just getting rid of the system that currently exists. It's this strange kind of bifurcated mental space that Republicans have been living in politically, where they want to run against Democrats for trying to blow up the health care system and replace it with single-payer, and, on the other side, they want to get rid of much of the existing health care system and replace it with something to be named later.
The department's second argument is even more outlandish than its first. It relies on a legal doctrine known as severability, under which courts decide whether the invalidation of one statutory provision requires the court to invalidate related ones. The Justice Department claims that the tax bill's super mandate is unconstitutional (something that no one in Congress or the presidency noticed when they enacted the bill) and that courts must invalidate other rules along with it.
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to decide whether the federal government was entitled to break a promise to shield insurance companies from some of the risks they took in participating in the exchanges established by President Barack Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act.
It's very hard, in part, to know what to do with these kinds of polls, where a lot of people take the question to be, are you a Republican or a Democrat, and whatever the specific question is, they answer it that way. But it also points to a real rot in the culture of the Republican Party. And I think we've seen, in the wake of the election, although it was evident before, of course, a kind of turn to the fantasy and escapism and conspiracism that is extremely dangerous for the country. And when a party veers in these directions, it finds itself in tremendous trouble. So the lessons are red flags. They're blaring warnings. And I think it is absolutely incumbent upon leaders of the Republican Party to help their voters separate fact from fiction and reality from fantasy and conspiracy. That's always necessary in a populist era. It's always necessary on the left and the right in populist times. And there have been times when the left has fallen into conspiracy in similar ways. But I think, at this point, the challenge on this front is for the right, and it is absolutely necessary for elected officials on the right to avoid pretending that false things are true. That's what happened with Hawley and Cruz and others in the wake of the election. And they tried to do it as carefully as they could and in ways that let them say, well, we're just asking questions.
Mr. Westover responded that he had a pistol in the center console of his car. Mr. Westover was also charged with carrying a pistol without a license.
Mr. Ammiano, who would grow up to become one of the country's pioneering gay leaders, an early openly gay comedian and a prominent California elected official, found that he loved running long distance. He helped his team win meets and in 1958, his junior year, he won his final one-mile run.
But who's going to get Mosul, really? We'll take Mosul eventually. But the way — if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher. Much more dangerous. Going to be more deaths that they thought.
Democrats in the Senate yesterday selected Gary Peters, a moderate senator from Michigan who fended off a strong G.O.P. challenger last fall, to run their campaign arm in 2022.
Senator Sherrod Brown, the incoming chairman of the Banking Committee, announced yesterday that he planned to hold a hearing on the current state of the stock market.
In the president's public statements, and as far as we can tell based on his personal thinking, he recognizes that health care is a huge political vulnerability for Republicans, that the last thing they did on health care, that big repeal drive, was politically devastating to them. And his proclamation that they need to become the party of health care clearly reflects an understanding that a problem needs to be fixed.
In October, Senator Warren's campaign bought ads that read: Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election. The campaign was intended as a critique of Facebook's decision not to fact-check or remove political ads. (Updated) Facebook did not remove from the social network the ad falsely endorsing Mr. Trump.
I would say that, in 2016, Donald Trump managed to stomp a lot of Republican politicians in that primary, who, even if they're a little bit more stuck in an older version of Republican Party orthodoxy, did approach politics more in that way. They did have policy ideas. They wanted to be constructive. Marco Rubio, even then, was trying to begin breaking with some parts of Republican Party orthodoxy or conservative orthodoxy to try to come up with a slightly more working-class agenda. And Trump just won. And there were a lot of tributaries to that victory, and some of them were the media coverage he's able to command and so on. But he was also right that much of the Republican base wanted to have this fight over who rules and wanted to have more of a fight over what kind of country America is. So when I look now at the Republican Party in Congress, I see a lot more learning of that lesson than I do of any policy lesson. I was very, very disturbed that such a large majority of the House Republican conference voted against certifying the electoral college results, even after all that happened on that day. You had these stories of Republicans down there in the safe space not putting on masks. There is a real re-centering of this politics of pure fight than you had before.
JI: So you have, on one hand, the boldest public option that's probably been offered by any of the Democratic candidates. On the other hand, you have the most aggressive Medicare for all universal plan that's been offered. You'll be, if I understand it correctly, starting with this aggressive public option hoping to segue to a Medicare for all by year three, and in the middle of all that, you will probably be called upon to defend the Affordable Care Act at the Supreme Court level. How do you think about those three — and of distinct — that just seems like an awful lot of health care reform.
I have a plan to build about 3.2 million new housing units across this country to make money available for changing zoning and working together across municipal boundaries on joint projects that increase density and trying to use the federal government as a partner to move forward in bringing down the cost overall for housing.
SS: The Obama administration tried that, Trump administration tried that in different ways, but no results. What kind of leverage would you use? What would you do?
The value of health insurance skyrocketed for a lot of Americans, said Michael Marchand, chief marketing officer for the Washington Health Benefit Exchange. All of a sudden masks, Clorox wipes and health insurance became really important.
The outlook after that is murky, to say the least. President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress are working to dismantle former President Barack Obama's signature health law, known as Obamacare. But repealing and replacing the law, which has expanded health insurance to an estimated 20 million people through individual marketplace plans and the expansion of state Medicaid programs, is complicated. Several proposals have been floated, but it's not yet clear which, if any, will prevail. And Congress has yet to confirm Tom Price, Mr. Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Healthcare.gov.
I mean, one of the main ways we can kind of recognize this as a society and the importance of language for people who have worries about it is for cisgender people to start adopting this. I didn't think exactly that what I was advocating was to use language to change politics as much as language has to reflect how our culture and politics are changing. And the culture is changing, and we really have to match the language or at least turn out some wrinkles in the language in order to match how people feel and how the language reflects how they feel.
And not just from the few remaining relatively moderate Republicans.
As much as I was against it, he said, at this point I'm against the repeal.
We have The One again, a New One — another lanky, bookish, handsome man with an attractive young family, a thin résumé, an exotic name, a hip affect, a rock star aura, an enticing smile, a liberal press corps ready to fluff his pillows and a frothing Fox News.
But it's not going to be real change because so long as the lobbyists are writing it, so long as they're the ones who are in the ears of the folks in the House and the Senate, we're just going to keep making little, tiny changes, and I just don't think we can keep doing that.
The evidence of that coming betrayal is obvious in the choice of an array of pro-corporate, anti-labor figures for key positions. In particular, the most important story of the week — seriously, people, stop focusing on Trump Twitter — was the selection of Tom Price, an ardent opponent of Obamacare and advocate of Medicare privatization, as secretary of health and human services. This choice probably means that the Affordable Care Act is doomed — and Mr. Trump's most enthusiastic supporters will be among the biggest losers.
Yet there is at least one big area in which the Roberts court has continued to lean strongly right: business regulation.
The changes will last only for two years. But for some, they will be considerable: The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a 64-year-old earning $58,000 would see monthly payments decline from $1,075 under current law to $412 because the federal government would take up much of the cost. The rescue plan also includes rich new incentives to entice the few holdout states — including Texas, Georgia and Florida — to finally expand Medicaid to those with too much money to qualify for the federal health program for the poor, but too little to afford private coverage.
JI: I want to just pivot very quickly to health care. It seemed like a good moment. With respect to what you will fight for, can you talk a little bit about Medicare for all and where it ranks in terms of your priorities, and then to kind of sort of reiterate the question, how do you convince people who are wary of massive health care overhaul yet again that that's the right approach to that problem basically?
But the measure landed in rough seas ahead of a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, wants next week. Four conservative senators, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, announced that they would oppose it without changes — more than enough to bring it down.
This appears to be a misrepresented statistic. A 2019 report from the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University found that the median white student borrower has paid back 94 percent of his or her student debt, while the median black student borrower has paid back 5 percent. Read the report here.
States were allowed to suspend the requirement during the recession, but most have brought it back as unemployment has dropped. It generally applies to adults ages 18 to 49 unless they are pregnant, have dependent children or are medically certified as unfit for employment.
The administration may not use amounts collected for the Treasury to make payments to insurance companies, said the ruling, signed by Susan A. Poling, the general counsel of the G.A.O.
I'll defend the Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the Trump administration. That I can do all by myself.
As far as I am concerned, that's the only choice on the ballot. It's a choice between letting Trump retain control of all the key levers of political power for two more years, or not.
[We tracked down the 2020 Democrats and asked them the same set of questions. Watch them answer.]
It is more accurate to say 'repair Obamacare,' Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate health committee, said this week. We can repair the individual market, and that is a good place to start.
From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today, President Trump has backed away from his call to replace the Affordable Care Act with a Republican alternative. Alex Burns on why the president's own party talked him out of it. It's Wednesday, April 3.
So what should we say about the Obama job record? Private-sector employment — the relevant number, as I'll explain in a minute — hit its low point in February 2010. Since then we've gained 14 million jobs, a figure that startled even me, roughly double the number of jobs added during the supposed Bush boom before it turned into the Great Recession. If that was a boom, this expansion, capped by last month's really good report, outbooms it by a wide margin.
The court had heard arguments on the law a month earlier, and Kennedy had already told the other justices he considered it unconstitutional. He wanted to strike it down. Roberts had a different view, wanting to invalidate some of the law and keep other parts. During their conversations that April, the two of them talked through the substantive issues that the case involved, like the law's health insurance mandate, the cost of insurance premiums and so on.
In court, the Trump administration is trying to get all of Obamacare erased. But at the White House, President Trump and his health officials are busily using the law to pursue key proposals.
Some ads focus on a personal connection to the issue, like the health history of a candidate or a candidate's relative. Some focus on an opponent's role in the lawsuit. Many House campaigns are using health care as part of attack ads against Republican incumbents who voted last year for the American Health Care Act, which would have unwound major parts of the Affordable Care Act. Some ads talk about the Affordable Care Act directly, but many gesture at it more obliquely, with talk of pre-existing conditions alone.
CW: I'm just curious, do you think that Facebook could tip the scales in favor of a candidate? What did you mean by that specific power and is it something that an employee like Mark Zuckerberg is going to wield on his own or just the company's power in political influence?
But a second amendment, introduced Thursday, would restore one of the taxes for six years. Wages of more than $200,000 will still be subject to a 0.9 percent Medicare payroll tax until 2023, if the change is adopted.
KK: We have time for, I think, one or two more questions.
I mean, he doesn't have a whole group of old friends.
WASHINGTON — El expresidente Barack Obama debe haber pensado que iba a tener mucho material para defenderse cuando fuera juzgado por la historia. Seguramente suponía que, entre otras cosas, podría señalar su programa de cobertura médica, su amplio acuerdo comercial con Asia, el pacto climático global y su apertura diplomática con Cuba.
I'll be the first to admit I'm as surprised as anyone to be in this position, said Brad Woodhouse, the executive director of the health care advocacy group Protect Our Care . Mr. Woodhouse worked at the Democratic National Committee when the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, and saw Democrats struggle to discuss it in the years afterward. But every poll we take, it's the issue that's most important to people.
After Senator Warren said during the October debate that the United States should get out of the Middle East, her campaign clarified that she was referring just to combat troops. Noncombat troops have long been stationed in the region for a variety of reasons including ensuring a free flow of oil.
To see what I mean, consider three stories about health care policies.
But why has Trump turned out to be such a conventional Republican? My sense is that he doesn't really care about policy, aside from protectionism, which I'll get to in a minute. And he certainly doesn't feel any empathy for less fortunate Americans, or actually anyone. So he was happy to make what amounts to an implicit deal with the Republican establishment: You get to implement your usual policy agenda, and I get a free pass on my corruption and abuse of power.
Look, the uncharitable way of describing this would be opportunism. The charitable way of saying this would be influence. And the fact is, one of the central dynamics of Washington, circa 2019, circa the Trump administration, is that never has the decision point been so wrapped up in the mercurialness of one single person as it is right now in Donald Trump's orbit. And Lindsey Graham has made himself a part of that orbit. Now, it might not last beyond next week. It might not last beyond his re-election. Who knows where this is going to end? Lindsey Graham posed that question himself to me. But for now, he seems to think it's very, very advantageous for him politically.
I definitely think that Sanders was part of it. And if you talk to him, he definitely thinks he was part of it — that he really brought this into the mainstream of our political conversation. But I think there are a couple of other factors. One is that after Trump became president, the first thing he tried to do in legislation was repeal the Affordable Care Act. And, you know, Republicans had a lot of indications that was going to be a good idea. Their voters had been telling them for years that they really didn't like Obamacare and they wanted it to go away. But actually, that turned out to be kind of politically perilous for the Republicans.
But even if you do that— and I support those moves, there are all kinds of ideas on that front— on the big issues, the ones that really matter to us, there are still going to be filibusters. There's no way around that. And I think a lot of the reason why there are so many more filibusters now is also the increasing centralization of control of the Senate schedule, where the party leaders arrange things such that most votes that make it to the floor are clean and convenient kinds of party votes, where their members all know how to go. Otherwise, they wouldn't have gotten to the floor. That, in itself, ought to change, and I think there are ways to empower committee leaders to control some floor time to put some very uncomfortable votes on the floor for the minority party, whoever that happens to be. And a fair number of its members might feel like they need to vote for that bill because they believe in it or their voters want to see them support it. Senators now almost never have to take those kinds of votes. And so we're in a place where, in some ways, the cause and effect of the filibuster and inaction are hard to pull apart. But I think, ultimately, it is a good thing for a very narrow majority to have to get some support from the minority for its big ideas, if those are going to endure.
Elizabeth Warren, in her interview with the Times editorial board [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] on Dec. 4, largely stuck to her polished script — which the senior senator from Massachusetts said she has delivered 175 times — calling for big structural change to right the imbalances in the current American economy and end what she sees as endemic corruption in business and politics. She famously has a plan for that and had a (lengthy) answer for nearly every question.
Projected cumulative change in deficit under the Republican plan
The most conservative House members are pushing for a fast repeal of the health law with only a bare-bones replacement to follow: possibly just bigger incentives for people to open health savings accounts to fund their own health needs. Other Republicans are more interested in taking their time to come up with a replacement plan that, as of now, they have failed to cobble together beyond a menu of options.
There's also reason to think that, in a world where community rating and guaranteed issue disappear but the rest of Obamacare remains, many more people would be turned down for insurance than in the pre-A.C.A. days. That's because the Trump administration wants to leave other insurance regulations in place that didn't exist before the health law. Obamacare says that all health plans need to cover a standard set of health benefits and can't limit the amount they will pay in a year. In the old days, plans often didn't cover prescription drugs or treatment for mental illness. Those strategies helped weed out customers who had expensive health needs and limited the companies' risk.
Consider the television markets across Texas; though they are heavily Republican areas, Mr. Bloomberg has often had the airwaves all to himself. He has been the only candidate on air in seven markets in Texas, spending a total of $4.3 million in those areas, though Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mr. Steyer recently began advertising in a few. Still, he remains the only candidate consistently on air in Amarillo, Tyler, Sherman and Wichita Falls.
Critics of the wealth tax point out that only four European countries now have one, down from 12 in 1990. In France, the wealth tax triggered an exodus of the ultrarich and didn't raise as much revenue as anticipated.

His intransigence placed him well to the right of Republican leadership, including former Speaker John Boehner, whom he repeatedly opposed for — get this — being excessively soft on curbing disbursements from the federal purse.
Stephen Miller, a former Senate press aide and the incoming senior White House adviser for policy, who has been particularly aggressive in presenting himself as the voice of Mr. Trump on all policy matters, has pushed the notion that a plan should move quickly and in tandem with a replacement measure, rather than in a series of smaller bills, congressional aides said.
Senator Warren's support among young people — the Gen Z and millennial voters she describes, saddled with debt — has been on the rise. A November poll from Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics found that 22 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds support her, up from 4 percent in March.
Never in modern American history has a president so transparently aimed to destroy a piece of major legislation. What makes Mr. Trump's sabotage especially undemocratic is that Congress has repeatedly considered repealing the law — and repeatedly declined to do so. In addition, the Supreme Court has twice sustained the Affordable Care Act in the face of major legal challenges. Mr. Trump's attempt to destroy the law any way he can is an unconstitutional usurpation of power.
So the way I see this is all I can do is get out and tell you what I'll fight for, and I'll point out the difference between the two. I try not to get over my skis. No, I do.

That Brill sees hope emerging from the literal rubble shows the limits of a certain strain of politics, one that sees public policy mainly in terms of incentives, with the most desirable outcome being an electorate that will now settle in the middle.

A Federal District Court judge in Texas agreed, ruling that the entire law was invalid, but he postponed the effects of his ruling until the case could be appealed. In December, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, agreed that the mandate was unconstitutional but declined to rule on the fate of the remainder of the health law, asking the lower court to reconsider the question in more detail.
But after weeks of loud protests, boisterous town hall meetings and scores of quieter meetings between members of Congress and health care professionals, patients, caregivers and hospital managers in their districts, it is becoming increasingly likely that a consensus in the House will be just as hard to reach.
Senator Warren said in an interview with Vox's Ezra Klein that many other economic policies should be accomplished before the government starts sending out checks to every American, as Mr. Yang's Freedom Dividend proposes.
Democrats, who consider health care a winning issue and worry about possible changes in the composition of the Supreme Court, had urged the justices to act quickly even though lower courts had not issued definitive rulings. They wanted to focus political attention on the health law's most popular provisions — like guaranteed coverage for pre-existing medical conditions, emergency care, prescription drugs and maternity care — and to ensure that the case was decided while justices who had rejected earlier challenges to the law remain on the court.
The insurers, some which have already started leaving the marketplaces because they are losing money, say they need a clear commitment from the Trump administration and congressional leaders that the government will continue offsetting some costs for low-income people. They also want to keep in place rules that encourage young and healthy people to sign up, which the insurers say are crucial to a stable market for individual buyers.

a growing sense among some policymakers, as well as among many in the pro-immigrant advocacy community, that the entire enforcement apparatus must be unwound. Certainly, enforcement reforms are necessary, as the following sections of this report explain. But the move to reject enforcement entirely — even in theory — only fuels louder calls for maximum enforcement.
Asian -Americans are the fastest-growing group in the United States and most economically unequal. While we are business leaders in a rapidly changing service economy, we are also low-income new immigrants: waiters, seamstresses and home health care workers who suffer under the double whammy of political invisibility and economic insecurity as wages stagnate.
At least when the Republicans are in power, you certainly hear a lot of criticism of the filibuster. I think they're wrong. I think they're wrong because, ultimately, we're all likely, sooner or later, especially in an era where power shifts back and forth, to find ourselves in that large minority facing that narrow majority. And I think it is important that narrow majorities can't make big changes in how our government does what it does. That's not a reason for us being unable to make any changes in how our system works. I think that is the result of a different problem, of a sense that we are passive in the face of the structure of the system. I talk to a lot of members of Congress. For my sins, I spent a lot of time with congressional Republicans. And I would say, they all have complaints about how Congress works. They all even have complaints about how the budget process works. When you say to them, well, you could just change it, it's up to you, that feels like news. And it's not the way they've ever really thought about the role they have. I think changing that and helping people see that the structure, the rules of the system — within the bounds of the Constitution, which are pretty broad bounds, in most respects — that system can be changed, and we should think about how it should be changed.

Part of Mr. McCain's legacy, which is yet to be fully understood, should serve as a warning to us. We can honor John McCain the man while having reservations about his political career. Among the things for which he will be remembered are his service to the country in the United States Navy, his advocacy for a strong military, his opposition to torture, the Keating Five scandal, two unsuccessful presidential runs, his yearslong feud with conservatives in his own party and the vote that killed Obamacare reform. It's a mixed bag. So let's honor the good and noble in Mr. McCain's life while not being afraid to be point out — and even carry on — legitimate political disagreements.

The tension between incremental and transformative change has been a feature of the 2020 campaign. Mr. Obama, for instance, weighed in to say that the typical American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system, an implicit critique of Senator Warren's and Senator Sanders's campaigns.
Mr. Trump's decision nearly four years ago was a shock to the UNFPA, which had counted on the United States, a founding member, as a critical source of funding. Overnight, the agency lost nearly $70 million. Dr. Natalia Kanem, the fund's executive director, welcomed Mr. Biden's order, which she said would greatly help the agency's work not only in family planning but in other health services to struggling women and girls in poor countries. We now have the support of a very important member state, Dr. Kanem said in a phone interview, expressing gratitude that the Biden administration had embraced her agency's work around the world. Mr. Biden is also directing the Department of Health and Human Services to take immediate action, his administration said, to consider whether to rescind the so-called domestic gag rule — a regulation imposed by the Trump administration that prohibits family planning clinics that receive federal funding from counseling patients about abortion. Such a change would likely require the department to write new regulations, a process that could take months. The president's Obamacare directive will also instruct federal agencies to review policies — including waivers that allowed states to impose work requirements — that discourage participation in Medicaid, the public health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Enrollment in Medicaid has grown substantially during the coronavirus pandemic, in part because people who have lost jobs and their health insurance have turned to Medicaid for coverage.

In Colorado, John Hickenlooper, the state's former governor, survived a rough campaign to win his Democratic Senate primary, propelling him to a general election challenge to Senator Cory Gardner, a Republican and top target for Democrats looking to capture control of the Senate.

I disagreed with them. So for example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership had a robust investor state dispute resolution mechanism, which multiple of our trade treaties have had for decades now. And I just think that's fundamentally wrong. It's a two-tier system that says, in effect, we'll make a bunch of promises in a trade deal on the environment, on use of prison labor, child labor and on anything else, and then we'll give two entirely different enforcement mechanisms.

In 2009, when the Affordable Care Act was being written, Sarah Palin popularized the phrase Obama's 'death panel,' which became a rallying cry for the Tea Party.
When even a bipartisan agreement on immigration reform, focused on employment-based green cards, died on the Senate floor in September, it demonstrated just how difficult it has become to get any immigration reform legislation through Congress.
The political theory behind this maximalism is an assertion that a bold populist program would transform the electoral landscape, winning over white working-class voters and bringing a surge of new voters, all of this on a scale sufficient both to win a smashing victory in November and to intimidate centrist members of Congress into accepting radical proposals.
Gail: So, we've got a disagreement! Doesn't happen all that often these days, what with the big guy in the White House bringing liberals and conservatives together in bipartisan gaping horror. There's been some feeling that this last week was the beginning of the end for Trump, but I see no evidence whatsoever that anybody in his party who's planning to run for re-election is prepared to call him out. What do you think happens next?
The court, even with two Trump appointees, moves with the illuminated society around it. Trump just grovels before his blinkered base. And while Trump is often clueless about public opinion, the court seems to be at least loosely tethered to it, as with a 5-to-4 ruling on Thursday that nixed his intended scuttling of a program that protected immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation. In some polling, about three-quarters of Americans support that program.
So we have a shrinking supply and a growing population, and that means tens of millions of people are paying more to get less. So how can you turn that around? And the answer is to make a bigger investment in housing supply directly. And that includes housing for middle-class families, for working-class families, for the working poor, for the poor, for seniors who want to age in place, for people with disabilities, for people who've been incarcerated. Expanding housing supply directly, but also using federal dollars to help encourage cities and small towns and rural areas to adopt housing practices, that will lower costs even further. I just think that's a more effective way to get real structural change.
The Black Death — when the bubonic plague killed an estimated 30 percent to 60 percent of the European population in the mid-1300s — is an extreme example of how pandemics can rebalance societies.
JB: And leave the Kurds to their fate?
Well, I think part of it is how much you're willing to do two things: how much you are willing to push and how much you're willing to be creative about the various ways in which it's done. You know, we did the same thing in Asia with South Korea, with Japan, about which costs the South Koreans pick up and which costs the Americans pick up. The cost of moving, the cost of consolidating the land, the cost of maintaining security around the perimeter. There are a lot of different ways that we can do this, and I think we should be doing this much more in partnership. I think hectoring them and putting their leaders in an embarrassing position domestically, for each of them, do you cave in to the United States president who is trying to throw his weight around by picking up a bigger share of the defense budget? I don't think that's a way to further success in this area.
A government plan, even a Medicare buy-in, could shrink the number of customers buying policies on the Obamacare markets, making them less appealing for leading insurers, according to many health insurers, policy analysts and even some Democrats.
I think there's a question that gets asked a lot today, which is, where does the Republican Party go from here? And I don't want to ask that specific question. I think it is a axiomatically important, that America needs a responsible right-wing party. It needs a party on the right that governs, that is, in some way or another, committed to the system itself. I think this is how political systems work, and they don't work well if the right-wing party goes off the rails. So I think you have views about where the Republican Party should go. It would be, ideologically, not the right party for me, but I think I'd probably be happier if you were in charge over there. So how does the Republican Party change? When you think about what's going to happen to it, as an institution, what are the levers? What are the pathways? Who are the leaders? When you think about a good future for the Republican Party, one that moves in a direction you'll be happier with, what are the points of pressure and power that can be leveraged there?
The Kaiser Family Foundation's Health Care Tracking Poll has found a decline in public support for Medicare for all since the start of the year. Now roughly 51 percent of American adults are in favor of a single-payer system and 47 percent are opposed, whereas earlier this year 57 percent backed it and 37 percent were opposed.
So now, we are basically back where we started. The Affordable Care Act is likely to remain the law of the land. So what did we learn from this weeklong ordeal?
The People and Forces Behind America's Fifty-Year Fall — and Those Fighting to Reverse It
And at times, the tweaks and fixes seem to be at war with one another. Those same short-term plans are likely to pull healthy people out of the exchanges, further destabilizing the markets and creating pressure to prop them up with subsidies and stabilization funds, which cost the government money.
Ties between some Republican lawmakers and extremist groups are under scrutiny after the Capitol riot. Representative Paul Gosar, Republican of Arizona, speaking to protesters in November outside the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center in Phoenix. Credit... Jim Urquhart/Reuters Nearly 150 House Republicans supported President Donald J. Trump's baseless claims that the election had been stolen from him. But a handful of the chamber's Republicans had deeper ties to extremist groups who pushed violent ideas and conspiracy theories and whose members were prominent among those who stormed the halls of Congress in an effort to stop certification of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory. Their ranks include Representatives Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar, both of Arizona, as well as Representatives Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida. It is not clear whether any elected officials played a role in directly facilitating the attack on the Capitol, other than helping to incite violence through false statements about the election being stolen from Mr. Trump. Officials have said they are investigating reports from Democrats that a number of House Republicans provided tours of the Capitol and other information to people who might have gone on to be part of the mob on Jan. 6. No evidence has surfaced publicly to back up those claims.
Democrats still need to come up with a compelling candidate against Trump. But the midterms told us that there is an important coalition of independents, moderate Republicans and suburban women no longer so sold on Trump.
Well, it's not good for them and in a dozen different ways. Wages are part of it, but they are only part of it. It's about unsafe working conditions, for example. If you can hire somebody for cash and not meet current labor standards on safety, that someone needs a safety belt or needs training to go up high on a building, you not only put that person at risk, you reward employers who continue not to follow the law and to undermine safety standards for everyone.
I'm Lindsey Graham, and I'm running for president of the United States.

After the endorsement interview, Senator Warren reached out to Mr. Warzel to clarify her response on 20th century antitrust. In that follow-up interview, she said: Antitrust law is a very valuable tool and breaking them up would have important effects but what I realized after I left in the room is that I was pulled in a different direction but I never finished to say that antitrust law is important but not the only tool we need. I don't believe that markets alone are going to fix all the problems we're facing on the tech side. Particularly the issues around privacy and the values that come from aggregation on platforms and how that value would be distributed. I don't believe only antitrust works but I do believe its a powerful tool we should be using in dealing with Big Tech.
In 1959, then vice president Richard Nixon—who would go on, as president, to create the Environmental Protection Agency, consider a basic minimum income, and propose a national health-care plan more ambitious than Obamacare—spoke with derision of those who sought to cleave the parties by their beliefs. It would be a great tragedy if we had our two major political parties divide on what we would call a conservative-liberal line, he said. The strength of the American political system is we have avoided generally violent swings in Administrations from one extreme to the other. And the reason we have avoided that is that in both parties there has been room for a broad spectrum of opinion.
It's hard to predict precisely who will choose what. The administration wrote in its rule proposals that it didn't anticipate either the short-term or association plans to be very popular, even as it lauded them as important alternatives to the current options under the health law. The new options may mostly attract people who are uninsured now, because they were priced out of the current market. Outside experts think the alternatives could siphon away a substantial percentage of healthy people from the Obamacare markets.
Yeah, I can imagine. Nobody ever wants to answer this probably. To try this, you've got to have an optimism bias. And I do. I know that. It's an optimism bias that keeps me working 14 hours a day. It's an optimism bias that pulls you in more and more people to try to talk about it.
Economists and other policy experts have long focused on this idea of carbon pricing. It can take the form of a carbon tax, as Nordhaus prefers. Or the pricing can be embedded in a system of permits known as cap-and-trade, as President Barack Obama and other Democrats proposed in their 2009 bill to address climate change. Either way, the underlying concept is simple. When a product becomes more expensive, people use less of it. Carbon pricing is an elegant mechanism by which market economics can work on behalf of the climate rather than against it.
Also, they could have a huge, super campaign song, believe me, if they were able to borrow the music from the absolutely great Stephen Sondheim. Folks, just try singing it yourselves to see just how catchy it is. It is so catchy:
In the age of populist revolts and anti-elite crusades , we ought to have known that Wall Street traders would get some kind of comeuppance. And across parties, politicians are feeling obligated to side with the insurgents, no matter where they usually come down on matters of Wall Street regulation.
In other news from around the world: Madrid will suspend its vaccination program for two weeks because of a supply shortage, the authorities in Spain's capital region said on Wednesday. The deputy head of Madrid's regional government, Ignacio Aguado, told a news conference that priority needed to be given to administering second doses of the vaccine, particularly to frontline health care workers and residents of nursing homes. Mr. Aguado urged the central government of Spain to urgently demand extra supplies from the European Union. Separately, the regional government of the northeastern region of Catalonia, also warned on Wednesday that a supply shortage was affecting its rollout program. Tomorrow our fridges will be empty, one regional health official, Josep Maria Argimon, said.
During a 10-day break for the Supreme Court in April 2012, several justices left Washington to give lectures or take short vacations. But both John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy remained in Washington, and Roberts used the time to try to win over Kennedy on Obamacare.

WASHINGTON — Emergency financing to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus appeared likely to be delayed until after Congress returns from its Fourth of July recess, as Democrats on Wednesday sharply criticized a new Republican proposal to provide $1.1 billion, but with $750 million redirected from other federal programs.
Mr. Ryan had earlier postponed the initial House vote that was scheduled for Thursday to coincide with the seventh anniversary of the Affordable Care Act's signing. Mr. Trump confronted the possibility of a humiliating loss on the first significant legislative push of his presidency.
We need to have Medicare for all.
Well, I'm not sure I accept the premise of the question, that they actually tried what I was talking about. Look, our No. 1 leverage is everybody wants the American consumer. They want access to the American consumer. They want to be able to sell us all of their stuff because the American consumer is not only the engine of about 70 percent of our economy; it's a worldwide engine. So I think it's perfectly reasonable to say, if you want to be able to trade with United States on the best possible terms, then everybody needs to raise their standards just a little. Who wants to do that?
NATO members agreed, in 2014, to a goal of spending 2 percent of their G.D.P. on defense, but in 2017 the only countries to meet that goal were America, Britain, Greece, Poland and Estonia. Mr. Trump chastised fellow member states at a 2017 summit, declaring that 23 of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should.
While denying that the military had seized power, they said that Mr. Mugabe and his family are safe and sound, and their security is guaranteed. (Above, Mr. Mugabe and his wife, Grace, last week.)
In the 1990s, the Clintons have an idea to try to achieve universal health care. But largely for the same reasons that we had trouble with this before — concerns about socialism, industry opposition — those proposals essentially get batted down.
Biden signs orders aimed at expanding health care access, including abortion, and opening Obamacare enrollment. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:06 - 0:00 transcript Health Care Orders Undo 'Damage Trump Has Done,' Biden Says President Biden took executive action to expand health care access by strengthening the Affordable Care Act and reopening enrollment. He also moved to protect reproductive rights and expand abortion access. Today, we're about to sign two executive orders. Basically, the best way to describe it, to undo the damage Trump has done. There's nothing new that we're doing. The first one I'm going to be signing here is to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. And of all times that we need to reinstate access to affordability of and extent of access to Medicaid, is now, in the middle of this Covid crisis. And the second order I'm signing relates to protecting women's health at home and abroad, and it reinstates the changes that were made in Title X and other things, making it harder for women to have access to affordable health care as it relates to reproductive rights. President Biden took executive action to expand health care access by strengthening the Affordable Care Act and reopening enrollment. He also moved to protect reproductive rights and expand abortion access.
Now, that's only for collective bargaining agreements, but that's real money in the pockets of those union numbers. Secondly, what at least some of the unions liked about this is the unions never have to bargain on this one again, once you get all the way to Medicare for all, because their workers will have health care coverage. Which means they can bargain once again over wages and working conditions and keeping jobs here in the United States instead of having to go back to their members year after year after year and say: We just bargained. Great for you. Your salary will go up one half of 1 percent, and your deductible will only go up by another $2,000.
Well, that's a beautiful, broad question. I mean, a party is always a coalition, and the Republican Party is more self-consciously a coalition than it used to be. Republicans, for most of my lifetime, were able to think of themselves as a party unified by a set of views — broadly conservative, kind of Reaganite views. But I think it has always been true that the party is actually more coalitional than that. That there is a conservative segment of its electorate, and there is a populist segment of its electorate. There's a more business-oriented and libertarian segment. And the differences between those have become much clearer over time and especially have become much clearer in the crucible of the last few years under Trump. And I think the party emerges from Trumpism much more self-consciously coalitional and really facing the question, the struggle of how now to define itself, how to find voters and expand its electorate, how to keep its base engaged — really fundamental questions that the party has to take up really fundamentally. It's allowed itself, to much too great a degree, to become a cult of personality around Donald Trump. And now Trump gets pulled out of the political arena, we hope — I hope, anyway. And the question for the party is, without that, what are we about? I think there's a conservative answer to that. There's going to be a populist answer to that. There's inevitably going to be a libertarian or business answer to that.
If Biden and Congress succeed at the big ideas, and not just the reversal of wrongful executive orders or unpopular legislation, he will be fondly remembered, even if he serves only one term. What's more, he may even able to bring enough fresh air into our toxic political atmosphere to realign things.

And that's why they proceeded with the primary.
Elizabeth Warren, in her interview with the Times editorial board [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] on Dec. 4, largely stuck to her polished script — which the senior senator from Massachusetts said she has delivered 175 times — calling for big structural change to right the imbalances in the current American economy and end what she sees as endemic corruption in business and politics. She famously has a plan for that and had a (lengthy) answer for nearly every question.
The first thing you need to understand here is that Republican talk of repeal and replace has always been a fraud. The G.O.P. has spent six years claiming that it will come up with a replacement for Obamacare any day now; the reason it hasn't delivered is that it can't.

SS: Well, speaking of using leverage, you've argued that nations that want to trade with the United States should be held to higher standards.
A meritocracy seemed like an improvement — in theory. Brill argues that reformers ended up creating a new aristocracy even more entrenched than the one it supplanted. Meritocrats were able to consolidate their winnings, outsmart and co-opt the government that might have reined them in, and pull up the ladder so more could not share in their success or challenge their primacy. The winners in this new dispensation feel their privilege has been earned, rendering them self-satisfied and unresponsive.
It's that you don't get the tariff benefit. This is what it's really about. Where's the baseline? Right? And is the baseline one that says, across the board, you've got to give plenty of notice. You've got to work through, make sure you've got something that's achievable for countries we trade with. But this is not like trying to institute a trade war. This is not like saying we're mad at you and therefore we're going to impose all these tariffs on you, and doing it as Donald Trump has done by tweet.
This is the advice — some might even call it a warning — that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been drilling into her caucus of late. If Democrats want to send President Trump packing in 2020, she told The Times recently, they must resist being pulled toward the hard, partisan fringes in ways likely to turn off the middle.
In the meantime, the law remains almost entirely intact but faces an uncertain future.

So my plan to forgive student loan debt is capped at $50,000 and an income of $250,000. And the reason for that is because it is the best way, not only to give maximum forgiveness to a lot of people who are struggling, but it also helps close the black-white wealth gap, and is part of the reason that the N.A.A.C.P. endorsed it along with the other parts I was doing about investment in our colleges. But I really worked through hard on these numbers to deal with exactly that question and that's why I got the numbers where they are. I don't think they raise that same issue. I'm not ——
So let me do the pitch, because I'll tell you exactly what the pitch is. That is the Affordable Care Act already requires employers to provide health care for their workers if they have more than 50 workers. I propose we just keep that in place, and that will yield about $9 trillion over the next 10 years. That's what they pay.
In 1950, Thomas Dewey, the former governor of New York and the GOP's 1944 nominee for president, freely admitted that if the measure of a real political party was a unified organization with a national viewpoint on major issues, neither the Republican nor Democratic Party qualified. Dewey thought this a great strength, since no single religion or color or race or economic interest is confined to one or the other of our parties. Each party is to some extent a reflection of the other. . . . This is perhaps part of the secret of our enormous power, that a change from one party to the other has usually involved a continuity of action and policy of the nation as a whole on most fundamentals. He allowed that there were those who rail at both parties, saying they represent nothing but a choice between Tweedledee and Tweedledum. If the critics had their way, he said, they then would have everything very neatly arranged, indeed. The Democratic Party would be the liberal-to-radical party. The Republican Party would be the conservative-to-reactionary party. (Narrator: They would have their way.)
Mara Gay: Actually, that's a perfect point for me to just ask you a question that's related. My family is from Michigan, and U.A.W. workers. One of the last things that they really love, many of them, is their health care. So I guess my question is, is both a practical one and a political one, which is why not try and expand health care access without actually taking away programs that people already like? Is there a way to do that? Is there even a way to get to what you're talking about without talking about it in such dogmatic political terms, and how do you — this is I guess the most important part of the question, I think, is how do you make the pitch to a U.A.W. worker that what you can offer is actually better than what they already have?
There's a wooing going on, David French warned in National Review in March under the headline The Temptation of John Roberts. His focus was not the census case but abortion and the Mueller report. According to this construct, Mr. French wrote, it's Roberts the ideologue who would vote to restrict abortion rights. It's Roberts the conservative who would back the Trump administration. But a chief justice who cared about the institution of the Supreme Court? Well, he guards Roe. He checks Trump.
The problem is this skepticism often morphs into a formulaic approach that can itself become untethered from reality. Whatever the facts, many journalists and Washington experts revert to familiar storylines: Both sides are hypocritical. The parties care more about scoring partisan points than getting anything done. The extremists have taken over, and there are no moderates left.
Now senators are searching for changes to make the bill more politically palatable. But the notion of making those changes today and then speeding immediately to a vote is madness. There would be no time for experts to consider the consequences — to discover the sort of problems and unintended effects that last-minute changes are bound to create. By the time they did, the Senate would have passed it.

But it's a very dangerous minority. While we are, as I said, in many ways a better nation than we were, we're also a nation in which the rule of law and democratic values are very much under siege.
The newfound Democratic health care enthusiasm may not translate into victories, of course. Republican campaigns are turning away from health care as a major issue this cycle, planning to pay more attention to other messages like immigration, job creation and attacks on Democrats. When they talk about health care, many candidates are focusing on Democratic efforts to expand public health insurance coverage, not on continued calls to repeal Obamacare.
What book would you give a democratic socialist to read about conservatism?
Some plans had waiting periods for care. Cancer treatment, for example, is not covered in certain plans during the first month a person is enrolled in a plan, and no treatment for illness is covered in the first five days. That's the kind of detail that might be easy to overlook when signing up for a plan if you aren't expecting a cancer diagnosis.

Ms. Nixon and other progressive activists argue the notion of Mr. Cuomo as an anti-Trump standard-bearer is risible. She pointed out this week that the day after the 2016 election, Mr. Cuomo had said the fact that Mr. Trump hailed from New York was a potential bonus. And she noted that Mr. Trump, formerly a Democrat, was once a donor to Mr. Cuomo, calling on the governor to return his money. (Mr. Cuomo has declined.)
And finally, a recommendation. And it may be a cliche, but greatness is good. [MUSIC PLAYING] This week, President Trump used a racist trope to criticize four women of color in Congress — Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib. Trump told them to, quote, go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came. Then the president doubled down on the sentiment.
Here are some key questions the candidates were asked, where they found common ground and where they disagreed.
Last year, Senator Warren introduced a bill called the No First Use Act, which would declare that the United States would never be the first to use a nuclear weapon. Opponents say it could drive arms races in smaller countries that depend on America for protection.
A German health body advises against using the AstraZeneca shot in people over 65. Preparing a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Credit... Silvia Izquierdo/Associated Press Germany's vaccination advisory committee, which provides recommendations to the government, is cautioning against using the AstraZeneca shot on adults age 65 and above, saying in a draft report released on Thursday that there currently is not sufficient data to assess the vaccination effectiveness above 65 years. The German Health Ministry, which usually follows the advice of the committee, declined to comment. The European Medicines Agency, the regulatory body for the European Union, is expected to announce on Friday whether the vaccine will be approved for use in the bloc. Britain has been administering the AstraZeneca shots to all age groups after it became the first country to give the vaccine emergency authorization, in December. British regulators have said that data on the efficacy and safety of the vaccine are currently limited in people age 65 and older. But concerns about the scarce data on older people could limit the use of the AstraZeneca shot: European regulators are considering authorizing it only for people under 65, two E.U. officials said. Neither AstraZeneca nor Oxford University, which helped develop the vaccine, has released figures on how effective the shot is in older people. But data on older people's immune responses have suggested that the vaccine will help protect them from the virus, the company has said.
America regularly renegotiates its defense cost-sharing agreements with host countries. In November, Mr. Trump asked Japan to quadruple its payments for the American troop presence.

Mr. Looney, of the Brookings Institution, estimated that the benefits from Senator Warren's plans are skewed — he estimated that borrowers with advanced degrees will claim 37 percent of the annual benefits, while representing only 27 percent of borrowers overall.
First, as I said, I'm not talking about mere dubious claims. When Trump officials insisted that the 2017 tax cut would lead to a decade of miraculous growth, their claim made no sense in terms of the underlying economics, and it flew in the face of decades of evidence. But it was a prediction, not a statement of fact, and it's conceivable (barely) that Trump's people actually believed it.
The Biden administration plans to reopen enrollment in many of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, both to help those who may have lost health insurance during the pandemic and to offer coverage to those who did not have any and now want it. The move will be announced on Thursday as part of an executive order describing administration policies on shoring up health insurance coverage, according to three people familiar with the details.
He was known as someone who was a truth-teller within his caucus.
What this means is that of the 27 million Americans who have either gained coverage through the Medicaid expansion or purchased insurance on the exchanges, only about two million are exposed to those Trump-engineered premium hikes. That's still a lot of people, but it's not enough to get a death spiral going. In fact, for complicated reasons (silver-loading — don't ask), after-subsidy premiums have actually gone down for many people.
WASHINGTON — The Republican-led House of Representatives won a significant victory over the Obama administration on Thursday when a Federal District Court judge in Washington ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services did not have the authority to spend billions of dollars on a key element of the new health care law.

The point, however, is that politicians and pundits, especially on the right, constantly insist that presidential policies matter a lot. And Mr. Obama, in particular, has been attacked at every stage of his presidency for policies that his critics allege are job-killing — the former House speaker, John Boehner, once used the phrase seven times in less than 14 minutes. So the fact that the Obama job record is as good as it is tells you something about the validity of those attacks.
So let me do both of these, because I think there are two answers. There are two pieces in this answer. One is, I think attacking the corruption in Washington brings a lot more people together than most folks recognize, and that it really does reach across party lines.
Four years of Trump feeling validated in all the crazy stuff he's done and said. Four years of Trump unburdened by the need to run for re-election and able to amplify his racism, make Ivanka secretary of state, appoint even more crackpots to his cabinet and likely get to name two right-wing Supreme Court justices under the age of 40.
Political campaigns are normally a game of budgeting exercises and allocating finite resources, which dictates where ads are aired and when. But if the resources are no longer finite, there can be blanket advertising even where there isn't essentially as big of a return on investment.
MARMET, W.Va. — There were the beauty queens, ages 6 to 60, riding in style in the Labor Day Parade, including Teen Miss West Virginia Coal. There was the man driving a pickup truck memorial to 29 workers killed in a 2010 mine disaster, each victim's portrait airbrushed on metal.
For example, federal checks to farmers aren't going out ­— but libertarian organizations like the Cato Institute have long denounced farm subsidies as just another form of crony capitalism.
Number of uninsured under the Republican plan
And the reason they can do it is that most of the things that are going in that relief package are, at least arguably, budget-related. It's sort of a primary purpose test.
While premiums have risen under the current law, it shielded many Americans from increases because a majority of those buying insurance through the marketplaces received tax subsidies from the federal government. The subsidies were on a sliding scale according to income, to help offset some of the costs for middle-income Americans.
The United Automobile Workers has nearly one million members. Along with the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Teachers, it has yet not taken a stance on Medicare for all.
Alex Kingsbury: The Trump administration has made an effort to get Europeans to pay more for their own defense as being part of NATO. Is that a goal that you support even if you don't support the way he's going about it? And how might you achieve those goals?
I don't know anybody who's afraid of the 2-cent wealth tax who isn't already a billionaire.
So we have a shrinking supply and a growing population, and that means tens of millions of people are paying more to get less. So how can you turn that around? And the answer is to make a bigger investment in housing supply directly. And that includes housing for middle-class families, for working-class families, for the working poor, for the poor, for seniors who want to age in place, for people with disabilities, for people who've been incarcerated. Expanding housing supply directly, but also using federal dollars to help encourage cities and small towns and rural areas to adopt housing practices, that will lower costs even further. I just think that's a more effective way to get real structural change.
So what explains the G.O.P.'s extraordinary indifference to the plight of Americans impoverished by this national disaster?
Only slivers of this were visible in Mr. Mulvaney's uneventful confirmation hearing on Tuesday.
JB: And you would bring them all home?
Trade wars are good, and easy to win. So declared Donald Trump a few weeks ago, after announcing tariffs on steel and aluminum. Actually, trade wars are rarely good, and not at all easy to win — especially if you have no idea what you're doing. And boy, do these people not know what they're doing.
No, I know he did, but I don't know what that means.
No, it's fine. It's just that look out there. People's financial circumstances have gotten worse. The amount of student loan debt has been going up at a rate of $100 billion a year. Oh, here's one. Just saw some data not long ago out of the Department of Education. Go take a look 20 years out on people who borrowed student loan debt. Ninety-four percent of whites have paid off their student loan debt. Want to guess what the percentage is for African-Americans is?
The reaction was even more intense in the Senate. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, had planned to use the week to publicize his floor vote to force Democrats to take a stand on progressives' Green New Deal — an important party-building exercise for Republicans after Mr. Trump's decision to declare an emergency at the border sparked an insurrection in their ranks this month.
Being a human being. Being a human being.
In 2012, Massachusetts Democrats, worried about a tough fight against Republican Senator Scott Brown, coalesced around Ms. Warren, knocking her only primary challenger, an immigration attorney, Marisa DeFranco, off the ballot. Winning in November is more important to Democrats than standing behind one woman who wanted to challenge another one for the right to run for U.S. Senate, Boston Globe columnist Joan Vennochi wrote at the time. Whether Ms. Warren could beat Mr. Brown, the incumbent, was more of a tossup, though by late summer 2012 most polls had her ahead.
It is not surprising that Warren has jumped out to an early lead in the ideas primary. The main theme in her life, both professional and personal, has been economic opportunity. Her father was a carpet salesman at Montgomery Ward in Oklahoma City in the 1960s, until he had a heart attack. He had to switch to lower-paying work as a janitor, and her mother got a minimum-wage job, answering phones at Sears.
In December, former Vice President Joe Biden said that he would consider choosing Senator Warren as his running mate and wondered whether she would choose him. The Senator, for her part, has suggested she might prefer a woman.
I would offer Bernie Sanders $50,000 to debate, absolutely, he said, referring to the Vermont senator. What in the world does this have to do with her being a woman?
Because I had to throw it out, because you ruined it.
At the same time, I think that the kinds of people who were uncomfortable with the Affordable Care Act, who were uncomfortable with some of these more universal health care systems in the past think it's sort of a laughable idea. It's really, really far from where we are right now, it's far from anything that's really been debated in a serious way in the Congress, and it would be extremely expensive to implement. It would require huge tax increases. And that is the kind of political debate that doesn't typically get very far when it's outside the confines of a campaign.
You can't cut $1 trillion from these programs and protect the most vulnerable, she said.
I know that as you sit here it looks like, wow, this woman wants to do a lot and it's hard. And the truth is, it is. I spent my whole life studying working families. Why they go broke, what's happening in America, why America's middle class is being hollowed out. Whole books written about this. And I watch every year two things as it gets worse and worse and worse. Not fire worse. That was 2008 and — everybody is ——
A result is that Congress hasn't completed the entire budget process, with all the spending bills, on time in more than 20 years. Many years, it has not passed any budget resolution at all. This is perhaps the most basic responsibility of the legislative branch, yet for decades, Congress has repeatedly come up short.
What's really driving up health care costs, and, consequently, health insurance premiums? Let's start with drug companies charging record-breaking prices and hospitals leveraging dominant market positions for higher rates.
Look, we can work — and this is what we should have done. We should have been pushing for negotiations with Turkey, with our allies, in order to protect the Kurds. And we could do that or could have done this as part of withdrawal. We could use economic pressure, we can use diplomatic pressure. We can use coalescing with our allies in order to bring pressure to protect the Kurds, and I think that's what we should have done. We've already abandoned the Kurds in the worst possible way and sent a huge signal to the rest of the world that the United States, at least under the Trump administration, is not a reliable ally.
NATO members agreed, in 2014, to a goal of spending 2 percent of their G.D.P. on defense, but in 2017 the only countries to meet that goal were America, Britain, Greece, Poland and Estonia. Mr. Trump chastised fellow member states at a 2017 summit, declaring that 23 of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should.
archived recording (theresa may) The ideal outcome of this process would be to agree an approach on a future relationship that delivers on the result of the referendum that both the leader of the opposition and I could put to the House for approval, and which I could then take to next week's European Council.
The difference between recorded infections and those that were missed was even more significant in Missouri, where about 2.65 percent of the population was infected with the virus as of April 26, although many people might not have felt sick. This number is about 24 times the reported rate: nearly 162,000 compared with the 6,800 believed to have been infected by then.
By combining the bills to shore up the Affordable Care Act with several bipartisan measures to address high drug prices, Democrats had hoped to lure in some Republican support. But the minority party did not bite, calling the package a bailout for the health law and instead introducing a Republican bill that included only the drug-pricing measures, plus an extension of funding for community health centers and the National Health Service Corps.
When told that former Vice President Biden criticized her health care plans, Senator Warren answered with a critique of moderate Democrats: Democrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies. She also suggested Mr. Biden is running in the wrong primary.
The most closely held of the cables was intended as an update on the new Trump administration for a narrow audience of top British officials. It described the chaos inside the new administration, the concerns about the future of the Atlantic relationship and the struggle to figure out who had the president's ear.
KK: As student loan debt has come up a couple of times, I want to make sure we have a question.
Well, the state is one that is unique in its political history.
Considering that it will seriously harm over 100,000 Kentuckians, in violation of numerous provisions of Medicaid law, we are very seriously considering taking legal action — and as we analyze the meager legal rationale in the approval itself, it seems inevitable, said Leonardo Cuello, director of health policy at the National Health Law Program, an advocacy group for the poor.
In a democracy, how is it that they have so much political influence that one-tenth of 1 percent can say, I rather your kid have to deal with $50,000 in student loan debt, and I'd rather you never get a chance to get a child into day care, which means you either piece stuff together in crazy ways or quit your job. And I'd rather your public schools still have tiles falling out of the ceiling and textbooks that are 11 years old than that the top one-tenth of 1 percent has to pitch in 2 cents.
KK: So do you think that Vice President Biden has been forceful enough in his ——
But the House legislation and the remdesivir announcement once again put a spotlight on the cost of health care as a political and economic issue. While the House bill has no chance of passing the Republican-led Senate, Democrats — who reclaimed the House majority in 2018 on a promise to lower health costs and expand access — intend to use it to reprise that playbook in November.
Obamacare was devised with a mix of new spending and taxes, along with cuts to the federal Medicare program, so that it would save more than it cost. A recent forecast from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that, if left in place, the Affordable Care Act will continue to save federal dollars through at least 2025. (Recent legislation has made some small changes to the law's tax provisions, but analysts at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers again and found very little difference.)
It's not a criticism of him as a man, it's a criticism of whether or not you think you're going to be able to help elect a Democratic senator here against Lindsey Graham, which I'm going to help do, he said of the South Carolina Senate race this year.
O.K. But he also, by doing so, he elevated these four members of Congress to really be symbols of the Democratic Party. And he kept the discussion to be about race. And what it reminded me of was this quote from Steve Bannon where Steve Bannon says, and I'm going to read it, The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got them. I want them to talk about racism every day. So it sounds like you both disagree with that.
The key parts of both decisions were decided by five-justice majorities, and the chief justice was the only member of the court in both.
The 2010 health care law includes many other provisions, such as the creation of health insurance marketplaces, premium subsidies for low- and moderate-income people and expansion of the Medicaid program, as well as changes in Medicare and public health services.
Empathy, Porter argues, has always waged an unequal struggle against the racial animus that courses through American history, poisoning both those who hate and those who are hated. Race has contaminated American solidarity, making it impossible for poor whites, threatened by job loss, globalization and the death of carbon-intensive industries, to make common cause with African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and immigrants. He writes, Unwilling to share the bounty of state with people of other races and creeds, heritages and colors, real Americans — the white ones — have prevented the erection of a welfare state at all.

Across the country, Republicans have been facing crowds demanding to know how they will protect the 20 million Americans who gained health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act, and will lose it if the act is repealed. And after all that inveighing against the evils of Obamacare, it turns out that they've got nothing.
JI: People were opposed to it until ——
Yeah, I think it's an enormously complicated question, and I worry about it a lot. I would say, it is amazing how being off Twitter has meant that Trump has just said nothing, not only since the inauguration of Joe Biden, but in some ways, before that, too, when he lived in the White House, there's a room in that house where you can get the press together and be heard everywhere. He didn't do that. And it's not hard to understand why Twitter did what it did in the wake of January 6. But I think that the power that that proved they had is a power that we should be very, very worried about. I actually think the bigger problem is not so much the platforms, which at least have a greater claim to say, what we're doing is providing you with this platform, with this access to the public and we're going to withdraw it if you abuse it, but the companies that really provide access to the internet itself, what Amazon did, what, in some ways, Apple did, and this kind of taking of Parler off of its platforms. Whatever you think of Parler, and I don't have a high opinion of it, it seems to me that having that kind of power in the hands of corporations is very, very troubling. I think we are only beginning to come to terms with how to think about the nature of that power. What is that power? Is it economic power?
KK: You seem to have avoided that approach for the most part. Can you just explain why?
Biden's pick for top economist testifies in the Senate. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:08 - 0:00 transcript Cecilia Rouse Testifies to the Senate Cecilia Rouse, President Biden's pick to lead the White House Council of Economic Advisers, testified to the Senate Banking Committee on how she would lead a recovery in the wake of the pandemic. Today, our country is living through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of families have had their lives turned upside down. The economic security they've worked so hard to build eroded almost overnight by the economic impact of the pandemic. Far too many have slipped through our safety net into hardship and hopelessness, and structural inequities that have always existed within our economy have not just been exposed, but exacerbated — their impact more devastating than ever before. As important as it is for the C.E.A. to interpret and translate data and academic research, it is also vital that we utilize the right data. Too often, economists focus on average outcomes instead of examining a range of outcomes. As a result, our analyses tell us about average economic growth and the middle of the distribution. But as our economy grows more and more unequal, that analysis fails to capture the experience of the many people who are left behind, particularly people of color.
But he didn't try to do some things like stick with his old pro-choice position on abortion, or really stick to his occasional advocacy of gun control, or tax increases. If he did that, I think, you would have found that there were large numbers of Republican voters who cared about those particular issues. And so we have to stick with them on those. You have to stick with them on religious liberty and lots of other stuff. Republican voters, don't in large numbers, have strong views on trade and he could do what he wanted to do on that. So that was one element of policy substance to Trump, or to Trumpism. A second, he was very good at using a policy issue to communicate a value, or communicate something he wanted people to know about him. Whether it's, I'm strong, or I'm on your side, I'm tough, et cetera. So, the wall being an aspect of that. The trade stuff being an aspect of that, too. Maybe he could have found different policies, more serious policies, more effective ones that would have communicated some of the same things, but there is some policy substance there. The thing about Senator Graham saying, we need Trump's policies, but presumably not some of Trump's personality, or Trump's negatives.
But if your complaint is a labor complaint, that is, gee, here I am in America and I'm trying to compete against workers in a foreign country who are getting paid a dollar a day. What's your path? Well, first you've got to go to the U.S. government and persuade the U.S. government that they should go after this country, for which we know what has happened. U.S. government has repeatedly — and this is not just by — well, yeah, we get your point.
I've been able to receive it for myself and for my family. Just like all of us who are on the tip of the iceberg, way up high in the health care services.
[Machine beeping] The frustrating thing about all of this is it really just feels like it's too little, too late. Like we knew — we knew it was coming. Today is kind of getting worse and worse. We had to get a refrigerated truck to store the bodies of patients who are dying. We are, right now, scrambling to try to get a few additional ventilators or even CPAP machines. If we could get CPAP machines, we could free up ventilators for patients who need them. You know, we now have these five vents. We probably — unless people die, I suspect we'll be back to needing to beg for ventilators again in another day or two. There's a mythical 100 vents out there which we haven't seen. Leaders in various offices, from the president to the head of Health and Hospitals, saying things like, 'We're going to be fine. Everything's fine.' And from our perspective, everything is not fine. I don't have the support that I need, and even just the materials that I need, physically, to take care of my patients. And it's America, and we're supposed to be a first-world country. On a regular day, my emergency department's volume is pretty high. It's about 200 people a day. Now we're seeing 400 or more people a day. At first, we were trying to isolate patients with cough and fever and be more careful around them, but we weren't necessarily being extra careful around all the other patients.

Take the enactment of Obamacare. For Gilens, the final legislation reflects the failure of the Democratic Party to achieve progressive goals:
America regularly renegotiates its defense cost-sharing agreements with host countries. In November, Mr. Trump asked Japan to quadruple its payments for the American troop presence.
Which I would say is like, you see that in a lot of QAnon people, you see it in Donald Trump post-election stuff, and you see it in the Republican Party, where most House Republicans voted to reject the results of the election. I mean, at some point, I think you have to say, however people feel in their heart of hearts, once you're willing to say publicly you believe this then it becomes harder not to act as if you believe it.

Joseph R. Biden Jr. speaks with Elizabeth Warren about once a week. They review the latest developments on the Covid-19 crisis and the collapsing economy. They trade ideas about how a Democratic president, like Mr. Biden, might rescue the country.

Third, McCain believed in democracy and its vital, fragile institutions. He accepted his two haunting presidential defeats honorably.

Mr. Obama was already pivoting to health care reform, so why not encharge Mr. Biden? As it turned out, Mr. Biden's work on the rollout, implementation, oversight and selling of the 2009 stimulus — officially the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act — was the most sustained, and perhaps the most significant, assignment of his time in office.
So let me push back on what your theory of change is, because the way the Affordable Care Act worked is we passed it, and then it was four years later when the benefits came in, and they kind of bumped into place, right? Look at it the other way around. What I propose is as many people can get into it as want to get into it, and then once they're in, try taking it away from them, because that's what the fight then shifts to. How did we end up hanging on to the Affordable Care Act when the Republicans had the House, the Senate and the White House? The answer was we ended up hanging on to it because enough people across this country said, You're not going to take this away from me.

I was feeling bad about my shoes at a fancy cocktail lounge the other night while talking to a woman I know. She is, I am pretty sure, greater-than-slash-equal to me in terms of poverty. She made an elaborate show of heaving her giant designer purse onto the bar so that she could dig through it to find the laundry money she was going to use to pay for her Sazerac. That's a really nice bag, I said, taking a sip of my light bill. Did you recently receive a settlement of some kind? She laughed heartily and poured her Obamacare deductible down her throat in one long swallow. Girl, naw, I bought this with money I should've spent on my car payment. I clinked the ice in my checking account overdraft fees and nodded solemnly in agreement.
In his early months on the job, Zucker laid off journalists. Lately, he has been on a hiring spree, in particular for CNN's digital operation. He brought on the veteran investigative reporters Carl Bernstein and James Steele to write for CNN's website and appear on TV and poached BuzzFeed's four-person investigative political-research team, K-File, led by Andrew Kaczynski. CNN.com has scored some big scoops in recent months. It was the first to report that U.S. intelligence officials briefed Trump about claims that Russia was in possession of compromising information on him, and it broke the story that the White House had asked the F.B.I. to publicly reject media reports that people close to Trump were in contact with the Russians during the campaign. Not only do stories like these generate traffic for CNN's website, but they provide news for its hosts to discuss on-air. And while the numbers are dwarfed by those on the TV side, the network's digital operation has become a revenue generator in its own right, bringing in $300 million in 2016.
You had budget reconciliation under Obama. You had the Bush tax cuts or budget reconciliation under George W. Bush. It's one thing for the Senate to say the 60-vote threshold is sacrosanct. That's how we want to run the institution. It's another to say majority rules is the way you want to run the institution, which is how most institutions run. It's totally bizarre to me to say we want to keep the 60-vote threshold, but obviously, that's not working, and it would completely paralyze the institution. So we're going to do this dumb thing and abuse another rule in a way that creates worse legislation instead.

Some progressives believe that Mr. Manchin and others may change their minds if Republicans obstruct the Democratic agenda. For their part, some moderates argue that the threat of eliminating the filibuster could force Republicans into legislative compromise. The minority party has often used the filibuster to thwart signature items of the majority party, and some Democrats fear that, without it, they would be powerless to stop Republicans the next time they control the Senate. Mr. Biden's commitment to keeping the Senate filibuster harks back to the policy debates that animated the Democratic presidential primary. The logic was informed by years of congressional gridlock under former President Barack Obama and the magnitude of challenges facing the country: Big problems need big solutions, they argued, and the filibuster was a blockade to progress. With the Senate split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, that could empower Mr. McConnell and a small cadre of moderate voices to block nearly any piece of legislation. It could doom Mr. Biden to the same fate as his Democratic presidential predecessor, who blamed Republican obstructionism for blocking a more robust liberal agenda. Mr. Markey said he was confident that if Mr. Biden began to experience the same fate, he would come around. Astead W. Herndon and
I mean, the Ryan moment, the Paul Ryan moment, where the Republican Party was about makers not takers and was all in on an entitlement reform. I mean, that wasn't the way the Republican Party was between 1981 and 2008, right? I mean, Reagan explicitly said basically, he wasn't going to do much on entitlements and didn't. And then George W Bush actually expanded in entitlements, with the Medicare drug benefit and obviously was a big government guy in general. And so, the Republican Party had gone down a little bit of an ideological cul-de-sac, during the Obama years. One of the reasons why that old Republican Party blew up, was because it had become such a brittle orthodoxy, that had gotten so far detached from political reality. It was not where voters at large were. And it turned out it wasn't even where Republican base voters were, where the Republican electorate was. So and you saw this in 2016, right? I mean, you'd have these ads from the Club for Growth. Trump has said this about health care and Trump said that about taxes and he's done this on trade. And there were a bunch of Republican primary voters who actively liked what Trump was saying on those issues. And then there was another group of Republican voters who just didn't care, right? They weren't so excited about any of those old Republican agenda items, that they held it against him that he wasn't for them.
And you may start out with modest increments and increase them over time, but there's no reason that we should be treating a country that is producing goods through prison labor or child labor or unsafe working standards or by polluting the earth, that we should treat a country that produces goods in that way the same way we're treating a country that produces goods with standards that are much closer to ours. We simply put our own businesses and our own workers at a competitive disadvantage, so we end up doing things like exporting pollution. Can't pollute here in the United States, but move this polluting industry. This way that you're going to paint dolls or produce chips, move it somewhere else where they have no environmental standards and then resell, and then sell those goods back in the United States.

Look, the single animating principle of everything Ryan did and proposed was to comfort the comfortable while afflicting the afflicted.

Remember, he voted against the Simpson-Bowles debt commission proposal not because of its real flaws, but because it would raise taxes and fail to repeal Obamacare.

A new survey of the Democratic candidates by The New York Times finds that many of them prefer less sweeping changes than the Medicare for All Act, the single-payer bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders and supported by Senator Elizabeth Warren and several other presidential hopefuls. A majority of candidates in the survey — including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the leader in early polls — said they would rather add a public option in the health care system that would compete with private plans.
I'm hoping through him that we can do some things in North Korea that maybe we couldn't have done otherwise.
Michael Conway, who served as counsel for the house Judiciary Committee during the Nixon impeachment inquiry, said President Nixon also tried to deny the investigators access to key materials, but Mr. Trump has gone a step further. Mr. Conway said, Nixon was equally resistant to turning materials over and documents, but he did allow people to testify.
The Times columnist David Leonhardt wrote in September that despite long positioning herself as a champion for the working class, Senator Warren has had a record of struggling to win in working-class towns and blue-collar parts of Massachusetts.
At issue is a program that collects fees from most insurers and uses the money to help pay high-cost claims for sicker people. The purpose of this temporary reinsurance program is to stabilize premiums and to encourage insurers to participate in markets under the health care law.
It's both capped in terms of the number of dollars, and it's capped in terms of the income.
For now, the restrictions will apply only to countries already deemed high-risk because of the emergence of more contagious virus variants, like South Africa, Portugal and Brazil. But Ms. Patel said the government could expand the list to include other countries where the virus is highly prevalent. Under the new rules, arriving passengers would be taken from the airport to nearby hotels, where they would be required to stay in their rooms for 10 days at their own expense. With a few exceptions, non-British citizens from the 22 high-risk countries are already banned from entering the country. Public health experts said the plan had too many loopholes and could be evaded by traveling first to an unaffected country and then to Britain from there. It won't be effective, because people will just connect in other countries to avoid quarantine, said Devi Sridhar, head of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh.
Much of the bitter debate over how to repeal and replace the law known as Obamacare has focused on cutting Medicaid and subsidies that help low-income people buy insurance.
LK: But I wanted to ask about an aspect of it that I think gets relatively little attention.
Normally, you can buy insurance only during a six-week period each fall. But the Biden administration established a special enrollment period that runs through mid-May, and most state marketplaces have done the same. This means you can go to Healthcare.gov and sign up for insurance now.
Which is pretty much what happened here. Despite their ceaseless attacks on the health care act since Mr. Obama signed it into law in March 2010, Mr. Trump, Mr. Ryan and their colleagues have never had a workable plan that could gain the support of a congressional majority. That is why they rushed their turkey of a bill to the floor without going through the laborious process of holding hearings and building coalitions. The last-minute wheeling and dealing did nothing to disguise the bill's underlying and increasingly obvious purpose, which was to reduce taxes for the wealthy by cutting benefits for the needy.
Well, kind of most clearly, the factors around the decision changed.
What's remarkable about this determination is that the usual arguments against helping the needy, which were weak even in normal times, have become completely unsustainable in the face of the pandemic. Yet those arguments, zombielike, just keep shambling on.
Details of the strategy are in flux, and there are disagreements among Republicans about how to proceed. In the House, the emerging plan, tightly coordinated between Mr. Ryan and Mr. Pence, is meant to give Mr. Trump's supporters the repeal of the health law that he repeatedly promised at rallies. It would also give Republicans time to try to assure consumers and the health industry that they will not instantly upend the health insurance market, and to pressure some Democrats to support a Republican alternative.
United States troops have recently resumed counterterrorism operations in Syria, suggesting that President Trump intends to leave most of the 500 troops currently stationed there (many of them in combat). Mr. Trump has been inconsistent in his strategy on troops in Syria; Senator Warren has been firm in her stance that all combat troops should come home.
KK: Yes, and even more practically, is it enough to get anything passed in Mitch McConnell's Senate?
In the midst of a global pandemic, Washington Republicans continue their crusade against the health and safety of the American public, said Fabiola Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for the group, in the statement. By blocking uninsured Covid-19 patients from getting health care, Trump and his allies have decided to bankrupt American families. The American people deserve to know if House Republicans will stand up for the millions of Americans who face the challenge of being jobless and uninsured during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Alex Kingsbury: The Trump administration has made an effort to get Europeans to pay more for their own defense as being part of NATO. Is that a goal that you support even if you don't support the way he's going about it? And how might you achieve those goals?
But it seems like your case is not only about people who don't consider themselves gender binary. It's also for someone who says, I am a woman, or I am a man. You don't think it's necessary to have that part of their identity be front and center in a conversation constantly. Right?
archived recording (tony evers) So I hope that the legislature will act swiftly to send absentee ballots to every single registered voter living in Wisconsin.
So I think that what we're seeing is not Trumpification completed but Trumpification in progress and escalating, so that when Trump said that a judge of Mexican-American heritage was not fit to hear a case that he was involved in, you heard Paul Ryan come out and say that it was the textbook definition of racism. And you heard much more, I think, strenuous and immediate condemnations. And so what we are accustomed to, the amount of racial invective that it takes to even break into the news cycle, keeps increasing. You know, I've been reading Tim Alberta's book American Carnage about the G.O.P. civil war that led to Trump. And there's something he quotes that kind of everybody quotes when they're describing the evolution of the modern Republican Party. It's a famous Lee Atwater quote from an interview in the '80s. But he says, You start out in 1954 by saying n-word, n-word, n-word. By 1968, you can't say n-word. That hurts you— backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights, and all that stuff, and you're getting so abstract. Now you're talking about cutting taxes. And all these things you're talking about are totally economic things. And a byproduct of them is blacks get hurt worse than whites.
CW: Is that enough to bridge the systems, the ecosystems of misinformation, hyper-partisanship, things that are ——
Senate leaders are now hastily trying to rewrite a sprawling tax bill — one that touches almost every part of the economy — and then pass it mere hours later. They need to do so because an independent Senate analysis late yesterday made clear what everyone already knew: The bill would add to the deficit enormously. In a normal legislative process, the Senate would have received that analysis long before taking any vote.
But in newspapers and on radios and TV stations from Anchorage to Miami, the effects of the bill are already being contemplated. These could vary considerably from region to region, state to state, even family to family. Thirty-one states expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, though the designs of these programs are not the same, and the states that did not choose to expand would still be significantly affected. Clinics in Pennsylvania desperately need funding to battle the opioid epidemic; rural hospitals in Maine rely on Medicaid for survival; Nebraskans struggle to cover rising premiums; and Floridians fear the loss of money to fight the Zika virus.
While premiums have risen under the current law, it shielded many Americans from increases because a majority of those buying insurance through the marketplaces received tax subsidies from the federal government. The subsidies were on a sliding scale according to income, to help offset some of the costs for middle-income Americans.
The number of people who have denounced Medicare for all as politically impractical continues to grow — the former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel called it a pipe dream in a recent Washington Post op-ed, in which he called on proponents to please explain to me exactly how we get that bill through the Senate?
A Washington hospital system apologizes after offering vaccines to wealthy donors. The Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue, Wash., last spring. Credit... Grant Hindsley for The New York Times A Washington hospital system apologized after The Seattle Times reported that it had offered vaccines to wealthy donors while others went without the coveted shots. Overlake Medical Center & Clinics sent an email to about 110 donors who gave more than $10,000 to the hospital system, telling them they could register for open appointments by invite only. The report drew a rebuke from Gov. Jay Inslee, who said during a news conference on Tuesday that the practice was simply unacceptable. Overlake's president and chief executive, J. Michael Marsh, apologized in a statement, adding that even those donors would have been required to show that they were eligible for the vaccine under state guidelines. We recognize we made a mistake by including a subset of our donors and by not adopting a broader outreach strategy to fill these appointments, and we apologize, Mr. Marsh said. The hospital's conduct mirrors that of other facilities that have made news for prioritizing wealthy donors over the rest of the population. A Florida nursing home and assisted living facility called MorseLife Health System came under investigation after The Washington Post and The New York Post reported that it had prioritized its donors as well. Another, Baptist Health in Miami, invited a donor to get a shot.

These four climate changes are creating a whole new set of governing challenges. They are not the obvious challenges of communism and economic dislocation — as occurred after World War II — when building a NATO, a Marshall Plan and an E.U. were the obvious antidotes. And it is not the obvious challenge and opportunity of spreading democracy and free markets into the vacuum created by the end of communism in 1989. It's the less obvious challenge of stemming the erosion of the pillars of democracy and order built in the previous two eras — but without a single big, obvious bogeyman or falling wall to galvanize us.
Republican House and Senate negotiators have been working to resolve differences between a Senate plan to provide $1.1 billion in emergency financing for Zika and a House plan that would provide $622 million but would take the money from other programs.
BS: Right. You have a lot of people in this country who actually, if you asked them about Obamacare, they hate it. These are the same people who are being wounded by the constant diminution of medical care under the Trump administration. How do you convince those people? That's the issue, because he's talking about fake news and disbelief. We had the whole discussion about death committees.
I don't know individual employees there. What I know is the power of that place and how they're using it right now. Well —
But I think you could also say — and this is where I disagree with you, David. I think you could say that we have exaggerated, as Michelle says, the extent to which male-female differences require some form of patriarchy. But that doesn't mean that we've actually exaggerated male-female differences. That just might mean that we haven't appreciated what women can do as much as we've should. And there's, in fact, plenty of evidence that in gender egalitarian societies, including the paradises of Scandinavia, male and female differences actually increase further. I think there are places and situations where male-female differences still get exaggerated. I think in the world of New York Times readers, at this point in our history, it's the opposite and that we've moved to a place of telling people that they need to deny realities in front of their face.
I talk about rolling back every racist voter suppression law in America. We could do that at the federal level. I talk about outlawing political gerrymandering. We could do that at the federal level.
This scene is part of Joan Biskupic's new biography of Roberts, The Chief. The book contains a description of the justices's behind-the-scenes maneuverings on Obamacare that's more detailed than any other to appear so far.
An expert on college affordability at the Urban Institute told The Times that Senator Warren's $50,000 debt clearance is too much. Setting the level at $10,000 instead would relieve debt for a third of all borrowers, according to their analysis.
We have a duty to enforce the law as Congress has written it, Mr. Azar said. But he added that the federal government must proceed with a great deal of deliberation and caution and care in assessing the Idaho plan.
In other years, the budget process has become bogged down, and Congress has kept the government funded through temporary extensions known as continuing resolutions (C.R.s) that fund government operations based on current levels, or rolled everything into an omnibus — or in some cases, a CRomnibus, combining a budget omnibus bill and a continuing resolution. It's kludgy language to describe a kludgy process.
Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign has aroused the passions of Democratic voters. Unfortunately for Bloomberg — a formerly Republican, Wall Street-friendly billionaire who, as New York City mayor, supported the racially discriminatory stop and frisk policing strategy — those passions are largely negative ones. These personal and ideological priors aside, many Democrats are angry that Bloomberg, who has indicated he is willing to spend as much as $1 billion of his estimated $50 billion fortune on his campaign, seems to be trying to purchase their party's nomination. The fear is that Bloomberg's campaign will prolong the Democratic contest and, in the end, produce a hobbled nominee — a nominee who almost certainly won't be Bloomberg.
That's a nice one. I like that. So look, I think it's one of the things that, as a country, it's time for us to take it on.
The Affordable Care Act already allows people who lose jobs or experience a change in income to sign up for coverage outside of the regular fall open enrollment period. What the Biden administration will do is open the marketplaces to all Americans, without requiring them to provide paperwork proving their eligibility.
Senator Warren's famous paper laying the groundwork for the creation of the C.F.P.B. opens with the sentence, It is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one-in-five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house and later says, Why are consumers safe when they purchase tangible products with cash, but when they sign up for routine financial products like mortgages and credit cards they are left at the mercy of their creditors?
Here are the steps the company is taking to address the issue:
The Justice Department did not challenge those provisions of the law. Indeed, it said, they can continue to operate without the individual mandate.
On the contrary, the repeal-and-replace bill designed by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan drew withering criticism from the left and the right. Liberals condemned its use of reductions in health coverage for the poor to pay for large tax cuts for the wealthy, while conservatives bemoaned its retention of many subsidies adopted under Obamacare.
KK: But this isn't expanding the arsenal at all. These are existing weapons that may or may not be in southern Turkey.
And so, where the Republican Party is going right now is a mush. Do you think that's right?
But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart. They say, what do we need this for? So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid — the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.
Here's why the prongs are crucial to the effort to roll back Obamacare: Republicans have chosen to pass their health reform bill using a special budget procedure that limits the policy changes they can make. That means that many of their key policy promises made over the past few years — and even days — can't be achieved in the bill.
So in a special session that happens before Evers takes office, Republicans do a kind of classic power grab.
In June, Senator Warren released a plan focused on voter disenfranchisement and election security. The plan proposes, among other measures, improved voting equipment across the country and bans on voter purges.
After Senator Warren said during the October debate that the United States should get out of the Middle East, her campaign clarified that she was referring just to combat troops. Noncombat troops have long been stationed in the region for a variety of reasons including ensuring a free flow of oil.
In conversations with some unions, Senator Warren has dodged the question of how she would protect existing coverage. At a recent town hall with the Culinary Workers Union, for example, she said their health care is not supposed to change but sidestepped details.
And we should think about how it could better serve us in a time when we are divided, in a time when power does shift back and forth. There are a lot of ways that Congress could work better. There are a lot of ways to think about how to change the electoral system and other things. And I don't think that requires empowering narrow minorities to get their way and then after the next election, the next narrow minority reverses what they've done. I think we want more durable policy change, and I do think it's achievable. [MUSIC PLAYING]
Interestingly, the progressive wing of the Democratic Party faces another challenge from an unexpected source.

Charlie Warzel: Senator, how do you first campaign in and then govern a country as polarized as the one that we're living in right now? Because this doesn't feel like a disagreement on a few policies. This is a situation where the cost of letting the other side wins seems almost too much to bear for the other side. And if you look at impeachment, you see politicians literally inventing alternate realities rather than compromise or disparage a party leader. How do you realistically navigate that and get things done? Because it doesn't feel like a divide that you can heal away.
Senator Warren has laid out an ambitious timeline that would put children and families under Medicare for all in her first 100 days through a congressional maneuver, then fully roll out her system by her third year in office.
I think the idea has always been pretty politically controversial. There are a couple of different threads of it. One is that industry doesn't like it. So doctors are the kind of most vocal group in this period. But over time, we also have hospitals, and drug companies, and other parts of the health care industry that are wary of the government getting involved and maybe taking their dollars away from them. I think also, especially in this period, there is a real resistance to socialism and this idea that it's not American to have the government providing these basic benefits, that the free market should work to do it instead.
Right. In which he essentially assails the Democratic members of the committee for basically being power-hungry and soulless.
The second and more significant factor is what Begala described as the unintended consequences of the obsession with small donors. Democrats legitimately want to break the stranglehold of big money, Begala wrote, but
In the House of Representatives, two bills have been proposed recently to address crises like the one now facing our family. The Ban Surprise Billing Act, sponsored by Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, would require hospitals to notify patients and get consent if they will be receiving any out-of-network treatment. And last week, the Ways and Means Committee sent the Consumer Protections Against Surprise Medical Bills Act to the House floor. This would also flag potential out-of-network costs for patients, and require insurers and providers to settle disputes through arbitration.
I'm going to bring down drug prices, he told Time magazine in an interview published on Wednesday. I don't like what's happened with drug prices.

KK: Yes, I am, undocumented immigrants, excuse me.
These are the fights we need to have. These are the fights we should be bringing forward. We don't bring those fights forward. We — oh, well, we could — around the edge a little bit. Then we're just going to be the ones who stood by while America became fundamentally a country that lost even a hope that all the kids would have opportunity. That we just extinguish that and say, Nope. Better be born into it, because that's the only way to make it in America. That's not the America I want to see.
So I'm always wary of making political predictions, but it seems extremely unlikely to me right now for a couple of reasons. One is that Republicans are dead-set against this. So now we're left with just Democrats who would have to vote for such a bill. And then you would have to imagine that they could all agree on a proposal this radical. And I don't think that there is enough unanimity among Democrats right now on this issue. But I also think that this is a way for Democratic politicians to signal that they are signed onto a particular set of values about fairness, about affordability, about kind of all being in it together. And I think that they want to send those kind of values messages to voters, even if they're not necessarily sending them a specific policy platform that they can deliver on. And so I think it's a way to say, like, that's the mountain-top goal. We're going to get there eventually. But it's not necessarily saying, you know, on day one, I'm going to get there right away.
The record of the Trump administration was such a grab bag of Trump's distinctive nationalist policies, and just old line Republican stuff, and a little bit of, frankly, a little bit of the reform conservative stuff that I was pushing, among many others for a few years. It's a grab bag, right? So, different people who say that, oh, it's Trump's policies. They mean totally different things by that, right? Lindsey Graham might mean tax cuts when he is talking about that. And Senator Cotton might be talking about a crack down on illegal immigration. And one of the problems that Republicans have right now is that every argument inside the party ends up being sucked into the vortex of an argument about Trump, and Trump personally, Trump's personality, and so forth. And he's paralyzed the Republican policy debate for that reason. And the fact that there's so little coherence to Trump and to his record has helped contribute to that as well. [MUSIC PLAYING]
Algeria's president resigns: Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who has led the North African country for 20 years, has submitted his resignation under pressure from the army after weeks of mass protests.
The Republican plan would save the federal government $337 billion by 2026, with the largest savings coming from cuts to Medicaid spending as well as reduced spending on tax credits for middle-income insurance buyers.
But there is a plausible argument that Bloomberg's candidacy could be a boon to whoever faces Donald Trump in November. The vast bulk of his money so far has gone not into renting out arenas for campaign rallies or chartering planes to crisscross the country but into advertising: more than $200 million in less than two months. His television and radio ads represent more than three times the combined ad spending of every other Republican and Democratic presidential candidate, save for his fellow billionaire Tom Steyer, over the last year, according to the data firm Advertising Analytics.
KK: Why? Do you mind telling?
Whether we're talking about workers or we're talking about the environment, who has to meet what standards? And there are big corporations who figured out how to game the system. Where standards are high, then move that part of the operation somewhere else where standards are low and save a nickel. Because these corporations, they don't have any loyalty to a country, they just have loyalty to their own bottom line. And they play this all around the world.
Under the A.C.A., the poorest Americans are covered by Medicaid, so private premiums don't matter. Meanwhile, many of those with higher incomes — up to 400 percent of the poverty line, or more than $95,000 for a family of four — are eligible for subsidies. That's 59 percent of the population, but because many of those with higher incomes get insurance through their employers, it's 83 percent of those signing up on the exchanges. And here's the thing: Those subsidies aren't fixed. Instead, the formula sets the subsidy high enough to put a limit on how high premium payments can go as a percentage of income.
I think Robert Bork narrowed the standards we use for antitrust and for breaking up big companies. Market dominance by itself, when you totally dominate a market, that is anti-competitive. Then the platforms — this new — you want to go to the new part. The platforms themselves create a new kind of problem that we haven't seen. We can only do this by analogy, which is what we always do in law, but think of it this way. There's Amazon that owns the marketplace where people go and buy toasters and sell toasters, but they also are scraping bits of information off every one of those purchases. When they decide that your toaster business is getting very profitable, and they might like to crowd in on that, they take all that information they took from you without your consent and they go into the 2.0 version of your toaster business and move you back to page seven on the search.
The latest example: According to Bloomberg Politics, a Trump campaign staffer emailed surrogates on Sunday telling them not to talk about the Trump University case. Mr. Trump had been facing criticism for his racist comments about the judge in that case, Gonzalo Curiel, and the email told surrogates, The best possible response is 'the case will be tried in the courtroom in front of a jury — not in the media.'
President Trump's lawyers and aides are scouring the backgrounds of investigators hired by the special counsel Robert Mueller, looking for conflicts of interest, people with knowledge of the effort said.
It is one of the many ways the U.S. health care system has made us so much more vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic than other countries, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation and a co-author of the new study.

March 3, 2020, 11:19 p.m. ET March 3, 2020, 11:19 p.m. ET Two North Carolina Democrats are poised to join the House after redistricting. Democratic voters on Tuesday selected Deborah Ross, an unsuccessful 2016 Senate candidate, to run in North Carolina's newly redrawn second congressional district this November, all but assuring she will become a member of the House. The district, surrounding Raleigh, is one of two House seats that will be a virtual lock for Democrats after a court ordered the state to redraw its congressional map last year. Kathy Manning, a lawyer and small business owner, was on track to win the other, the state's newly drawn sixth district around Greensboro. If Democrats do win the seats in November, it would help insulate their House majority from Republicans seeking to reclaim control. Read more
One note I want to put here is, we talk all the time in politics about liberal bias or conservative bias or partisan bias. And people really underestimate how dangerous status quo bias is. And particularly, this is very true in the Senate, that people get used to the way they have done things. And so the fact that the way they do things doesn't make any sense and has become an illogical, as you put it, Kafkaesque nightmare — as I put it in a column recently, a Dadaist nightmare — stops reading to them is clear. So I want to go back to something you were saying earlier. The Senate has a filibuster, which we are going to talk about here in some detail. But just as a shorthand right now, the filibuster says things require 60 votes. And there is a coterie of senators, including, at this point, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who say that is good. It forces bipartisanship. It's how the Senate should work. So you might say, OK, everybody's going to demand everything requires 60 votes. But then they vote for budget reconciliation, which end runs the filibuster in this weird way. Because I mean, of course, you can't really run a Senate where you can never get anything done. So the Senate exists, and this is, by the way, true of everybody. The two major legislative packages of the Trump era were budget reconciliation packages, the Tax Cuts, and Obamacare repeal.
And so how does Graham explain to you how his relationship with Trump develops and how this evolution kind of lands with him having a relationship with Trump?
KK: As student loan debt has come up a couple of times, I want to make sure we have a question.
It's interesting. So when candidates like Bernie Sanders say Medicare for all, potentially, he's actually trying to change the American culture to the point where Medicare for all could actually work. In other words, when he or anyone says Medicare for all, they're actually calling for the cultural change required for the U.S. to get excited and adopt Medicare for all.
KK: Well, the House Democrats are fighting Mitch McConnell. [WARREN APPEARS UNIMPRESSED]
BS: What do you say about disenfranchisement? Forgive me for not knowing.
So when Republicans say they're disgusted by Trump's ignorance and indecency but love his deregulations and tax reforms — those very sanitized words — this is what they love: taking huge fiscal and environmental risks — effectively throwing away our bumpers and spare tires that we may soon need to drive through the next financial or climate storm — for a short-term economic and political high.
In contrast, in the Republican formulation, the size of the tax credits is coupled only to the age of the recipient; older Americans get more, on the principle that the cost of insurance is higher for those of more advanced years.
WALLACE: Sir, your two minutes are up.
Mr. Buttigieg said that a plan that offers Medicare for those who want it will be a natural glide path to the single payer environment. The quickest, fastest way to do it is build on Obamacare, to build on what we did. And secondly, to make sure that everyone does have an option. I feel very strongly that families ought to be able to have this choice. You can't eliminate private insurance for 180 million people, many who don't want to give it up.
The changes in premiums affect nearly everyone, but are particularly valuable for two groups. If you have a low income, subsidies will cover enough to give you a free silver plan with extra benefits that lower your co-payments and deductibles. And if you earn more than 400 percent of the federal poverty level — about $51,000 for a single person or $105,000 for a family of four — for the first time you will qualify for help buying insurance.
So there's an argument that in a closely divided country, or at least in a closely divided Senate, if you can't get to 60, you can't get meaningful bipartisanship, you just shouldn't do big things because it'd be polarizing intrinsically to do big things. And I want to read you what Mitch McConnell said in 2014 in his speech about how if he took over the Senate, he would restore it to its old traditions and luster about this. And he's talking about Obamacare here. And he says, Without some meaningful buy-in, you guarantee a food fight. You guarantee instability and strife. It may very well have been the case that on Obamacare, the will of the country was not to pass the bill at all. That's what I would have concluded if Republicans couldn't get a single Democrat vote for legislation of this magnitude. I'd have thought, maybe this isn't such a great idea. Now, obviously, Mitch McConnell is a hypocrite. Obviously, he has run all kinds of bills without getting bipartisan votes. But a lot of people believe this underlying idea that if you cannot get bipartisan votes for something, maybe it isn't such a good idea. Maybe that's a signal you need to slow down and stop. I'm curious what your response to them is.
After years of vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, as it is formally known, Republican lawmakers in both chambers of Congress have now passed a bill that will make it easier to gut the law.
The Senate confirms Pete Buttigieg as transportation secretary. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:22 - 0:00 transcript Buttigieg Is Confirmed by the Senate On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., as transportation secretary for the Biden administration. Pete Buttigieg for secretary of transportation. Mr. Buttigieg, known to many simply as Mayor Pete, has demonstrated an impressive familiarity with our nation's entire transportation challenges, challenges which are pronounced in states like my own, where projects like the Gateway Tunnel are a top national priority. I know that Mr. Buttigieg is committed to working with members from both sides to improve rail and transit highways, and more, in rural communities, urban centers and everywhere in between. We all know the nominee as Mayor Pete, a man who basically came on to the national stage as a Midwest mayor who had lots of enthusiasm for making investments in America's future. So today we're considering his nomination to be secretary of transportation at a time when we need a lot of work done on transportation. And in my opinion, he's a young, energetic mayor, who is going to help us usher in a new era of transportation. Mr. McConnell. Mr McConnell, 'aye.' Mr. Romney, 'aye.' Is there anyone in the chamber who would like to vote or change his or her vote? If not, the yeas are 86, the nays are 13. The nomination is confirmed.
Here are the changes made to the bill so far. And here is an easy way to see how it differs from Obamacare.
Founded in 2016 by Jenny Abramson and Heidi Patel, Rethink has invested in an array of start-ups, including Guild Education, which partners with companies to offer workers employer-sponsored education programs, and Ellevest, a women-focused financial information start-up co-founded by Sallie Krawcheck, a former Citigroup C.F.O. It mostly invests in Series A and B funding rounds, alongside other venture firms.
Called Trump — I think it was a [expletive].
Throughout his presidential campaign Donald J. Trump extolled his business acumen and management skills, and just before his inauguration he insisted the transition to his administration was going very, very smoothly.
G.O.P. opposition to programs helping the less fortunate, from food stamps to Medicaid, is usually framed in monetary terms. For example, Senator Orrin Hatch, challenged about Congress's failure to take action on the Children's Health Insurance Program, a part of Medicaid that covers nearly nine million children — and whose federal funding expired back in September — declared that the reason CHIP's having trouble is that we don't have money anymore.
And so when somebody — when I was first thinking about running for president, somebody said to me, Primaries are hard. You've never been in one and they're hard, because the people you think are going to be your friends turn out not to be your friends. And ——
The proposal is also notable for what it did not include. In previous years, Mr. Trump's budget has proposed repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with a system that would provide block grants of funding to states with far fewer rules about how the money should be spent. The new budget backs away from that approach. It leaves the law's funding in place but asks Congress to develop policies that would advance the president's health reform vision, with a corresponding price tag, which it says would save $844 billion over the decade.
Right. He cited the date 2021. We will do all this right after the election.
John Broder: We have combat troops in Syria now fighting ISIS.
But Heritage Action, because of its ironclad resistance to partial repeal, actually opposed the measure to get rid of the 1099 provision. Yes, it would help small businesses — but then those same small businesses would no longer care to be part of Heritage Action's crusade. As Needham later told me, We felt that when anything less than full repeal becomes acceptable, you open the door for every lobbyist in town to say: 'Hey, while we're working on full repeal, let's fix the 1099 issue. Or let's fix the franchise-restaurant issue'  — the popular shorthand for an A.C.A. provision requiring companies with 50 or more employees to provide health care to anyone working over 30 hours a week. You eventually over time whittle off various constituencies that we want to keep as part of the full-repeal platform. Partial repeal would be well and good if it got rid of what Needham called a vital organ of the law: the individual mandate, say, or Medicaid expansion. But those vital organs were never going to go down if repeal was defined by Washington's lobbying class. It would be 1099s and these heavily lobbied issues, and then we'll be stuck with Obamacare.

So this could be what some Republican voters, especially moderate-ish Republican voters, are thinking when they imagine that Trump is more electable than his more ideologically conservative rivals. And if the pundits are all proven wrong one more time and Trump makes a real race of it, this will be the reason why.
So I want to push on this just a little bit, which is what would make it go differently next time? What lessons need to be learned by the kinds of politicians you would like to see triumph from their more recent losses?
I was also very unhappy, in real time, when Obama began echoing Republican arguments for fiscal austerity despite continuing high unemployment.
Look, the uncharitable way of describing this would be opportunism. The charitable way of saying this would be influence. And the fact is, one of the central dynamics of Washington, circa 2019, circa the Trump administration, is that never has the decision point been so wrapped up in the mercurialness of one single person as it is right now in Donald Trump's orbit. And Lindsey Graham has made himself a part of that orbit. Now, it might not last beyond next week. It might not last beyond his re-election. Who knows where this is going to end? Lindsey Graham posed that question himself to me. But for now, he seems to think it's very, very advantageous for him politically.
The new suburban Democrats may be attracted to Mr. Bloomberg's more moderate message, and he's been hammering them with it; more than half of his ads in Los Angeles and San Diego deal with the issue of health care. One ad, which attacks Mr. Trump for saying let Obamacare implode, ran more than 1,700 times in the two markets, the most of any Bloomberg ad, powered by $2.2 million.
Goldwater's convention was a harshly factional affair, with conservative Republicans doing their damnedest to expel the moderate wing of the party. In its aftermath, George Romney, then the governor of Michigan and a leading light of moderate Republicanism, wrote a twelve-page letter outlining his disagreements with Goldwater. Dogmatic ideological parties tend to splinter the political and social fabric of a nation, lead to governmental crises and deadlocks, and stymie the compromises so often necessary to preserve freedom and achieve progress, he wrote, rather prophetically. (Decades later, his son, who had carried on his father's legacy as the popular moderate governor of Massachusetts, would win the Republican nomination for the presidency by recasting himself as severely conservative.)
Our three-part investigation describes the Murdoch family's role in destabilizing democracy in North America, Europe and Australia. The product of six months of digging, the report shows how two major stories of our times — one of nativist forces, the other of the Murdoch dynasty — are really one.
The demands are a sort of warning shot to Republicans. While the party is eager to repeal the law as quickly as possible, and many have promised a replacement, its members are sharply divided over what shape any new plan should take. If they do not come up with an alternative, more than 22 million people would be left uninsured, including the more than 10 million who have bought individual plans on state marketplaces.
I cite Poland because so many Poles (including the Krzysztofowicz family, later renamed Kristof) came to America for a better life, yet today American babies are one-third more likely to die in their first year of life than Polish children are (and twice as likely as Italian, Portuguese and Czech babies!). Meanwhile, American women are four times as likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth as Polish women, according to the World Health Organization.
When told that former Vice President Biden criticized her health care plans, Senator Warren answered with a critique of moderate Democrats: Democrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies. She also suggested Mr. Biden is running in the wrong primary.
Stephen Miller, a former Senate press aide and the incoming senior White House adviser for policy, who has been particularly aggressive in presenting himself as the voice of Mr. Trump on all policy matters, has pushed the notion that a plan should move quickly and in tandem with a replacement measure, rather than in a series of smaller bills, congressional aides said.
End Citizens United, a group with more than four million members and half a million donors around the country, has voiced support for Senator Warren's proposed anti-corruption plans. The group has noted that both President Obama and President Trump won election in part by portraying themselves as tougher on opponents. Read more in The Times.
From the beginning, Republicans hated Obamacare not because they expected it to fail, but because they feared that it would succeed, and thereby demonstrate that government actually can do things to make people's lives better. And their nightmare is gradually coming true: Although it took a long time, the Affordable Care Act is finally becoming popular, and the public's concern that the G.O.P. will kill it is becoming an important political liability.
# #1 Benefit requirements New change States will be required to define a minimum package of benefits for insurance plans for people who buy their own coverage.

When Bush pushed through his tax cut, we had a budget surplus, so it wasn't clear to voters that less revenue might mean cuts to programs they count on. When you push through big tax cuts in the face of a budget deficit — and when your own party has spent years warning about imminent fiscal doom and demanding spending cuts — the implications are more obvious.
But in subtle and not so subtle ways, the White House waged a quiet campaign to ensure that Mr. Trump had a second opportunity in his administration's first 18 months to fulfill one of his most important campaign promises to his conservative followers — that he would change the complexion and direction of the Supreme Court.

The question now is whether Trump will pay any price for betraying all his promises. Democrats took the House in 2018 largely because of the popular backlash against his attempt to destroy Obamacare. But there's a real danger that Democrats will blow the election by making it a referendum on ambitious ideas like so-called Medicare for all that are unlikely to become reality, rather than on Trump's ongoing efforts to destroy programs Americans love.
BA: Would you reduce existing access in order to achieve that goal?

Mara Gay: Actually, that's a perfect point for me to just ask you a question that's related. My family is from Michigan, and U.A.W. workers. One of the last things that they really love, many of them, is their health care. So I guess my question is, is both a practical one and a political one, which is why not try and expand health care access without actually taking away programs that people already like? Is there a way to do that? Is there even a way to get to what you're talking about without talking about it in such dogmatic political terms, and how do you — this is I guess the most important part of the question, I think, is how do you make the pitch to a U.A.W. worker that what you can offer is actually better than what they already have?

And you may start out with modest increments and increase them over time, but there's no reason that we should be treating a country that is producing goods through prison labor or child labor or unsafe working standards or by polluting the earth, that we should treat a country that produces goods in that way the same way we're treating a country that produces goods with standards that are much closer to ours. We simply put our own businesses and our own workers at a competitive disadvantage, so we end up doing things like exporting pollution. Can't pollute here in the United States, but move this polluting industry. This way that you're going to paint dolls or produce chips, move it somewhere else where they have no environmental standards and then resell, and then sell those goods back in the United States.
Well, they go back to trying to find creative workarounds. So the first thing that some of the local jurisdictions do is close and limit their polling locations. Some of the more drastic examples include Milwaukee, the biggest city in the state, going from 180 polling locations, typically, down to just five or seven.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi — who celebrated her 79th birthday on Tuesday — had already planned to move to change the conversation with the unveiling of the Democrats' own health care plan on Tuesday. The Democrats' bill aims to lower health insurance premiums, strengthen protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions and ban the sale of what Democrats call junk insurance.

Whether the Affordable Care Act should be repealed has been one of the highest-profile health policy issues ever since its passage in 2010. Health economists are clear on this: They strongly reject repeal, with 89 percent opposing the idea.
I think the main reason why health care at that time was so controversial is because doctors were really against it. Doctors were these small business owners, people paid them directly for medical care, and they really didn't want the government getting involved in their business and, perhaps, making it harder for them to make a living.
That's a nice one. I like that. So look, I think it's one of the things that, as a country, it's time for us to take it on.
The terrific Sarah Palin was the very first person of note to endorse Donald Trump, and he should pick her because of his beautiful loyalty.

In a statement Wednesday, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey recommended that Congress include a special enrollment provision in its next round of coronavirus legislation. He had also proposed such language be included in the last bill. At a time when our health care system is already under enormous strain, it makes no sense to willingly allow even more individuals to go without coverage, he said.
It focuses on whether the law's requirement that most Americans have health insurance is unconstitutional, but has much broader implications. The Justice Department made a highly unusual decision this summer: though it disagreed with the plaintiffs that the entire law should be struck down, it decided not to defend the individual mandate or several other central provisions, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions. That prompted a coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia, led by California, to intervene to defend the law, saying that to pause it or invalidate key components would threaten the health care of millions of people.
Critics of the wealth tax point out that only four European countries now have one, down from 12 in 1990. In France, the wealth tax triggered an exodus of the ultrarich and didn't raise as much revenue as anticipated.
This is a profound enough point worth dwelling on for a moment. When a division exists inside a party, it gets addressed through suppression or compromise. Parties don't want to fight among themselves. But when a division exists between the parties, it gets addressed through conflict. Without the restraint of party unity, political disagreements escalate. An example here is health care: Democrats and Republicans spend billions of dollars in election ads emphasizing their disagreements on health care, because the debate motivates their supporters and, they hope, turns the public against their opponents. The upside of this is that important issues get aired and sometimes even resolved. The downside is that the divisions around them become deeper and angrier.
But the law has made health care far more affordable in a number of less conspicuous ways.
Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren are members of the same generation, Democrats shaped by modest upbringings who became United States senators and candidates for their party's presidential nomination. But with Mr. Biden now actively considering Ms. Warren to be his running mate, it's their ideological differences — and whether they can build a complementary, productive relationship — that will ultimately determine whether she emerges as No. 2 on the ticket.

That's part of it. It's why you have to build — when I did inside/outside, it's also about the importance of building grass roots, building it from the ground up. It's why I made the decisions I made in running for president right from the beginning, which we can talk about in a minute. But for me, that's at the heart of it, and then there's a second part. I'll push first to get the anti-corruption bill through. I'll push to deliver on a meaningful anti-corruption deal.

Medicaid also helped Kansas Democrats win a 2018 election for governor, and on Thursday the state's Democratic governor, Laura Kelly, and its Republican State Senate leader, Jim Denning, announced the details of their compromise to expand the program. The state will implement the expansion, covering up to 150,000 additional Kansans. In return, Republicans will get a pilot program meant to reduce private health insurance premiums and keep people from dropping existing insurance and signing up for Medicaid, paid for an increase in the state cigarette tax by a $1 per pack. The proposal would also allow the state to charge recipients a premium of up to $25 per individual and $100 per family. If and when it becomes law, Kansas will become the 37th state to expand its Medicaid program.
Reed: I thought he was pretty realistic in talking about the need to make various fixes to the law. That's been an issue since it was passed in 2010. There is a fairly broad consensus that the law could be changed to make it work better, even among its supporters. What did surprise me was the president's admission that affordability remains a real concern for many people, even with subsidies.
It's not too hard to imagine a Trump who pursued this strategy much more aggressively, doling out checks and assistance to his core constituencies at every opportunity. One of his early advisers, Steve Bannon, urged as much at the start of Trump's administration, calling for an economic nationalism to match the president's anti-immigrant rhetoric. It's an approach that may have left him more popular than he is now, or at least, less unpopular.

Did any of these Republican lawmakers take note of the Iranian naval exercise in the gulf in August ? The Iranians took some big old ships from the shah's days and said you will be the American Navy.

Analysis: McConnell was done with Trump. The G.O.P. said not so fast. Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, has been circumspect about how the Republican Party can break away from former President Donald J. Trump's grip. Credit... Oliver Contreras for The New York Times Three times in recent weeks, as Republicans grappled with a deadly attack on the Capitol and their new minority status in Washington, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky carefully nudged open the door for his party to kick Donald J. Trump to the curb, only to find it slammed shut. So his decision on Tuesday to join all but five Republican senators in voting to toss out the House's impeachment case against Mr. Trump as unconstitutional seemed to be less a reversal than a recognition that the critical mass of his party was not ready to join him in cutting loose the former president. Far from repudiating Mr. Trump, as it appeared they might in the days after the Jan. 6 rampage at the Capitol, Republicans have reverted to the posture they adopted when he was in office — unwilling to cross a figure who continues to hold outsize sway in their party. For Mr. McConnell, a leader who derives his power in large part from his ability to keep Republicans unified, defying the will of his members would have been a momentous risk, putting his own post in peril and courting the ire of the far right.
But peaceful demonstrators took control, igniting a national movement that challenged Mr. Trump without making him its focal point.
It may be futile to try to restrict the influence of the very wealthy, but we can offset it by opening the system up and making it easier for a candidate to run and be heard, or for people working together to put a new idea on the agenda. Both Democratic presidential candidates have called for some kind of system of public financing that matches small donations, along the lines of New York City's program, which matches small contributions six to one. Every current citywide elected official participated in the system, and small donors, including the match, accounted for 61 percent of the money spent in the 2013 elections.

And to me, a good example of that is Florida. I mean, Ron DeSantis, who's the current governor of Florida, ran a campaign last year that were it not for Donald Trump, I think, would have stood out for how racialized and, I would argue, racist it was. And Ron DeSantis is now the governor of Florida who's doing all kinds of things like trying to take voting rights away from African-American former felons. Ross, I take your point that this is not full Trumpification, but I do worry that it's moving in that direction.
If the administration prevails in the case, the full force of the decision would not hit until after the midterm elections on Nov. 6. But insurers said the legal debate alone could cause turmoil in insurance markets this summer.
Vice President Biden has cast the Medicare for all plan as anti-labor, arguing that unions have already painstakingly negotiated health care benefits, progress that could be undone by a single-payer system. But Senators Warren and Sanders argue that the plan is pro-labor because it would mean union members are guaranteed health care and can focus their negotiations on wage increases, family leave and other benefits.
I did this interview with Senator Cotton and it had been set up as a thing on cancel culture, which is fine, and great, and there's a lot of interesting stuff to say about it. But I did say, I did ask, So OK, if this is like this huge problem in America, what are you as the Senator going to do about it? And he didn't have much of an answer to that. And I'm not sure that there really is much of an answer, other than, well, I'm just going to keep saying what I'm saying and I'm in this position where I depend on voters rather than these cultural institutions and so, I have this freedom. Which I mean, that's actually not a terrible answer to the question, but it's not a completely satisfying answer to the question either. Let me back up a second. There is some policy substance that was important to Trump. Trump, whether because he was a brilliant strategist, or because he had a certain cunning sense of these things. He did, I think, understand the red lines in the Republican Party. Because sometimes you hear people saying, well, Republicans are for Trump. Whatever he does they they'd go with him. He could do anything. He could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue. OK, fine. He can do lots of things. He proved that he could do lots of things and still retain Republican support.

Part two is again, we should be working more with our allies. Donald Trump seems to think somehow that we are stronger alone and I think that's fundamentally wrong. If you want to bring economic pressure on China, if you want to bring diplomatic pressure on China, it makes a lot more sense to do that if we're doing it with our allies, if we're doing it in conjunction with others. And I think that provides potentially much better protection for Hong Kong. The idea that this is going to be a direct military conflict between China and the United States, that would be deeply destabilizing to the entire world. So I want to see us use our diplomatic tools. I want to see us use our economic tools, and I want to see us leverage everything that we want to do by working much more tightly in conjunction with our allies. We just haven't been doing that. None of the above.

Zucker's tenure at CNN started inauspiciously. He talked about the need to broaden the definition of news and joked about replacing a pillow in one executive's office that said CNN = Politics with one that read CNN > Politics.

Zucker's news judgment was publicly and repeatedly called into question: In 2015, Jon Stewart devoted a large part of The Daily Show to mocking CNN for broadcasting the White House Correspondents Dinner rather than covering the protests after a black man, Freddie Gray, died in the custody of the Baltimore Police.
When I began writing columns in The Times about climate policy more than a decade ago, I, too, was strongly in favor of carbon pricing as the best strategy for attacking climate change. But two big things have changed since then. The financial crisis and its aftermath intensified many families' economic problems. Income growth has since been sluggish. Amazingly, the wealth of the median American household has fallen 30 percent since 2007, according to the most recent Federal Reserve data, making higher energy costs an even harder sell.

The stop in Des Moines was the first event of a three-day Iowa swing for Mr. Biden, who has led in national and state polling despite appearing in the state far less than his top competitors.

I would say that the one difference between a case like this and something like the Charlottesville case is that Trump's foils here are genuinely unpopular figures to the extent that they're well known. That could make this a case where he gets away with more bigotry because it's seen as a choice between Trump's bigotry and Ilhan Omar's far-left politics. But I think, in general, we have a very clear track record that when Trump is seen to be explicitly race-baiting, lots and lots of voters who might be otherwise inclined to support him don't like it.
Never in modern American history has a president so transparently aimed to destroy a piece of major legislation. What makes Mr. Trump's sabotage especially undemocratic is that Congress has repeatedly considered repealing the law — and repeatedly declined to do so. In addition, the Supreme Court has twice sustained the Affordable Care Act in the face of major legal challenges. Mr. Trump's attempt to destroy the law any way he can is an unconstitutional usurpation of power.
I am convinced that more Americans are worried about the country's cohesion and its institutions being ripped apart by Trump than Trump realizes. It's a key reason his approval rankings remain largely flat while our stock markets soar. I also believe that the Trump team has overestimated how easy it will be for it to just keep hiding the most important evidence and witnesses now that the impeachment trial has begun and many Americans are tuning in to this issue for the first time.
Despite all that, however, the act has vastly improved many Americans' lives — and in many cases, saved lives that would otherwise have been lost due to inadequate care. The progress has been most dramatic in states that have tried to make the law work. Before the A.C.A. went into effect, 24 percent of California adults too young for Medicare were uninsured. Today that number is down to 10 percent. In West Virginia, uninsurance fell from 21 percent to 9. In Kentucky, it fell from 21 to 7.

Of course, it's not possible to know through a survey. But just by getting a peek at a voter beyond his one ballot can inspire a much more humble reading of the electorate's behavior.
You had budget reconciliation under Obama. You had the Bush tax cuts or budget reconciliation under George W. Bush. It's one thing for the Senate to say the 60-vote threshold is sacrosanct. That's how we want to run the institution. It's another to say majority rules is the way you want to run the institution, which is how most institutions run. It's totally bizarre to me to say we want to keep the 60-vote threshold, but obviously, that's not working, and it would completely paralyze the institution. So we're going to do this dumb thing and abuse another rule in a way that creates worse legislation instead.
KK: As student loan debt has come up a couple of times, I want to make sure we have a question.
Well, so — I don't want to be Sigmund Freud. He's got a tough job.
Brent Staples: But she needed the Triangle Shirtwaist fire. What is the contemporary equivalent of the Shirtwaist fire?
Senator Warren published an op-ed in The Washington Post in 2015 attacking the investor-state dispute settlement clause in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which she argued would tilt the playing field in the United States further in favor of big multinational corporations.
John Broder: We have combat troops in Syria now fighting ISIS.
We understand the Redemption era now as a white response to the gains black people made during Reconstruction. Is it too simplistic to say that the energy driving the current moment is also a reaction to black progress and Obama's becoming president? I've spent a lot of time thinking about your question, and I don't know the answer. If we're sitting around in a bar with a bunch of black people, they could say, Barack and Michelle drove all the white people totally out of their minds. I think that's partly true. The other thing, though, is that between Martin Luther King's death and now, the black middle class has doubled and the black upper-middle class has quadrupled. But simultaneously, if you look at the wages of white workers — the chance of your kids doing better than you if you were in the white working class, that's over. So you might look at a black family in the White House, all these black people who joined the upper-middle class, and there's a kind of collective What the [expletive]?
KK: Well, it has to come to the Senate floor. I mean, Mitch McConnell already has an anti-corruption, election reform bill [passed by the House].
But the change in premiums would be significantly different, depending on age, because the Republican plan calls for charging more for older Americans than allowed under the current law.
Empathy, Porter argues, has always waged an unequal struggle against the racial animus that courses through American history, poisoning both those who hate and those who are hated. Race has contaminated American solidarity, making it impossible for poor whites, threatened by job loss, globalization and the death of carbon-intensive industries, to make common cause with African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans and immigrants. He writes, Unwilling to share the bounty of state with people of other races and creeds, heritages and colors, real Americans — the white ones — have prevented the erection of a welfare state at all.
On this not-so-happy anniversary, a Democratic super PAC is on the air with a television commercial reminding her constituents of a repeal vote that Republicans were once convinced would be a political winner. Ms. Tenney's Democratic challenger, Anthony Brindisi, a state assemblyman, said health care is consistently one of the top issues in a vast district that runs from Lake Ontario through Utica and Rome to the Pennsylvania border.

The Green New Deal obviously cannot wish away the costs of replacing dirty energy. Government subsidies for clean energy require tax dollars, and performance standards for utilities will almost certainly cause prices to rise. But as the experience in California, among other places, has shown, a switch to cleaner energy is not as expensive as many people fear. The price of solar and wind power has fallen sharply in recent years and will most likely fall further. The problem with the failed carbon-pricing schemes of recent years has not been the actual price increases they would inflict on families but the perceived price increases. Either a carbon tax or a Green New Deal would impose manageable costs, but those incurred by the Green New Deal are likely to be less visible.
Does the administration really think that the very position it advanced just months ago is so untenable that it must now adopt one that is even more extreme?
The threat of repeal appears to have been particularly galvanizing for Democratic activists, who came out to protest and contact their legislators during the debate.
Mr. Holder has few qualms about calling Mr. Trump a racist in the former president's presence. Mr. Obama has never contradicted him, but he avoids the term, even in private, preferring a more indirect accusation of racial demagoguery, according to several people close to both men.
Obamacare's individual mandate is the least popular provision in the law. But it is vital because it encourages younger and healthier people to sign up for health insurance. Otherwise, people would simply wait until they got sick or injured to buy coverage. As a result, insurers would either charge much higher premiums or not sell comprehensive health policies at all. A system that allows people to purchase coverage only when they need it drives up costs for everyone, the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association said in a statement on Wednesday.
KK: O.K., the Electoral College is really important to Jesse. So much of the biggest change in recent years has come through the Supreme Court. Who would be your Supreme Court nominees?
In response, climate activists are realizing that they instead need to find policies that are popular enough to survive the inevitable attacks on them.
A growing divide has emerged among unions over whether to support Medicare for all. Roughly 95 percent of union workers had health care access in 2019, while just 68 percent of nonunion workers did.
Trump will probably accomplish at least part of the short-term goal and take insurance away from some people. But it is possible to minimize the damage, through an effective political response. Whether you're a Democrat, Republican or independent — whether you have already been part of the citizen activism or not — I encourage you to get involved.
BS: You speak of these people standing around at rallies, are a lot of these people you're talking about. A lot of people standing around at Trump rallies are the very people you're talking about.
A century ago, most Americans worked in agriculture: Today hardly any do, and we're all better off, including farmers. That manual labor, farm or factory, has given way to 60 percent of Americans employed in white-collar circumstances is the important story in the long term. But nothing is achieved by moaning about the past. The challenge is to create even more white-collar opportunities.
Now, that's only for collective bargaining agreements, but that's real money in the pockets of those union numbers. Secondly, what at least some of the unions liked about this is the unions never have to bargain on this one again, once you get all the way to Medicare for all, because their workers will have health care coverage. Which means they can bargain once again over wages and working conditions and keeping jobs here in the United States instead of having to go back to their members year after year after year and say: We just bargained. Great for you. Your salary will go up one half of 1 percent, and your deductible will only go up by another $2,000.
BS: Just to tie in with Charlie here, let's just take the prescription problem.
Wow. And what's the reaction to Sanders's proposal?
Maine Senator (and Congresswoman) Margaret Chase Smith, Ms. Collins' political foremother and idol, often broke ranks with her party — to defend, for instance, F.D.R.'s New Deal legislation from conservative attacks. On June 1, 1950, she became one of the first members of Congress to denounce the anti-Communist witch hunt of fellow Republican Senator Joe McCarthy. She began her Declaration of Conscience speech: I would like to speak briefly and simply about a serious national condition. It is a national feeling of fear and frustration that could result in national suicide and the end of everything that we Americans hold dear. She did not want to see the Republican Party ride to political victory on the Four Horsemen of Calumny — Fear, Ignorance, Bigotry and Smear.
But look at the difference it makes if there are multiple Facebooks out there. If you can get to anybody's page regardless of who they go through, it becomes like the phone company, right? You can have any different brand of phone, but as long as I hit the same set of numbers, I will reach you. If you could do that through Facebook, then you've got competitors offering, hey, I tell you what. You come use my site, and I won't be sharing your personal data with anybody. I will offer better security than those other yahoos offer. I will offer you a 2-cent rebate for all of the advertising. I will offer you the option to click out of ads, or you'll only get one ad every minute. That's what competitive markets do.
We'll be right back. [MUSIC]: Here's what else you need to know today.
Wow. Trump tiene una opinión muy baja de los republicanos. Y de las aseguradoras. ¿Ven por qué un ciudadano desesperado podría creer que él es el menor de tres males compitiendo a la cabeza? Recuerden: el candidato de la cúpula prudente del partido es una persona que no quiere permitir abortos para víctimas de violación y que básicamente cree que la única gente que debería tener que pagar impuestos es la que trabajó por el dinero.
So the effect is that the promises that are put into trade agreements like T.P.P., they may all look the same on paper, but man, they are nowhere close to each other in terms of what happens with enforcement. Multinational corporations are given the opportunity basically to opt out of laws they don't like, where protections that are supposed to be written for our workers, for the worldwide environment, for human rights standards, just get left by the curb.
At age 19, Senator Warren married her high school sweetheart, a computer engineer, Jim Warren. She gave up a full scholarship to George Washington University for the marriage, and they later split in part because he didn't support her career ambitions.
The health care industry consists of a dense network of public-private partnerships. Even programs widely viewed as government insurance, like Medicare and Medicaid, depend on private hospitals, doctors and insurers.
Asian-American identity is in vogue, and Ross Douthat is the latest to offer his thoughts. But Mr. Douthat, focusing on the film Crazy Rich Asians and Harvard admissions, misses the complexity of today's Asian-Americans.

In a statement, Johnson insisted he remained in charge of the British government, but said he had deputized his foreign minister to act in his place when necessary. Meanwhile, Iran, an epicenter of the virus in the Middle East, said it would lift a nationwide shutdown of businesses and allow the majority of its workforce to return to work later this week.
BS: What do you say about disenfranchisement? Forgive me for not knowing.
The question is not that far-fetched. The current economic expansion is already the third longest since the middle of the 19th century, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. If it makes it past June of next year it will be the longest on record.
This lie was invented by Sarah Palin in 2009, during the fight for what would become the Affordable Care Act. It was the hysterical version of the common conservative critique that universal health care means government rationing.
So you might think that this sort of really left-wing idea of doing a universal health care would just go away, but instead it starts to gain in popularity, and we see this in a couple of different ways. Public opinion surveys show steady and modest increases in the number of Americans who seem interested in this idea when they're asked about it. And the other thing that happens is we start to see way more Democrats in Congress signing on to proposals like the Sanders proposal. So Sanders himself had a bill that he had brought forward in previous Congresses and, basically, no one wanted to co-sign it. And then he brought it again in 2017, and all of a sudden he had, I think, 16 co-sponsors, including lots of really ambitious Democratic senators that we expected to run for president, and we now see are running for president. And there's a bill in the House that had been introduced year after year with very few co-sponsors, and all of a sudden, again, in 2017, we saw the majority of Democrats in the House were signing onto this bill.
I tell them that if you are counting on forbearance from Mitch McConnell in not getting rid of the filibuster himself when he takes back power, because we didn't get rid of it now, then I've got a bridge to sell you. I think that —
The way I think we get something done in Washington, it's the Frances Perkins story. It's not enough to organize on the outside and have the marches in the street. Before the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire, there had been dozens of marches, right? Lots of high profile. But the guys who ran the factories figured out it was a lot cheaper just to grease palms in Albany than it was to actually change their practices and put up adequate fire escapes and fire preventive measures. So just pushing from the outside, it's not enough to get it done. Just fighting it from the inside is not enough to get it done. But the one-two punch of pushing from the outside and leading it from the inside is where you see real difference.
WASHINGTON — The Trump administration asked a federal appeals court on Monday to delay ruling on a lawsuit that could determine whether the government will continue paying subsidies under the Affordable Care Act to health insurance companies for the benefit of low-income people — effectively prolonging uncertainty that is already rattling the health law.
I'm sorry, say it again. Facebook?
Senator Warren said in March that she hopes to pass a constitutional amendment to protect every American's right to vote. She added, Every vote matters, and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.
Imagine if American health policy were established by the consensus of health economists. What would the system look like? A survey of nearly 200 Ph.D. health economists working in the United States provides some clues.
The economy: Closing racial gaps and creating jobs programs
No. This is on budget reconciliation.
Basically, we need to give up on the for-profit insurers. There is no place, except among a niche, to have our entire system held hostage by this parasitic middleman.
While the economy is hardly booming, trundling along at an annual growth rate of about 2.5 percent, investors are getting jittery.
So with the Affordable Care Act, once again, the concept of government-run health care is proposed and ultimately tossed aside.
You start by disrupting. You start with some wins. You start with some places people want to be, and actually immigration reform is one of them. People don't like our immigration system, and our support for immigrants continues to go up. I can be in a room full of people who are three generations away from any immigration experience personally, and they want to see us get this done. It's not just liberals. What was the latest story? Utah wants more immigrants, right?
The press never tires of the Democrats in disarray story line, but that doesn't mean it's always wrong. Its latest manifestation concerns the pickle Senate Democrats are in with respect to the coming hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court.
My view on that one is that really you can be the umpire in the baseball game or you can have a team in the baseball game, but you don't get to do both at the same time. So breaking the platform off from the competitive business, yeah, that would give a lot of small businesses a much more level playing field and ability to compete.
The effort has its roots in a less focused campaign at the start of the Trump administration. Four years ago, during the transition, a Trump aide printed out the detailed checklist of Mr. Obama's campaign promises from the official White House website with the goal, never quite achieved, of reversing every single one.
With those kinds of problems, you might think that the stock market has looked with disfavor at UnitedHealth and its competitors, and that investors have been counting on Congress to repeal Obamacare and replace it within something more palatable for the insurers.
WASHINGTON — Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot who built a formidable campaign war chest, emerged Tuesday as the Democratic nominee to take on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, fending off a challenge from the left that highlighted the party's ideological divisions.
Carbon pricing's recent losing streak arguably began in the United States during the first two years of Obama's presidency, in 2009 and 2010. Those years were the most successful period for progressive legislation since Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society. Obama signed a huge federal stimulus bill, toughened Wall Street regulation and extended health insurance to some 20 million people. The one major piece of Democratic legislation that failed was the climate bill, which was sponsored in the House of Representatives by Henry Waxman of California and Ed Markey of Massachusetts.
That's a pretty pale rebellion. It's like saying you're going to sit home on Election Day and sulk.
And he said he was doing O.K. He misses him. He thinks about him all the time.
We fall apart, particularly in the academy, when we succumb to or perpetuate that kind of intellectual bullying.
Two main changes appear to have turned the tide on health care as an issue. The Republican effort to repeal Obamacare last year made the embattled health law more popular than it has ever been. For the first time, the Affordable Care Act earned the support of a majority of Americans in public polls, a small shift but one that has been durable, even as Congress moved on to a tax overhaul and other issues. Pre-existing condition protections have always been much more popular than the law over all.

So why is Mr. Bloomberg spending nearly $10 million in the state?
And in Oklahoma, voters narrowly approved expanding Medicaid coverage to at least 200,000 lower-income adults, according to The Associated Press, an affirmation of Obamacare in an overwhelmingly Republican state. The results, coming as the state battles the coronavirus pandemic, was a repudiation of President Trump and Republican state leaders who had opposed the Medicaid expansion and who supported a court case seeking to overturn President Barack Obama's signature health care plan.
Donald Trump won the Electoral College (though not the popular vote) on the strength of overwhelming support from working-class whites, who feel left behind by a changing economy and society. And they're about to get their reward — the same reward that, throughout Mr. Trump's career, has come to everyone who trusted his good intentions. Think Trump University.
There was little new in Mr. Trump's performance. He did not offer a governing vision or even an updated policy focus for a second term. His 76-minute speech was the usual brew of aggrandizement, aggrievement and demonization of political foes. He vilified Democrats as ruthless, unhinged monsters dedicated to the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream. He whined about his persecution by the fake news and the deep-state rogues who perpetrated the Russia witch hunt. He devoted so much time to attacking Crooked Hillary that it seemed as though a confused aide might have accidentally loaded one of his 2016 speeches into the teleprompters.
I don't know anybody who's afraid of the 2-cent wealth tax who isn't already a billionaire.
A Federal District Court judge in Texas agreed, ruling all of Obamacare invalid, but postponed the effects of his ruling until the case could be appealed. In that ruling last month, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the mandate could not remain, but declined to rule on what should happen to the remainder of the health law, asking the lower court to reconsider the question in more detail.
TRUMP: The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.
The bottom line: The Republican proposal would not increase competition and consumer choice as Mr. Ryan claims. It certainly wouldn't deliver on President Trump's promise of insurance for everybody. And it wouldn't be the full repeal of the A.C.A., or Obamacare, that many Republicans have been promising their base for the last seven years. That is why some hard-liners say they will oppose the new bill, which the House is expected to vote on as early as Thursday.
Mr. Trump requested no funding at all for the initiative in his 2018 budget request, effectively eliminating the program, though Congress ended up appropriating nearly $300 million. His latest budget proposes a 90 percent cut to the program, reducing funding to $30 million.
But that brings us to the second problem.
So that is really kind of the No. 1 reason that I ran, and why I won.
As I said, the modern G.O.P. is perfectly willing to sell out America if that's what it takes to get tax cuts for the wealthy.
The staff Mr. Trump does have may be no more appealing than the candidate himself — his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was charged with battery in March. But Mr. Trump's unwillingness to listen to anyone is disturbing because he has no experience governing. He would be in desperate need of guidance on foreign policy, as Carol Giacomo has noted, and in many other areas.
Well, I would add he also got a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

It'll be free for anybody who's under 18. It'll be free for a family of four making less than $50,000 a year, and it will have a small price for everyone else. This is the advantage to having already identified how you can pay for this.
The question for progressives — a question that is now central to the Democratic primary — is whether these failings mean that they should re-litigate their own biggest political success in almost half a century, and try for something better.
The latest attempt is a lawsuit claiming that the 2017 tax cut, which reduced the penalty for not having insurance to $0, somehow made the entire Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. It's a ludicrous claim, both in terms of substance — would the law suddenly become constitutional if the penalty were a penny? — and because it's clear that this was not legislators' intention.
But that's my point. It doesn't. That's what I just said.
We're anticipating Kentuckians by and large are going to be extremely confused and worried about what they're going to face and whether or not they'll continue to have coverage, Ms. Beauregard said. They'll be looking to advocates and enrollment assisters and their providers for answers, and at this point we don't have any.
Well, actually, you're going to have to explain to me what Andrew was — if I'm going to have to argue back against Andrew, you're going to have to tell me exactly what Andrew's argument is.
Justices appointed by Republicans are generally committed to following the law. There are justices who frequently vote in a conservative way. But some of the justices appointed by Republicans often don't vote in a way that advances conservative policy.
KK: Yes, I am, undocumented immigrants, excuse me.
The social safety net depends on public support to survive. And one way to generate that support is to make it as strong and expansive as possible, with the most ambitious policies you can bring to fruition. Conservatives understand this in their bones. As Democrats debate their choices and decide on a presidential nominee, they should also keep this lesson uppermost in their minds.
But I get it. There are right now, Democrats against Democrats on this. But understand this, we'll get into a general election. Oh, I know what the insurance industry will want to do. I know what Donald Trump will want to do. But the truth is we're going to have the party who tried to take away health care from 35 million Americans, said it was O.K. to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions and is continuing to follow that right now, both in their lawsuits and in their agency practices, and millions of people have lost their health care.
A Washington Post tally of President Obama's campaign promises found that he kept 11 promises (expand hate crime statutes, insure more Americans, establish a credit-card Bill of Rights), compromised on 12 (end the war in Iraq in 16 months, increase the earned-income tax credit) and failed on 17 (raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation, create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants).
And so when somebody — when I was first thinking about running for president, somebody said to me, Primaries are hard. You've never been in one and they're hard, because the people you think are going to be your friends turn out not to be your friends. And ——
Big business has also come on board: More than 150 senior executives at major companies have written congressional leaders urging enactment of Biden's plan.

March was always going to be one of the most consequential months of the presidential election. By the time we get to the middle of March, though —
The roots of today's dysfunction date back to some critical decisions starting in the 1970s. Here's a look at why the American government has lurched into crisis over the budget so often since then.
Every crisis opens a course to the unknown. In an eye-blink, the impossible becomes possible. History in a sprint can mean a dark, lasting turn for the worse, or a new day of enlightened public policy.
WASHINGTON — In an unusual letter to the Supreme Court in a case already argued, the Biden administration told the justices on Wednesday that the federal government was switching sides in a challenge to the Affordable Care Act. Disavowing the position of the Trump administration, a Justice Department official urged the court to uphold the law.
It seems to me that one of the things that social conservatives in particular, although not only my fellow social conservatives should look at, is this thing that you mentioned about scheduling practices, about these flexible scheduling practices. And it may be — one would want to do some empirical work on if you put restrictions on that what kinds of effects would it have on employment and national — but it may be that you just need to stop companies from being able to engage in these practices, because people need predictable work lives and work schedules. And that, that is a case where competition, as great as competition is in a lot of ways, is not going to lead you to an optimal outcome. Because maybe you can get a little bit of edge from a kind of exploitative practice that undermines the flourishing of families, which is a crucial component of our society's flourishing. And so maybe Republicans and Democrats alike, at the state level at least, should look into restricting these kinds of corporate practices. And I actually was talking about this with somebody we both know as a libertarian and saying, I wonder if there's some way we can solve that, and she just said, well, maybe we should just ban it. And it does seem to me that, that is something you see here and there some interest in it.
Not so, not so … but then neither have Republican voters simply cast the electability issue aside. Instead, on the evidence of polls, even many not-Trump voters have convinced themselves that Trump is the most electable candidate available, that he's better positioned than his rivals to beat Hillary, and that given the alternatives supporting him is actually the pragmatic thing to do.
So many people are saying it's going to be OK, everything's fine, we have what we need. And if this goes on for a month or two or three or five like it did in China, and we're already this strained, we don't have what we need. I don't really care if I get in trouble for speaking to the media. I want people to know that this is bad. People are dying. We don't have the tools that we need in the emergency department and in the hospital to take care of them, and — and it's really hard.
He's obsessed with the weaponry of pirates, the pistols, the daggers, the swords. You know, this is just one example, but I think it's a familiar example to a lot of parents, that I don't think that my son was born into some sort of cultural prison of gender. I think that maleness and femaleness are biological realities that have strong cultural expressions that can vary from person to person. But I don't see how, looking at my son, it would help him, remotely, for me to be disappointed in his obsession with piracy, and now his obsession with knights, and his desire to wave swords, and all the rest. I think it's much healthier for me to concede the obvious and say, maleness is real. And what we want is to find a healthy and morally upright expression of maleness so that he thinks about himself as a man in ways that are protective and chivalrous rather than toxic and aggressive. And I think that's a cultural construct, but it's a cultural construct placed on top of a biological reality and a fundamental difference that, as Michelle says, persists in different forms in just about every human society. So I'm just curious: Why do you feel like your children are imprisoned rather than feeling like they're just finding cultural expressions for who they actually are?
Everybody will get a vote on everything they want to vote on, Mr. Cornyn said. He added, What we're trying to do is convince everybody that if they'd like to get a vote on their amendment, then they need to vote to proceed to the House bill.
Should Mr. Biden select Ms. Warren, the Democratic ticket would be a marriage of contrasting policy ideas and governing philosophies unlike any seen since Jimmy Carter, the moderate governor of Georgia, chose Walter F. Mondale, the liberal senator from Minnesota, in 1976. And some Democrats are arguing that might be precisely what Mr. Biden needs as he tries to unseat President Trump — particularly at a moment when the country's deep economic despair could demand bold action of the type Ms. Warren pushed for during her candidacy.
The speaker of the House's institutional responsibilities date to the founding of our country, but the modern speakership is focused largely on its political roles: protecting the House majority and advancing the party's policy goals. Success in one dimension — as Speaker Paul Ryan's decision to retire reflects — does not always translate into success in the other.
We need more machines, we need more locations, we need better voting hours, we need better voting access, and we need an aggressive agenda that gets that done so that this doesn't happen again in November, said Manny Garcia, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party. To the people who had to wait five hours to vote, Mr. Garcia said, Texas' government failed you, and we all failed you. Nick Corasaniti reported from Austin, and Maggie Astor from New York. Read more
One of the central Republican criticisms of the A.C.A., which helped 20 million people gain health insurance, is that premiums and deductibles for the policies sold under the law are too high. Skinny repeal, however, could force insurance companies to raise premiums by 20 percent, according to a C.B.O. analysis of a similar bill from 2015. It would eliminate the requirement, or mandate, that individuals buy insurance, and would also repeal a mandate that employers above a certain size provide it to their workers and get rid of a tax on medical devices.

Lee/The New York Times It has not been a good night for Michael R. Bloomberg, who spent hundreds of millions of dollars only to win a single contest on Tuesday: American Samoa, where roughly 350 people caucused. He earned four delegates for his efforts there. But he did have a few strong spots within states, in some poetically perfect places. He won Pitkin County, Colo., home to Aspen, and Summit County, Utah, home to Park City. He also has a narrow lead, for now, in Napa County: the heart of California wine country. Read more
The proposal would allow small business owners, their employees, sole proprietors and other self-employed people to join together as a single group to buy insurance in the large-group market. The new health plans could be exempt from some requirements of the Affordable Care Act. They would, for example, not have to provide certain essential health benefits like mental health care, emergency services, maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs.
One tax that remains, a tax on expensive employer health plans, would be postponed until 2026. The original bill let it kick in in 2025.
The most that can be achieved, and it's a lot, actually, is to convey to the swing voters — the independents, suburban women and moderate Republicans who delivered the House to the Democrats in the 2018 midterms — just how much this president is ready to put himself above the law. And, therefore, four more years of his presidency, when he would no longer be restrained by the need for re-election, would be catastrophic for our country's unity and for the institutions and norms that have sustained it since 1776.
But these efforts have tended to be cursory and short-lived, with tiny or nonexistent constituencies. Few conservative lawmakers talk about them today, and it's unclear whether many Republicans in Congress today even grasp the basics.
No. It's a process. This is an example.
We take it on by deciding we're going to take it on. We pass it through Congress, and then we set it up for the states to be able to vote on it.
The best-known example of his radically anti-worker views is his argument that SeaWorld shouldn't face any liability after a captive killer whale killed one of its workers, because the victim should have known the risks when she took the job. But there's much more anti-labor extremism in his record.
Look what Frances Perkins got accomplished, first in Albany, but then when she went down to Washington. So here's a woman, she goes to Albany at a time when women don't even have the vote and gets herself appointed the head of a fire commission. And by the way, every time you see one of those lit-up fire exit signs, thank Frances Perkins, O.K.? But she not only does that, she then immediately expands it into labor law and workers and worker safety and worker protection overall. As you know, she then goes down to Washington, becomes the first woman cabinet official, and look at what she gets done in a short period of time. Social security, minimum wage, right to join a union, end of child labor, the weekend, my personal favorite [LAUGHTER], that Saturdays and Sundays are not treated like Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. But think about it that way. So we start with the corruption. That's what Perkins started with. She started by outing the corruption.
Since scolding member nations at the 2017 summit, Mr. Trump has followed up with strongly worded letters to NATO nations advising that if they don't increase their payments, it will be increasingly hard to justify why American soldiers continue to sacrifice their lives overseas.
• After hearing details of the new health care legislation, I call up Newt Gingrich and ask him what he thinks.
The bottom line: The Republican proposal would not increase competition and consumer choice as Mr. Ryan claims. It certainly wouldn't deliver on President Trump's promise of insurance for everybody. And it wouldn't be the full repeal of the A.C.A., or Obamacare, that many Republicans have been promising their base for the last seven years. That is why some hard-liners say they will oppose the new bill, which the House is expected to vote on as early as Thursday.
Well, I have some thoughts about that, inspired in part by looking at Elizabeth Warren's proposals on both the tax and spending side. By the way, I don't know whether Warren will or even should get the nomination. But she's a major intellectual figure, and is pushing her party toward serious policy discussion in a way that will have huge influence whatever her personal trajectory.
This time around, the federal government is expected to spend $50 million on marketing and outreach efforts, to let people know that low-cost coverage is available, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers HealthCare.gov. The Trump administration had cut advertising for the marketplace by 90 percent.
Well, what may seem like an anomaly right now might actually just be a pacesetter. And this could be a preview as to what comes for state after state. If you are a place like Georgia or Louisiana or Ohio that has functionally delayed its election by three, four weeks, and if this virus persists to that time, there will still be questions about whether it is safe to hold in-person balloting then.
I don't have a complete theory for how this self-deception has been accomplished: My column threw out several possibilities but hardly exhausted the list. But the possibilities I cited were mostly sub-rational — a reaction to Trump's media dominance, a reaction to his winning streak, a reaction to his demagogue's charisma, a tribal wishful thinking — plus the logical fallacy that having once proved pundits wrong Trump can always do so.
Indeed, turning us back into that kind of country is the G.O.P.'s true goal, and is what will happen if the party gets its way either as a result of the current lawsuit or through legislation during a second Trump term.
The shift in legal position won't make much of a difference in the lawsuit itself. Because a group of blue states has intervened, the appeals court will hear a full-throated defense of the law. Most observers expect the court to uphold the Affordable Care Act; if so, the Supreme Court may choose not to hear the case.
When President Trump was elected, his party's long-cherished goal of dismantling the Affordable Care Act seemed all but assured. But eight months later, Republicans seem to have done what the Democrats who passed the law never could: make it popular among a majority of Americans.
The authors liken their plan to the New Deal, but the real parallel is to World War II. It is the state mobilizing as many of society's resources as possible to wage a war on global warming and other ills. The document is notably coy about how all this would be implemented. Exactly which agency would inspect and oversee the renovation of every building in America? Exactly which agency would hire every worker?
WASHINGTON — Denouncing the profit motive in health care, more than 100 House Democrats rallied on Wednesday around a bill to replace most private health insurance with a national single-payer system, Medicare for all.
NF: But it's also about the Medicare for all plan.
I know that as you sit here it looks like, wow, this woman wants to do a lot and it's hard. And the truth is, it is. I spent my whole life studying working families. Why they go broke, what's happening in America, why America's middle class is being hollowed out. Whole books written about this. And I watch every year two things as it gets worse and worse and worse. Not fire worse. That was 2008 and — everybody is ——
NF: Why would you think, why is that ——
So what should we say about the Obama job record? Private-sector employment — the relevant number, as I'll explain in a minute — hit its low point in February 2010. Since then we've gained 14 million jobs, a figure that startled even me, roughly double the number of jobs added during the supposed Bush boom before it turned into the Great Recession. If that was a boom, this expansion, capped by last month's really good report, outbooms it by a wide margin.
JW: Senator, do you think that the House of Representatives is moving too quickly toward a vote on impeachment?
The same goes for Medicaid, where new studies suggest that more than half of each dollar spent on health care for children eventually comes back as higher tax receipts from healthier adults.
But is it really about the money? No, it's about the cruelty. Over the past few years it has become increasingly clear that the suffering imposed by Republican opposition to safety-net programs isn't a bug, it's a feature. Inflicting pain is the point.
WASHINGTON — President Trump is expected to propose on Monday a $4.8 trillion budget that will include billions of additional dollars for his wall along the southern border and steep cuts to safety net programs like Medicaid, disability insurance and housing assistance, according to senior administration officials and documents reviewed by The New York Times.
Senator Warren's famous paper laying the groundwork for the creation of the C.F.P.B. opens with the sentence, It is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one-in-five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house and later says, Why are consumers safe when they purchase tangible products with cash, but when they sign up for routine financial products like mortgages and credit cards they are left at the mercy of their creditors?
The Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee rebuffed calls to recuse himself from the panel's investigation into Russian meddling in the presidential election.
KK: Well, one more personal question for you. Who has broken your heart?
But the Democratic Party, Grossmann and Isaac argue, is not aligned with business preferences or affluent preferences in any domain — and actually represents middle-class views over affluent views on economic policy.

Many Utah residents still detest the law, but the activity here, and in other politically conservative states, highlights the challenges Republicans and the White House face as they struggle to come up with a palatable replacement.

On Monday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who tested positive for Covid-19 10 days ago, was moved into the intensive care unit of a London hospital after his condition worsened.
Senator Sanders's idea is that everyone in America would have access to health insurance that's provided by the government that covers a wide array of medical services, and for which they do not have to pay any money when they go to the doctor.
AK: But the Obama administration tried, past presidents have tried — how would you do it?
WASHINGTON — Abortion flared up Wednesday as the latest hot-button issue to complicate passage of a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which Senate Republican leaders hope to unveil on Thursday and pass next week.
Ms. Harris turned to face Mr. Biden as she brought up the Obama administration's deportation policy.
I feel that the best person for the job would be Spiro T. Agnew. Mr. Agnew is tried and true as V.P. He is one person who could actually make Mr. Trump seem likable, and possibly even competent. The fact that he is deceased provides Mr. Trump with the advantage of nominating someone who cannot say no. He is, or was anyway, a member of the Republican establishment, and therefore is someone who could help to unite the party.
JI: Let me try to frame it a different way. What do you say to critics who would argue that it will take so much political capital just to enact the first portion of this plan, the aggressive public option that you've laid out, that it would be essentially impossible to then segue to a Medicare for all? You'll spend so much capital getting that first part that it seems — people have said it seems like a pipe dream to say we're going to have this aggressive public option, and then we're going to have Medicare for all three years later.
Ms. DiCola's father, a solo-practice lawyer, is also a Trump supporter, but she is a liberal Democrat and uneasily aware of the anger and frustration that unsubsidized Obamacare customers are feeling — so much so that at first, she worried about sharing her story with The New York Times and being dragged through the mud on some 24-hour news channel for being on Medicaid.
If you're a centrist worried about the gigantic spending increases Sanders has proposed, calm down, because they won't happen. If you're a progressive worried that Biden might govern like a Republican, you should also calm down, because he wouldn't.
It did not, however, bridge a notable gap between the Biden and Sanders platforms. The task force called for decriminalizing marijuana and legalizing it at the federal level for medical use, but for letting the states decide whether to legalize it for recreational use. That is the position Mr. Biden held in the primary, in contrast to Mr. Sanders, who supports full legalization.
SS: So you mean getting rid of the combat troops there now, or preclude sending any combat troops there in the future?
When I was a girl, you had a better than 50/50 chance of doing better than your parents. Today, that seems to be slipping under a 1-in-10 chance. Opportunity is shifting away from not just the poor kids. It's shifting away from everybody who's not born into the top. And sure, a few people roll the dice and make it big and we should celebrate that, but it's like this fundamental question of who we're going to be as a country. And yeah, I do fight for a lot of things. I fight for a big vision, but if we don't start there, if we start by compromising, if we start by saying, Hey, everybody line up. We're going to knock 2 cents off your student loan debt, who's showing up for that?
JW: Senator, do you think that the House of Representatives is moving too quickly toward a vote on impeachment?
Political commentators and strategists write with some awe of President Trump's outrageous, gutsy strategy of ginning up his base with one more attack on black athletes, one more crackdown on Central American mothers and children on the Mexican border, one more assault on Obamacare, one more tariff on imports. They think Mr. Trump's drumbeat is intensifying loyalty and fervor among Republican partisans and that the Republican Party we used to know is taking a nap somewhere, as John Boehner, the former speaker of the House, put it.
Right, and there's also an income cap where it starts phasing out if you're a single filer making more than $200,000, or a married filer making more than $400,000. Which is to say it covers nearly everybody in it. It's a flat benefit. Would replace the existing child credit and would replace some other programs like, temporary assistance for needy families, which is the main program that used to be called welfare. But it's a much smaller program than it used to be with a much smaller caseload. And he'd also get rid altogether of the tax deduction for state and local taxes that you can apply on your federal tax return. So this would all be, at least in theory, I mean, some of it has to be scored a little bit more. But in theory it's supposed to be deficit neutral, not to increase the deficit. And this is a policy that would have a number of potential advantages. One would be that it would very sharply decrease child poverty, which is something that the existing child credit does but this would do even more. It simplifies government supports for children by folding a bunch of existing things into this new child allowance.

Senator Warren's plan on trade, released in July, would change American trade policy by pushing the country's trade partners to abide by higher labor and environmental standards. Under her plan, more representatives from labor, environmental and consumer groups would be involved in trade negotiations, and the process would be more transparent through public disclosure of draft agreements.
So I start with trying to understand the problem, what it means that tens of millions of people don't have prescriptions filled, don't go to the doctor. People with health insurance who are being sued by their hospitals for medical bills. I think of this as offering the most help to the greatest number of people as quickly as possible. So in terms of priorities, day one, there's a lot a president could do all by herself, and I'll do it.
Yeah, look, that's right. Now, Trump won with more difficulty than we now tend to remember. In 2016, there were 17 candidates, and he won a plurality. And he won by first appearing to be the candidate of the moderate lane of the party and then becoming also the voice of a kind of angry populism in the party. But he did win the nomination and then narrowly, the election. What happened in 2020 was different. I think the party lost an election that it could have won because it went the way of Donald Trump, and then it lost two more in Georgia that it could have won because it followed in the path of Donald Trump. And ultimately, the experience of electoral wins and losses is the way that politicians learn lessons. There's no way around that. And for the kind of agenda that I'm describing, that's both good and bad because there is a lot to be gained by taking the path of a kind of angry populism that is largely empty of policy direction and that is hostile to the institutions. Republicans, in recent years, have done reasonably well doing that. And my argument for why they shouldn't do that is that it's wrong and that it's bad for the country. But I don't have to win elections, and so it's easy for me to say.
Since the start of the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces in 2014, Texas' uninsured rate has fallen about five percentage points. The number of insured Texans has increased by about one million people, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.
The health care law had promised the insurers that they would be protected, she wrote, and it did not matter that Congress later failed to appropriate money to cover the insurers' shortfalls.
The Democrats who wrote the Affordable Care Act helped pay the costs of expanding insurance coverage by imposing a variety of taxes. The Republican plan would eliminate taxes on health insurance, prescription drugs, tanning salons and investment income, among others. The original bill would have left the taxes in place until next year. The first amendment would make them disappear faster.
With the tools we have today, he said, we can do much better.
In 2012, Steven Teles, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University, published a paper arguing that American public policy had become defined by kludges. The term comes out of the world of computer programming, where a kludge is an inelegant patch put in place to be backward compatible with the rest of a system, he wrote. When you add up enough kludges, you get a very complicated program, one that is hard to understand and subject to crashes. In other words, Windows.
We're going to have that party who lost a bunch of seats on that in 2018 versus a party that we argue with each other about the best way to try to make sure that people get health care coverage, but at least we're trying to move in that direction. And this is a salient, personal, human fact. Your health care, your housing, getting your kids educated, getting your kids taken care of in child care. Every single one of those, I like where we are. I like where I am in this fight because I think it's the right fight to have and I think we must be in this fight. We cannot take a pass on this.
So whenever people are being paid outside the legal system, it undercuts protection for everyone and gives an advantage to the employers who move outside the legal system. You know, look, it's part of the same basic principle. Everybody should follow the same set of rules. And if our labor standards are there's a $15-an-hour minimum wage, then everybody should pay it. If the labor standards are that you don't get to put somebody up working in an elevator shaft who has no training, then every employer should have to follow that. And any time an employer can get the work done by not following the rules, that employer gets an unfair advantage, and that unfair advantage undercuts the strength of everybody who follows the rules, undercuts the economy, undercuts workers.
Therefore, one of my priorities as chair will be to try to understand how policies will impact all in our country as we strive to ensure the economy works for everyone. Cecilia Rouse, President Biden's pick to lead the White House Council of Economic Advisers, testified to the Senate Banking Committee on how she would lead a recovery in the wake of the pandemic. Credit Credit... Kriston Jae Bethel for The New York Times Cecilia Rouse, a Princeton University economist who is President Biden's pick to lead the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told a Senate committee this morning that Congress must take action to shore up an economic recovery that has left many Americans behind. As deeply distressing as this pandemic and economic fallout have been, she said, it is also an opportunity to rebuild the economy better than it was before — making it work for everyone by increasing the availability of fulfilling jobs and leaving no one vulnerable to falling through the cracks. In a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Ms. Rouse said that if confirmed, she will make it a priority for the council to gather more detailed data, in order to better see how economic policies are affecting nonwhite Americans in particular. Too often economists focus on average outcomes, instead of examining a range of outcomes, she said.
His intransigence placed him well to the right of Republican leadership, including former Speaker John Boehner, whom he repeatedly opposed for — get this — being excessively soft on curbing disbursements from the federal purse.
Rethink Impact, a venture capital firm that invests exclusively in tech start-ups founded by women, plans to announce today that it has raised $182 million for its second fund, surpassing expectations.
Here are questions and answers about the special open enrollment period:
Before the law, employer-provided plans often set strict limits on what they would pay toward medical bills during a single year and over a lifetime. An estimated 105 million Americans had some sort of lifetime cap before the passage of the health care law.
(Read more about Mr. Biden's record on the crime bill and criminal justice here, here and here.)
So let me do the pitch, because I'll tell you exactly what the pitch is. That is the Affordable Care Act already requires employers to provide health care for their workers if they have more than 50 workers. I propose we just keep that in place, and that will yield about $9 trillion over the next 10 years. That's what they pay.
These are the fights we need to have. These are the fights we should be bringing forward. We don't bring those fights forward. We — oh, well, we could — around the edge a little bit. Then we're just going to be the ones who stood by while America became fundamentally a country that lost even a hope that all the kids would have opportunity. That we just extinguish that and say, Nope. Better be born into it, because that's the only way to make it in America. That's not the America I want to see.
Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and most likely Amy Klobuchar are all capable candidates, and I expect there will be other women who will enter the fray.
Senator Warren said in March that she hopes to pass a constitutional amendment to protect every American's right to vote. She added, Every vote matters, and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.
And he said he was doing O.K. He misses him. He thinks about him all the time.
From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily.
But look at the difference it makes if there are multiple Facebooks out there. If you can get to anybody's page regardless of who they go through, it becomes like the phone company, right? You can have any different brand of phone, but as long as I hit the same set of numbers, I will reach you. If you could do that through Facebook, then you've got competitors offering, hey, I tell you what. You come use my site, and I won't be sharing your personal data with anybody. I will offer better security than those other yahoos offer. I will offer you a 2-cent rebate for all of the advertising. I will offer you the option to click out of ads, or you'll only get one ad every minute. That's what competitive markets do.
JI: But one of the premises for massive health care reform is that the Affordable Care Act is not working in a lot of ways, right? So you support Medicare for all presumably because you think the Affordable Care Act has a lot of holes in it, and we need to do something different, so you'll be defending that.
I'm an Orthodox Jew and I have never catcalled a woman in my life, he said. I don't know how they catcall down in Queens, but it must be weird.
Honestly, I'm really content to let Michelle play the reactionary in this conversation and just sort of sit back and listen. But, no, Farhad, I wanted to just challenge you a little bit on what you said about your feeling of disappointment in your children's adoption of gender roles. We have three kids, and our oldest two kids are girls. They're eight and six. And until my son was born, we had a very female-oriented domestic space in the sense that most of the books and toys and clothes and everything else were girl clothes— not in sort of a hyper-gendered way but in a sort of stereotypically gendered way. And I tried to interest my girls in Wiffle ball and various things, and they tended to be more interested in fairy tales and dolls and so on. And then my son was born. And so his experience of his childhood was of femininity as a norm. I mean, I read to him the girl books that I read to my daughters. And to the extent that it's possible, I think he had, at the very least, a sort of gender-neutral entry into consciousness. And when he was about two and a half, one of my girls brought home a book about Blackbeard the pirate. And he, entirely unbidden, picked it up and immediately became obsessed with it to the point where he would wear a pirate hat to school every day.
There were responsible ways to cut taxes on things we want more of — like corporate investment — while boosting them on things we want less of — like carbon, reckless financial speculation and diabetes — that could have stimulated jobs and growth but also left us more financially and environmentally resilient. But both Trump and the anonymous-G.O.P. crowd rejected them, just as they rejected smart improvements to Obamacare, preferring a total scrapping.
President-elect Donald Trump and other Republican leaders may be determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act immediately, but a few more sensible members of the party are now trying to slow down this runaway train. They recognize the danger in destroying a program that directly benefits 22 million Americans — and indirectly millions more by controlling costs — without a plan to replace it.
JD: Do you think it's better, then, that the Senate finish a trial as early as possible next year?
Under the House bill, the budget office said, premiums would tend to rise for older people and decline for younger people. By 2026, it said, premiums would be 20 percent to 25 percent lower for a 21-year-old and 8 percent to 10 percent lower for a 40-year-old — but 20 percent to 25 percent higher for a 64-year-old.
After six moderate Republican senators signed the declaration, Mr. McCarthy labeled them, in Trumpian fashion, Snow White and the Six Dwarves. He had Ms. Smith removed from her post on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (replacing her with Richard Nixon) and lavished support on her challenger in the next election (she won anyway).
He's not alone. Restive House members have also blamed Senate rules for the party's thin legislative record under the first year of unified Republican control in Washington since 2006. As Representative Chris Collins of New York said, Let's be done with that archaic nonsense rule, once and for all. Representative Darrell Issa of California went even further: I regret the very existence of the Senate.
At the heart of the Medicare for all proposals championed by Senator Bernie Sanders and many Democrats is a revolutionary idea: Abolish private health insurance.

In other words, for Gilens, the glass is half empty, for Rhodes, half full.

He compared deaths from the novel coronavirus to deaths from other causes — influenza and car crashes — suggesting that the scale of those preventable deaths means economic restrictions may not be appropriate to prevent the spread of the virus.
Even some strong advocates of carbon pricing have come to see this point. Nathaniel Keohane, the head of the climate program at the Environmental Defense Fund, which helped design the original cap-and-trade program for acid rain, puts it this way: If we're going to succeed on climate policy, it will be by giving people a vision of what's in it for them, a positive vision of how it matters for their life and their kids. Too often in the past, he said, climate activists failed to do that. We really led with, and let us ourselves be defined by, the policy mechanism rather than the outcome we were striving for. You need to be able to inspire people.
Trump support is growing among Pennsylvania's Republicans, and they want him to know it. Representative Scott Perry, Republican of Pennsylvania, was instrumental in promoting a plan in which President Donald J. Trump would fire the acting attorney general in an effort to stay in office. Credit... Al Drago for The New York Times Republicans in states across the country are lining up behind former President Donald J. Trump with unwavering support. And perhaps no state has demonstrated its fealty as tenaciously as Pennsylvania, where Republican officials have made loyalty to him the sole organizing principle of the party. Just as in some Midwestern states, a surge in Pennsylvania of new Republican voters with grievances about a changing America was triggered by Mr. Trump, and only Mr. Trump. And as a second impeachment trial approaches next month, many of the former president's defenders see it as the culmination of years of unfair treatment by a Washington establishment that was always hostile to him. Pennsylvania Republicans are already jockeying ahead of the 2022 primaries to prove that they fought the hardest for Mr. Trump, who, in spite of the losses by his party in the White House, the Senate and the House, still exerts a strong grip over elected Republicans and grass-roots voters. Eight of the nine Republicans in Pennsylvania's congressional delegation voted to throw out their state's own electoral votes for President Biden on Jan. 6, just hours after a mob stormed the Capitol.
The Trump administration also reduced advertising for the insurance signup period and made it harder for people to sign up for insurance later in the year, two factors that could have also depressed insurance enrollment. It's also possible that some who stopped buying their own insurance did so because they got a new job with health care benefits.
The American government's antitrust battle with the oil industry perhaps epitomizes a 20th-century approach to antitrust — in 1911, the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of Standard Oil. Of course, many would argue that the country's dependence on oil and its addiction to Facebook aren't totally comparable.
This time Sacha Baron Cohen ambushed all of us. His new Showtime series, Who Is America? — his first television show since Da Ali G Show went off the air in 2004 — was announced just last week and makes its debut on Sunday night, riding a short but intense wave of hype.
The so-called special enrollment period is intended to help people who have lost coverage in the past year, but it will be open to those who want health insurance for any reason, in the 36 states that use Healthcare.gov. The decision was reported earlier by The Washington Post.
So is Trump's magical thinking. The president seems to see certain people as exempt from the laws of gravity, and he has accorded Kushner a place snug beside him in that pantheon. He keeps telling us that he can predict the future, and he keeps telling himself that Kushner can juggle more than even the most seasoned, brilliant White House aides of yesteryear pulled off. Kushner doesn't seem to be quibbling.
Indeed, all of these things surely played a role in GOP health care strategy. But at this point they've clearly lost the political argument. In 2017, Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare made it clear to everyone that their party didn't have any better ideas, and never did; everything they proposed would have devastated the lives of millions.
KK: But this isn't expanding the arsenal at all. These are existing weapons that may or may not be in southern Turkey.

So let me explain what the plan is. The plan is the employer has to keep paying in as the employer does right now. The one exception to that is if you have a collective bargaining agreement, and the employer is paying in more than whatever is the standard minimal that employers are paying in. That difference goes to the workers in cash.
But a few questions caught her off guard: how to safeguard American nuclear weapons in Turkey; how to respond if China cracked down violently on protesters in Hong Kong; and what she was likely to fail at as president.
But who's going to get Mosul, really? We'll take Mosul eventually. But the way — if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought. Much, much tougher. Much more dangerous. Going to be more deaths that they thought.
Why would we want to plunge ourselves back into that situation?
You mentioned college: I went back and read Loose Canons, and there's a line in there in which you say that college students are too old to form but not too old to challenge. How does a line like that resonate today, when challenging students can seem like such a fraught proposition? Political correctness is heinous if it comes from a person on the left or the right or a person of color or a white person. Let's take a hot-button issue. I wrote the introduction to the 50th-anniversary edition of Albert Murray's The Omni-Americans, and there was this paragraph I wrote last summer that I saw when I was cleaning out my Word files on my iPad. In it I said, Only people not familiar with this history of slavery or Ta-Nehisi Coates's recent work would wonder if there was an economic disadvantage to African Americans subsequent to the Civil War because of slavery and then because of the rollbacks of Reconstruction. I said, However, reasonable people could disagree about reparations. But, I continued, there are few people today who have the courage to stand up within the community and say, 'I genuinely think reparations is a mistake.' Now I'm not saying that's my position. But I'm saying you will find nobody black standing up and criticizing reparations — it's very rare — because they're afraid that students are going to boycott them or that they'll be called an Uncle Tom. That's not right.

Carl E. Schmid II, the deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute, a public policy and advocacy organization, said Mr. Trump's plan sounded very bold and could be one of his greatest achievements, if the president and Congress provide enough funds.
DOYLESTOWN, Pa. — Five years ago, the Affordable Care Act had yet to begin its expansion of health insurance to millions of Americans, but Jeff Brahin was already stewing about it.
Every day, a dozen women die unnecessarily in America from cervical cancer–yet GOP closes women's health centers and cuts Title X. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
By combining the bills to shore up the Affordable Care Act with several bipartisan measures to address high drug prices, Democrats had hoped to lure in some Republican support. But the minority party did not bite, calling the package a bailout for the health law and instead introducing a Republican bill that included only the drug-pricing measures, plus an extension of funding for community health centers and the National Health Service Corps.

Every issue in my district is impacted by this, said Representative Elise Stefanik, a Republican who represents much of New York's vast North Country. This is going to be an economic issue, it's going to be a higher ed issue, it's going to be a border issue.
I'll — start — I want to lie about you, that's why I ran the ad that said Mark Zuckerberg endorses Donald Trump, and they said, We'll take your money for that one, until they discovered what it actually said and said: Wait a minute. Not if you're going to talk about Mark Zuckerberg. Whoa.
The Department of Labor identifies about 44 million people that it thinks would be eligible. (Fifty percent of the people is a stretch.) Those people include self-employed business owners who buy their own insurance, people in the small group insurance market, and people who do not get insurance, but might, if their company could find a cheaper option.
Then he took me to the place right off the Oval Office, and we had lunch. And we talked for an hour. And he really seemed to care what I think, what I thought. And he said, I know we've had our differences, but I'd like you to help me. I said, I'll be glad to help you where I can, Mr. President. I want you to be successful.
Finally, in the pettiest move of all, Mulvaney said he would change the order of the words in the bureau's name — to the bulkier Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. Administration officials acknowledged to The Times that the move was meant to diminish the agency's public profile. It also seems like an unsubtle attempt to erase the old C.F.P.B. from everyone's memory.
I think you should talk about the language and recognize the way that the language may not be inclusive for everyone. I mean, I never until recently made it a practice to ask people I interview, people I would mention in articles, about their gender and their pronouns. I feel like having that conversation is a good way to start. One of the ways we can talk about this is not as a replacement for traditional genders but as an addition. Offering they as a pronoun for you in addition to he or she, I think, is a kind of a way to avoid some of these problems. So most places, like airports and others, that have all-gender restrooms also have men and women restrooms. And that would be a relatively easy way to both offer it as an option and include it in the language without adding to this fear that were erasing people's identities.
Most of the changes will appeal to the party's right flank, including the Freedom Caucus – which has voiced concern that the bill does not go far enough to undo Obamacare – but there are also concessions to more moderate Republicans, many of them in the Senate. A vote is expected in the House on Thursday.
Mr. Jordan believes that at this time he is better suited to represent Ohioans in the House of Representatives, where, as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, he can advance an America first agenda, promote conservative values and hold big government accountable, a spokesman for Jordan's congressional campaign said.
I feel like I might have voted differently today than Saturday, she said, noting that the South Carolina results had not yet come in when she cast her vote. I might've flipped my support to Bernie Sanders. As she watched the results roll in on televisions throughout the venue, Ms. Matthews said she was looking forward to finding out who the nominee would be. There's been a lot of not knowing who the nominee is, she said. Being in this limbo for so long, it would be nice to have an answer. Bronwen Marshall-Bass, 31, said that she had voted for Mr. Sanders, citing Medicare for All as his most appealing policy initiative. People want to do half solutions and I feel like his solutions get to the root of the problem, Ms. Marshall-Bass said. Read more
CW: Well, during the debate he said it was a 20th-century —
archived recording (mick mulvaney) And it's hard to know where to begin when you're talking about how bad the current health care legislation is for small business.
What no one knew is that the inevitable fight would center on a struggling brick-and-mortar video game retailer called GameStop. With two hedge funds betting that GameStop's value would fall, a swarm of Reddit users this week led a successful campaign to send the stock price surging instead. The internet-based caper raised GameStop's market value to over $24 billion from $2 billion, and caused billions in losses at the hedge funds.
At this point, the Democratic presidential nomination is very much up in the air. Not only is it unclear who will be the nominee; it's unclear whether the nominee will be a centrist like Joe Biden or Amy Klobuchar, or a representative of the party's left like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. Whoever wins, there will be much wailing and gnashing of teeth from the other side.
If I were president of the United States and these people showed sympathy toward me and my agenda, it would bother me. And I would urge the president to dissuade them of the fact that he's sympathetic to their cause.
BA: What is the specific standard that you would apply in antitrust? Right now we basically have a consumer pricing setup.
MC: And nobody does well at this question.
WASHINGTON — About 6.4 million people have signed up for health insurance next year under the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration said Wednesday, as people rushed to purchase plans regardless of Republican promises that the law will be repealed within months.
President Biden talks with China's leader for the first time since the election. In the conversation with Xi Jinping, Mr. Biden raised issues like trade, human rights abuses and climate change. They agreed to search for common ground, but each held firm on contentious issues like the status of Hong Kong.
A history of health problems, even relatively minor ones like allergies or acne, could mean trouble buying one of these plans. Some plans won't cover any care related to such a condition, even one not previously diagnosed. Other plans charge people with prior health problems a higher price or just deny them outright.
If the next president were able to sign an ambitious version of the Green New Deal, it would not be nearly enough to solve the climate crisis. The problem is enormous and global. But most scientists believe that a large reduction in carbon emissions over the next few decades could greatly reduce the destruction — and a large reduction in emissions remains possible.
In 2009, when the Affordable Care Act was being written, Sarah Palin popularized the phrase Obama's 'death panel,' which became a rallying cry for the Tea Party.
Facebook explores creating a rival to Clubhouse. The tech giant has directed employees to create an audio chat product similar to the popular app, The Times's Mike Isaac reports. It's Facebook's latest effort to clone emerging competitors' services, a strategy that hasn't always been successful.
After years of vowing to repeal the Affordable Care Act, as it is formally known, Republican lawmakers in both chambers of Congress have now passed a bill that will make it easier to gut the law.
New York has among the highest per-enrollee Medicaid spending of any state, and some county governments pay for a share of the state's Medicaid expenses. County governments would like to have the state assume the full costs of that program. A revision, introduced by Representative Chris Collins of New York's 27th District, which includes a large part of rural, western New York, would do just that, barring Medicaid funds from being used by small local governments under specific conditions tailored precisely to counties outside of New York City.
Maybe. I mean, it could be that this is the only way that we're going to get the kind of cultural change that would be required to make a policy change of this magnitude, but I also think that there are real risks here. It's totally possible that America could engage with this idea, and we could have a big debate about it in a presidential election, and then could thoroughly reject it. And then we sort of end up with the kind of politics around health care that we've had for a long time, where these sort of universal health care proposals are put forward, it's decided that they're kind of too radical for where we are, and they get shelved again.
The insurance industry, which usually supports tight limits on insurance enrollments, is backing the extra enrollment period now. Around 15 million Americans are uninsured and eligible for marketplace coverage, according to a recent analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Most would qualify for some form of financial assistance if they bought such coverage — and about four million could sign up for a high-deductible plan that would cost them nothing in premiums.
The rule as it is right now, called Rule 22, it is an attempt to bring cloture — which should be closure, but it's very confusing. They changed the S to a T, and now everybody is confused about it. So right now, the rule allocates certain amounts of time for debate. So all you really have to do is decide what you want those amounts of times to be. It could be three days. It could be five days. It could be a week. But basically, it would say after this allocation of time, a majority can vote to end debate. The minority would have to use that time to its fullest. And if they don't use that time at any point, the majority would be allowed to quickly end debate and move to a final vote. Maybe people don't want a debate a bill for a week. No one's going to force them to debate it for a week if they don't want to. But let's say a week is the maximum. After that maximum amount of debate time is used, a majority could vote to end debate. The bill would then, in a day or so, move to the final stage. It would vote up or down, and the world could move on. The issue would pass or fail, majority rule, the way a democracy should work. Things would actually start getting done.
And so that had already happened by that point. We have not had something like a Souter in a long time. Whatever people say about John Roberts, who's not gone as far as some of the crazier conservatives would like him to go, he's a quite conservative justice, who has done exactly what he was expected to do. And so, by the time you get to Merrick Garland and Mitch McConnell, you're operating in this weird mismatch between this idea that a vote for a Supreme Court justice should depend on whether they are qualified, not whether or not they are ideological, and this reality that ideological parties have constructed an ideological vetting system to get highly ideological justices to give them lifetime appointments to one of the most powerful bodies in the land. And yet, as we expect them to vote ideologically on everything else, we were still expecting somehow the other party to treat this one vote different. And Mitch McConnell just comes along and says, there is nothing different about this. We do not want Democrats to take over the Supreme Court with a more liberal justice. And so we will not let them. He didn't invent a new power. He just treated it like an ideological vote. And it feels to me that so much of the Senate is like that, that we have rules built, traditions built, norms built.
And if Republicans are going to fight or undermine them, market-based programs probably aren't going to happen. Such programs are often designed to be a compromise between the two parties — policies that essentially use the market to correct a market failure. I realize that some people would argue that Democrats should still promote market-based programs even if Republicans won't.
If you are a giant multinational corporation and any regulation comes along that you don't like, the local country raises the minimum — we've actually seen this — raises its environmental standards, you get to sue them to get them to drop those standards. And who will your case be heard by? It'll be heard by a handful of corporate lawyers, who when they're not sitting on this arbitration panel are working for big law firms that are doing work for you or other multinational corporations like you. That's one set of how the path will run.
But what it tries to do is kind of patch up the holes in the existing system. And one of the ways that it does that is by vastly expanding Medicaid, that program we talked about for poor people. A lot more people get coverage through Medicaid, and then the government helps people who don't get insurance through work with financial subsidies that allow them to buy their own insurance.
On the other hand, I do have some insight into how Ryan — who has always been an obvious con man, to anyone willing to see — came to become speaker of the House. And that's a story that reflects badly not just on Ryan himself, not just on his party, but also on self-proclaimed centrists and the news media, who boosted his career through their malfeasance. Furthermore, the forces that brought Ryan to a position of power are the same forces that have brought America to the edge of a constitutional crisis.

But let me finish my point. If you fight on ground where I think you've got lots of bipartisan support and you lead a damn fight — and then — just — if you can deliver a 2-cent wealth tax, which has wide popularity, when I get to sign the piece of paper that cancels student loan debt for 43 million Americans, that's Democrats and Republicans. I think at that moment, the world starts to shift. I think at that moment, a whole generation of people who have only seen the government as debt collector starts to shift. Will we get 100 percent of the folks on board? No. But will we get a lot more? Will we begin to talk about a democracy that doesn't just work increasingly for a thinner and thinner slice of the top, or will we start to talk about a democracy that works for all of us? That 2-cent wealth tax is about child care. It's about things that touch people's lives. It's about universal pre-K for 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds. It's about a $50 billion investment in historically black colleges and universities, tuition-free. Technical school, two-year college, four-year college. You just deliver on something that matters to people. Now they've got a stake in democracy. It feels like it pays off, that it's not just marching in the street over and over and over, and the next day you wake up and it's a little bit worse than it was today.
Well, I'm talking, actually, about Lindsey Graham.
I talk about Citizens United, although that one again is either going to take constitutional amendment or some change in the personnel at the Supreme Court to reslice that issue. But I think it is important to keep that one on the table. And I talk about it because when I close, I talk about why those three things are related to each other.
But Mr. Azar said, We certainly are not able to regulate in time for the plan year that starts in January.
I try to tell people when they think about Congress and its operation to not think about Congress, to just imagine you work in an office, and you work for a boss. And you don't like your boss, and you don't like what your boss is working on. And that importantly, for your boss to finish his project, he needs your help. And if you don't help him, he won't finish his project, and you may become the boss. And if you do help him, he will finish his project, and you may lose your job. And even if you don't lose your job, all your friends are going to be mad at you. So what do you do? And I think the answer's pretty obvious. You wouldn't help your boss. But that is actually how Congress works, as best as I understand it. And yet, we expect people to overwhelm their own self-interest, minority players to overwhelm their own self-interest, because of tradition or something.
OK, I'm going to give you two answers on this. One, the serious heavy political book. Michael Greve's The Upside-Down Constitution changed the way I thought about federalism and changed a conventional conservative view of that. It's dense, but it's really quite interesting if you're interested in federalism in the Constitution. And then Popular Crime, Bill James, which changed the way I thought about a number of interesting historical episodes. And it's a real treat to read.
Mr. Trump said his campaign received more than 120,000 requests for tickets to the event. Supporters began lining up 30-plus hours before showtime, hauling in sleeping bags, coolers and stadium chairs. Rainstorms on Tuesday drove the crowd to seek shelter, but could not dampen its ardor. Inside and outside the arena, people danced, whooped and reveled in MAGA-mania.
It's very hard, in part, to know what to do with these kinds of polls, where a lot of people take the question to be, are you a Republican or a Democrat, and whatever the specific question is, they answer it that way. But it also points to a real rot in the culture of the Republican Party. And I think we've seen, in the wake of the election, although it was evident before, of course, a kind of turn to the fantasy and escapism and conspiracism that is extremely dangerous for the country. And when a party veers in these directions, it finds itself in tremendous trouble. So the lessons are red flags. They're blaring warnings. And I think it is absolutely incumbent upon leaders of the Republican Party to help their voters separate fact from fiction and reality from fantasy and conspiracy. That's always necessary in a populist era. It's always necessary on the left and the right in populist times. And there have been times when the left has fallen into conspiracy in similar ways. But I think, at this point, the challenge on this front is for the right, and it is absolutely necessary for elected officials on the right to avoid pretending that false things are true. That's what happened with Hawley and Cruz and others in the wake of the election. And they tried to do it as carefully as they could and in ways that let them say, well, we're just asking questions.
JI: I want to just pivot very quickly to health care. It seemed like a good moment. With respect to what you will fight for, can you talk a little bit about Medicare for all and where it ranks in terms of your priorities, and then to kind of sort of reiterate the question, how do you convince people who are wary of massive health care overhaul yet again that that's the right approach to that problem basically?
You see, I thought their behavior was cynical and strategic: They opposed Obamacare because they thought there was political mileage in scaring people about change, and also in denying Obama any successes. Oh, and their donors really hated the taxes on the rich that pay for the ACA's subsidies. And right up through 2016 they could hope to convince voters that they had a secret plan for something much better than Obamacare.
Mr. Trump opposed any expansion of Obamacare, even a partial one.
As Dr. Fauci spoke, educators at the meeting posted comments — many reflecting frustration and anxiety. They complained that many states had not prioritized teachers for vaccination and said students were not able to effectively stay masked throughout the school day. Several called for job actions. Teachers need to participate in a national strike to protect kids, communities, and teachers, one wrote. Dr. Fauci appeared alongside two powerful teachers union presidents: Randi Weingarten of the American Federation of Teachers and Becky Pringle of the National Education Association. The event took place as some local unions across the country, most notably in Chicago, continue to resist efforts to reopen schools, arguing that doing so before widespread teacher vaccination would risk lives. Ms. Weingarten has staked out a somewhat more moderate position, arguing that schools can operate safely before teachers are vaccinated by using strategies such as surveillance testing for the virus and updating ventilation systems. She has also asked for teachers with health concerns, or who live with family members with compromised immune systems, to be allowed to continue to work remotely.
JW: So you think a constitutional amendment?
In the end, I think a long shutdown was more likely to hurt the Dreamers than to help them. Congress would not have passed a law to protect them before reopening the government, and the Dreamers' allies in Congress — the Democrats — would be in a weaker position than they are now.
The filing was made in a case challenging the law brought by Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, and 17 other Republican-led states. In December, a federal judge from the Northern District of Texas, Reed O'Connor, ruled that the law was unconstitutional.
WASHINGTON — El expresidente Barack Obama debe haber pensado que iba a tener mucho material para defenderse cuando fuera juzgado por la historia. Seguramente suponía que, entre otras cosas, podría señalar su programa de cobertura médica, su amplio acuerdo comercial con Asia, el pacto climático global y su apertura diplomática con Cuba.
Cleared of collusion and flush with victory, President Trump is a man unleashed, ready to tackle everything that's evaded him over the last two years. His first target is health care. We're going to get rid of Obamacare, Trump said at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Thursday. And I said the other day, the Republican Party will become the party of great health care. It's good. It's important.
There was a Republican lunch we went to in Greenville, where he was saying —
The number of people who have denounced Medicare for all as politically impractical continues to grow — the former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel called it a pipe dream in a recent Washington Post op-ed, in which he called on proponents to please explain to me exactly how we get that bill through the Senate?
CLINTON: ... a very clear fact that...
I've been able to receive it for myself and for my family. Just like all of us who are on the tip of the iceberg, way up high in the health care services.
When our congressmen took a party-line vote that would have canceled health insurance for thousands of Virginians, I knew I had to run.
I just don't think that's Trumpification either. That is an example of a pre-existing pathology in the Republican Party where you have a hyperpartisan desire to use the courts as, basically, super legislators. But that predates Trump. I don't think anyone in Congress wants the judge to overrule Obamacare because it would be a huge mess for Republican legislators. And I think it's— I doubt that Trump himself wants it to happen. I suspect it's a faction within his administration. If the judge rules against Obamacare, it will be a partisan decision and a foolish one. But I think that's a problem with partisanship in general and Republicans in general, that it's only tangentially connected to Trump.
But look at the difference it makes if there are multiple Facebooks out there. If you can get to anybody's page regardless of who they go through, it becomes like the phone company, right? You can have any different brand of phone, but as long as I hit the same set of numbers, I will reach you. If you could do that through Facebook, then you've got competitors offering, hey, I tell you what. You come use my site, and I won't be sharing your personal data with anybody. I will offer better security than those other yahoos offer. I will offer you a 2-cent rebate for all of the advertising. I will offer you the option to click out of ads, or you'll only get one ad every minute. That's what competitive markets do.
JI: So this is an incremental plan that you've talked about, right? So your first hundred days you have essentially two health care plans, right? You have one that — would enact ——
But immediate policy doesn't tell the whole story. You also want to look at Trump's appointments. When it comes to policies that affect workers, Trump has created a team of cronies: Almost every important position has gone to a lobbyist or someone with strong financial connections to industry. Labor interests have received no representation at all.
Serge Schmemann: Let me ask you about the Middle East. In the October debate you said, I think we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. Did you mean nowhere in the Middle East? Do you think — for example, who should control the Persian Gulf, freedom of navigation, should we close down the air base in Qatar?
The health care bill unveiled Thursday by Senate Republicans has been out in the open for less than a week, and there are many obstacles to clear before it can become law: an uncertain Senate vote, a return to the House for final approval, a presidential signature.
MC: I think we can agree that there are huge problems here. But to Katie's point, and then I'm going to throw it to Jesse. You have to be careful to balance the big promises with the over-promising, because then you risk the disillusionment, which I think we saw during the Obama administration. And back to kind of Katie's question about how you pay for a lot of these things. I mean comprehensive immigration for one, you can't do that through budget reconciliation.
Ms. Smith could at least appeal to Republican legislators willing to put reason, compassion, and country ahead of party. Trumpist Republicans have no room for such niceties — they care only about winning. Which is why only losing the Senate can get their attention, and slow the party's extremism.
No, it's fine. It's just that look out there. People's financial circumstances have gotten worse. The amount of student loan debt has been going up at a rate of $100 billion a year. Oh, here's one. Just saw some data not long ago out of the Department of Education. Go take a look 20 years out on people who borrowed student loan debt. Ninety-four percent of whites have paid off their student loan debt. Want to guess what the percentage is for African-Americans is?
Insurers, which had been arguing in favor of the enrollment period, had been hopeful just a few days ago that the White House might announce such a step. But the situation suddenly became fluid, in the description of one executive. Another described the administration as divided about whether to proceed, especially given the president's support for the lawsuit that would overturn the law.
The future of America's health insurance system has already been a huge part of the 2020 presidential race. At campaign events over the past year, voters have shared stories of cancer diagnoses, costly medications and crushing medical debt.
And put simply, one should expect Republicans to hold the Senate more often — quite a bit more often — because they have this quite substantial, and as far as we can tell, growing advantage in the geography of the country. Now Democrats could get rid of the filibuster and add things like DC and offer statehood to Puerto Rico. But even that wouldn't fully balance the scales. So one thing I've heard from some Democrats — this is not crazy — is that they worry that getting rid of the filibuster will simply mean that Republicans, who will control the Senate more often, will have more power. What do you tell them?
Even in Northern cities, blacks were often denied opportunities for upward mobility. For example, in 1944 white transit workers in Philadelphia went on strike — disrupting war production — to protest the promotion of a handful of black workers.
You do what you can with 50 votes to offer people what's possible. And then when lots of people get experience with it and they say, I like this, this works for me, then we vote on it and everybody gets better off and gets to try it. I think that's what's going to happen on Medicare for all. In fact, I think that is the way that we can solve our health care problems.
When I began writing columns in The Times about climate policy more than a decade ago, I, too, was strongly in favor of carbon pricing as the best strategy for attacking climate change. But two big things have changed since then. The financial crisis and its aftermath intensified many families' economic problems. Income growth has since been sluggish. Amazingly, the wealth of the median American household has fallen 30 percent since 2007, according to the most recent Federal Reserve data, making higher energy costs an even harder sell.
If I were writing the choice on a ballot, it would read: Are you in favor of electing a majority of Democrats in the House and/or Senate to put a check on Trump's power — when his own party demonstrably will not? Or are you in favor of shaking the dice for another two years of unfettered control of the House, the Senate and the White House by a man who wants to ignore Russia's interference in our election; a man whose first thought every morning is, 'What's good for me, and can I get away with it?'; a man who shows no compunction about smearing any person or government institution that stands in his way; and a man who is backed by a party where the only members who'll call him out are those retiring or dying?
Before Obamacare 57 million In 2026 52 million Now 27 million Projected 2013 2016 2020 2026 Before Obamacare 57 million In 2026 52 million Now 27 million Projected 2013 2016 2020 2026 Before Obamacare 57 million In 2026 52 million Now 27 million PROJECTED 2013 2016 2020 2026
Yeah. These companies would essentially be wiped out by the Sanders proposal.
The candidates were asked if it should be a civil offense instead of a crime to cross the United States border without documentation. Mr. Bennet appeared to be the only candidate not to raise his hand, while Mr. Biden simply said that he would not emphasize the deportation of undocumented immigrants who have not committed a serious crime.
Yes, the Democratic candidates need to talk about health care. Polls show that it is a top — if not the top — policy concern for their voters, and the issue was a pillar of the party's successful platform to win control of the House in 2018. But there are other health care matters that could use more attention, such as surprise medical bills, reproductive rights and the Republicans' continuing efforts to dismantle Obamacare — which have gained far more traction than many people predicted, threatening coverage for millions of Americans.
The Trump administration said these concerns were unfounded. But in a preamble to the proposed rules, it said, Individuals who are likely to purchase short-term, limited-duration insurance are likely to be relatively young or healthy.
Critics of the wealth tax point out that only four European countries now have one, down from 12 in 1990. In France, the wealth tax triggered an exodus of the ultrarich and didn't raise as much revenue as anticipated.
JW: So you think a constitutional amendment?
At least a half-dozen Republican senators have expressed doubts about the Republican leadership strategy of using the budget resolution to fast-track legislation to repeal the law, with a delayed effective date to allow time to find a replacement in the future.
The low point for the self-proclaimed daddy's girl came a month ago when The Times reported that the president might be using his chief of staff, John Kelly, an adversary to Javanka, to push them out and back to New York.
Last Sunday, though, Mr. Trump acknowledged that the toll could hit 100,000. Still, he said, it could have been much worse had his administration not acted. If we didn't do it, the minimum we would have lost was a million two, a million four, a million five, that's the minimum. We would have lost probably higher. It's possible higher than 2.2.
Health reform is the signature achievement of the Obama presidency. It was the biggest expansion of the social safety net since Medicare was established in the 1960s. It more or less achieves a goal — access to health insurance for all Americans — that progressives have been trying to reach for three generations. And it is already producing dramatic results, with the percentage of uninsured Americans falling to record lows.
WASHINGTON — Standing before a diverse new class of House Democrats, in the shadow of their new female speaker, President Trump showed on Tuesday how he planned to govern in a divided Washington.
Health economists also overwhelmingly (81 percent agreement) said the A.C.A.'s individual mandate — in which people paid a fine if they chose not to be insured — was essential for its success. Without it, they said, the people who sign up would disproportionately be sicker, causing insurance to become ever more expensive. This phenomenon, also known as adverse selection, could collapse the market.
The basic solution is straightforward. It involves increasing the subsidies for lower-income families — while also increasing the penalties for people who refuse to sign up for health insurance. The overall cost of this fix would be modest, and a better functioning Republican Party would have no problem agreeing to a compromise. It would preserve a robust role for the private market, after all.
KK: Yes, and even more practically, is it enough to get anything passed in Mitch McConnell's Senate?
NF: How do you deal with the fact that while people might want big change, they're also afraid of it?

A 2018 Gallup poll found that a record-high 75 percent of Americans say immigration is a positive, including majorities of all parties. Yet immigration reform has become a wedge issue in Congress, with the government brought to a shutdown multiple times over issues like the treatment of Dreamers and the funding for Mr. Trump's border wall.
Tying is an arrangement where to buy one product, a consumer also has to buy a different product from a separate market. An example the F.T.C. offers is a drugmaker that required all consumers buying its medicine for schizophrenia to also buy its blood-monitoring service. The Supreme Court has treated the practice as illegal in the past, but more recently lower courts have permitted it under the more flexible rule of reason.
As early voting continued in Nevada on Sunday, some of the criticism seemed to be sticking.
archived recording (tony evers) This is not a Republican issue or a Democratic issue. This is an issue of democracy. I don't care who gets the credit. I just want to make sure that everyone has a chance to cast their ballot this April. Thanks for watching, and let's get it done, folks.
He needs the help of the legislature. And so one of the measures he tries to do is call a special session of the legislature, and encourage them to delay the election and implement changes that would allow every person to be able to vote without going in person.
So I start with trying to understand the problem, what it means that tens of millions of people don't have prescriptions filled, don't go to the doctor. People with health insurance who are being sued by their hospitals for medical bills. I think of this as offering the most help to the greatest number of people as quickly as possible. So in terms of priorities, day one, there's a lot a president could do all by herself, and I'll do it.
No longer will illness crush and destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over a lifetime.
Times columnist David Brooks noted in The Road to Character that Ms. Perkins discovered her calling to service and organizing after witnessing the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist fire. The analogy to something like the student loan debt crisis or child care, of course, isn't perfect — the debt crisis, for instance, has been slow burning as tuition rates have risen far above the inflation rate since the 1970s.
While the individual mandate may be dead, the employer mandate — the requirement that many companies offer health insurance to their workers or pay a penalty — is very much alive. Under Mr. Trump, the Internal Revenue Service has been pursuing companies that fail to comply with the mandate and, according to the agency, was sending penalty notices to more than 30,000 businesses around the country.
I'm not going to do names. That's enormously presumptuous.
The best hope for the Dreamers was not a shutdown that was somehow supposed to end differently from every other recent shutdown. The best hope, first, is to see if there is a solution over the next few weeks, away from the chaos and heat of a shuttered federal government.
President Trump will hardly be short of far-right cabinet members, including an education secretary who has called public schools a dead end, a labor secretary who has been cited for employment law violations and an Environmental Protection Agency administrator who has sued his own department.
The desire to crush those who displease him is a defining characteristic of this president. When challenged, his impulse is to lash out — preferably with personal, degrading insults. This has been on most vivid display with the myriad investigations into sketchy presidential behavior, but it also has been a hallmark of Mr. Trump's approach to key policy issues. Border security, health care, trade — you name the debate, Mr. Trump's answer is to stake out his position, vowing pain and regret for those who do not embrace it.
There are many, many things that rich people buy in larger quantities. It turns out medications for certain serious diseases may be one of them.
Based in Louisville, Ky., Humana is not a major player in the individual exchanges and is among the national insurers, like Aetna and UnitedHealth Group, that have struggled to make money in the market. The company has steadily scaled back its presence, selling policies for 2017 in just 11 states. In early January, the company said the number of its customers buying coverage through the exchanges had dropped to about 150,000, a small fraction of the roughly 12 million individuals who initially signed up for coverage through the exchanges.

But what about the people who are being covered by government-run health care programs like Medicare? Do they like it? Is it working well for them in this period — the 1960s, the 1970s?

By late January, Ms. Hurd had begun to believe that the only way for her family to have any access to health care was to drop their insurance and save the $928 a month to spend on care when they need it. Harry's recent illness had rattled her, and Matt wanted to see a chiropractor for back pain that was threatening his ability to work.
Once you accept this reality, two conclusions follow.
In one sense, it offers Democrats an advantage. The party is far more engaged with the details of health care policy, and far more willing to promise to extend coverage to those who don't have it. The debate over the last two nights has not been about whether to expand health coverage, but by how much, and by what policy mechanism.
But there was gun violence galore before Columbine, Newtown and Parkland. Feinstein can attest to that. She was at San Francisco City Hall on the November 1978 day when Mayor George Moscone and her fellow city supervisor Harvey Milk were fatally shot.

And during her quarter-century in the Senate, almost no lawmaker of any age has been a more insistent crusader for restrictions on firearms.

One of them is use march-in orders on prescription drugs. We can bring down the cost of EpiPens and insulin and other drugs, so that we save families literally hundreds of millions of dollars. It can be done without Mitch McConnell. The power is already there. You've just got to be willing to pick it up and use it. Nobody else has talked about picking it up and using it.
But it's not clear that Mr. Trump cares. In his mind, this is not about helping constituents. It's about scoring political points and undoing Barack Obama's legacy. Let's hope that enough lawmakers do care about their constituents, and that they fight back.
It's true that the coverage expansion was somewhat less than originally predicted, although the shortfall was much less than you may have heard. It's also true that after initially offering surprisingly cheap policies on the Obamacare exchanges, insurers found that the people signing up were sicker, on average, than they expected, leading to higher premiums. But as of last year, the markets appeared to have stabilized, with insurers generally profitable.
The struggles and false starts have injected more uncertainty into insurance markets that thrive on stability. An aspirational deadline of Jan. 27 for repeal legislation has come and gone. The powerful retirees' lobby AARP is mobilizing to defend key elements of the Affordable Care Act. Republican leaders who once saw a health law repeal as a quick first strike in the Trump era now must at least consider a worst case: unable to move forward with comprehensive health legislation, even as the uncertainty that they helped foster rattles consumers and insurers.
In 2012, Steven Teles, a political scientist at Johns Hopkins University, published a paper arguing that American public policy had become defined by kludges. The term comes out of the world of computer programming, where a kludge is an inelegant patch put in place to be backward compatible with the rest of a system, he wrote. When you add up enough kludges, you get a very complicated program, one that is hard to understand and subject to crashes. In other words, Windows.
Judge Elrod also asked how the federal government would respond if a stay issued by the lower court after Judge O'Connor's decision was lifted and its order striking down the law took effect.
I feel that the best person for the job would be Spiro T. Agnew. Mr. Agnew is tried and true as V.P. He is one person who could actually make Mr. Trump seem likable, and possibly even competent. The fact that he is deceased provides Mr. Trump with the advantage of nominating someone who cannot say no. He is, or was anyway, a member of the Republican establishment, and therefore is someone who could help to unite the party.
The Republican Party has essentially tied itself to a magical solution: getting rid of the law while keeping its benefits. The party does seem committed to repealing major parts of the law early in 2017, as Nicholas Bagley of the University of Michigan laid out in a smart tweetstorm yesterday. Yet Republicans could cause a lot of anger and frustration if they stick to their plan.
Survivors get a vaccine on Holocaust Remembrance Day.

Omar Marques/Getty Images Hundreds of survivors of the Holocaust are set to be vaccinated this week in Austria and Slovakia as part of vaccine drives organized in observance of the 76th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, a day known as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. More than seven decades after one of the darkest periods in human history, the generation that endured the Nazi death camps is aging and especially vulnerable to the coronavirus. Jewish leaders have long pushed to prioritize their inoculations. Some 400 people aged 85 and older, many of them Holocaust survivors, were being vaccinated in Vienna on Wednesday, according to the Jewish Community of Vienna, which helped organize the program in cooperation with the Austrian Ministry of Health. About 12 doctors were administering vaccinations, according to Erika Jakubovits, executive director of the Jewish Community of Vienna, who helped organize the event. I think we owe it to our parents and grandparents to take care of these Holocaust survivors, Ms. Jakubovits said on Wednesday, speaking by phone from a vaccine center. A similar program was underway in Bratislava, Slovakia, according to The Associated Press. People are very happy, Ms. Jakubovits said.

The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, provided for the sale of subsidized, private health insurance plans through federal and state marketplaces for people without job-based insurance. The 2010 law also expanded eligibility for Medicaid in many states. The law protects people with pre-existing conditions from being excluded from coverage, and requires health plans to provide certain essential coverage like preventive care.
But now Donald Trump is, in effect, implementing at least part of the drastic reduction in government's role his party has long claimed to favor. If the shutdown drags on for months — which seems quite possible — we'll get a chance to see what America looks like without a number of public programs the right has long insisted we don't need. Never mind the wall; think of what's going on as a big, beautiful libertarian experiment.
Senator Warren's support among young people — the Gen Z and millennial voters she describes, saddled with debt — has been on the rise. A November poll from Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics found that 22 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds support her, up from 4 percent in March.
Furthermore, we could reduce those disincentives by making programs more generous, not less — providing more aid to the near-poor rather than less aid to the poor. Somehow, conservatives never seem to consider that option.

The insurance industry, which usually supports tight limits on insurance enrollments, is backing the extra enrollment period now. Around 15 million Americans are uninsured and eligible for marketplace coverage, according to a recent analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Most would qualify for some form of financial assistance if they bought such coverage — and about four million could sign up for a high-deductible plan that would cost them nothing in premiums.

Yeah, I think it's an enormously complicated question, and I worry about it a lot. I would say, it is amazing how being off Twitter has meant that Trump has just said nothing, not only since the inauguration of Joe Biden, but in some ways, before that, too, when he lived in the White House, there's a room in that house where you can get the press together and be heard everywhere. He didn't do that. And it's not hard to understand why Twitter did what it did in the wake of January 6. But I think that the power that that proved they had is a power that we should be very, very worried about. I actually think the bigger problem is not so much the platforms, which at least have a greater claim to say, what we're doing is providing you with this platform, with this access to the public and we're going to withdraw it if you abuse it, but the companies that really provide access to the internet itself, what Amazon did, what, in some ways, Apple did, and this kind of taking of Parler off of its platforms. Whatever you think of Parler, and I don't have a high opinion of it, it seems to me that having that kind of power in the hands of corporations is very, very troubling. I think we are only beginning to come to terms with how to think about the nature of that power. What is that power? Is it economic power?

But there were certain occasions where Lindsey Graham was actually quite vocal and really wasn't trying to hide his feelings at all. After the Charlottesville demonstration and ultimately murder —
You don't need to look much further than the latest far-left-leaning Democratic debate to see how uniform policy preferences have become in our two-party system. The candidates' reluctance to reject purity tests, as well as their attempts to avoid getting ratioed by their loud online base, often leads them to well-intentioned yet hard-line rhetoric and stances that are unrepresentative of even many Democratic voters.
The key political advantage is that performance standards focus voters on the end goal, rather than on the technocratic mechanism for achieving it. Carbon pricing puts attention on the mechanism, be it a dreaded tax or a byzantine cap-and-trade system. Mechanisms don't inspire people. Mechanisms are easy to caricature as big-government bureaucracy. Think about the debate over Obamacare: When the focus was on mechanisms — insurance mandates, insurance exchanges and the like — the law was not popular. When the focus shifted to basic principles — Do sick people deserve health insurance? — the law became much more so.

So why revive the Obamacare debate? Why set yourself up for Trump Defunds Special Olympics headlines? The answer is that there are effectively two Trump presidencies. One offers something like what the president promised on the campaign trail — a break with Paul Ryan's green-eyeshade approach to entitlement reform, a more moderate tack on health care, an indifference to Obama-era conservative orthodoxies on fiscal and monetary policy.
In the Age of Trump, the bar for adding something new to this genre is high. Steven Brill, a writer, lawyer and entrepreneur who founded The American Lawyer and Court TV, offers his take in Tailspin. The book was born when Brill was stuck in traffic in a taxi one night on the Van Wyck Expressway coming home from Kennedy Airport. Fortunately, Tailspin is better than its grumpy origin story. Brill describes a slow-motion process of perverse meritocracy in which, as one law professor tells him, the elites have become so skilled and so hardworking that they are able to protect each other better than ever before. Or, as Brill labels it, Moat Nation.

Private insurers make Medicare extraordinarily confusing, increasing costs for beneficiaries and their own profits. When enrolling in Medicare, and then every subsequent year, beneficiaries are required to make a series of decisions regarding their coverage. Though there is a base benefit package, there are also many and varied options, ranging from which prescription drugs are covered to the amount of premiums, co-payments and deductibles. The plans also change every year.
But if the court rules in the way the Justice Department has requested, the result will be a world in which it is much more difficult for individuals and small businesses to buy health insurance. The health law is complicated, with interlocking parts. It will be hard to remove just two rules from the individual market without disrupting many others.

But in signaling either overt or tacit support, a small but vocal band of Republicans now serving in the House provided legitimacy and publicity to extremist groups and movements as they built toward their role in the attack on Congress. Ms. Boebert, who has close connections to militia groups including the Three Percenters, said in a statement that she had never given a tour of the U.S. Capitol to anyone besides family members in town for my swearing-in, and she called accusations from Democrats that she gave a reconnaissance tour to insurgents an irresponsible lie. Both Mr. Biggs and Mr. Gosar have been linked to the Stop the Steal campaign backing Mr. Trump's effort to overturn the election's outcome. Mr. Biggs has denied associating with Stop the Steal organizers and condemned violence of any kind. Mr. Gosar did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Ms. Greene said she now rejected the QAnon conspiracy theory that she previously promoted, and he tried to distance her from militia members. Before being elected to Congress last year, she used social media in 2019 to endorse executing top Democrats and has suggested that the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., was a staged false flag attack.

But at least canonically, as I understand it, the way people think about budget reconciliation, raising the minimum wage would not survive because that's not primarily budgetary. But doing a direct subsidy would survive because that is primarily budgetary. So even if raising the minimum wage is the cheaper, more efficient, more direct, more useful way to do this — I'm not saying it is, but hypothetically — you then would have to do the less efficient, more expensive, less useful way of doing it. That it's like, it's not just what kind of thing you do, but how you can do it.

President Trump has railed repeatedly against the Senate filibuster as a major reason that many of his policy priorities have flopped. Monday, raging about the Mexico border, he tweeted that Congress must immediately pass border legislation, use nuclear option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of drugs and people.
And I think this lays the groundwork for Bernie Sanders when he comes forward with a proposal in 2016 that he calls Medicare for all.
I'm not saying this is right, but that's the rational political calculation for them. So that's why you have Rubio, Lee, and all these others who supposedly care about this issue coming out and shooting it down. The irony here is that the framers saw this coming. And they identified this misperception about supermajority threshold at the time in 1789. The reason they saw it was that they had just finished having direct firsthand experience with the Articles of Confederation, which did require a supermajority threshold for most major categories of legislation. And so, in Federalist 22, Alexander Hamilton addresses this misperception head on. And he says, what at first sight might seem a remedy, referring to a supermajority threshold, is, in fact, a poison. And he says — now I'm going back to my words, but he says you might think it would cause compromise, but really, what it does is, it provides an irresistible temptation for the party that's out of power to make the party in power look bad. He uses the words to embarrass the administration and the good functioning of government. So it's not what you would think at the time. You think, oh, 60 votes. Well, there's 50 Democrats so that means they got to get 10 Republicans, so that's going to force bipartisanship. But really, what it does is, give Republicans the ability to simply make Democrats look bad at all times. And in a polarized environment, that's the rational political choice.

I disagreed with them. So for example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership had a robust investor state dispute resolution mechanism, which multiple of our trade treaties have had for decades now. And I just think that's fundamentally wrong. It's a two-tier system that says, in effect, we'll make a bunch of promises in a trade deal on the environment, on use of prison labor, child labor and on anything else, and then we'll give two entirely different enforcement mechanisms.
But it's a very dangerous minority. While we are, as I said, in many ways a better nation than we were, we're also a nation in which the rule of law and democratic values are very much under siege.
And it seems to me that what's happened in the Republican Party is that you had a generation of people like Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney who thought that everybody was really in it for the tax cuts, thought that this economic libertarianism was sincere instead of a cipher for a broader set of grievances. Trump has stripped that all away and gone back to giving the base of the party what it wants. Once you discover that this is what the voters of the Republican Party wanted, I don't see how you go back to giving them what they don't want so much.

Tying is an arrangement where to buy one product, a consumer also has to buy a different product from a separate market.

On the economy, Trump could reach out to moderate voters with a minimum-wage increase. In a January poll from The Hill , 55 percent of registered voters said they would support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour from $7.25. While only 36 percent of Republicans supported $15 per hour, 70 percent said they would support a lesser but still significant raise. Only 14 percent of registered voters want the minimum wage to stay the same and only 5 percent think it should be reduced or eliminated. In the same survey, an even larger number of voters — 59 percent — said that they support a 70 percent tax rate on the amount of income over $10 million. By adopting both policies, Trump could claim the middle and grow his coalition beyond its current confines.

However, to repeat something I've said a few times in the Trump era, when the venting is done it's important to acknowledge that it could be worse. The bill is badly designed but it does some good things, including some things that could be done only in the teeth of Democratic opposition. Its flaws are significant but also manageable, and they aren't going to tip America into the dystopian nightmare invoked by a certain kind of liberal Twitter hysteric this past week. And as is often the case with flawed proposals, the failings offer useful signposts to the opposition: The partial defeat of reform conservatism leaves good ideas lying around to be picked up, and Republican overreach creates opportunities for the Democrats to pursue them.
One of them is use march-in orders on prescription drugs. We can bring down the cost of EpiPens and insulin and other drugs, so that we save families literally hundreds of millions of dollars. It can be done without Mitch McConnell. The power is already there. You've just got to be willing to pick it up and use it. Nobody else has talked about picking it up and using it.
A 'bunch of kids' ran a major vaccination site for Philadelphia. Then the city cut its ties. The vaccination site at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia earlier this month. Credit... Kimberly Paynter/WHYY With pressure mounting to get Covid-19 vaccine doses into arms as quickly as possible, many overburdened city health departments across the country have turned to partnerships with hospitals, nonprofit organizations and pharmacies. In Philadelphia this week, one such deal went awry after the city leaned on a start-up led by college students who were eager to get involved but had little experience. The start-up is an organization called Philly Fighting Covid, which was founded last year by a 22-year-old graduate student, Andrei Doroshin. The group quickly won plaudits for volunteering to run free testing sites, and for using 3-D printers to make face shields that it supplied free to health care workers. So when Philadelphia began receiving shipments of vaccine and needed help administering doses on a large scale, the city health department turned to Philly Fighting Covid to operate what would be the largest vaccination site in the state, at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. It took less than three weeks after vaccinations began for the partnership to sour. Since it opened on Jan. 8, the site has vaccinated nearly 7,000 people, though there were reports in local media that appointments had been overbooked and some people were turned away.
So if the overall case counts continue to decline, she said, I think it's more likely that we will see the deaths start to come down. Even with the recent new-case declines, the daily pandemic statistics in the U.S. remain troubling. On Tuesday, the country logged 151,616 new cases, and 4,205 deaths — close to the peak of 4,406 on Jan. 12. As of Tuesday, the seven-day average for new reported deaths stood at 3,341. Overall, more than 25 million people have tested positive in the country, and more than 425,000 people have died, since the pandemic began. The U.S. saw significant spikes in new reported cases after Thanksgiving and during the December holidays, most likely the result of increased travel and social gatherings. Now, experts like Dr. Nuzzo are concerned that cases will be driven up again by the new and more infectious variants of the virus that are circulating. President Biden said this week that his administration would soon reach deals to purchase 200 million additional vaccine doses, which he said could allow 300 million Americans to be fully vaccinated by the end of the summer. But experts worry that the new variants could cause significant damage in the meantime.
In 2012, Massachusetts Democrats, worried about a tough fight against Republican Senator Scott Brown, coalesced around Ms. Warren, knocking her only primary challenger, an immigration attorney, Marisa DeFranco, off the ballot. Winning in November is more important to Democrats than standing behind one woman who wanted to challenge another one for the right to run for U.S. Senate, Boston Globe columnist Joan Vennochi wrote at the time. Whether Ms. Warren could beat Mr. Brown, the incumbent, was more of a tossup, though by late summer 2012 most polls had her ahead.

The result is likely to be big differences in health insurance options and coverage, depending on where you live. States that lean into the changes might have more health insurance offerings with small price tags, but ones that are inaccessible to people with health problems and don't cover major health services, like prescription drugs. States pushing back may see more robust Obamacare markets of highly regulated plans, but the price of those plans is likely to remain higher.
Acting Capitol Police chief calls for permanent fencing and backup forces in wake of assault. Capitol Police officers standing by the Capitol's rotunda on Monday. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times The acting chief of the Capitol Police has called for vast improvements to security on the Capitol grounds, including permanent fencing and the availability of ready, backup forces, a sign of lasting changes in Washington in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol siege. Yogananda D. Pittman, who became acting chief on Jan. 8 after her predecessor resigned, had directed her staff to assess the Capitol complex's security upon assuming the post. She noted that security experts had argued for greater security measures for the Capitol even before the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Additionally, a security assessment in 2006 recommended a permanent fence. In light of recent events, I can unequivocally say that vast improvements to the physical security infrastructure must be made to include permanent fencing, and the availability of ready, backup forces in close proximity to the Capitol, she said in a statement. Ms. Pittman's announcement came a day after the Department of Homeland Security issued a rare warning saying that the United States faced a growing threat from violent domestic extremists who might have been emboldened by the Jan. 6 assault. The deadly Capitol assault has prompted new scrutiny of the Capitol Police and other government agencies. Separate reviews are also being conducted by the Capitol Police inspector general and Russel L. Honoré, a retired Army lieutenant general.
When even a bipartisan agreement on immigration reform, focused on employment-based green cards, died on the Senate floor in September, it demonstrated just how difficult it has become to get any immigration reform legislation through Congress.
Senator Warren's plan on trade, released in July, would change American trade policy by pushing the country's trade partners to abide by higher labor and environmental standards. Under her plan, more representatives from labor, environmental and consumer groups would be involved in trade negotiations, and the process would be more transparent through public disclosure of draft agreements.
A graduate with a professional degree expects to earn $2.3 million more than a high school graduate. The Brookings Institution's Adam Looney estimated that under Senator Warren's plan the bottom 20 percent of borrowers by income get only 4 percent of the savings.
The equivalent of a nuclear bomb fell on our country when the president said what he said this week, Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California, said Wednesday as her House subcommittee began pushing through health care legislation. This is deadly serious.

Among states that expanded their Medicaid programs under the Affordable Care Act, the uninsured rate actually fell last year. Among states that didn't expand, it rose a little.
WALLACE: Sir, your two minutes are up.
I talk about rolling back every racist voter suppression law in America. We could do that at the federal level. I talk about outlawing political gerrymandering. We could do that at the federal level.
To the ends, to the objectives that I want.
We were told that if America passed Obamacare, it would result in death panels.
MC: And there is a good question. How do you do that if Mitch McConnell still holds that Senate?
Everything Mr. Trump has done so far suggests that even if he were able to identify the most knowledgeable people in the world on any subject, he probably wouldn't listen to them anyway.
In her latest attempt to rally support for Brexit after a series of embarrassing setbacks, British prime minister Theresa May said she would seek a new delay for leaving the European Union and would begin negotiating a Brexit plan with her political rivals in the Labour Party.
Considering that it will seriously harm over 100,000 Kentuckians, in violation of numerous provisions of Medicaid law, we are very seriously considering taking legal action — and as we analyze the meager legal rationale in the approval itself, it seems inevitable, said Leonardo Cuello, director of health policy at the National Health Law Program, an advocacy group for the poor.
The House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, to strengthen voting rights and ethics provisions, in March 2019 and sent it to the Senate. It is now awaiting a vote there.
That was the last time there was this sort of disruption in our daily lives and change in rituals, said Doris Kearns Goodwin, the presidential scholar, noting that millions were deployed in arms and those who remained home lived with rationed goods. But at least people then could go to work, be part of the effort to win the war.
KK: But do you know of any specific evidence that immigrants drive down wages?
I've heard you make this argument on another podcast, I think was on 5:38, where you argued that a lot of 2024 hopefuls have learned the wrong lesson from Trump in 2016. That Trump won largely because he was seen as a moderate in the party, not because he just played to the base. That's a challenging argument to hear at this moment, so give it to me in more detail.
This is our chance to turn that one around.
CW: Intends to use their influence in this election. And Mark Zuckerberg especially. You were tweeting about that and mentioning him.
Mr. Doroshin did acknowledge that there were problems with the organization's privacy policy, which he said was posted in haste. But he said that the group had not sold or otherwise disseminated any of the patient data it collected, and that the posted policy was frankly just a mistake. Katrina Lipinsky, a registered nurse who volunteered at the group's vaccination site, said in an interview that at the end of one day, after the group tried to find takers for a number of leftover doses, she saw Mr. Doroshin put a few in his backpack, along with the vaccination cards that are used to track vaccination timelines. She said she had reported it to city investigators. Obviously, that didn't seem right, she said. Dr. Farley, the health commissioner, told reporters that any leftover vaccine doses should have been given back to the health department. He said the department was looking into the matter. If that's true, that's very disturbing, he said. They shouldn't have done that. In the interview, Mr. Doroshin acknowledged that he took four doses home with him and administered them to friends. He said that he should have had a nurse present when he gave the shots, but that he did not regret making use of doses that would otherwise have expired that night. I'm OK with being a person that broke a rule to not have any vaccine left over, he said. If that's the final word I have in my book, then that's OK. I'm OK with dying with that.
Vice President Biden has cast the Medicare for all plan as anti-labor, arguing that unions have already painstakingly negotiated health care benefits, progress that could be undone by a single-payer system. But Senators Warren and Sanders argue that the plan is pro-labor because it would mean union members are guaranteed health care and can focus their negotiations on wage increases, family leave and other benefits.
And to be fair, I actually agree that Obama was much too cautious on some fronts. Back in 2009 I was very publicly tearing my hair out over the obvious inadequacy of Obama's economic stimulus, which I predicted (correctly) would be a political disaster, because the failure to achieve dramatic results would play into Republican hands. And I believe that Obama could have gotten much more if he had been willing to use reconciliation to bypass the filibuster, the way Republicans did in ramming through the 2017 tax cut.
We won't be debating about the science. We'll be debating about the solutions.
Polling has consistently shown Senator Warren to be in the top tier of candidates, but not the front of the pack. She trails Joe Biden — and Donald Trump — in key swing states.
MC: Not everybody likes Medicare for all, where you do away with private health care. Not everybody is going to appreciate if you've suggested that the candidate that they happen to back now is in the wrong primary. I'm just saying these things will come back as you have to win voters in swing states, things like that.
It puts him in direct conflict with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others who back a single-payer Medicare for all plan. Mr. Sanders has led the charge to eliminate most private health insurance as part of his proposal, though other Democrats running for president have said they would seek to retain a private-insurance structure.
Because, without doubt, Russia and China also will be voting Trump 2020 — for three reasons: (1) Trump keeps America in turmoil and unable to focus on building the infrastructure we need to dominate the 21st century the way we did the 20th. (2) Both Beijing and Moscow know that Trump is so disliked by America's key allies that he can never galvanize a global coalition against China or Russia. And (3) both Russia and China know that Trump is utterly transactional and will never challenge them on human rights abuses. Trump is their chump, and they will not let him go easily.
Relax. Everything political is interesting right now.
It's not a criticism of him as a man, it's a criticism of whether or not you think you're going to be able to help elect a Democratic senator here against Lindsey Graham, which I'm going to help do, he said of the South Carolina Senate race this year.
In an alienated America, efforts to decentralize power are more effective and realistic than efforts to concentrate it in the Washington elite. The great paradox of progressive populism is that it leads to elitism in its purist form.
So let me do both of these, because I think there are two answers. There are two pieces in this answer. One is, I think attacking the corruption in Washington brings a lot more people together than most folks recognize, and that it really does reach across party lines.
KK: You seem to have avoided that approach for the most part. Can you just explain why?
But that is the specific, right? This is the place where Democrats have fired on Democrats about how we're going to do health care. And I'll make two pitches on that. One is I think the best way we're going to do health care — this is just what I believe — is you do what you can to bring down costs. You got a little success on the table. It's a lot of success. It's hundreds of millions of dollars of success. You've got that on the table. You start to offer people what's possible.
BA: So you'd put tariffs on existing foreign imports?
KK: Well, we're going to start, if you don't mind, at America's borders and around foreign policy.
In October 2019, Senator Warren tweeted: Facebook has incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. Mark Zuckerberg is telling employees that he views a Warren administration as an 'existential' threat to Facebook. The public deserves to know how Facebook intends to use their influence in this election.
When you're spending that much money unopposed, you're doing two things, Mr. Goldstein said. You're getting the general advantage, yes, but it's also allowing you to play everywhere, which is an advantage for delegate math.
Margot: Maybe state legislatures in some states, but then we're not talking a Medicare-like program. Remember there are states — Vermont, Colorado, California — where there is an active and somewhat mainstream movement to get to a single-payer health care system. This is not exactly that, but it is a way of socializing more of health care, and I could see political support for the idea, especially if things get worse in the marketplaces. Of course, ironically, the most receptive states tend to be the ones with the most stable exchanges. If I were a legislator in California, I might think twice about voting for something with the potential to destabilize a functional market.
CW: Can I ask about that?
But unlike those other companies, many drug makers have already been taking steps in recent weeks to insulate themselves from future attacks. Some have pledged to limit price increases. Others offered plain-spoken critiques of drug pricing. And the industry's two main lobbying groups have pushed ahead with major campaigns intended to win back the narrative.
On the contrary, the repeal-and-replace bill designed by House Speaker Paul D. Ryan drew withering criticism from the left and the right. Liberals condemned its use of reductions in health coverage for the poor to pay for large tax cuts for the wealthy, while conservatives bemoaned its retention of many subsidies adopted under Obamacare.
She told one recruit, I need you fighting fit by Inauguration Day and told another that the training class was a military style exercise run by a Marine drill sergeant, prosecutors said. Biden may still yet be our president, Ms. Watkins stated, in part, when asked by a recruit about her predictions for 2021. If he is, our way of life as we know it is over. Our Republic would be over. Then it is our duty as Americans to fight, kill and die for our rights. Thomas Edward Caldwell, 65, another rioter included in the indictment and an apparent leader of the Oath Keepers, told Ms. Watkins that he believed we will have to get violent to stop this. The next month, Mr. Caldwell, who is from Virginia, made plans to stay at a hotel in Arlington, Va., for the days around the Capitol rampage, the indictment states. Evidence revealed earlier had already pointed to a potential conspiracy among rioters. A prosecutor in a hearing for Mr. Crowl, also a resident of Ohio, told the federal magistrate judge, He's been preparing for literal war. Prosecutors have said that the Oath Keepers moved in an organized and practiced fashion up the Capitol steps during the riot, donning matching gear. Inside, Ms. Watkins and others communicated using a channel on Zello, an application that mimics walkie-talkies, called Stop the Steal J6.
CW: But does that fix the power consolidation that's happening right now? If you took Facebook and spun out to Instagram, say, you still have a real dominance and a power that has been accumulated there. So Facebook, for example, in the media and advertising industry.

But a degree worse, two degrees worse. I watch that, and I watch as one more player in the game gets even more deeply embedded in Washington and Washington decision making. One more player hires more lobbyists, spends more money on campaign contributions, puts more money into bought-and-paid-for experts and think tanks so that nothing will change. It's like you talk about hardening between right and left. That's not the hardening. The part that's happening is it's hardening between the top and the bottom.
KK: We have some foreign policy questions for you.
Where can I get help choosing a health plan?
Because, without doubt, Russia and China also will be voting Trump 2020 — for three reasons: (1) Trump keeps America in turmoil and unable to focus on building the infrastructure we need to dominate the 21st century the way we did the 20th. (2) Both Beijing and Moscow know that Trump is so disliked by America's key allies that he can never galvanize a global coalition against China or Russia. And (3) both Russia and China know that Trump is utterly transactional and will never challenge them on human rights abuses. Trump is their chump, and they will not let him go easily.
The nation responded to the turmoil both from the bottom up and the top down.
Mr. Trump sent mixed signals from the White House lectern, agreeing at one point with his surgeon general and saying, It's going to be bad, then suggesting that the response to the virus may have been overblown.
Day 2 of the impeachment trial. Many senators became emotional after House impeachment managers presented previously unreleased security footage of the Capitol riot, showing how close some lawmakers came to encountering the attackers.
The idea was that everyone, once they turned age 65, if they had worked and paid payroll taxes, would be able to have government health insurance. They would have access to insurance that would pay for their hospital care and further visits to doctors.
O.K., well, what is the response to this announcement?
Frustrated state officials have ideas for stabilizing the individual insurance market, but they say they cannot figure out where to make their case because they have been bounced from one agency to another in the Trump administration.
Not surprisingly, violence against African-Americans who managed to achieve any economic success discouraged initiative. For example, the economist Lisa Cook has shown that the number of blacks taking out patents, which soared for several decades after the Civil War, plunged in the face of growing white violence.
Medicare beneficiaries would have to pay more for preventive care, like a wellness visit or diabetes check, which are now free. They would also have to pay more toward their prescription drugs. About five million people faced the so-called Medicare doughnut hole, or coverage gap, in 2016, which the A.C.A. sought to eliminate. If the law were overturned, that coverage gap would widen again.
Some are at increased risk because of age, and some have health problems like diabetes or asthma that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified as risk factors.
JW: Senator, do you think that the House of Representatives is moving too quickly toward a vote on impeachment?
Which is why it's important to place the blame where it belongs.
KK: Why? Do you mind telling?
So did I, and I think so did a lot of Republican candidates down the ballot preparing for 2020. There was always going to be tension in the Republican message about Democratic radicalism on health care, because if you are running in 2020 on the idea that Democrats are going to blow up the current system and replace it with European-style medicine, you're kind of implicitly defending the status quo system as it exists under Obamacare. It's an extraordinarily awkward position for Republicans to be in. Can you be opposed to Democratic proposals to make the health care system even more liberal, even more regulated or structured by the government, without essentially defending the system that Barack Obama put in place? We don't know how they're going to walk that line. We don't know to what extent they'll even try. But the president's current approach, which is to say that Democrats will do something drastic and bad to your health care, and I'm not quite going to tell you what I'm going to do yet, doesn't seem sustainable.
That's what makes it all the more surprising that his administration decided to dive right back into one of the most politically damaging fights of his whole presidency, which is health care.
But Heritage Action, because of its ironclad resistance to partial repeal, actually opposed the measure to get rid of the 1099 provision. Yes, it would help small businesses — but then those same small businesses would no longer care to be part of Heritage Action's crusade. As Needham later told me, We felt that when anything less than full repeal becomes acceptable, you open the door for every lobbyist in town to say: 'Hey, while we're working on full repeal, let's fix the 1099 issue. Or let's fix the franchise-restaurant issue'  — the popular shorthand for an A.C.A. provision requiring companies with 50 or more employees to provide health care to anyone working over 30 hours a week. You eventually over time whittle off various constituencies that we want to keep as part of the full-repeal platform. Partial repeal would be well and good if it got rid of what Needham called a vital organ of the law: the individual mandate, say, or Medicaid expansion. But those vital organs were never going to go down if repeal was defined by Washington's lobbying class. It would be 1099s and these heavily lobbied issues, and then we'll be stuck with Obamacare.

The messages in these rural areas are fairly diverse — Mr. Bloomberg has run 38 different ads in Duluth alone — though nearly one third of them in each market deal directly with health care. Only a few go after Mr. Trump as aggressively as Mr. Bloomberg has in other states.
Other candidates who addressed the question said they preferred some kind of public option for a government-run plan while still maintaining the private insurance system, at least in the immediate future.
But I think you could also say — and this is where I disagree with you, David. I think you could say that we have exaggerated, as Michelle says, the extent to which male-female differences require some form of patriarchy. But that doesn't mean that we've actually exaggerated male-female differences. That just might mean that we haven't appreciated what women can do as much as we've should. And there's, in fact, plenty of evidence that in gender egalitarian societies, including the paradises of Scandinavia, male and female differences actually increase further. I think there are places and situations where male-female differences still get exaggerated. I think in the world of New York Times readers, at this point in our history, it's the opposite and that we've moved to a place of telling people that they need to deny realities in front of their face.

Bret: The G.O.P.'s refusal to consider Judge Garland's nomination was a disgrace. No argument from me there. Although I would point out that the hyper-politicization of these confirmation hearings began in 1987 with the disgraceful Democratic mistreatment of Robert Bork, the Reagan nominee who should have been confirmed. Sorry, please continue.
If premiums exceeded a company's medical expenses, the insurer would be required to pay some of its profit to the government. But if premiums fell short of medical expenses, the insurer would be entitled to payments from the government.
The United Automobile Workers has nearly one million members. Along with the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Teachers, it has yet not taken a stance on Medicare for all.
He later added, I'm not looking at months, I can tell you right now.
Margot: Maybe. There is, of course, some sort of utopian health insurance plan that is able to be affordable because it manages care so well and keeps people really healthy without requiring a lot of medical services. But the government Medicare program is not really like that. It gets most of its cost advantages through price controls. Of course, Medicare is changing a lot. The Obama administration has been experimenting with new ways to pay doctors and hospitals, designed to improve quality and squeeze out wasteful care. But, so far, those experiments aren't making a big difference to the bottom line. Realistically, I think the best chance for a public option plan to compete with insurers right away is probably just to pay doctors and hospitals less — and maybe spend less on overhead and profits. That could change over time.
A graduate with a professional degree expects to earn $2.3 million more than a high school graduate. The Brookings Institution's Adam Looney estimated that under Senator Warren's plan the bottom 20 percent of borrowers by income get only 4 percent of the savings.
Even before President-elect Donald J. Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, giving their party full control of the government, Republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities — most notably a measure to clear a path for the Affordable Care Act's repeal. Perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new Congress is the push for deregulation. Also up early: filling a long-vacant Supreme Court seat, which is sure to set off a pitched showdown, and starting confirmation hearings for Mr. Trump's cabinet nominees.
If you buy insurance from a broker, it may not be obvious whether a given plan will be a short-term plan or a more comprehensive Obamacare-compliant plan, unless you ask. Both insurers and brokers who help connect people with the plans will have an incentive to sell them.
And even if the lawsuit fails, the administration's support for an incredibly flimsy legal challenge — one so indefensible that three career Justice Department lawyers withdrew from the case — is a clear signal of Republican priorities: G.O.P. to Americans with health problems: Drop dead.
• After hearing details of the new health care legislation, I call up Newt Gingrich and ask him what he thinks.
I have not finished reading the report, but they look like they've laid out their ducks. The Trump administration evidently does not wish to put up a defense and call its own witnesses. In fact, it seems to be still in the process of trying to block witnesses from coming and block documents from exposure. Yeah. And look, I think they've got enough. And if they've got enough, it can't be that the House impeachment process is the tail that gets wagged by Donald Trump based on when he's willing to allow access to various witnesses or various documents. Not even Richard Nixon tried to stop people from testifying or tried to stop the House from getting access to documentation. So they've got what they've got. If it's enough, then go forward.
So we have a shrinking supply and a growing population, and that means tens of millions of people are paying more to get less. So how can you turn that around? And the answer is to make a bigger investment in housing supply directly. And that includes housing for middle-class families, for working-class families, for the working poor, for the poor, for seniors who want to age in place, for people with disabilities, for people who've been incarcerated. Expanding housing supply directly, but also using federal dollars to help encourage cities and small towns and rural areas to adopt housing practices, that will lower costs even further. I just think that's a more effective way to get real structural change.
In a 6-to-3 decision, the justices ruled on Monday that gay and transgender people are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law. It was a stunning milestone in L.G.B.T.Q. progress. It was also a major slap at Trump, whose administration has gone perversely far out of its way not merely to halt advances during the Obama years but to turn back the clock.
This week's Campaign Stops column tries to reckon with an important part of the Trump surprise, which is the willingness of Republican primary voters — who are plugged-in, high-information, politically-savvy voters by the standards of the country as a whole — to support a candidate who is neither ideologically reliable nor obviously electable. The ideological part is fairly easy to understand: Trump represents (among other things) a revolt of ideologically-heterodox Republicans against the party's litmus tests, which lots of people saw coming even if we didn't imagine would take this form or rope in quite this much support. But the electability issue is trickier to parse: No Republican (or Democratic) primary in generations has produced a nominee with anything like Trump's unfavorable ratings or long general-election odds, and you would think the combination of eight years of Obama and the hated Hillary waiting in the wings would have concentrated voters' minds on that, ah, problematic aspect of Trump's candidacy.
Senator Warren's famous paper laying the groundwork for the creation of the C.F.P.B. opens with the sentence, It is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one-in-five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house and later says, Why are consumers safe when they purchase tangible products with cash, but when they sign up for routine financial products like mortgages and credit cards they are left at the mercy of their creditors?
Members of Congress are paid $174,000 a year, while members of Poland's lower house of Parliament are paid $32,300 a year.
It's always possible that the president will confound the naysayers and emerge from what he has called his little squabble with China with some big-picture successes. Alternatively, this folly could wind up wreaking global havoc well beyond the economic sphere.
I went to Washington. I came here to New York to talk to people about the idea for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and I heard two things over and over and over. Part one, that's a great idea. It would actually make a real difference. That would be structural change, or as I now say, big structural change, in financial services. And part two, don't even try, because you'll be up against the big banks. You'll be up against Wall Street. You'll be up against all of the Republicans. You'll be up against half the Democrats. You'll never get it done. But we did get it done.
KK: Senator, I think we need to move on.
Over all, though, the panel spent the most time on the question of whether the rest of the law should fall if Judge O'Connor was correct in scrapping the insurance mandate — and Judge Elrod and Judge Engelhardt, based on their questioning, seemed to firmly believe he was. Judge Engelhardt asked Mr. Letter, the House lawyer, why Congress could not remedy the situation by writing a new health law or set of laws.

Simple Health violated the trust of its consumers, its regulators and us, the company said, emphasizing that it was not named as a defendant in the F.T.C. case and was cooperating with federal regulators.
Several members of the Trump family have come under fire for profiting from Donald Trump's administration in possible violation of the emoluments clause, including Ivanka Trump, who was paid more than $1 million from her ties to the Trump Organization last year. And former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter held a lucrative position on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. In late September, Ms. Warren was, in the words of one reporter, uncharacteristically flustered when asked about the Biden matter.

Fourth, McCain understood that democracy sometimes means moving on. He voted against Obamacare — a reflection of his small-government conservatism. But he also voted, crucially, against its repeal — a reflection of his small-c conservatism. In doing so, he acted as a modern-day Eisenhower, a Republican willing to accept an expansion of the safety net for the good of the country.
Trump in general was preaching to his base, and I don't think he did what he needed at a time when GOP is in crisis. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
But if the idea's straightforwardness is its great economic advantage, it has also proved to be its political flaw. Energy, for utilities and transportation, is a major cost of living. And across the industrialized world, the middle class and the poor have been struggling with slow income growth. As Nordhaus acknowledged in his speech, curbing dirty energy by raising its price may be good for nature, but it's not actually all that attractive to voters to reduce their income.
Mulvaney isn't just the budget director. He is also the interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the banking watchdog that the Obama administration and Elizabeth Warren created after the financial crisis. The bureau, often called the C.F.P.B., has had an impressive record since its founding, curtailing abusive lending practices by banks, among other things. It's helped level the playing field — not all the way, to be sure — between big, powerful companies and American families.
He was being one of the smart guys.
Biden signs orders aimed at expanding health care access, including abortion, and opening Obamacare enrollment. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:06 - 0:00 transcript Health Care Orders Undo 'Damage Trump Has Done,' Biden Says President Biden took executive action to expand health care access by strengthening the Affordable Care Act and reopening enrollment. He also moved to protect reproductive rights and expand abortion access. Today, we're about to sign two executive orders. Basically, the best way to describe it, to undo the damage Trump has done. There's nothing new that we're doing. The first one I'm going to be signing here is to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. And of all times that we need to reinstate access to affordability of and extent of access to Medicaid, is now, in the middle of this Covid crisis. And the second order I'm signing relates to protecting women's health at home and abroad, and it reinstates the changes that were made in Title X and other things, making it harder for women to have access to affordable health care as it relates to reproductive rights. President Biden took executive action to expand health care access by strengthening the Affordable Care Act and reopening enrollment. He also moved to protect reproductive rights and expand abortion access.
But I take your question seriously. The place I might be most likely to fail is to get only part. Now, part's better than none, right? But only part. And that's a deeply worrisome thought.
Climate change: New near-term targets, but no fracking ban
I did not come to Washington to hurt people, said Senator Shelley Moore Capito, above, a Republican from West Virginia. I cannot vote to repeal Obamacare without a replacement plan that addresses my concerns and the needs of West Virginians.
But it's to work with nations and say, you want access to the American consumer, you've got to start raising your standards in a meaningful way. And here's where the long-term goals are, here's where you are, here's what constitutes moving toward those. And I think that's where a lot of folks would like to go, and frankly we should be working with other nations on helping, not just those who lag way behind, but those who have good standards to be using the same kind of approach to trade. The idea that trade is just about tariffs is just old 20th century. Trade today in the 21st century is about regulation. It's about who's going to have to meet what regulatory standards.
Senator Warren's plan on trade, released in July, would change American trade policy by pushing the country's trade partners to abide by higher labor and environmental standards. Under her plan, more representatives from labor, environmental and consumer groups would be involved in trade negotiations, and the process would be more transparent through public disclosure of draft agreements.
And Republicans are contending with retirements of incumbents in crucial states, including Senators Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio, that could make their task more difficult. Mr. Peters, 62, is also the incoming chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. He won his Senate seat handily in 2014, but his re-election fight was a grind, and he ultimately eked out victory by a margin of less than 2 percent. Along the way, Mr. Peters raised more than $50 million, a key metric for the campaign post. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, called him battle-tested on Thursday. Republicans had a less flattering assessment, resurfacing one of their leading digs against Mr. Peters in his re-election campaign: that he is so bland and unrecognizable that voters forget his name. We are thrilled that Senator Peters was chosen for this position, Chris Hartline, a spokesman for Senate Republicans' campaign arm, said in a statement. It is an inspiration to uninspiring people everywhere that even Jerry Peters can reach a leadership position in the Democrat Party. Republicans selected Senator Rick Scott of Florida, the ambitious former governor, to lead their campaign team. Mr. Scott has jumped into the job enthusiastically, campaigning in a pair of runoff elections in Georgia earlier this month that cost his party the Senate.
KK: O.K., the Electoral College is really important to Jesse. So much of the biggest change in recent years has come through the Supreme Court. Who would be your Supreme Court nominees?
And I think that if we are going to commit to the political project of eliminating gender as a social organizing principle, we should be really clear about the amount of political resources that you would have to devote to a project of that magnitude. And then, I guess, the final thing I would say is that my own relationship to femininity is pretty fraught. But I could easily imagine my trolls calling me they to call into question whether or not I am a real woman. That's probably true, I would guess, certainly not all but for some trans people who have gone through a lot of trouble to identify as a man or a woman as opposed to a person of indeterminate gender. And so we have to do a lot more thinking and arguing about what we believe about gender before we go off and try to impose it on everyone else.
This interview was conducted by the editorial board of The New York Times, which will announce its Democratic primary endorsement on Jan. 19.
Right. But giving voters a better version of health care provided by the Republican Party has always had to mean more than just getting rid of the system that currently exists. It's this strange kind of bifurcated mental space that Republicans have been living in politically, where they want to run against Democrats for trying to blow up the health care system and replace it with single-payer, and, on the other side, they want to get rid of much of the existing health care system and replace it with something to be named later.
KK: Oh my god, we're running out of time. We have a bunch of questions around technology. [LAUGHTER]
Senator Warren visited Beijing in 2018, as Mr. Trump was waging a tariff war on China. She criticized his chaotic foreign policy, while arguing that America cannot support an economic system more integrated with China's while it fails to respect basic human rights.
The House leadership aide said that lowering the cost of insurance was a much better way to encourage people to opt in.
• A group of financiers has teamed up with scientists to create a Manhattan Project for Covid-19, The Wall Street Journal reports, and their recommendations have gained traction at the White House.
Among other things, right? And it's why though I've tried so hard for 11 months and four days now to talk about the vision of what we can actually do and to try to make it real. Not vision in a — I'm not really a big, you know, talk about this in soaring terms. But in real terms, a 2-cent wealth tax.
On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he would remain in the job as long as that is appropriate after Mr. Trump criticized him for recusing himself in the Russia investigation.
On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., as transportation secretary for the Biden administration. Credit Credit... Pool photo by Stefani Reynolds The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, to be transportation secretary, putting in place a key emissary to President Biden as his administration seeks an ambitious overhaul of the nation's infrastructure. The confirmation, by a vote of 86 to 13, makes Mr. Buttigieg, 39, the first openly gay cabinet secretary to be confirmed by the Senate, as well as Mr. Biden's youngest cabinet member. Mr. Buttigieg's bipartisan confirmation underscored the support he has received from lawmakers in both parties as he charted a vision for infrastructure reform that aligned with Mr. Biden's goals on climate change, racial justice, job creation and economic recovery. As transportation secretary, Mr. Buttigieg will oversee an agency that employs 55,000 people and controls around $87 billion in funding at a time when the country's public transit systems are reeling from the pandemic. He is expected to play a key role in shepherding efforts by the Biden administration to push a $2 trillion infrastructure plan through Congress. At his confirmation hearing last month, Mr. Buttigieg spoke of a generational opportunity to transform infrastructure. He pledged to work with state, local and tribal leaders on transportation concerns, while trying to mitigate the effect that transportation policies have historically had on poor and minority communities.
JI: So this is an incremental plan that you've talked about, right? So your first hundred days you have essentially two health care plans, right? You have one that — would enact ——
And don't get me started on the recently signed $716 billion defense budget for the 2019 fiscal year — a spending hike so dramatic, as defense analyst Lawrence Korb pointed out, that it means since Trump took office under two years ago, the defense budget will have grown by $133 billion, or 23 percent. And there's no major war going on.
The key parts of both decisions were decided by five-justice majorities, and the chief justice was the only member of the court in both.
AK: Sure. I'm really interested in the student loan debt issue, but there's a concern that your plan to forgive student debt really tilts a lot of resources towards the wealthy. So only 2 percent of borrowers have more than $50,000 in debt. A third of all student debt is owned by people in the top income quartile, and most student debt goes to households with advanced degrees. So these are doctors and lawyers, and they've amassed a lot of debt, but they're also investing in their own educational capacity to pay off that debt. So I'm just wondering how you square that with a plan that goes about forgiving student debt?
The race even in retrospect, is a little odd, because in one way it was not tight. It was a more comfortable margin for Biden than say, the 2000 race for the Republicans. But at the same time you look at three states where if you switched what, 22,000 votes in the right places, Trump would have gotten the election kicked into the house, where Republicans would have had a majority of state delegations and he would then have won. So in that sense it was pretty tight, and you do have to look at small things that could have made a difference. So, even though most people's opinions were pretty baked in and there wasn't a whole lot of fluctuation in public opinion about Donald Trump throughout his entire presidency. I think that could have made a difference. Definitely could have made a difference in the Senate. There are a number of other things that you could point to like, what if Trump's policies on COVID had been basically the same, but he just carried on a little bit less like a maniac about it, had done the bare minimum of being a reassuring figure when he spoke about it? What if he hadn't discouraged mail-in voting? That might have been enough.
Democrats have spent much of the last two years pressing for these policies, outlining ideas in candidate platforms and fine-tuning them in congressional legislation. The House even passed a similar proposal this past summer, but none of it had a shot at becoming law with President Trump in office and a Republican majority in the Senate.
Randy Barnett, a law professor at Georgetown University and an architect of the Commerce Clause-based attack on the Affordable Care Act, put it this way in a speech last week to the Heritage Foundation titled How John Roberts Gave Us Donald Trump:
To me, then, Medicare for America — which lets people keep employment-based insurance — looks like a much better bet for actually getting universal coverage than Medicare for All. But I could be wrong! And it's fine to spend the next few months arguing the issue.
And when those questions come and the remedies are proposed, whether it's online or vote-by-mail or the like, these same struggles of power will persist. And we will see factions emerge that question whether the new systems are fair and who politically benefits from them.
I talk about Citizens United, although that one again is either going to take constitutional amendment or some change in the personnel at the Supreme Court to reslice that issue. But I think it is important to keep that one on the table. And I talk about it because when I close, I talk about why those three things are related to each other.

Under the plan discussed this week, Republicans said, repeal will be on a fast track. They hope to move forward in January or February with a budget blueprint using so-called reconciliation instructions, which would allow parts of the health care law to be dismembered with a simple majority vote, denying Senate Democrats the chance to filibuster. They would follow up with legislation similar to a bill vetoed in January, which would have repealed the tax penalties for people who go without insurance and the penalties for larger employers who fail to offer coverage.
That gets to one takeaway from the Trump years: that there's a real constituency for the white welfare state he gestured at during his campaign. It's not a majority, but our election rules (starting with the Electoral College) and the structure of our government (like equal representation of states in the Senate) make it large enough to claim and maintain real political power. And the Trump phenomenon also shows that you don't have to deliver the benefits to hold those voters in your camp. All you have to do is deliver pain to disfavored groups, to target them and make a show of it.
Michael Conway, who served as counsel for the house Judiciary Committee during the Nixon impeachment inquiry, said President Nixon also tried to deny the investigators access to key materials, but Mr. Trump has gone a step further. Mr. Conway said, Nixon was equally resistant to turning materials over and documents, but he did allow people to testify.
Over all, around 20 million Americans who wouldn't have had health insurance without the A.C.A. now do.
The repeal bill approved last month by the House would bar the use of federal tax credits to help purchase insurance plans that include coverage of abortion. But senators said that provision might have to be jettisoned from their version because of complicated Senate rules that Republicans are using to expedite passage of the bill and avoid a filibuster.
Actually, even if you leave aside the substance, this is bizarre. Do you really think that the fraction of the Republican primary electorate that selected Trump cares what New York Times columnists, me in particular, have to say — that they would have been warned off if only I had been nicer to establishment Republicans? That doesn't even rise to the level of a joke.
For example, the creation of the food stamp program didn't just make the lives of recipients a bit easier. It also had major positive impacts on the long-term health of children from poor families, which made them more productive as adults — more likely to pay taxes, less likely to need further public assistance.
NF: But it's also about the Medicare for all plan.
But the budget office pointed to another reason premiums would decline: Insurers would be allowed to offer skimpier benefits. In the absence of federal standards, the budget office said, insurance plans would cover a lower share of health care costs, on average.
No. This is on budget reconciliation.
In another wrinkle, August E. Flentje, a lawyer for the Justice Department, appeared reluctant to answer questions from Judge Elrod about how applying the ruling only to the plaintiff states would work. He was also vague about another new and surprising position the administration mentioned almost in passing in its May brief: that some pieces of the health law, though not its insurance provisions, should be preserved.
So I start with trying to understand the problem, what it means that tens of millions of people don't have prescriptions filled, don't go to the doctor. People with health insurance who are being sued by their hospitals for medical bills. I think of this as offering the most help to the greatest number of people as quickly as possible. So in terms of priorities, day one, there's a lot a president could do all by herself, and I'll do it.
And because of that, there are a bunch of proposals over the years to try to reconsider a more national health care system.
I'm eager to get to you and your folks the remainder of what I call the entire health initiative, Mr. Biden told Mr. Barkan. That goes beyond Obamacare with a public option or Medicare for all, goes beyond that in terms of a whole new care network across the board, of giving people more flexibility, allowing people to not have to make choices between their job and taking care of a parent who's dying.
The strategy of reminding voters that she was at the forefront of pushing for universal health care could help Mrs. Clinton appear more authentic as she tries to compete with a populist liberal candidate who identifies as a Democratic socialist. But the new line in her stump speech could also evoke a tumultuous period during President Bill Clinton's administration when the first lady was tasked with overhauling the health care system — and ultimately failed. Her proposals at the time aimed to provide universal health care, though they would have made employers responsible for their workers' insurance, while Mr. Sanders envisions a government-run system.
A lot of us are living like this, right? How does anyone do the stuff they want to do with their money while they're doing the stuff they need to do? It's easy to make fun of people for buying avocado toast with precious take-home pay, but what if what I'm spending isn't my mom's money? What if there's no clear path from $0 in your checking account to a down payment on a house that's fit to live in? I am sure there's a financial adviser somewhere who could use trigonometry to explain how to whittle a three-car garage out of $20,000 a year, but since I can't afford his services, I'll just be over here in the bottomless-mimosa brunch line.
The answer, judging by his words, is no differently than he did before.
Among other things, right? And it's why though I've tried so hard for 11 months and four days now to talk about the vision of what we can actually do and to try to make it real. Not vision in a — I'm not really a big, you know, talk about this in soaring terms. But in real terms, a 2-cent wealth tax.
So I have a long discussion of that episode in my book, Why We're Polarized, which makes a wonderful pairing with Adam's Kill Switch. It's like wine and cheese. And one of the things that I try to argue there and that I think is true is that it is important to step back from your outrage, if you are a liberal, about what Mitch McConnell did and just ask, what didn't make sense about the action? And one of the things that I try to show there using a fair amount of research on Supreme Court justices over time is that what had been happening for a long time predating the Merrick Garland affair is that Supreme Court nominations had gone from being relatively non-ideological, if very consequential votes, to very ideological ones. So if you look across to the 20th century, knowing which party nominated a Supreme Court justice in an age of not very polarized parties, not very ideological parties, did not tell you that much about how that justice was going to vote. You consistently had Republicans nominating justices who turned out to be very important liberals, like Earl Warren or David Souter. You had the same thing happen to Democrats a number of times. And that as the parties polarized ideologically, the rallying cry became, never again. They developed these big vetting structures, on the Republican side in particular, the Federalist Society, to make sure that the judges they nominated to the Supreme Court would be reliable, ideological partisans.
Oh, and social safety net programs can do more than limit misery: they can be liberating. I've known many people who stuck with jobs they disliked for fear of losing health coverage; Obamacare, flawed as it is, has noticeably reduced that kind of lock in, and a full guarantee of health coverage would make our society visibly freer.
You don't need to look much further than the latest far-left-leaning Democratic debate to see how uniform policy preferences have become in our two-party system. The candidates' reluctance to reject purity tests, as well as their attempts to avoid getting ratioed by their loud online base, often leads them to well-intentioned yet hard-line rhetoric and stances that are unrepresentative of even many Democratic voters.
On energy, California is a good case study. Its cap-and-trade program has been disappointing. Its performance standards have worked better. In 2005, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a moderate Republican, committed the state to reducing its carbon emissions to their 1990 level by 2020. He and state legislators later gave regulators the authority to require more clean-energy use by local utilities.
The authors liken their plan to the New Deal, but the real parallel is to World War II. It is the state mobilizing as many of society's resources as possible to wage a war on global warming and other ills. The document is notably coy about how all this would be implemented. Exactly which agency would inspect and oversee the renovation of every building in America? Exactly which agency would hire every worker?
I think his calculation was that if he confirmed a third Obama Supreme Court nominee during the year of 2016 with a presidential election in full swing, if he had been responsible for installing a third Obama nominee on the Supreme Court and the Democrats took back the Senate and Hillary won the White House, as was widely expected at the time, that McConnell would have, at the very least, had a very aggressive challenge to his leader job. At that point, Republicans would have been in the majority for only two years, been bounced right back to the minority, and seen the confirmation of three Obama Supreme Court justices. It's not a very good record for McConnell to have been running on. So it was a bold move. I don't want to take away from that. And then he proceeded to execute it and keep people in line, which took a lot of work. But essentially, what he was trying to do was block a challenge to his leadership from his right flank and secure his right flank. And it worked. It paid off massively. But I don't think even he at the time had any idea that it would pay off as much as it has.
The conventional route could be faster — but would most likely result in a smaller bill.

The answer is some, but it looks like many newly insured Americans probably won't participate in the election. The biggest reductions in the uninsured rate came among those adults who were not registered to vote or who were registered but had not voted in the last two elections. The uninsured rate declined nearly 8 percentage points among the nonregistered. Among people who were registered voters but had not voted in the last two elections, the uninsured rate fell 11 percentage points. By comparison, among the group of people who'd voted in both elections, the uninsurance rate dropped about 6 percentage points.
But the expensive Los Angeles media market includes Orange County, the former Republican stronghold that saw four of its six congressional districts flip from Republican to Democrat in 2018, turning the entire county blue.
If America were a blank slate, Medicare for all would be a plausible policy, but we are not a blank slate. At this point, the easiest way to get to a single-payer system would probably be to go back to 1776 and undo that whole American Revolution thing.
The association rule is also likely to combine with other policy changes, as Mr. Trump notes. Congress recently repealed the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate, which means that Americans who decline to buy insurance won't face a penalty, beginning next year. Another regulation is expected soon that would permit insurers to offer short-term plans for longer periods, perhaps for a year. Mr. Trump is right that the associations are part of a larger set of policies meant to chip away at Obamacare, and are likely to destabilize its markets for individual and small business insurance.

[Mr. Cohen has been duping politicians for decades. Here are his greatest hits.]
Yes. I just think it's got this — no one has to say there is a conflict of interest, and I'm not trying to talk about anyone's individual circumstances, but I think one of the things we have to deal with in public life is the appearance of conflict of interest. You know, that's supposed to be the guiding principle, for example, for judges. It's not whether or not there is a conflict of interest, it's whether or not people in the public could reasonably be concerned that it were, because it's important that you believe that judges are acting independently and not influenced because they're going to get money or someone in their family is going to get money. And so that's where I think the analogy is the closest, and whether you make it a rule of ethics or whether do you actually just make it part of the law, I think is a fair question, but I get why we should push in that direction.
He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured, O.K.? I hate to tell you.

Mr. Trump has unsettled markets with trade threats aimed at China, which The Times has editorialized against. He famously boasted Trade wars are good, and easy to win. But a recent Axios report noted that China's exports to the United States dropped 23.1 percent this year.
Mr. Obama's first reaction to the protests, people close to him said, was anxiety — that the spasms of rioting would spin out of control and play into Mr. Trump's narrative of a lawless left.
Well, I think that the bottom line is if we don't clearly define that we are not socialists, the Republicans are going to come at us every way they can and call us socialists. I disagree with both their perspectives. The debate we're having in our party right now is confusing. Because the truth is there's a big difference between capitalism on the one hand and greed on the other.
The thing is, both of these claims might well be true! A simple, single-payer system would probably have lower overall costs than a hybrid system that preserves some forms of private coverage.
That last win put me over the top, Mr. Ammiano said, and when he was told he had earned a varsity letter, Mr. Ammiano recalled, I went to seventh heaven.

Dogs, though known for their loyalty, can take only so much from one abusive human. Alas, the same cannot be said for the aging, white, rural and southern people who make up Trump's base. He can lie to them, hurt them with tariffs, make a mockery of their values, suck up to freedom-hating dictators they once distrusted, and they'll stick with him. Cult 45 is thought to be impermeable.
And he also was like a sidekick, kind of the Gilligan to John McCain's Skipper.
Two months ago, as you know, we were facing serious problems. The country was dying by inches.
As long as health insurance companies donate to politicians, we can't hope for a government that eliminates their profits. Without getting rid of for-profit health insurance, we cannot get the obscene expense of treating illness in this country down to manageable levels. In spite of Dr. Daw's optimism, we cannot transition from profitability to a system based on the values associated with compassion as long as health insurance companies continue to stand between us and the care we need to thrive.
So what do officials do in response to this severe shortage of poll workers?
Now, Republican leaders are considering a legislative effort to roll back major provisions of the health law, but the plan they're considering would keep the current system in place for at least two and possibly three more years.
I'm convinced that this is part of his obsession with former President Barack Obama. Obama was quickly granted the thing Trump never had: upper-class acceptance and adulation.
Supporters of the health care law might describe many of these changes as sabotage, and it's certainly true that many of them are not being made out of love for the law. But the changes also suggest that Republicans are belatedly engaging with the particulars of the law and its operation, cobbling together a not entirely coherent replacement on the fly.

The most closely held of the cables was intended as an update on the new Trump administration for a narrow audience of top British officials. It described the chaos inside the new administration, the concerns about the future of the Atlantic relationship and the struggle to figure out who had the president's ear.
Well, I think part of it is how much you're willing to do two things: how much you are willing to push and how much you're willing to be creative about the various ways in which it's done. You know, we did the same thing in Asia with South Korea, with Japan, about which costs the South Koreans pick up and which costs the Americans pick up. The cost of moving, the cost of consolidating the land, the cost of maintaining security around the perimeter. There are a lot of different ways that we can do this, and I think we should be doing this much more in partnership. I think hectoring them and putting their leaders in an embarrassing position domestically, for each of them, do you cave in to the United States president who is trying to throw his weight around by picking up a bigger share of the defense budget? I don't think that's a way to further success in this area.

It would substantially cut funding for Medicaid, which covers low-income Americans, and reduce the value of tax credits that individuals use to buy health insurance, pricing many out of the market.
Yeah, and I just want to hammer this home for your listeners because it's so important. The Jim Crow era is a really good period to look at because you basically had two categories of legislation that encountered the legislative process very differently. You had civil rights, and you had everything else. Civil rights encountered the requirement to clear a supermajority threshold — at the time, it was two-thirds — in the Senate in order to pass. Everything else only had to clear a majority. Civil rights didn't pass. And I think it's really important — for 87 years, every single civil rights bill that came before Congress — and there were many, from the end of Reconstruction in 1877 to the first time a Southern filibuster was broken in 1964. Every single civil rights bill that came before the Senate was systematically forced to clear a supermajority threshold. And they were unable to do it. And so, they all failed. It's not like America wasn't ready to pass civil rights. I think one of the things that we sort of look back on with rose-colored glasses is the idea that maybe America wasn't quite ready until 1964. The filibuster played its cooling saucer role and waited until the country was ready for civil rights. That's not true. There were federal anti-lynching laws. There were federal anti-poll tax laws. And there were laws to end workplace discrimination that all had majority support in the House. They passed the House. They came to the Senate.

The public option was once considered too far-reaching — champions of the idea in Congress could not muster quite enough support to include it in the Affordable Care Act in 2010. But it is now seen as a more moderate alternative to Mr. Sanders's plan, which would all but eliminate private health insurance and enroll everyone in a government-run program.
CW: Is that enough to bridge the systems, the ecosystems of misinformation, hyper-partisanship, things that are ——
A nationwide poll conducted by SurveyMonkey for The New York Times found that six in 10 Americans support a wealth tax. The slice of the electorate least likely to support it is Republican men with college degrees.
But if the court rules in the way the Justice Department has requested, the result will be a world in which it is much more difficult for individuals and small businesses to buy health insurance. The health law is complicated, with interlocking parts. It will be hard to remove just two rules from the individual market without disrupting many others.
March 4, 2020, 12:22 a.m. ET March 4, 2020, 12:22 a.m. ET Undecided until the end in Tustin, Calif. TUSTIN, Calif. — Up until the polls closed, Michael Van Duyn, a structural engineer who works in Santa Ana, was still weighing his options. I'm really on the fence, he said. Michael R. Bloomberg, he said, is successful and a capable manager, though his nondisclosure agreements don't reflect very well on him. While Bernie Sanders has been labeled a socialist, Mr. Van Duyn doesn't seen him as an evil threat. And Elizabeth Warren seems like she'd be a good mom for the country. Maybe that's what we need right now, he said. Any of them but Joseph R. Biden Jr. I just think that going forward he doesn't seem like he has a grasp of the future and where we're headed, Mr. Van Duyn said. No candidate, he added, has stated a position on infrastructure. It is one of those things that's boring to most people, he said. It's really not at the forefront of the national discussion right now. Mr. Van Duyn and about a dozen other civil engineers were at an election night happy hour hosted by the Orange County chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers, watching the results come in California style: Taco Tuesday plus beers. Sitting next to him was Josue Vaglienty, a transportation engineer who voted for Ms. Warren. He wants infrastructure to be a priority for whoever advances to the November ballot.
Is there anything wrong with that passage? The apology tour thing was a constant refrain, even though Politifact declared it pants on fire. So were the Romneycare not Obamacare and job loss things, which were equally false. So what is the assertion here? That I should not have called Romney out on lies, because that would undermine my authority when a much bigger liar came along?
Making the right choice means finding a match between your fluctuating health needs and the changing plans. It is as complicated as it sounds. Getting the best coverage for the lowest cost often requires switching plans nearly every year but very few people do this, leaving them with higher costs and less effective coverage. A study from the University of Pittsburgh, for instance, found that only 5 percent of Medicare beneficiaries in 2009 chose the cheapest plan that will cover their prescription drug needs.
Yes. I just think it's got this — no one has to say there is a conflict of interest, and I'm not trying to talk about anyone's individual circumstances, but I think one of the things we have to deal with in public life is the appearance of conflict of interest. You know, that's supposed to be the guiding principle, for example, for judges. It's not whether or not there is a conflict of interest, it's whether or not people in the public could reasonably be concerned that it were, because it's important that you believe that judges are acting independently and not influenced because they're going to get money or someone in their family is going to get money. And so that's where I think the analogy is the closest, and whether you make it a rule of ethics or whether do you actually just make it part of the law, I think is a fair question, but I get why we should push in that direction.
Unimpressed by the litany of self-justifications offered by Mr. Acosta, House Democrats are now bringing their oversight authority to bear.
Age Under Obamacare Under new plan 21 years old $1,700 $1,450 40 years old $1,700 $2,400 64 years old $1,700 $14,600
The terms of the new amendment, go something like this: States would have the option to jettison two major parts of the Affordable Care Act's insurance regulations. They could decide to opt out of provisions that require insurers to cover a standard, minimum package of benefits, known as the essential health benefits. And they could decide to do away with a rule that requires insurance companies to charge the same price to everyone who is the same age, a provision called community rating. In exchange, states would be required to set up special arrangements for high-cost patients.
I cynically said, and also good for Lindsey Graham's re-election.
Medicare for all has created deep divisions on the left, particularly over questions like: How much would it really cost? Is Senator Warren's plan for raising the money for it progressive enough? Is it politically prudent to debate the issue now?
In Nevada, the measure did get on the ballot, and the campaign in favor of it has some lessons for winning future fights. The messages were simple and powerful. They focused on the immediate benefits from clean-energy use, like fewer health problems, lower medical costs and more jobs that pay well. As Steyer said to me, If you don't talk about health issues and jobs, then you've got nothing to talk about. In one ad, a white-coat-clad doctor in Carson City describes the damage air pollution does to the lungs and brains of her patients in northern Nevada. It's just a disaster, health-wise, she says. In another ad, a woman named Jennifer Cantley becomes teary-eyed when talking about having to check the air quality each day before letting her son, who has asthma, go outside to play with his friends.
Of all Mr. Trump's grandiose claims, his pledge to restore lost manufacturing jobs remains among the most heartbreaking. Don't move. Don't sell your houses, he soothed voters in the Rust Belt town of Youngstown, Ohio, in 2017. They're all coming back, he promised of the jobs and prosperity.
A 2-cent wealth tax, and now let's talk about what kind of change we could make. Two cents, and we can do universal child care. We can put $800 billion into our public schools. We can make a federal commitment for the first time in history to public education K-12, and we can do the same thing for college, and we can cancel student loan debt, and an enormous boost to our economy.
But we know the opposite is true: Congress kept the guaranteed-issue and community-rating provisions even after it chose to deprive the mandate of any force or effect in the tax bill.
And I think a strengthening of Congress is required for a strengthening of that capacity, but that requires these supermajority institutions. So I would create a filibuster in the House before I would get rid of the one in the Senate, and it's not because my party's not in power right now. I had this view and made this argument when Republicans were in power and even pretty comfortably had majorities in both houses. I think it is very important that our system requires some cross-partisan accommodation, frustrating as it is for those of us who have policy ambitions. I think that the contribution of that to the health of our political culture is absolutely essential, especially now.
And the fraudulence of this bill aside, even serious, nonfraudulent regulation of insurance companies isn't enough in itself to provide affordable coverage for pre-existing conditions. If that's all you do, those who sign up for coverage will be a lot sicker than those who don't, which means a bad risk pool, which means high premiums. That was New York's experience: Before the A.C.A., it had strong regulations on insurers, but high premiums meant that only people with health problems bought insurance on the individual market (as opposed to getting it from their employers), and this in turn kept premiums high.
NF: Why would you think, why is that ——
For Parkland, for Orlando, for every community affected by gun violence — ending gun violence. Climate change Passing a family bill of rights that includes a national paid leave plan. Passing a middle class working families tax cut. I reject the premise, he said. We need a political revolution. The first thing I would do is make sure that we defeat Donald Trump. We've got to fix our democracy before it's too late. I would pass a $1,000 freedom dividend for every American adult. I would do a collaborative approach to climate change. The United States of America is going to be the best place in the world for a child to grow up.
House Republicans will be unveiling their replacement for the Affordable Care Act (a/k/a Obamacare) next week and the White House has been signaling that it may reveal its thoughts not long after.
The more boldly liberal solution is to create a so-called public option on the exchanges — a government insurance plan anyone could buy. In a Times op-ed today, Jacob Hacker — one of the architects of the public option — makes the case for it.
Some of her most memorable moments on the national political stage have come as she has wielded her prosecutorial skills while questioning witnesses as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Virtually every European government with 'universal' health care restricts access in one way or another to control costs, and it isn't pretty, said a Wall Street Journal editorial about the A.C.A. The Journal allowed that our system already rations health care according to people's ability to pay for it, but argued that that's how freedom works: This is true of every good or service in a free economy and a world of finite resources but infinite wants.
He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years, and then he got to a vote and he said thumbs down, Mr. Trump said on Tuesday after taking reporters' questions alongside the president of Brazil, who was at the White House for an official visit. Our country would have saved a trillion dollars and we would have had great health care.
Gail: Can you imagine running a restaurant in New York or New Jersey, waiting out the shutdown, and then discovering that you're not going to be able to reopen because places like Arizona and Texas tried to avoid suffering, and then hosted a coronavirus comeback?
KK: Why? Do you mind telling?
In years past, Obamacare was the stuff of Republican attack ads. No more.
I mean, what happened to Lindsey Graham?
WASHINGTON — Republican governors pleaded with their fellow Republicans in Congress on Thursday to give states more control over both their Medicaid programs and their individual health insurance markets as lawmakers work with President-elect Donald J. Trump to replace the Affordable Care Act.
What began as a Democratic governor and a Republican state legislature that were basically on the same page has now devolved into what is, by all accounts, a partisan bloodbath. From the moment that Evers proposes that every person would be mailed a ballot whether they ask for it or not, Republicans go haywire.
WASHINGTON — Congress's rush to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, once seemingly unstoppable, is flagging badly as Republicans struggle to come up with a replacement and a key senator has declared that the effort is more a repair job than a demolition.
Well, I'm talking, actually, about Lindsey Graham.
BA: What is the right stance?
I have not finished reading the report, but they look like they've laid out their ducks. The Trump administration evidently does not wish to put up a defense and call its own witnesses. In fact, it seems to be still in the process of trying to block witnesses from coming and block documents from exposure. Yeah. And look, I think they've got enough. And if they've got enough, it can't be that the House impeachment process is the tail that gets wagged by Donald Trump based on when he's willing to allow access to various witnesses or various documents. Not even Richard Nixon tried to stop people from testifying or tried to stop the House from getting access to documentation. So they've got what they've got. If it's enough, then go forward.
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said Thursday that addressing entitlement spending is what you need to do to fully deal with this debt crisis, though Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader from Kentucky, said he has ruled out doing so this year.
(Read more about Mr. Biden's record on the crime bill and criminal justice here, here and here.)
But the greater cause of many Republican headaches is substantive divisions within the party. Democrats' leverage on spending bills has been enhanced by the fact that a bloc of Republicans, especially in the House, generally refuse to support large, omnibus packages like the one Congress passed last month. And on issues where Republicans are capable of legislating without Democratic involvement, disagreements about how to proceed have been the major obstacle. The failed effort to repeal Obamacare using a legislative process that did not require overcoming a filibuster threat stands as the clearest casualty of Republican divisions, but it is not the only one.
We've talked about Republicans a lot here. How do you assess Joe Biden's presidency so far?
They appeared to have majority support in the Senate, and they had presidents of both parties ready to sign them. They also had massive public support. When Gallup polled federal anti-lynching laws in 1937, they found support at 72 percent, including a majority support in the South. Anti-poll tax laws also had upwards of 60 percent support. The country was ready for these civil rights laws, but because of the supermajority threshold, they didn't pass in the Senate. On the other hand, every other piece of legislation, all of the things that we passed to build post-war America, came and cleared because they had to pass only a majority threshold. They maybe every once in a while encountered a filibuster, but it was quickly resolved and they passed in a timely fashion. What we've done now is we've taken the process that we applied to civil rights during the Jim Crow era and started applying it to every other issue. And so the reason that there is gridlock on every issue you can possibly think of is that the solutions exist, but they have to clear a supermajority threshold. And so just like civil rights took 87 years to pass when the solutions existed, the country was ready for it, public support was there, that's why we're seeing climate change, income inequality, immigration, gun control, you name it, finding it impossible to clear this threshold. It's an impossible threshold to clear.
Absent a war or a natural disaster, Zucker cast around for an event that might capture the national attention. For 24 hours, the network went all-in on a cruise ship that was adrift with a broken sewage system and then devoted weeks to the mysterious disappearance of a Malaysian airplane. Don Lemon interviewed a llama in prime time.
Credit Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times President Biden, seeking to expand access to health care and strengthen the Affordable Care Act, used his executive authority Thursday to order the reopening of enrollment in the health law's marketplaces and a re-examination of Trump administration policies that undermined protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. His aim, he said in a brief signing ceremony in the Oval Office, was to undo the damage Trump has done. Mr. Biden also moved to protect reproductive rights and expand access to abortion, and took separate executive action to overturn his predecessor's restrictions on the use of taxpayer dollars for clinics that refer or counsel patients to terminate pregnancies, both in the United States and overseas. Taken together, Mr. Biden is trying to put a quick stamp on health policies that have been critical to a Democratic resurgence, especially those that back the Affordable Care Act, which he helped secure as President Barack Obama's vice president. President Donald J. Trump failed to overturn the health law, but he spent four years undermining it with a series of executive actions, including allowing the sale of cheap, short-term and small-business health plans that do not meet the law's health coverage mandates. Mr. Biden's first step is to reopen enrollment for health coverage offered through the federal marketplace created under the health law, also known as Obamacare.
James Dao: Moving from Europe to Asia, if China were to send troops, massive numbers of troops into Hong Kong, and impose a violent crackdown there similar to Tiananmen Square in 1989, what would you do as president?
This interview was conducted by the editorial board of The New York Times, which will announce its Democratic primary endorsement on Jan. 19.
The Affordable Care Act said that products called health insurance had to include a basic set of benefits, including hospital care, prescription drugs and maternity care. Those provisions have been criticized for driving up the cost of insurance and making the market too inflexible.
Lindsey Graham, as John McCain's best friend, was extremely — took great umbrage at this.
Joseph R. Biden Jr. had just been sworn in as vice president. All he needed now was a job.
Well, let's talk about that. What does it mean when a candidate for the Democratic presidential primary in this moment says Medicare for all? What are the actual proposals on the table?
Mr. Obama has lately been in close contact with his first attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., sharing his outrage over the way the current attorney general, William P. Barr, personally inspected the phalanx of federal law enforcement officers who tear-gassed demonstrators to clear the path for Mr. Trump's walk to a photo op at a historic church near the White House.
But with no guaranteed coverage and no standard premiums, it would be impossible to know whether you could buy any particular plan, or at what price. Customers would need to apply to each plan separately, filling out detailed medical histories — and in some cases submitting blood and urine samples — to find out what they would be allowed to buy. Those steps would make shopping much more difficult. Obamacare currently limits the period during the year when people are allowed to shop for insurance, meaning that customers might have to submit multiple applications at once in order to be able to buy insurance before the shopping period closed.

Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist, argued that two factors — fund-raising demands and the effect of the social media on candidates and their staff — are turning the nomination contest into some kind of purity game to see who can be the most leftist.
The exemplar remains the most powerful Montana Democrat in American history, Mike Mansfield. The longest-serving Senate majority leader, he quietly egged on his Republican counterpart, Everett Dirksen, to help pass the Great Society laws, including the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (back when, according to the 1960 census, the black population of Montana was 0.2 percent).
In fact, let me quote you a New York Times article from just last week that I thought was terrific, and that's about a 2-cent wealth tax and how it is popular across political lines and it's popular, why? Because most of America gets that they're getting cheated in this game, and you get that wherever you are on that income scale until you get up to the very top.
The government may clarify its plans in a legal brief to be filed on Monday with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Or it could simply ask the court for a three-month extension, prolonging the uncertainty.
But there is a lot of solidarity around issues of race and policing, around immigration, around gender and LGBTQ rights. And a lot of it is hollow, particularly from corporations. But that is a place where corporations are more willing to take a stand. And as that has become more the dividing line in our politics, I think that has pushed more of this realignment. I'm curious if that seems right to you.
The Democratic Party establishment wants to bring us Bernie Sanders supporters into the fold, so it urges Mr. Sanders to join the pro-Clinton, anti-Trump cause right now, not later. The Republican establishment is engaged in the very different enterprise of asking its candidate to pretend to be what he is not.
On the other side were Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers; and Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council.
During the Obama administration, Republicans talked about changing this. Senator Mitch McConnell promised that he would pass a budget every year if and when Republicans gained a Senate majority. But in 2016 there was no budget resolution at all, which led us to the unusual situation we saw last year, where there were two budget resolutions, one to set up the failed Republican health care bill and another, later in the year, to set up tax reform.
KK: Senator, a number of your opponents have proposed in various ways either new entitlements or other programs that would give cash directly to low-income families.
The health law enabled the Food and Drug Administration to consider and approve biosimilars, drugs akin to generic versions of biologic drugs, which can't be copied as precisely as typical drugs. Twenty-one biosimilar medications have been approved by the F.D.A. with the new process. Eliminating the health law could jeopardize those approvals and discourage drugmakers from investing in new biosimilar drugs.
I'll — start — I want to lie about you, that's why I ran the ad that said Mark Zuckerberg endorses Donald Trump, and they said, We'll take your money for that one, until they discovered what it actually said and said: Wait a minute. Not if you're going to talk about Mark Zuckerberg. Whoa.
Which you're saying resulted in resentment? It's the curve of rising expectations. When it's interrupted, people go nuts. After World War II, G.I.s got mortgages so they could live in the suburbs and buy a house, buy a car, then a TV. Their kids could go to college. Their grandchildren could be doctors. That was the promise of America. That promise is over. That drives people crazy, and then they target, they objectify, they need a scapegoat. So it's not just Michelle and Barack. They are part of the larger phenomenon. To go from them to Trump is a seismic revolution that is the result of a collapse of expectation.
And I don't think that the argument that therefore, we should eliminate the protections for large minorities in the rules of the Senate and allow these temporary majorities to make big changes in how we govern ourselves, it doesn't seem to me like the right way to respond to this moment of intense division. I do think that we can think about other changes in the institution, in Congress. It seems to me that, as I said, there needs to be less centralization so that more questions are on the table. I think there's room for electoral reform, for ways of expanding the electorate, and that would help both parties in ways that I think are not entirely clear right now to both parties' politicians. The 2020 elections has a lot of lessons on that front. It turned out, there were 10 million more Republican voters than the Republican Party thought there were, and it was only mail-in voting that brought them out. I think there are ways of bringing more people into the system that could allow us to break the logjam, in some respects. But to focus on the fact of minority protections on the limits on majoritarianism as the key that holds us back from having a clearer set of political divisions or a dominant political majority or a clear direction for the country, I don't think that's really how the causation flows here.
The president's blunt remarks came in response to a reporter's question about his recent attacks on the Republican war hero who represented Arizona, and who died last year of brain cancer.
It was just like, O.K., I voted for your guys. What's going on here? I was furious for the way the guy was treated. I've had a very fixed view about the law. I mean, that's been my link. And I just think I don't want to ruin the judiciary because we can't get along up here.
But Bannon — Bannon is right about the Democrats. But if Trump is the one talking about race, that doesn't help him. Right? I mean we went through this with the midterm elections. Trump went out and talked up the border caravan and how the Democrats were going to let illegal aliens into the country as his closing argument. And there's no evidence that it worked. Trump is helped when the media elevates Ilhan Omar or A.O.C. as the face of the Democratic Party because they are far left. And I think most voters aren't remotely close to where they are. But if Trump is the one doing race talk, I think he's losing.
It was just like, O.K., I voted for your guys. What's going on here? I was furious for the way the guy was treated. I've had a very fixed view about the law. I mean, that's been my link. And I just think I don't want to ruin the judiciary because we can't get along up here.
Well, I'll start with 43 million Americans who are dealing with student loan debt. And not all of them are having trouble, but a whole, whole bunch of them are. Or how about the parents of 12 million children who are struggling to find child care? And I'm not just talking about one narrow slice. I'm talking about a whole bunch of parents across a wide range of ZIP codes and income categories who are struggling. I'm talking about the 36 million Americans last year who didn't have prescriptions filled because they simply couldn't afford it. Or the 35 million Americans who didn't go have a lump checked out at the doctor, or some other medical condition, because they were afraid they couldn't afford the — and these are people, most of them, many of them, with insurance, right? Couldn't afford the co-pay, couldn't afford the deductible. I think people are feeling this in their lives right now. And what is the spark, which is what I hear your question to be? It's you show them a path out. It doesn't have to be this way. Can I just say, the first time I think I came to The New York Times was during the financial crisis.
And so, finally we're here. And, I think, a kiddo in the background. What's your favorite children's book?
Oklahoma was also the first state to ask the Trump administration for permission to convert its Medicaid program to block grant funding, an idea strongly pushed by Mr. Trump's health appointees. The state would receive a lump-sum payment from the federal government to run the program with additional flexibility. Opponents of that proposal worry that such a funding formula could struggle to keep up with increased enrollment in an economic downturn.
Times reporting from Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley found that Senator Warren's wealth tax plan has broad support, including from 77 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of Republicans, with the exception of one demographic: Republican men with college degrees.
The case could have major political implications because the results sought by the Republican states and the Trump administration would cause substantial disruptions. According to estimates from the Urban Institute, around 20 million more Americans would become uninsured because of the elimination of the law's coverage expansions and protections for Americans with pre-existing health conditions.
I think it's a good place to come to a close here, so let me move to our recommendation section and I'll start with this. If I want to understand where the Republican Party is going, who are some folks I should be reading?
Both Trump and Clinton have bad answers on taxes. A starting point: End step-up basis and tax capital gains & earned income equally. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
Reed: Some of that problem with high prices was supposed to be solved by more competition among health insurance companies. Which gets to the second important change, I think: adding a Medicare-like public plan in areas of the country where there remain too few companies offering plans on the state marketplaces. (I notice the president didn't dwell on the increasing number of failures among the co-ops, the nonprofit insurers created by the law to serve as something akin to the so-called public option.)
The government may clarify its plans in a legal brief to be filed on Monday with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Or it could simply ask the court for a three-month extension, prolonging the uncertainty.
But an effective speech is not the same thing as an effective agenda, and right now there are no prospects for Trump's popular ideas getting enacted or even really considered on the Hill. His party's ideologues don't want them, the opposition party doesn't want to make a deal with Trump to get them, and his White House doesn't actually have any detail behind the rhetoric. The ideas are just things that the president would probably like to do but that someone will talk him out of, or that he'll forget about, or that he'll offer in a halfhearted way and that Congress will never bother to take up.
The reconciliation process allows Congress to advance certain spending and tax bills on a simple majority vote, freeing lawmakers from the 60-vote threshold most legislation must meet to be considered. Since 1980, the first year the process was put in place, 21 reconciliation bills have been enacted into law. Initially envisioned as a mechanism for lowering the deficit, it was used most recently by Republicans to push through President Donald J. Trump's tax overhaul and in a failed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Here are four important things to know about the process, and how Democrats might use it: Budget reconciliation allows Congress to change taxes or spending, usually with a simple majority vote.
We have a very active flu season, more active than most, he said It's looking like it's heading to 50,000 or more deaths — not cases, 50,000 deaths. Which is — that's a lot. And you look at automobile accidents, which are far greater than any numbers we're talking about. That doesn't mean we're going to tell everybody, 'No more driving of cars.' So we have to do things to get our country open.
Donald Trump has been too erratic and undisciplined to take welfare chauvinism as far as it could probably go. But it is almost certainly true that somewhere in American politics, there's someone who has paid attention to what Trump has discovered and is planning accordingly.
There was the time this month when Taylor Swift announced she would air her City of Lover concert on television. The time that the cast of The Office reunited for an 18-minute-long Zoom wedding. And the time last month that the Pentagon posted three videos that showed unexplained aerial phenomena.
What is your position on reparations? I do believe that it's impossible for any rational person not to understand the cost of 400 years of slavery and then another century of Jim Crow. We have to find ways to compensate for that cost. Affirmative action, to me, is a form of reparations. So is health care — Obamacare or a variant. And there's reform of public education. One of the most radical things we could do to reform public-school education would be to equalize the amount of money spent per student in every school. That is never going to happen, but that would constitute a radical shift. Those are my three big principles of reparations, and two of the three affect poor people in general. But I'm a scholar of African and African-American history. There were palpable costs to antiblack racism that have had profound effects on the state of black America. These effects are cumulative, and somebody has to do something about it.
The need to protect people with existing medical conditions from discrimination by insurers was a central theme in the midterm elections, and Democrats attributed much of their success in reclaiming control of the House of Representatives to voters' desire to safeguard those protections. Many Republicans also promised to keep this provision of the law, although exactly how was unclear. Before the law, some individuals were sent to high-risk pools operated by states, but even that coverage was often inadequate.
It would seem as if safe voting and public health would be an issue in which partisanship would be left to the side and that Democrats and Republicans can agree on the best way to move forward. But in Wisconsin, there is no issue in which that can be left aside. What we see is a state that has become so deeply wrested by Republican control that even something like safe voting turns into a mud fest. And for this governor, for the Democratic governor Tony Evers, that's been clear since the day he was elected.
Many of us are sitting ducks who are still susceptible to second waves, he said.
But there is no magical fix for Obamacare. Our health care system is a messy hybrid of the public and private sectors. Obamacare eschewed radical change — which would have been even less popular, given the disruptions — for progress within the current framework. And the law has done far more good than bad, by expanding insurance coverage and helping slow the growth of medical costs.
And I know it's tough between here and there. I was in a very tough primary back in 2012 and I wasn't in any primary at all in 2018, so those are my two electoral experiences.
The judge had been skeptical of the administration's defense of the program from the beginning and made an crucial earlier decision to grant the House standing to sue. Courts have historically avoided being caught in the middle of fights between the legislative and executive branches.
Because for me, they all are about a central question and that's: Who's going to get opportunity in this country going forward? Will opportunity be reserved just for those born into privilege? Or will opportunity be something that we say as a country, we're willing to make some hard choices to invest, so that all of our kids get those opportunities?
Over the past week, several teams of scientists have sounded the alarm that the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines seem to be slightly less potent against the variant in South Africa, although they still successfully neutralized the virus. The vaccines were just as effective against the variant identified in Britain as against previous forms of the virus. Dr. Ho's study confirmed those findings. It has not yet been peer-reviewed for publication, and was posted to the online server BioRxiv. The new research does not have an immediate effect in the United States, because neither of those variants is known to be widespread in the country, Dr. Ho said. Just one infection with the variant from Brazil has been found, in Minnesota, and no cases of the variant from South Africa have been identified. But the United States analyzes too few viral samples to be absolutely certain the variants are not already circulating here, Dr. Ho said. In the future, new versions of the virus, including some that evade vaccines and monoclonal antibodies, will undoubtedly emerge, he added. We've got to expect more of this, because so many people are infected with this virus, he said. The virus has so many chances to mutate.
In a statement, Johnson insisted he remained in charge of the British government, but said he had deputized his foreign minister to act in his place when necessary. Meanwhile, Iran, an epicenter of the virus in the Middle East, said it would lift a nationwide shutdown of businesses and allow the majority of its workforce to return to work later this week.
By backing a flimsy, state-initiated lawsuit to throw out the entirety of the Affordable Care Act, President Trump has made himself and Republican candidates in 2020 vulnerable to attacks that they want to take health insurance away from millions of people.
All the likely Democratic presidential nominees are on board with expanding coverage, but they disagree on the path forward. Some favor allowing people to buy into the existing Medicare system. Others support the idea of Medicare for all, but disagree on whether it would be a comprehensive single-payer system and what role private insurance would play. The focus on expanding access has left little room for discussion of the frustrations embedded in the current system.
He went on to veto that program, after the legislature secured its funding.
Then he went further, pointing to 100,000 deaths as the number against which to judge him.

Across the country, Republicans have been facing crowds demanding to know how they will protect the 20 million Americans who gained health insurance thanks to the Affordable Care Act, and will lose it if the act is repealed. And after all that inveighing against the evils of Obamacare, it turns out that they've got nothing.
How Has the Pandemic Changed Your Taxes? Will stimulus payments be taxed? Nope. The so-called economic impact payments are not treated as income. In fact, they're technically an advance on a tax credit, known as the Recovery Rebate Credit. The payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague Ann Carrns wrote. Read more. Are my unemployment benefits taxable? Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction? Probably not, unless you're self-employed, an independent contractor or a gig worker.
To the Editor: This is some of the nuttiest, ill-thought-out political rationalizing I have ever seen. According to this article, Republicans plan to strip out the mandate and tax penalties in Obamacare, leaving the remainder to deal with later.
Our current institutions, particularly our Republican institutions, are failing. We need better ones. We need them quickly. As always, my email is ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. Here's Yuval Levin. So how do you describe what the Republican Party is right now?
But the deep cuts enshrined in the budget's numbers are not consistent with modest tweaks. Taken together with Medicaid changes recommended elsewhere in the budget, the proposal would strip about $1 trillion out of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's premium subsidies, the two pillars of the law's expansion of insurance coverage. By 2029, the cuts to those programs in Mr. Trump's budget would represent around 85 percent of the total that the Congressional Budget Office estimates would otherwise be spent on Obamacare coverage that year.
If the Republican agenda is so unpopular, how does the party win elections? Partly by lying about its policies. But mainly the G.O.P.'s political achievements depend on identity politics — white identity politics. Exploiting racial resentment to capture white working-class voters, while pursuing policies that benefit only the wealthy, has been the core of the party's political strategy for decades. That's why, in an increasingly diverse country, Republican support has stayed overwhelmingly white.
The Trump administration formally declared its opposition to the entire Affordable Care Act on Wednesday, arguing in a federal appeals court filing that the signature Obama-era legislation was unconstitutional and should be struck down.
I want to key in on that, because I think that's a really interesting way of putting that. So, let's go back to Rubio and Lee here. What they say in their statement about the Romney plan and I'm paraphrasing this but I'm getting it mostly right is to say, to be a pro-family party is to be a pro-work party. And they mean here, as you just said, paid work. Now, most parents want to get paid for their work. Even if the Romney plan passed, you'd be getting a very small amount of money from the government to stay home with children. It's not the amount of money you need to even be above the poverty line with a couple of kids. And so to make that decision in the ways people would, would tend to mean — and I've done reporting on cases like this. It tends to mean people have sick parents of their own, children with disabilities, they have a terrible boss, or a hellish commute, they have their own mental health issues. People don't want to live in poverty for no reason, despite what Paul Ryan used to say about government being a hammock, not a safety net. It's horrible to just be on social insurance.
It's always possible that the president will confound the naysayers and emerge from what he has called his little squabble with China with some big-picture successes. Alternatively, this folly could wind up wreaking global havoc well beyond the economic sphere.
Democrats want universal coverage, but actually most of the roughly 28 million uninsured Americans are already eligible for public coverage or an employer plan. That's not true of 2.5 million people who live in states that have not yet expanded Medicaid and have incomes below the federal poverty line. They are ineligible for the A.CA.'s subsidies and can't afford to buy coverage on their own. Republicans should embrace a compromise that allows the non-expansion states to expand Medicaid eligibility to 100 percent of the federal poverty line instead of 138 percent as required by the A.C.A. The expansion states could stay at 138 percent if they wanted to. States should also be given more flexibility to run the program with less federal interference in return for accepting limits on overall spending.
But peaceful demonstrators took control, igniting a national movement that challenged Mr. Trump without making him its focal point.
SS: The Obama administration tried that, Trump administration tried that in different ways, but no results. What kind of leverage would you use? What would you do?
Because for me, they all are about a central question and that's: Who's going to get opportunity in this country going forward? Will opportunity be reserved just for those born into privilege? Or will opportunity be something that we say as a country, we're willing to make some hard choices to invest, so that all of our kids get those opportunities?
WASHINGTON — The Republican-led House of Representatives won a significant victory over the Obama administration on Thursday when a Federal District Court judge in Washington ruled that the Department of Health and Human Services did not have the authority to spend billions of dollars on a key element of the new health care law.
But the greater cause of many Republican headaches is substantive divisions within the party. Democrats' leverage on spending bills has been enhanced by the fact that a bloc of Republicans, especially in the House, generally refuse to support large, omnibus packages like the one Congress passed last month. And on issues where Republicans are capable of legislating without Democratic involvement, disagreements about how to proceed have been the major obstacle. The failed effort to repeal Obamacare using a legislative process that did not require overcoming a filibuster threat stands as the clearest casualty of Republican divisions, but it is not the only one.
Mr. Trump isn't the first to mount a pressure campaign on NATO member states to increase their contributions. President Bush used a summit in Latvia in 2006 to urge other nations to raise their military spending, and President Obama echoed the plea at a 2014 conference in Brussels. Mr. Trump, though, has made spending levels a more central issue.
Mr. Spicer demurred when asked to provide proof that anyone other than Russia attempted to sway the election. He also declined to say whether Mr. Trump accepted the finding that the Russians were not merely trying to meddle but were actively working on his behalf in an effort to defeat Mrs. Clinton.
Re Trump Administration Asks Supreme Court to Strike Down Affordable Care Act (nytimes.com, June 26):
If you are a giant multinational corporation and any regulation comes along that you don't like, the local country raises the minimum — we've actually seen this — raises its environmental standards, you get to sue them to get them to drop those standards. And who will your case be heard by? It'll be heard by a handful of corporate lawyers, who when they're not sitting on this arbitration panel are working for big law firms that are doing work for you or other multinational corporations like you. That's one set of how the path will run.
JI: Let me try to frame it a different way. What do you say to critics who would argue that it will take so much political capital just to enact the first portion of this plan, the aggressive public option that you've laid out, that it would be essentially impossible to then segue to a Medicare for all? You'll spend so much capital getting that first part that it seems — people have said it seems like a pipe dream to say we're going to have this aggressive public option, and then we're going to have Medicare for all three years later.
Under the current rule, issued in late 2016 by the Obama administration, short-term insurance cannot last for more than three months, as it was meant to be a stopgap. Under the new rule, the limit would be 364 days, and insurers would be allowed, but not required, to extend policies. The maximum duration, including any extensions, would be 36 months.
Well, maybe when I get elected, you can come and help me figure out what's enough, Mr. Biden told him.
I would go further and argue that it is the Trump persona so vilified in the media that has in fact made bolder, more sweeping reforms possible than would have been conceivable under almost any other Republican who might have been elected.
It may, however, depend on whether Americans' incomes and living standards are consistently rising.
Actually, I don't think of what I say that way. What I think of is the leadership possibilities that the candidates for president are offering. I don't know anybody who sits around and says, I want to make peace with corruption. I don't know where those people are in America who think it's O.K. that Amazon makes $11 billion and pays nothing in taxes. I haven't seen those people. Now, maybe they just stay away from me, but I don't think so. I think —
Many had already sent letters to Republican lawmakers urging them not to repeal the law before approving a replacement plan, and in comments after Thursday's session they focused on the details of what that replacement plan should be.
Peter Thiel, an early Facebook investor, called Senator Warren dangerous, to which Senator Warren responded good. Mr. Zuckerberg said a Warren presidency would suck for the company, according to audio leaked and reported in The Verge.
I went to Washington. I came here to New York to talk to people about the idea for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and I heard two things over and over and over. Part one, that's a great idea. It would actually make a real difference. That would be structural change, or as I now say, big structural change, in financial services. And part two, don't even try, because you'll be up against the big banks. You'll be up against Wall Street. You'll be up against all of the Republicans. You'll be up against half the Democrats. You'll never get it done. But we did get it done.
The news signaled that Biden and other leaders may encounter diminished resistance from big business as they try to shift away from fossil fuels in a last-ditch effort to fight back the most perilous effects of climate change. A move away from the combustion engine would rattle the oil and gas industry but greatly reduce carbon emissions.

Why is defending the Affordable Care Act in the Supreme Court hard? That's what lawyers are for, sure. That's a legal issue, and they've got a whole bunch of lawyers in the federal government.
And one problem with that is that it pushes Congresses towards just doing these weird budget reconciliation bills because they can get them done, even with a narrow majority, and away from trying to figure out how to actually do things about these other issues that people really want to see change and experimentation on. So I always think that social conservatives should be much more upset about the filibuster than they are because their issues are consistently down-weighted because they can't clear a filibuster from Democrats in the Senate. And so instead, it's like the Club For Growth side of the party that gets tried out because at least I can go through budget reconciliation. On the Democratic side, you could potentially do things like $1,400 checks, a big expansion of the child tax credits — all really, really important — but you can't do democracy reform. There's a lot of things on green energy you can't do. And so there is also this warping away from experimentation but also away from whole issue areas that probably, at this point, really, really need to be pushed out of the realm of symbolic argumentation and into the realm of, well, do you actually have an idea, Josh Hawley and the Republican Party, about how you want to regulate tech companies? Do you actually want to get rid of Section 230? Do you want to do any of these things? Do you want to change something about moral regulations in this country?
Senator Warren visited Beijing in 2018, as Mr. Trump was waging a tariff war on China. She criticized his chaotic foreign policy, while arguing that America cannot support an economic system more integrated with China's while it fails to respect basic human rights.
In practice, though, with virtually everything a candidate says now recorded for posterity, it has become increasingly difficult to evade past statements.
Seriously, a lot of people both in this administration and in Congress simply feel no empathy for the poor. Some of that lack of empathy surely reflects racial animus. But while the war on the poor will disproportionately hurt minority groups, it will also hurt a lot of low-income whites — in fact, it will surely end up hurting a lot of people who voted for Trump. Will they notice?

The program still faces threats, most significantly the Trump administration lawsuit to overturn the health law. The Department of Justice, alongside a coalition of 20 Republican-controlled states, submitted briefs to the Supreme Court last week arguing that the recent repeal of the individual mandate, which required all Americans to carry health coverage or pay a fine, made the entire law unconstitutional.

Image Representative Kay Granger at a subcommittee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. Credit... T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times Representative Kay Granger, Republican of Texas, fended off the most expensive and brutal challenge of her political career. Her opponent, Chris Putnam, a former technology executive backed by more than $1 million in spending, had attacked her for voting on massive spending bills and failing to show unwavering loyalty to President Trump. But shortly before midnight on the East Coast, Ms. Granger received a call from Mr. Putnam conceding the race, her campaign staff said. The primary in her district, Texas's 12th, is all but guaranteed to decide the general election's outcome. In the Texas Senate race, M.J.

The court granted requests from Democratic state officials and House members who wanted to thrust the fate of the Affordable Care Act into the public eye just as Americans prepare to vote this November. The Supreme Court did not say when it would hear the case, but under its ordinary practices, arguments would be held in the fall and a decision would land in the spring or summer of 2021.
Fourth, McCain understood that democracy sometimes means moving on. He voted against Obamacare — a reflection of his small-government conservatism. But he also voted, crucially, against its repeal — a reflection of his small-c conservatism. In doing so, he acted as a modern-day Eisenhower, a Republican willing to accept an expansion of the safety net for the good of the country.

Look, we can work — and this is what we should have done. We should have been pushing for negotiations with Turkey, with our allies, in order to protect the Kurds. And we could do that or could have done this as part of withdrawal. We could use economic pressure, we can use diplomatic pressure. We can use coalescing with our allies in order to bring pressure to protect the Kurds, and I think that's what we should have done. We've already abandoned the Kurds in the worst possible way and sent a huge signal to the rest of the world that the United States, at least under the Trump administration, is not a reliable ally.
But that's my point. It doesn't. That's what I just said.
So far in this election cycle, AAN has given more than $19 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC with which it shares an address and staff, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. The fund recently ran ads opposing Democratic candidates in high-profile special congressional elections in Georgia and Pennsylvania.
Meanwhile, the thing that the bill's centrist critics are most incensed about, the fiscal irresponsibility of cutting taxes without offsets, just doesn't look like that big a deal in the context of continued low interest rates and bond market unconcern. Like many people I accepted the arguments of fiscal hawks in the early Obama years, but few-to-none of their predictions have come to pass. I don't think Republicans have really learned from this experience and become less alarmist about deficits; they're mostly just being opportunists and hypocrites. But the experience is still real, and the lesson that the deficit is not, in fact, our major near-term problem seems convincing.

NATO members agreed, in 2014, to a goal of spending 2 percent of their G.D.P. on defense, but in 2017 the only countries to meet that goal were America, Britain, Greece, Poland and Estonia. Mr. Trump chastised fellow member states at a 2017 summit, declaring that 23 of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should.
Unfortunately, what looks good on TV isn't necessarily good for America, or the world.
The Obama rule has been tied up in litigation for several years, and the Trump administration has declined to enforce it, citing a court ruling from a judge in Fort Worth. That means that the final rule does not have any immediate practical effects. Other courts that considered identical legal questions found in favor of the Obama administration's interpretation.
But I take your question seriously. The place I might be most likely to fail is to get only part. Now, part's better than none, right? But only part. And that's a deeply worrisome thought.

Some of the Democratic candidates have been more forthright in their criticism of Hunter Biden's role at the Ukrainian gas concern; others have been cagier. Senator Cory Booker, when asked about the controversy, said I just don't think children of vice presidents, presidents, during the administration should be out there doing that. Senator Warren, on the other hand, has said: I don't know. I mean I'd have to go back and look at the details.
And conservative writers including Philip Klein of the Washington Examiner and the Cato Institute's Michael Cannon have criticized the lawsuit. The headline on Klein's piece is: I hate Obamacare, but Texas judge's decision on its unconstitutionality is an assault on the rule of law.

And so there, I think what has traditionally happened in this country, the way narrow majorities sometimes became durable majorities, the way that a consensus changed was that big policies were passed, and those big policies changed the landscape. The Democratic majority in the 20th century comes out of the New Deal. The Republican majority before that comes out of the Civil War, so that's an ugly example that I prefer we don't have to go back to bloodshed. But I think it is healthy for there to be actually a fair amount of policy churn and then people can decide where they want to stand. And in part, I take your point actually quite seriously, that there is a concern about narrow majorities creating legislation that is profound and far reaching. But at the same time, if they create legislation people don't like, they won't be a majority anymore, and they'll hopefully learn their lesson. Or if they create legislation people love, maybe they do become a durable majority. But at some point, there has to be, it seems to me, more of a feedback loop, in which the public gets something akin to what they ask for and then they can hold leaders accountable for that. As opposed to the public repeatedly doesn't get what they ask for, it's not clear who to hold accountable for that, and so then you're just in this miasma of which side seems to allied with you in some spiritual, fundamental, identitarian way.
Mr. Barr quoted the special counsel as stating that while this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him, and wrote that Mr. Mueller did not draw conclusions about whether Mr. Trump's conduct amounted to obstruction of justice.
Democrats have spent much of the last two years pressing for these policies, outlining ideas in candidate platforms and fine-tuning them in congressional legislation. The House even passed a similar proposal this past summer, but none of it had a shot at becoming law with President Trump in office and a Republican majority in the Senate.
Parties' Leaders Work to Rein In Their Renegades (front page, June 9) seeks, perhaps in the interest of a false equivalence, to liken the Democrats' effort to achieve unity with the Republicans' effort to transmogrify their fascism-flirting candidate.
Which is why, for all these ideas, if you ask Republican politicians what they stand for when it comes to health policy, you are likely to hear slogans like patient centered and preserving the doctor-patient relationship and possibly something about how Democrats want to socialize Medicare — as if the nation's largest government health program is not already an essentially socialist enterprise.
But that's my point. It doesn't. That's what I just said.
Seriously, it's striking how many of the payments the federal government is or soon will be failing to make are for things libertarians insist we shouldn't have been spending taxpayer dollars on anyway.
KK: Well, it has to come to the Senate floor. I mean, Mitch McConnell already has an anti-corruption, election reform bill [passed by the House].
Well, I think there's this strange and amorphous thing in a free society called the mainstream culture. And the mainstream culture is that part of the culture that doesn't take itself to be explicitly on one side or another but that it's just the arena in which a lot of our arguments happen and a lot of our public life happens. And I think what we've found in the last more than half century is certainly a transformation of a lot of mainstream institutions in the direction of the left. Now, that's happened in the culture, in Hollywood, music. I think you could certainly see that happening in mainstream journalism, where a lot of the core mainstream institutions are just more expressly on the left than they used to be. And creating alternatives to these is quite a challenge. There's certainly a lively think-tank culture on the right in Washington, but it's a tiny culture. I mean, the think-tank culture, in general, is quite small. And the right has always had some presence in that culture because, in some ways, think tanks have always been more on the right or more on the left. And AEI is not a new institution in response to the contemporary changes in political culture. It was created in the 1930s. And so it has been very hard to actually create alternative institutions at the core. To start a new elite university is not a simple matter. It's not unimaginable. There are people who have thought about it.
So let me explain what the plan is. The plan is the employer has to keep paying in as the employer does right now. The one exception to that is if you have a collective bargaining agreement, and the employer is paying in more than whatever is the standard minimal that employers are paying in. That difference goes to the workers in cash.

His plan is cheap because it has a high deductible — $6,900 a year. Worse, if his unemployment benefits expire before he finds a new job, and his income drops below the poverty line, he will lose his premium subsidies and will no longer be able to afford the plan. But because of a quirk in the law, he would not be eligible for Medicaid in that situation, because North Carolina has not expanded the program to cover many low-income men.

In terms of your own writing, you're a long way from the guy who made his name with a dense academic book like The Signifying Monkey. Something like Stony the Road is written in much simpler language with much less jargon. How do you make sense of that evolution? The Signifying Monkey is my tenure book. I was just trying to get tenure. I was trying to be a bridge between the black tradition and poststructuralism and deconstruction. Then I got tenure, and as far as the evolution of my own prose, once you get tenure, you could write films, you could do anything. A crucial point came when I gave a lecture at Howard University. A friend of mine invited me down to deliver my essay called Binary Oppositions in Chapter 1 of 'Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass.' I thought I was introducing structuralism.

I have an ego. I want the audience to be with me. That's what you see in my evolution.

Trump says Obamacare is a disaster. It has problems, but the bottom line is that net 20 million more Americans have health insurance now. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
This may have spelled the end of a certain mode of reform, but it did little to change reform's association with progressives and liberals — even when it was taken up by their opponents. In 1955, the historian Richard Hofstadter published a book whose title named the period from the 1890s through the 1940s The Age of Reform. He accepted as axiomatic that reformers came from the side of the left in American history. Still, he noted, there was now a tendency among conservative politicians to claim reform and reformer as gauzy, feel-good labels. We usually reserve our highest acclaim for the politician who has in him a touch of the liberal reformer, Hofstadter wrote. As a result, any talented conservative politician learned how to exert his maximal influence by using the rhetoric of progressivism and winning the plaudits of the reformers — while otherwise working against what most progressives would want.

There were responsible ways to cut taxes on things we want more of — like corporate investment — while boosting them on things we want less of — like carbon, reckless financial speculation and diabetes — that could have stimulated jobs and growth but also left us more financially and environmentally resilient. But both Trump and the anonymous-G.O.P. crowd rejected them, just as they rejected smart improvements to Obamacare, preferring a total scrapping.
Brent Staples: But she needed the Triangle Shirtwaist fire. What is the contemporary equivalent of the Shirtwaist fire?
The Democratic setup is more evenhanded than the Republican debates in 2015, when lower-ranking contenders were relegated to what was unkindly known as the kids' table. Afterward, many of them vanished from view forever. However, Rick Santorum is still around, now busy promoting the idea of a Catholic cryptocurrency. And Rick Perry is one of the few early Trump cabinet members who has not had to resign to spend more time with his family.
The new rule is presented as a redefinition of short-term, limited-duration insurance. But it stretches the common understanding of those terms, and some of the new policies could be an attractive option for healthier consumers who now pay high prices for major medical coverage and are willing to take more risk in return for lower prices.
Well, I'm not sure I accept the premise of the question, that they actually tried what I was talking about. Look, our No. 1 leverage is everybody wants the American consumer. They want access to the American consumer. They want to be able to sell us all of their stuff because the American consumer is not only the engine of about 70 percent of our economy; it's a worldwide engine. So I think it's perfectly reasonable to say, if you want to be able to trade with United States on the best possible terms, then everybody needs to raise their standards just a little. Who wants to do that?
Then he took me to the place right off the Oval Office, and we had lunch. And we talked for an hour. And he really seemed to care what I think, what I thought. And he said, I know we've had our differences, but I'd like you to help me. I said, I'll be glad to help you where I can, Mr. President. I want you to be successful.
It was a big political discussion in a very small room.
And do you know if McCain essentially blessed this or said, I understand, Lindsey?
It redoubles the loyalty of some part of his base. But if we assume his base is 45 percent of the country, then after Charlottesville his approval rating went down into the mid- to low 30s. So there's a big chunk of his base that I think believes in the Trump is a populist fighting for you message, and doesn't like the bigotry, and doesn't like the racism. So I think it's a big mistake to attribute these sort of multidimensional, chess-move brilliance to Trump's move here. What actually happened was that the Democratic Party was tearing itself apart because Nancy Pelosi and the leftward fringe in Congress can't get along with each other. And Trump saw a political scrum and wanted to jump in it because that's what he does. I expect his approval ratings to go down after this. We'll see what happens.
This is the party of Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt. It is the party that built interstate highways, championed family planning, founded the Environmental Protection Agency, opened relations with China, confronted the Soviet Union and managed the collapse of Communism.

Look what Frances Perkins got accomplished, first in Albany, but then when she went down to Washington. So here's a woman, she goes to Albany at a time when women don't even have the vote and gets herself appointed the head of a fire commission. And by the way, every time you see one of those lit-up fire exit signs, thank Frances Perkins, O.K.? But she not only does that, she then immediately expands it into labor law and workers and worker safety and worker protection overall. As you know, she then goes down to Washington, becomes the first woman cabinet official, and look at what she gets done in a short period of time. Social security, minimum wage, right to join a union, end of child labor, the weekend, my personal favorite [LAUGHTER], that Saturdays and Sundays are not treated like Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. But think about it that way. So we start with the corruption. That's what Perkins started with. She started by outing the corruption.

The 2017 tax cut, which did away with the individual mandate — the penalty for noninsurance — weakened the system; you can see this by the fact that states, like New Jersey, that imposed their own mandates saw a drop in insurance premiums. But the design of the subsidies, which insulated most people from rising premiums, contained the damage: The percentage of Americans without health insurance, which fell sharply as a result of Obamacare, remains near record lows.
Exactly when the health care vote will occur is not yet clear. The current version of the compromise bill strips away minimum requirements for coverage, like maternity care, hospitalization and prescriptions.
WASHINGTON — About 6.4 million people have signed up for health insurance next year under the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration said Wednesday, as people rushed to purchase plans regardless of Republican promises that the law will be repealed within months.
The news signaled that Biden and other leaders may encounter diminished resistance from big business as they try to shift away from fossil fuels in a last-ditch effort to fight back the most perilous effects of climate change.

Biden plans to reopen Obamacare exchanges in many states. President Biden spoke about his plans for the Affordable Care Act in November. Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times The Biden administration plans to reopen enrollment in many of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, both to help those who may have lost health insurance during the pandemic and to offer coverage to those who did not have any and now want it. The move will be announced on Thursday as part of an executive order describing administration policies on shoring up health insurance coverage, according to three people familiar with the details. The so-called special enrollment period is intended to help people who have lost coverage in the past year, but it will be open to those who want health insurance for any reason, in the 36 states that use Healthcare.gov. The decision was reported earlier by The Washington Post. Typically, Americans without a special circumstance can buy Obamacare insurance only during a six-week period in the fall, a restriction meant to encourage people to hold coverage even when they are healthy. The sign-up period for this year's coverage ended in mid-December, with enrollments only slightly higher than they were last year. But the Trump administration did little to advertise it. The Biden administration plans to have a large marketing campaign to announce the new opportunity and encourage people to enroll in health plans, two of the people said.

Look, we can work — and this is what we should have done. We should have been pushing for negotiations with Turkey, with our allies, in order to protect the Kurds. And we could do that or could have done this as part of withdrawal. We could use economic pressure, we can use diplomatic pressure. We can use coalescing with our allies in order to bring pressure to protect the Kurds, and I think that's what we should have done. We've already abandoned the Kurds in the worst possible way and sent a huge signal to the rest of the world that the United States, at least under the Trump administration, is not a reliable ally.

The White House suffered a staff turnover rate of 34 percent during Mr. Trump's first year, a rate that would be unfathomable at nearly any for-profit enterprise. Even by political standards, it's off the charts — triple that of the Obama administration, and twice that of Ronald Reagan, the previous record-holder — according to a study by the Brookings Institution.
But even if optimistic claims about Medicare for All are true, will people believe them? And even if most people do, if a significant minority of voters doesn't trust the promises of single-payer advocates, that could easily either doom Democrats in the general election or at least make it impossible to get their plan through Congress.

In an interview, James Taylor, who wrote the Heartland critique, drew a direct line between problems he saw in the modeling of Covid-19 deaths and climate science, arguing that in both instances we don't have perfect information with which to make projections. The coronavirus models' failure to make accurate predictions to this point should be instructive when we are told to blindly accept certain climate models, he said.
What a wonderful segue to something I wanted to speak to you about. So I wrote a piece, it came out in Sunday Review a week or two ago now, that is all about this question of how do you reorient politics around a politics, as you put it, of what we do. And my argument, and this was framed in the structure of advice to the Democratic Party, was that they need to get rid of the filibuster, which makes it so they can't pass really any of their agenda through the Senate, or very little of it, anyway, and just begin legislating. Do things that help people fast. Try to put things out where people can see what you did and judge you based on what you did. My underlying argument here being that the filibuster plus the weird structural imbalances in our electoral system plus the system's other veto points, divided government, checks and balances, which are all supposed to be there and will continue to be there, it's created such a slow-moving form of government that symbolic politics can take over, quite often, because so little legislation happens outside the context of true emergencies, like right after, say, coronavirus hits or the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. What do you think of that argument?
First, there's the saga of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. The Supreme Court allowed states to opt out of this expansion. But accepting expansion should have been a no-brainer for every state: The federal government would initially pay the full cost, and even in the long run it would pay 90 percent, meanwhile bringing money and jobs into state economies.
She told one recruit, I need you fighting fit by Inauguration Day and told another that the training class was a military style exercise run by a Marine drill sergeant, prosecutors said. Biden may still yet be our president, Ms. Watkins stated, in part, when asked by a recruit about her predictions for 2021. If he is, our way of life as we know it is over. Our Republic would be over. Then it is our duty as Americans to fight, kill and die for our rights. Thomas Edward Caldwell, 65, another rioter included in the indictment and an apparent leader of the Oath Keepers, told Ms. Watkins that he believed we will have to get violent to stop this. The next month, Mr. Caldwell, who is from Virginia, made plans to stay at a hotel in Arlington, Va., for the days around the Capitol rampage, the indictment states. Evidence revealed earlier had already pointed to a potential conspiracy among rioters. A prosecutor in a hearing for Mr. Crowl, also a resident of Ohio, told the federal magistrate judge, He's been preparing for literal war. Prosecutors have said that the Oath Keepers moved in an organized and practiced fashion up the Capitol steps during the riot, donning matching gear. Inside, Ms. Watkins and others communicated using a channel on Zello, an application that mimics walkie-talkies, called Stop the Steal J6.
Mary Trump's new book aptly calls him the world's most dangerous man in its title. Mr. Trump is a drowning man who won't hesitate to pull his country down with him.
You can take it through a constitutional amendment if you think it needs a constitutional amendment.
During oral arguments, two of the three judges expressed some openness to the argument from the states. Of course, any ruling that invalidated the health law would be appealed to the Supreme Court, where the five justices who voted to uphold it in 2012 remain.
BS: Right. You have a lot of people in this country who actually, if you asked them about Obamacare, they hate it. These are the same people who are being wounded by the constant diminution of medical care under the Trump administration. How do you convince those people? That's the issue, because he's talking about fake news and disbelief. We had the whole discussion about death committees.
As the sound cut in and out and the audio often came out garbled, Mr. Biden sought to host what his campaign had called a virtual town hall with Illinois, in which he spoke to supporters and voters via video in place of an originally scheduled Chicago get-out-the-vote event — or at least, that was the goal.
You can't say that there's never any conflict between these two things because in the life of every parent and every family there are very difficult conflicts that have to be managed even for very affluent, well-off, and lucky parents. There's just a conflict between paid work and child rearing. But it certainly is true that if you create the conditions for a flourishing economy, which can include promoting work that this can be good for families and can be good for family life. So, here I actually will defend Lee and Rubio. Sometimes you'll get people who will say things like, we shouldn't care about incentives on work at all. If we're helping people, if we're bringing people out of poverty, you have to care about magnitudes, the size of these affects, and so forth. But I also do think that they're right. The old welfare system did, by creating these poverty traps and discouraging work, harm families. I think that to some extent, and here I get back to disagreeing with them, I think that they are misapplying those lessons in thinking about this current proposal, which is a different proposal from the old welfare system and it's in a different context than the old system was. For example, like as I was saying earlier, we're talking about a flat benefit which doesn't create that same kind of trap that you had in the old system.
Over the past week, several teams of scientists have sounded the alarm that the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines seem to be slightly less potent against the variant in South Africa, although they still successfully neutralized the virus. The vaccines were just as effective against the variant identified in Britain as against previous forms of the virus. Dr. Ho's study confirmed those findings. It has not yet been peer-reviewed for publication, and was posted to the online server BioRxiv. The new research does not have an immediate effect in the United States, because neither of those variants is known to be widespread in the country, Dr. Ho said. Just one infection with the variant from Brazil has been found, in Minnesota, and no cases of the variant from South Africa have been identified. But the United States analyzes too few viral samples to be absolutely certain the variants are not already circulating here, Dr. Ho said. In the future, new versions of the virus, including some that evade vaccines and monoclonal antibodies, will undoubtedly emerge, he added. We've got to expect more of this, because so many people are infected with this virus, he said. The virus has so many chances to mutate.

Who should replace Justice Antonin Scalia is the political question du jour.
The program still faces threats, most significantly the Trump administration lawsuit to overturn the health law. The Department of Justice, alongside a coalition of 20 Republican-controlled states, submitted briefs to the Supreme Court last week arguing that the recent repeal of the individual mandate, which required all Americans to carry health coverage or pay a fine, made the entire law unconstitutional.

So Josh Jordan on Twitter summarized a bunch of recent polls looking at what percentage of Republicans believe the election was stolen from Donald Trump. USA Today Suffolk poll 73 percent, Gallup 83 percent, CNN 75, Monmouth 72 percent, Fox News, a low result, 68 percent. So, we're looking at somewhere between 2/3 to 4/5 of the Republican Party saying, the election was stolen from Donald Trump. That is a hell of a thing to believe. How do you understand that belief and how do you think it changes political incentives and strategies for people who want to lead that party going forward?
Yes, say policy experts and consumer advocates. Health plans — and subsidies to help low-income consumers pay for premiums — are in place for this year. Healthcare.gov and the state-based insurance marketplaces are open for business, for consumers who do not have job-based coverage and are seeking individual policies.
The more boldly liberal solution is to create a so-called public option on the exchanges — a government insurance plan anyone could buy. In a Times op-ed today, Jacob Hacker — one of the architects of the public option — makes the case for it.

That was before more than 68,000 people in the United States tested positive for the coronavirus, grinding the country to a halt, upending lives from coast to coast, and postponing primary elections in many states. The virus has made the stakes, and the differing visions the two parties have for health care in America, that much clearer.

At least two other Republicans, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have indicated they will not vote to proceed if Senate leaders plan to then put forth a measure to repeal the health law without providing a replacement.
So I have a long discussion of that episode in my book, Why We're Polarized, which makes a wonderful pairing with Adam's Kill Switch. It's like wine and cheese. And one of the things that I try to argue there and that I think is true is that it is important to step back from your outrage, if you are a liberal, about what Mitch McConnell did and just ask, what didn't make sense about the action? And one of the things that I try to show there using a fair amount of research on Supreme Court justices over time is that what had been happening for a long time predating the Merrick Garland affair is that Supreme Court nominations had gone from being relatively non-ideological, if very consequential votes, to very ideological ones. So if you look across to the 20th century, knowing which party nominated a Supreme Court justice in an age of not very polarized parties, not very ideological parties, did not tell you that much about how that justice was going to vote. You consistently had Republicans nominating justices who turned out to be very important liberals, like Earl Warren or David Souter. You had the same thing happen to Democrats a number of times. And that as the parties polarized ideologically, the rallying cry became, never again. They developed these big vetting structures, on the Republican side in particular, the Federalist Society, to make sure that the judges they nominated to the Supreme Court would be reliable, ideological partisans.
AstraZeneca and some European opposition politicians say the delay put the bloc at the back of the line for deliveries. The commission disagrees.

Lindell is a Fox celebrity, a big Trump donor, and the president would like to see him run for governor of Minnesota. No way right now of knowing whether his political future will be affected by a 2017 Better Business Bureau decision to revoke MyPillow's accreditation.
So the way I see this is I think the old left-right division, yeah, there's a lot of that. But I think there's a very different division in America, and that is an America that's working for a thinner and thinner slice at the top and not working for much of anyone else. And there are a lot of Democrats, a lot of independents and a lot of Republicans who see that.
Biden's relief plan also includes a major expansion of the Affordable Care Act in the form of greater subsidies for Americans who purchase their health insurance on the marketplaces established by the law. This would, according to an Urban Institute estimate, reduce the number of uninsured people in the United States by more than four million.
He also criticized Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's analogy of catcalling, labeling it an insane accusation.

So I'd like to offer an opinion that will probably anger everyone: In terms of actual policy, it probably doesn't matter much who the Democrats nominate — as long as he or she wins, and Democrats take the Senate too.

Senator Warren visited Beijing in 2018, as Mr. Trump was waging a tariff war on China. She criticized his chaotic foreign policy, while arguing that America cannot support an economic system more integrated with China's while it fails to respect basic human rights.

The Kaiser Family Foundation's Health Care Tracking Poll has found a decline in public support for Medicare for all since the start of the year. Now roughly 51 percent of American adults are in favor of a single-payer system and 47 percent are opposed, whereas earlier this year 57 percent backed it and 37 percent were opposed.
For those who are too poor to afford health insurance, Medicaid is a lifeline. This joint federal and state program doesn't care whether you're white or black, Christian or Muslim, Republican or Democrat, a city dweller or a rural resident. In states that expanded their Medicaid programs under Obamacare, all you have to be is poor enough to qualify.
WASHINGTON — President Trump singled him out for praise even while attacking other members of the Supreme Court. The White House nominated people close to him to important judicial posts. And members of the Trump family forged personal connections.
So Mr. Cruz has a truth problem. But what else can we learn from this encounter? That the Affordable Care Act is already doing enormous good. It came too late to save one man's life, but it will surely save many others. Why, then, do we hear not just conservatives but also many progressives trashing President Obama's biggest policy achievement?
Mr. Klain suggested the grant had underwritten more safety measures. He also twice understated the size of the student settings in the schools, saying they were classes of about 11 or 12, and later, classrooms of 12 on average. What that study in Wisconsin from the C.D.C. showed, Mr. Klain said, was that 17 schools that got a sizable grant from a private foundation to put in the kinds of safety measures they needed — students in very small pods, classes of about 11 or 12, distanced, in a rural area — they could go to school safely. Asked by the CNN anchor, Erin Burnett, why teachers' unions were ignoring the scientific evidence in opposing reopening, Mr. Klain disagreed. I think what you're seeing is schools that haven't made the investments to keep the students safe, he said.
The new suburban Democrats may be attracted to Mr. Bloomberg's more moderate message, and he's been hammering them with it; more than half of his ads in Los Angeles and San Diego deal with the issue of health care. One ad, which attacks Mr. Trump for saying let Obamacare implode, ran more than 1,700 times in the two markets, the most of any Bloomberg ad, powered by $2.2 million.
Away's ex-C.E.O. says giving up her title was a mistake
Insurance markets are collapsing, Mr. Ryan said this week. Premiums are soaring. Patients' choices are dwindling.
So what happens in the last 24 hours or so to this Trump-led project to try to strike down, repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act?
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is one of the Democratic presidential contenders who favor this kind of buy-in, often called the public option. They view it as a more gradual, politically pragmatic alternative to the Medicare-for-all proposal championed by Senator Bernie Sanders, which would abolish private health insurance altogether.
Maintaining that carefully constructed system is a particular duty of the speaker. Mr. Ryan, though pledged to uphold the Constitution, has taken to acting as though he and the Republicans he leads are members of the White House staff.
The good news is that America is a far less racist, far more tolerant nation today than it was in 1970. Remarkably, multiple polls show a majority of Americans approving of the protests inspired by George Floyd's death, and strong disapproval of Trump's response.
There is not yet an estimate of how many people would gain coverage under the Senate plan, but the Congressional Budget Office did estimate that the original House version would reach 2.2 million former workers.
In 2009, with unified Democratic Party control and a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, the Democratic Party failed even to include a public option in Obamacare, much less establish a health insurance program that would cover all uninsured Americans.
Doctors would have to transition. Salary losses would differ by specialty, but imagine you came out of med school saddled with debt and learn that your payments are going to be down by, say 30 percent. Similar shocks would ripple to other health care workers.
You start by disrupting. You start with some wins. You start with some places people want to be, and actually immigration reform is one of them. People don't like our immigration system, and our support for immigrants continues to go up. I can be in a room full of people who are three generations away from any immigration experience personally, and they want to see us get this done. It's not just liberals. What was the latest story? Utah wants more immigrants, right?
I don't know. I almost think that the opposite thing is probably true — that it's really hard to imagine it being possible to pass something that would be so earth-shattering, that would make so many changes to our health care system, to our tax code, to the way that health care is delivered if we don't have buy-in. And so I think that a real challenge for politicians around this issue is really going to be winning hearts and minds and trying to convince people that this vision of how the health care system should work is worth the disruption. The people who really believe in it really believe in it, but there are a lot of people that they will have to persuade.
Top executives from state hospital associations will fly to Washington this week to develop their strategy. Many also plan to visit offices on Capitol Hill, where they will warn of the potential damage if Congress repeals the health law without guaranteeing similar coverage for those who would lose it.
This appears to be a misrepresented statistic. A 2019 report from the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University found that the median white student borrower has paid back 94 percent of his or her student debt, while the median black student borrower has paid back 5 percent. Read the report here.
That doesn't mean a Democratic candidate should stand for nothing, just keep it simple: Focus on building national unity and good jobs.

It would, for starters, stop cowing to Trump and stand up for American national security. It would investigate Russian cyberattacks and the possibility, as McCain put it, that the president of the United States might be vulnerable to Russian extortion. Many of McCain's colleagues remembering him as a brave patriot are proving themselves to be neither.

Big business has also come on board: More than 150 senior executives at major companies have written congressional leaders urging enactment of Biden's plan.
In the October Democratic debate, Times national editor Marc Lacey asked Mr. Yang to comment on Senator Warren's calls to break up companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google. Mr. Yang said Senator Warren is correct in her diagnosis of the problem but breaking up the companies isn't an adequate solution because using a 20th-century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new tool kit.
At the same time, you don't want to create some sort of narrative of historical inevitability of the return of bigotry and racism. Right? George W. Bush campaigned in almost all of the ways that liberals now miss about Republican politicians. Right? He went to mosques after 9/11. He pushed a huge program for fighting AIDS in Africa. His was a conservatism of some kind of racial outreach. So you have to ask the question, you know, well, what changed between 2000 and 2016? And I think the big answer is that George W. Bush's foreign policy was a failure. And then we had a huge financial crisis. And we have a host of socioeconomic problems in America that the Republican message wasn't addressing.
LK: And a growing concern during the Trump era about violence. And I'm just wondering how you would address that, if that is in fact something that's not going to go away once the Trump era ends, which I think is a safe assumption.

Mr. Biden, who has a habit of going on tangents and fumbling his lines, gave among the most fluent and forceful remarks of his candidacy as he vigorously defended the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama's signature health care law, and advocated for strengthening it, rather than embracing a new system — like, he implied, Medicare for All.

Soon after, in the middle of a strategy call with political aides and policy experts at his foundation, an excited Mr. Obama pronounced that a tailor-made moment had arrived.
Republicans now have two powerful reasons to repeal and replace together: They hope to protect about 20 million Americans who have gained coverage under the law. And they want a politically acceptable judgment from the Congressional Budget Office on the effects of their alternative.
KK: But does it drive down wages for American workers?
But Mr. Civiletti argued that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional appropriations. The few exceptions included work by federal employees to protect life and property, he wrote.
When I was a girl, you had a better than 50/50 chance of doing better than your parents. Today, that seems to be slipping under a 1-in-10 chance. Opportunity is shifting away from not just the poor kids. It's shifting away from everybody who's not born into the top. And sure, a few people roll the dice and make it big and we should celebrate that, but it's like this fundamental question of who we're going to be as a country. And yeah, I do fight for a lot of things. I fight for a big vision, but if we don't start there, if we start by compromising, if we start by saying, Hey, everybody line up. We're going to knock 2 cents off your student loan debt, who's showing up for that?
The higher proportion of younger adults with medical debt was a bit surprising, Ms. McKernan said, because they tend to have fewer health problems. But they are less likely to have health insurance, she noted, and have not been accumulating wealth as quickly as earlier generations.
Emily Beauregard, the executive director of Kentucky Voices for Health, an advocacy group, said the state had provided little information about how it would make sure people were complying with work requirements, how exemptions would be determined and other details.

In their brief seeking Supreme Court review, two insurance companies said they had been the victims of a bait-and-switch of staggering dimensions in which the government has paid insurers $12 billion less than what was promised.
Nick Fox: What did you think of the standards in the Trans-Pacific deal?
But in signaling either overt or tacit support, a small but vocal band of Republicans now serving in the House provided legitimacy and publicity to extremist groups and movements as they built toward their role in the attack on Congress. Ms. Boebert, who has close connections to militia groups including the Three Percenters, said in a statement that she had never given a tour of the U.S. Capitol to anyone besides family members in town for my swearing-in, and she called accusations from Democrats that she gave a reconnaissance tour to insurgents an irresponsible lie. Both Mr. Biggs and Mr. Gosar have been linked to the Stop the Steal campaign backing Mr. Trump's effort to overturn the election's outcome. Mr. Biggs has denied associating with Stop the Steal organizers and condemned violence of any kind. Mr. Gosar did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for Ms. Greene said she now rejected the QAnon conspiracy theory that she previously promoted, and he tried to distance her from militia members. Before being elected to Congress last year, she used social media in 2019 to endorse executing top Democrats and has suggested that the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., was a staged false flag attack.
To make regulation work, you have to back it up with incentives for healthy people to sign up, including subsidies that help lower-income families afford insurance. In other words, if you really want to make essential care available for pre-existing conditions while continuing to rely on private insurance companies, you need a system that looks a lot like … Obamacare. Indeed, New York premiums dropped in half when the A.C.A. went into effect.
Mulvaney isn't just the budget director. He is also the interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the banking watchdog that the Obama administration and Elizabeth Warren created after the financial crisis. The bureau, often called the C.F.P.B., has had an impressive record since its founding, curtailing abusive lending practices by banks, among other things. It's helped level the playing field — not all the way, to be sure — between big, powerful companies and American families.
Donald Trump has spent his whole life overselling an overinflated vision of himself and his success.
Texas, for example, allowed insurers to charge women higher premiums than men (a practice that was outlawed or restricted in 12 other states, mostly Northeastern ones). Individual market insurers could deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions. The average individual market plan around that time came with a $222 monthly premium. The plan was not required to cover expensive benefits such as childbirth or prescription drugs.
But you know what else baby boomers did? Helped bring an end to the Vietnam War. Advanced the causes of equality for women, for black people and for L.G.B.T. Americans. Engineered the digital revolution. If we're not the dynamos we once were, maybe it's not because we're sanguine or jaded. We could just be pooped.
Senator Warren has released one of the most robust housing plans in the 2020 field, including the creation of a Tenant Protection Bureau modeled after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The sky-high rates of homelessness across the country was a major focus of Times reporting last year — read it here.
The American government's antitrust battle with the oil industry perhaps epitomizes a 20th-century approach to antitrust — in 1911, the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of Standard Oil. Of course, many would argue that the country's dependence on oil and its addiction to Facebook aren't totally comparable.
President Trump has railed repeatedly against the Senate filibuster as a major reason that many of his policy priorities have flopped. Monday, raging about the Mexico border, he tweeted that Congress must immediately pass border legislation, use nuclear option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of drugs and people.
Two legal opinions issued by the United States attorney general, Benjamin R. Civiletti, in 1980 and 1981, made shutdowns much more severe.
While the stimulus checks will be a boon to many struggling families, the package is also geared toward strengthening efforts to bring an end to the pandemic. To better understand how, I spoke to my colleague Abby Goodnough, a national heath care correspondent.

Clinton should learn from Trump's grandstanding and defensiveness: Sometimes it's best just to apologize and move on. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
The view associated with Bernie Sanders and some scholars, which suggests that both parties have been bought off by rich donors to represent the rich and big business at the expense of the middle class, is inconsistent with the patterns we observe.
I disagreed with them. So for example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership had a robust investor state dispute resolution mechanism, which multiple of our trade treaties have had for decades now. And I just think that's fundamentally wrong. It's a two-tier system that says, in effect, we'll make a bunch of promises in a trade deal on the environment, on use of prison labor, child labor and on anything else, and then we'll give two entirely different enforcement mechanisms.
[Mr. Cohen has been duping politicians for decades. Here are his greatest hits.]
I happen to believe — and I know not everybody agrees with me — I believe that health care is a right of all people.
Reed: Some of that problem with high prices was supposed to be solved by more competition among health insurance companies. Which gets to the second important change, I think: adding a Medicare-like public plan in areas of the country where there remain too few companies offering plans on the state marketplaces. (I notice the president didn't dwell on the increasing number of failures among the co-ops, the nonprofit insurers created by the law to serve as something akin to the so-called public option.)
And then there are people who are willing to call themselves socialists, even, in some cases, but in any case, who have much greater ambitions for what public policy should be doing and what government should do. And both parties have some divisions along these lines. And in fact, those socialist Democrats probably agree with Josh Hawley about more than they would imagine. But the parties are very divided on social issues. And not only the traditional ones — abortion and so on — but they've broadened the definition of social issues so that immigration is now almost entirely a social issue and questions of culture and the rest of it are really what divides the parties now. There's much more room for compromise on economics and much less on social issues than there used to be.
New York has among the highest per-enrollee Medicaid spending of any state, and some county governments pay for a share of the state's Medicaid expenses. County governments would like to have the state assume the full costs of that program. A revision, introduced by Representative Chris Collins of New York's 27th District, which includes a large part of rural, western New York, would do just that, barring Medicaid funds from being used by small local governments under specific conditions tailored precisely to counties outside of New York City.
About 20 million people now have health insurance because of Obamacare, according to government estimates. But will they vote?
For Parkland, for Orlando, for every community affected by gun violence — ending gun violence. Climate change Passing a family bill of rights that includes a national paid leave plan. Passing a middle class working families tax cut. I reject the premise, he said. We need a political revolution. The first thing I would do is make sure that we defeat Donald Trump. We've got to fix our democracy before it's too late. I would pass a $1,000 freedom dividend for every American adult. I would do a collaborative approach to climate change. The United States of America is going to be the best place in the world for a child to grow up.
There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and Republican claims about health care.

March 3, 2020, 11:14 p.m. ET March 3, 2020, 11:14 p.m. ET In heavily Latino East Los Angeles, a bastion of support for Sanders. LOS ANGELES — Looked at one way, Lorena Vellanowth's family is the embodiment of the American dream. She came to Los Angeles from Mexico as a baby, and her daughter went on to study at the University of California, Los Angeles, and then to attend graduate school at the University of Southern California. But all that success came with a big caveat: Her daughter, who works in public administration for the city of Anaheim, is struggling under the weight of almost half a million dollars in student loans. Bigger than my mortgage, said Ms. Vellanowth, 43, who works in health care. She said her daughter is getting married this month, and she worries about how her daughter will be able to afford to raise children or buy a home. That reason alone was enough for Ms. Vellanowth, and many of her family members and friends in the Latino community, to support Bernie Sanders, she said, drawn by his message of fighting the type of inequality they feel every day in Los Angeles. I'm Latina, and you'd think that's not someone I'd vote for, an old white guy, she said on Monday afternoon outside a polling center at a park in the heavily Latino East Los Angeles. But she worries about her candidate's future, now that the Democratic establishment is coalescing around Joseph R. Biden Jr.
The other offers a continuation of the Tea Party's insistence on spending cuts and Obamacare repeal, and appropriately its present leader is a former Tea Party congressman — Mick Mulvaney, the Zelig of the administration, whose zeal is apparently the main reason that the Obamacare lawsuit now has administration support.
In 2009, when the Affordable Care Act was being written, Sarah Palin popularized the phrase Obama's 'death panel,' which became a rallying cry for the Tea Party.
AK: Sure. I'm really interested in the student loan debt issue, but there's a concern that your plan to forgive student debt really tilts a lot of resources towards the wealthy. So only 2 percent of borrowers have more than $50,000 in debt. A third of all student debt is owned by people in the top income quartile, and most student debt goes to households with advanced degrees. So these are doctors and lawyers, and they've amassed a lot of debt, but they're also investing in their own educational capacity to pay off that debt. So I'm just wondering how you square that with a plan that goes about forgiving student debt?
The American government's antitrust battle with the oil industry perhaps epitomizes a 20th-century approach to antitrust — in 1911, the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of Standard Oil.

He should choose Rick Perry. There are three very good reasons.
Same story for Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, who says she's struggling to figure out what to do. Last week Murkowski responded fervently in support of former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis's anti-Trump essay in which he urged Americans to unite without him and create a better world. There are, everybody knows, a great many things the country needs to do to make a brighter tomorrow. But the without him part does seem to be the critical priority.
At the end of the competition, five candidates would be fired, and one lucky person would be crowned the 2016 Vice President Apprentice. This is what Americans who support Mr. Trump want to see, and, golly gee, this may also be how to make our vice presidency great again.
That's a nice one. I like that. So look, I think it's one of the things that, as a country, it's time for us to take it on.
Yes. I just think it's got this — no one has to say there is a conflict of interest, and I'm not trying to talk about anyone's individual circumstances, but I think one of the things we have to deal with in public life is the appearance of conflict of interest. You know, that's supposed to be the guiding principle, for example, for judges. It's not whether or not there is a conflict of interest, it's whether or not people in the public could reasonably be concerned that it were, because it's important that you believe that judges are acting independently and not influenced because they're going to get money or someone in their family is going to get money. And so that's where I think the analogy is the closest, and whether you make it a rule of ethics or whether do you actually just make it part of the law, I think is a fair question, but I get why we should push in that direction.

He made the move, made the money and made his mark on New York's skyline, but he never quite made it into the inner sanctum of New York high society.
A Washington Post tally of President Obama's campaign promises found that he kept 11 promises (expand hate crime statutes, insure more Americans, establish a credit-card Bill of Rights), compromised on 12 (end the war in Iraq in 16 months, increase the earned-income tax credit) and failed on 17 (raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation, create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants).
CW: But does that fix the power consolidation that's happening right now? If you took Facebook and spun out to Instagram, say, you still have a real dominance and a power that has been accumulated there. So Facebook, for example, in the media and advertising industry.
The result: Older Americans with low incomes in high-cost areas would lose very big. This is a group that tended to vote for President Trump. This reality worried some moderate G.O.P. politicians, particularly those from rural districts, where prices for health insurance are the highest.
At the same time, the health department is setting limits on how far states can go with their experiments: Idaho recently proposed a scheme to allow insurers to sell plans that do not comply with all of Obamacare's regulations, with the goal of creating a market for less expensive, less robust coverage, but last week the department rejected the plan as illegal (Gov. Butch Otter didn't see it as a rejection but as an invitation to continue discussing the specifics). And while the Trump administration approved a request to add work requirements to Medicaid in Arkansas, it has held off on approving a rollback in enrollment.
A recent op-ed in The Times argued that Carrie Lam's decision to characterize the Hong Kong protests as a riot echoed a moment in 1989 when The People's Daily, the newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, referred to a gathering of students in Tiananmen Square as turmoil. Protesters in Hong Kong demanded that the term riot be retracted.
The plans tend to limit how much care they will pay for in a given year. That means that if you develop an expensive illness, your insurance could get cut off when you hit the limit. A typical short-term plan covers a maximum of $250,000 to $2 million in medical care, according to the Kaiser study. Major medical plans, which follow rules set by the Affordable Care Act, can't impose any such limits.
Mr. Trump released his short list of potential Supreme Court nominees in May 2016. In September 2016, he released a second list with several more women and people of color, following criticisms of the white and male bias in his first.
And this goes to this question, can you force policy on the Republican Party, on a Republican base, that is not primarily worried about the things policy wonks worry about? Like I noticed at CPAC this year, the big conservative conference, its theme is uncanceled America. Right, and say what you will, about your ideas of cancel culture or not cancel culture. Its theme is not health care, the economy, coronavirus, climate change. Like all of these things where I could come up with a bunch of policy ideas, even from the right, to do something about them. It seems cancellation — there's a lot of Republican energy around the 1619 Project at The New York Times — is that where the energy is and what happens if the energy is on things that really don't have policy solutions?
How Has the Pandemic Changed Your Taxes? Will stimulus payments be taxed? Nope. The so-called economic impact payments are not treated as income. In fact, they're technically an advance on a tax credit, known as the Recovery Rebate Credit. The payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague Ann Carrns wrote. Read more. Are my unemployment benefits taxable? Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction? Probably not, unless you're self-employed, an independent contractor or a gig worker.
Well, actually, you're going to have to explain to me what Andrew was — if I'm going to have to argue back against Andrew, you're going to have to tell me exactly what Andrew's argument is.
Well, he did get rid of it for Supreme Court justices because that's what he cared about the most, and that's what he wanted to pass. I think that if Republicans retake power, the minute they have something that they really want to pass that can get 51 votes, but can't clear 60, they'll get rid of the filibuster in a heartbeat. I think that a strategy that is designed to preserve a defensive tool is not a good strategy if the opponents can get rid of that defensive tool whenever they want to. I would also say, look at the world around you today. And if you like it just the way it is, and you don't think that any big structural reforms to our democracy need to pass, anything like a John Lewis Voting Rights Act, statehood, automatic voter registration, or any other issue you care about like climate change, healthcare, income inequality, if you don't see the need for any big changes, then fine, oppose getting rid of the filibuster. If, however, you think that we need changes on any one of these issues, let alone all of them, then you have to support getting rid of the filibuster because it is the only way we're going to make major change. And I do think, look, I mean, this is — we're in a perilous moment in our democracy here. In some ways, we're picking between a lot of not great options.
The Obama administration interpreted the provision about sex discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of gender identity. Under the original 2016 rule, health care providers and insurers would have been required to provide and cover medically appropriate treatment for transgender patients.
Let me ask you both something, which is if there's one thing Donald Trump is good at, it's manipulating public opinion.
But that is the specific, right? This is the place where Democrats have fired on Democrats about how we're going to do health care. And I'll make two pitches on that. One is I think the best way we're going to do health care — this is just what I believe — is you do what you can to bring down costs. You got a little success on the table. It's a lot of success. It's hundreds of millions of dollars of success. You've got that on the table. You start to offer people what's possible.
If Biden and Congress succeed at the big ideas, and not just the reversal of wrongful executive orders or unpopular legislation, he will be fondly remembered, even if he serves only one term. What's more, he may even able to bring enough fresh air into our toxic political atmosphere to realign things.
Yes. I do think that the Europeans need to bear a significant share of the cost of defense of Europe. I don't think that hectoring or embarrassing them is a way to get there. I think we get there by talking about the ways that work best for them on the ground, but I do think it's important. It's an important partnership, and it should be a partnership.
He made clear his influence in a pair of stunning decisions on Thursday, joining the court's liberal wing in one and his fellow conservatives in the other. In providing the decisive votes and writing the majority opinions in cases on the census and partisan gerrymandering, he demonstrated that he has unquestionably become the court's ideological fulcrum after the departure last year of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy.

He proposes a dramatic expansion in the state's absentee ballot voting system, essentially making it a universal vote-by-mail system.

Bret: I honestly don't believe that Kavanaugh will vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. Democrats said the same thing about Anthony Kennedy when Ronald Reagan nominated him in 1987, yet he ended up being one of the justices (along with the Republican appointees David Souter and Sandra Day O'Connor) who reaffirmed the central holdings of Roe in the Casey decision. I'm confident Kavanaugh will respect 45 years of abortion precedent even if he's more traditionally conservative on other issues.
Well, I'm not sure about that. I mean, so, obviously, I don't think that the racist tweets have majority support in this country. But we don't have majority rule in this country. And so does it fire up enough of the Trump supporters who came out for him in 2016, stayed home in 2018, enough of those to make a difference in the few unrepresentative states that end up deciding all of our fates in our system of minority rule? I hope not, but maybe.
The decline could be because Trump's increasingly moonstruck tweets have lost their power. Or maybe it's because all of the people around him believe he's an idiot and they're going public with the consensus inside the White House (another reason to get a dog). But I think Trump's base is showing some erosion because his followers feel he finally crossed a line: He's now insulting them.
As far as I am concerned, that's the only choice on the ballot. It's a choice between letting Trump retain control of all the key levers of political power for two more years, or not.
KK: Well, we're going to start, if you don't mind, at America's borders and around foreign policy.
America regularly renegotiates its defense cost-sharing agreements with host countries. In November, Mr. Trump asked Japan to quadruple its payments for the American troop presence.
But I think you could also say — and this is where I disagree with you, David. I think you could say that we have exaggerated, as Michelle says, the extent to which male-female differences require some form of patriarchy. But that doesn't mean that we've actually exaggerated male-female differences. That just might mean that we haven't appreciated what women can do as much as we've should. And there's, in fact, plenty of evidence that in gender egalitarian societies, including the paradises of Scandinavia, male and female differences actually increase further. I think there are places and situations where male-female differences still get exaggerated. I think in the world of New York Times readers, at this point in our history, it's the opposite and that we've moved to a place of telling people that they need to deny realities in front of their face.
In 2012, Massachusetts Democrats, worried about a tough fight against Republican Senator Scott Brown, coalesced around Ms. Warren, knocking her only primary challenger, an immigration attorney, Marisa DeFranco, off the ballot. Winning in November is more important to Democrats than standing behind one woman who wanted to challenge another one for the right to run for U.S. Senate, Boston Globe columnist Joan Vennochi wrote at the time. Whether Ms. Warren could beat Mr. Brown, the incumbent, was more of a tossup, though by late summer 2012 most polls had her ahead.
Trump says Syrian refugees coming in by the hundreds of thousands. Huh? Just 11,000 so far. Canada has admitted 35,000. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
It provides $14 billion for vaccine distribution and another $48 billion for testing and contact tracing. There's also close to $8 billion for state and local public health departments to help them beef up their public health work force and infrastructure.
So I think that what we're seeing is not Trumpification completed but Trumpification in progress and escalating, so that when Trump said that a judge of Mexican-American heritage was not fit to hear a case that he was involved in, you heard Paul Ryan come out and say that it was the textbook definition of racism. And you heard much more, I think, strenuous and immediate condemnations. And so what we are accustomed to, the amount of racial invective that it takes to even break into the news cycle, keeps increasing. You know, I've been reading Tim Alberta's book American Carnage about the G.O.P. civil war that led to Trump. And there's something he quotes that kind of everybody quotes when they're describing the evolution of the modern Republican Party. It's a famous Lee Atwater quote from an interview in the '80s. But he says, You start out in 1954 by saying n-word, n-word, n-word. By 1968, you can't say n-word. That hurts you— backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights, and all that stuff, and you're getting so abstract. Now you're talking about cutting taxes. And all these things you're talking about are totally economic things. And a byproduct of them is blacks get hurt worse than whites.
After an illness or an injury, many Americans who enroll in these G.O.P. junk health coverage plans will end up being hit by crushing medical bills, finding that they have been paying for coverage that doesn't cover much at all, said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader.
I just don't think that's Trumpification either. That is an example of a pre-existing pathology in the Republican Party where you have a hyperpartisan desire to use the courts as, basically, super legislators. But that predates Trump. I don't think anyone in Congress wants the judge to overrule Obamacare because it would be a huge mess for Republican legislators. And I think it's— I doubt that Trump himself wants it to happen. I suspect it's a faction within his administration. If the judge rules against Obamacare, it will be a partisan decision and a foolish one. But I think that's a problem with partisanship in general and Republicans in general, that it's only tangentially connected to Trump.
Look, I have argued for a long time that we need not to expand our nuclear arsenal, and that is the direction the Trump administration has been taking us.
That list could grow. Senator Ron Johnson, of Wisconsin, has not yet said whether he will seek a third term, nor has Senators Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who is 87, or Richard Shelby of Alabama, who is 86. Senators Mark Kelly of Arizona and Raphael Warnock of Georgia — two Democrats who joined the chamber after winning special elections — will face voters again in 2022 for full six-year terms.
How different is that from Trump's indecency? Let's be clear, Trump cheated on his wife, but his party's now cheating on their kids. You tell me who's worse.
Perched on the window sill of Zucker's office, among the pictures of his family, is a framed cartoon of him shaking hands with Trump. Another Trump stooge on the payroll, Don Don! a plump-looking Zucker says. Big league move, Zucker, Trump replies. It was drawn by the political cartoonist Sean Corcoran last summer, when CNN hired the former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski as a contributor just days after he was fired by the campaign. I was surprised to find it in Zucker's office. His critics saw the hiring of Lewandowski — who was accused of assaulting a female reporter and was still getting paychecks from the campaign during his five-month stint at CNN — as emblematic of everything that was wrong with Zucker and CNN. Namely, that he was more interested in staging fights and creating spectacles than in producing journalism. But Zucker doesn't engage in second-guessing, let alone soul-searching.
That warning came from Josep Maria Argimon, a health official in Catalonia, and he was referring not to food but to the dwindling supplies of something almost as precious: the coronavirus vaccine. On Wednesday, Spain became the first European country to partly suspend immunizations because of a lack of doses. It did so first in Madrid, for two weeks, and said that Catalonia, the northeastern region that includes Barcelona, could soon follow. It has not gone easily for the European Union since it approved its first vaccine in late December and rushed to begin a vast immunization campaign across its 27 member states. But the early problems have snowballed into a full-blown crisis. Countries across the bloc have felt the pain of vaccine shortages even as a new wave of the virus rages. The pandemic has prompted prolonged lockdowns in most member countries, and there is also anxiety over the spread of at least two highly infectious variants that are straining national health systems. It is unclear when the supply might improve. The bloc is also in an escalating dispute with AstraZeneca over the drug maker's announcement that it would cut deliveries by 60 percent because of production shortfalls. And Pfizer informed the European Union this month that it had to drastically cut its vaccine deliveries until mid-February while it upgraded its plants to ramp up output, adding to the supply problems.
In other words, Republicans' insistence that they have a superior alternative to Obamacare is a zombie lie — a claim that should be dead after having been proved false again and again, but it is still shambling along, eating people's brains.
Without the mandate, many healthy people are expected to drop coverage, driving up prices for those who need it most, and ultimately causing even more people to drop out of the individual market.
WASHINGTON — Abortion flared up Wednesday as the latest hot-button issue to complicate passage of a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which Senate Republican leaders hope to unveil on Thursday and pass next week.
Ms. Warren was likely referring to reporting by Sarah Kliff in The Times in November chronicling a rise in hospitals' suing patients over overdue bills.

There is no guarantee that the lawsuit will turn out the way the Trump administration wants, of course. And any final answer is probably a long way away, since the case is likely to be appealed once it is decided. A group of Republican states that brought the lawsuit initially argued that the entirety of Obamacare should be invalidated. A decision for those litigants would mean changes not just to the individual market but to Medicare, Medicaid and a broad array of other health programs.

Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:18 - 0:00 transcript Pelosi Rebukes House Republicans Over Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned House Republican leaders on Thursday after they named Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to serve on the Education and Labor Committee. Ms. Greene supported the QAnon movement and other conspiracies. Reporter: Madam Speaker, I want to ask you about Marjorie Taylor Greene. How concerned are you about her past posts, remarks, rhetoric — what would you like to see done about her? What I'm concerned about is the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives, who was willing to overlook, ignore those statements, assigning her to the Education Committee when she has mocked the killing of little children at Sandy Hook Elementary school. When she has mocked the killing of teenagers in high school at the Marjory Stoneman Douglas high school. What could they be thinking or is thinking too generous a word for what they might be doing? It's absolutely appalling. And I think that the focus has to be on the Republican leadership of this House of Representatives for the disregard they have for the death of those children. It's just beyond any understanding of any regard that the House Republicans would have for the House of Representatives, for the Congress of the United States and for the heartbreak of the families.
Mr. Trump's decision nearly four years ago was a shock to the UNFPA, which had counted on the United States, a founding member, as a critical source of funding. Overnight, the agency lost nearly $70 million. Dr. Natalia Kanem, the fund's executive director, welcomed Mr. Biden's order, which she said would greatly help the agency's work not only in family planning but in other health services to struggling women and girls in poor countries. We now have the support of a very important member state, Dr. Kanem said in a phone interview, expressing gratitude that the Biden administration had embraced her agency's work around the world. Mr. Biden is also directing the Department of Health and Human Services to take immediate action, his administration said, to consider whether to rescind the so-called domestic gag rule — a regulation imposed by the Trump administration that prohibits family planning clinics that receive federal funding from counseling patients about abortion. Such a change would likely require the department to write new regulations, a process that could take months. The president's Obamacare directive will also instruct federal agencies to review policies — including waivers that allowed states to impose work requirements — that discourage participation in Medicaid, the public health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Enrollment in Medicaid has grown substantially during the coronavirus pandemic, in part because people who have lost jobs and their health insurance have turned to Medicaid for coverage. Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Abby Goodnough and
Think of what that means. Do — you know that the top — just one quick — one number. I've resisted numbers while I'm in here. The 99 percent America pays 7.2 percent of your total income in taxes. Not total income. Total wealth. The top one-tenth of 1 percent, the part I want to hit with a 2-cent wealth tax, 3.2 percent. 3.2 percent. They have wealth managers who are managing these huge funds that are growing at what rate? Six percent a year, 8 percent a year, 10 percent a year?
The number of people who have denounced Medicare for all as politically impractical continues to grow — the former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel called it a pipe dream in a recent Washington Post op-ed, in which he called on proponents to please explain to me exactly how we get that bill through the Senate?

They describe a heated meeting in the White House on Monday, in which Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff, pressed the president to keep his campaign promises to upend the law and urged him, along with other officials, to try to seize control of the health care issue from Democrats.

Here's a look at what may follow as the pandemic starts to settle:
Unfortunately, Vice President Biden, you're just simply inaccurate in what you're describing. The cost of doing nothing is far too expensive. I'm going to go back to Vice President Biden. You do nothing to hold the insurance companies to task for what they have been doing to American families. Kamala Harris said she's not trying to restructure society— She put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana. She had a police department when she was there that in fact was abusing people's rights. You want to compare records, and frankly, I'm shocked that you do— It looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past, and one of us hasn't. Mr. Vice President, there's a saying in my community: You're dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don't even know the flavor. Mr. Vice President, you didn't answer my question. What did you mean when you said, when a woman works outside the home, it's resulting in 'the deterioration of family'? Mr. Vice President, you want to be president of the United States, you need to be able to answer the tough questions. I guarantee you, if you're debating Donald Trump, he's not going to let you off the hook. I love your affection for me. You spent a lot of time with me. And I don't know what math you do in New York. I don't know what math you do anywhere, California.
Actually, I don't do polls. I haven't looked at them, so I don't know, but I'll tell you this. I'm out there fighting for those votes every single day. I've been to 29 states and Puerto Rico. I will keep doing this. I've been to blue states and red states, and talked about how we build a future. I think that's what we've got to do. We've got what, two more months before the caucuses start, but this is the question in front of us as a country. How do we think about how to go forward? Is the message going to be business as usual after Donald Trump? It's just too damn hard to get anything done. Therefore, we're just going to just kind of nibble at that problem of all the folks who can't get child care and teachers who are working three jobs?
Britain requires citizens flying home from 22 countries to quarantine at hotels. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:21 - 0:00 transcript Britain Cracks Down on International Travel Hoping to reduce the spread of the coronavirus variant, Britain announced on Wednesday it will require citizens arriving home from high-risk countries to quarantine in hotels for 10 days at their own expense. It is clear that there are still too many people coming in and out of our country each day. And today, I am announcing further action to strengthen the health measures that we already have at the border, but to reduce passenger flow. Firstly, the police have stepped up checks, and are carrying out more physical checks at addresses to ensure that people are complying with the self isolation rules. Second, we will continue to refuse entry to non-U.K. residents from Red List countries which are already subject to the U.K. travel ban. Third, as the prime minister has said, we will introduce a new managed isolation process in hotels for those who cannot be refused entry, including those arriving home from countries where we have already imposed international travel bans. We will increase police presence at ports and at airports. Finding those in breach of the stay-at-home regulations — anyone who does not have a valid reason for travel will be directed to return home or they will face a fine. These are crucial new measures to protect us all.
Ronny L. Jackson, the veterans affairs nominee, certainly looks good on TV, as we saw when he gave Trump an excellent bill of health, including a declaration that the president, while overweight, is just shy of being officially obese — thanks to having apparently grown an inch in office.
We have The One again, a New One — another lanky, bookish, handsome man with an attractive young family, a thin résumé, an exotic name, a hip affect, a rock star aura, an enticing smile, a liberal press corps ready to fluff his pillows and a frothing Fox News.
It's media ecosystems are intermixed with mainstream media that has incentives that are different than the Democratic Party, and so that ends up being somewhat restraining. It seems to be Republican institutions have been taken over and have actually lost a lot of battles. And I'd be curious if, one, do you think that's true? And two, then why it is the Republican institutions are proving weaker?
WASHINGTON — Congress's rush to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, once seemingly unstoppable, is flagging badly as Republicans struggle to come up with a replacement and a key senator has declared that the effort is more a repair job than a demolition.
Senator Warren's famous paper laying the groundwork for the creation of the C.F.P.B. opens with the sentence, It is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one-in-five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house and later says, Why are consumers safe when they purchase tangible products with cash, but when they sign up for routine financial products like mortgages and credit cards they are left at the mercy of their creditors?
Ross, I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that you're not a big fan of getting rid of the pronouns he and she.
Randy Barnett, a law professor at Georgetown University and an architect of the Commerce Clause-based attack on the Affordable Care Act, put it this way in a speech last week to the Heritage Foundation titled How John Roberts Gave Us Donald Trump:
NF: How do you deal with the fact that while people might want big change, they're also afraid of it?
Under the Republican plan, the premium for a typical low-income 64-year-old, after subsidies, would jump to $14,600 a year, from $1,700 a year, but rise slightly for a 40-year-old with the same income.
Actually, I don't think of what I say that way. What I think of is the leadership possibilities that the candidates for president are offering. I don't know anybody who sits around and says, I want to make peace with corruption. I don't know where those people are in America who think it's O.K. that Amazon makes $11 billion and pays nothing in taxes. I haven't seen those people. Now, maybe they just stay away from me, but I don't think so. I think —
I'm Ezra Klein, and this is The Ezra Klein Show. [MUSIC PLAYING] So before we begin today, we are still looking for an associate producer on the show. That is a position which requires two years of audio experience, but it's going to be involved in everything from researching guests, to booking, to transcripts, to cutting and editing episodes. If that sounds like something you have the experience for and want to do, we have the listing right now in the show description. So go check it out. Today's episode is about one of the core obsessions, or themes, that this show is going to have. And that is how do we get — can we even get a more responsible Republican Party? And one way I define that is, a Republican Party that is more centered around an actual governing agenda. The Republican Party we actually have, has spun off too much to culture war and grievance politics, as, depending on how you want to frame it, a distraction from an absence of consensus on more direct policies that would improve the lived economic lives of the voters. Or another way of looking at it is, it's trying to distract from opposition to those policies. But there are Republicans who are trying to diagnose the problem, who are trying to push the party back in a more policy-centric direction and trying to push the party, also towards a policy-centric direction that, I think, would be healthier.

Health care affects everyone. Making it into a partisan battle makes things worse.
So there's an argument that in a closely divided country, or at least in a closely divided Senate, if you can't get to 60, you can't get meaningful bipartisanship, you just shouldn't do big things because it'd be polarizing intrinsically to do big things. And I want to read you what Mitch McConnell said in 2014 in his speech about how if he took over the Senate, he would restore it to its old traditions and luster about this. And he's talking about Obamacare here. And he says, Without some meaningful buy-in, you guarantee a food fight. You guarantee instability and strife. It may very well have been the case that on Obamacare, the will of the country was not to pass the bill at all. That's what I would have concluded if Republicans couldn't get a single Democrat vote for legislation of this magnitude. I'd have thought, maybe this isn't such a great idea. Now, obviously, Mitch McConnell is a hypocrite. Obviously, he has run all kinds of bills without getting bipartisan votes. But a lot of people believe this underlying idea that if you cannot get bipartisan votes for something, maybe it isn't such a good idea. Maybe that's a signal you need to slow down and stop. I'm curious what your response to them is.
I wouldn't say that the stakes are low and I wouldn't. Try to minimize the stakes I care about elections and the outcomes of legislation. So, what I think the right in particular has a problem with is a kind of apocalypticism. The point of no return idea. If you lose this election, if you lose this bill, that's the end of the Republic. That's the end of freedom. You can never recover it. And people convinced themselves of this. Although they don't actually follow their own beliefs on it. Like Michael Anton, he doesn't, obviously, believe that the country is now doomed forever because Trump lost re-election. Otherwise he would have stopped talking, right? He would have stopped being involved in politics. Ted Cruz doesn't believe that Obamacare, having survived his attempt to get rid of it in 2013, means the end of the Constitution, because he's still there, right? Just as it wasn't the end of free markets and capitalism when we got Medicare in the first place in 1965, about which you could have made a stronger slippery slope argument, than applied to Obamacare. That's what I want to counter, because that kind of thinking logically could lead to defeatism despair and surrender, just as much as it could lead to extremism, and violence, and so forth. But it just strikes me as just the wrong attitude to take towards politics in a Democratic country even when we rightly care about political outcomes.

At a rally in 2008, McCain corrected a questioner who called Barack Obama untrustworthy and an Arab. No, ma'am, McCain told the crowd. He's a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.
Mr. Douthat's musings — that Asians might lead the Democrats back to 1990s-style Clintonism  — are wrongheaded fantasies. No surveys show voters clamoring for President Bill Clinton's blend of cutting welfare while deregulating finance. And even if such centrism were on the rise, Asian-Americans won't lead the way.
BS: Last question. What are you likely to fail at as president?
Yes, and he had the high risk tolerance necessary to sort of run the experiment because the conventional wisdom at the time was that the minority party would be punished by voters if they offered nothing but relentless obstruction, instead of cooperation. And when Obama came into office, he was riding a 67 percent approval rating, the highest since JFK. Democrats had made massive gains in the House and Senate for two straight cycles, 2006 and 2008. And the general conventional wisdom was that Republicans, if they wanted to avoid extinction as a party, should cooperate with this massively popular president and his giant majorities in the House and Senate. So it took a real bold insight and then a willingness to carry it out on McConnell's part to sort of defy all of the conventional wisdom and say, no, we are going to oppose him at every turn. The 2010 midterms, which ended up being a disaster for Democrats, if you looked at them in 2009, it was not clear that Republicans were going to do well in those midterms. A lot of the Senate races were in states Obama won. And so it took sharp insight on McConnell's part and the willingness to take the punishment from the punditocracy to carry out the strategy and deny Obama cooperation in every way.
A new Obamacare waiver program has just gone into effect: It would allow states to overhaul their entire health insurance markets if they can show that their revised plans would cover as many people. That process could allow Ms. Verma and Mr. Price to approve state plans that hew more closely to the Republican vision for health care.
Numerous other health care provider and consumer groups, including the American Diabetes Association, Families USA and the New Hampshire Nurses Association, wrote a joint letter to the administration last month asking it to establish a special enrollment period. The groups argued that forcing people to verify eligibility would not only delay care receipt, it would deter enrollment by healthy customers, endangering the individual-market risk pool, the grouping of customers that determines what the insurers charge for a policy.
Ms. Warren was likely referring to reporting by Sarah Kliff in The Times in November chronicling a rise in hospitals' suing patients over overdue bills.

While people over 65 are more likely to have health problems, they have access to health insurance coverage through the federal Medicare program, Ms. McKernan said. Baby boomers are also more likely to have health insurance, which may contribute to their lower rates of medical debt.
Trump keeps expanding Kushner's bloated portfolio while leaving key agencies woefully understaffed, and that's a sign that he doesn't know how government works, said a former Bush administration official who has had extensive dealings with Kushner.
A Washington Post tally of President Obama's campaign promises found that he kept 11 promises (expand hate crime statutes, insure more Americans, establish a credit-card Bill of Rights), compromised on 12 (end the war in Iraq in 16 months, increase the earned-income tax credit) and failed on 17 (raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation, create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants).
Also on Wednesday, prosecutors filed an indictment, including three counts of assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers using a dangerous weapon, against Robert Gieswein, 24, who is said to be a member of the militia group known as the Three Percenters. The F.B.I. has said Mr. Gieswein, who is from Woodland Park, Colo., posted photos on Facebook in which he is flashing hand signs commonly used by the Three Percenters while posing in front of the group's flag with others in clothing that included the Three Percenters logo.
One thing I see you doing in a lot of your work is trying to reassure Republicans that the stakes of Democratic victories, big-D Democratic victories, Democratic Party victories aren't so existential. That politics is still a contest of ideas that you can lose and it'll be OK. You have a piece about how Republicans should be optimistic in opposition and that you can then win back and it'll be OK. In '06 you wrote this book about Democrats called, Party of Death, which the argument had to do with things like abortion and death with dignity ideas, but obviously was a pretty hot title. I'm curious if watching the escalation of political stakes in people's minds, how you feel about the title and the rhetoric around that looking back?
He's a war hero because he was captured. I like people that weren't captured, O.K.? I hate to tell you.
So Lindsey Graham said, John and I were relevant together. I mean, it was, like, we're sharing a meal together. We're sharing a value system together, and that value system was relevance. And I was confused by the word. I said, what do you mean by that? And he said, relevant is like, in the middle of everything. Relevant is you're making a difference.
This may have spelled the end of a certain mode of reform, but it did little to change reform's association with progressives and liberals — even when it was taken up by their opponents. In 1955, the historian Richard Hofstadter published a book whose title named the period from the 1890s through the 1940s The Age of Reform. He accepted as axiomatic that reformers came from the side of the left in American history. Still, he noted, there was now a tendency among conservative politicians to claim reform and reformer as gauzy, feel-good labels. We usually reserve our highest acclaim for the politician who has in him a touch of the liberal reformer, Hofstadter wrote. As a result, any talented conservative politician learned how to exert his maximal influence by using the rhetoric of progressivism and winning the plaudits of the reformers — while otherwise working against what most progressives would want.
I think knowing that he had a cushion of 13 votes gave him the confidence to make that snap decision and say, look, I don't know if I can hold Collins, Ayotte, and Murkowski for a year from voting for President Obama's nominee, but I'm pretty sure that I can hold 13 Republicans from breaking ranks.
The presidential election will give us a chance to end bullying of many different varieties. If Senator Elizabeth Warren winds up not becoming the nominee, it is possible that one reason for this was voter uncertainty about her Medicare for all proposal. Apparently whenever Americans consider this idea, we are thrown into a panic by the possibility that we will lose our health care insurance, and that it will be replaced by some governmental entity.

Gail: So, we've got a disagreement! Doesn't happen all that often these days, what with the big guy in the White House bringing liberals and conservatives together in bipartisan gaping horror.

What do you think happens next?
Since scolding member nations at the 2017 summit, Mr. Trump has followed up with strongly worded letters to NATO nations advising that if they don't increase their payments, it will be increasingly hard to justify why American soldiers continue to sacrifice their lives overseas.
And the potential benefits are large, as real-world examples attest. Other countries, especially Germany and China, have rapidly expanded their clean-energy production through public subsidies. The United States could do the same. When Washington has invested in nascent industries in the past, the return has been fantastic. The successes have easily paid for the failures. The internet, the pharmaceutical industry and fracking (its environmental impacts aside) are among many examples. In addition to research funding, a Green New Deal could also expand performance standards to sectors beyond utilities, like transportation.
The trouble with both Biden and Sanders is that each, in his own way, seems to believe that he has unique powers of persuasion that will let him defy the harsh reality of today's tribal politics. And this lack of realism could set either of them up for failure.
First, we are giving the opportunity of employment to a quarter of a million of the unemployed.

I definitely think that Sanders was part of it. And if you talk to him, he definitely thinks he was part of it — that he really brought this into the mainstream of our political conversation. But I think there are a couple of other factors. One is that after Trump became president, the first thing he tried to do in legislation was repeal the Affordable Care Act. And, you know, Republicans had a lot of indications that was going to be a good idea. Their voters had been telling them for years that they really didn't like Obamacare and they wanted it to go away. But actually, that turned out to be kind of politically perilous for the Republicans.
Senator Warren's famous paper laying the groundwork for the creation of the C.F.P.B. opens with the sentence, It is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one-in-five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house and later says, Why are consumers safe when they purchase tangible products with cash, but when they sign up for routine financial products like mortgages and credit cards they are left at the mercy of their creditors?
[Machine beeping] The frustrating thing about all of this is it really just feels like it's too little, too late. Like we knew — we knew it was coming. Today is kind of getting worse and worse. We had to get a refrigerated truck to store the bodies of patients who are dying. We are, right now, scrambling to try to get a few additional ventilators or even CPAP machines. If we could get CPAP machines, we could free up ventilators for patients who need them. You know, we now have these five vents. We probably — unless people die, I suspect we'll be back to needing to beg for ventilators again in another day or two. There's a mythical 100 vents out there which we haven't seen. Leaders in various offices, from the president to the head of Health and Hospitals, saying things like, 'We're going to be fine. Everything's fine.' And from our perspective, everything is not fine. I don't have the support that I need, and even just the materials that I need, physically, to take care of my patients. And it's America, and we're supposed to be a first-world country. On a regular day, my emergency department's volume is pretty high. It's about 200 people a day. Now we're seeing 400 or more people a day. At first, we were trying to isolate patients with cough and fever and be more careful around them, but we weren't necessarily being extra careful around all the other patients.
Trump's point seems to be that in a world of ISIS and terrorism, it doesn't matter if a guy grabs women by the genitals. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
So it seems to me, there is some relationship here, some feedback loop between what is happening in the Republican Party, who is leading it, what it is espousing and then what is happening to it in its representation in these institutions. It actually seems to me that a lot of institutions would like to be sort of in the center or not that partisan or even, in some cases, particularly in business, center right have been pushed off of ground they would prefer to be holding and, at the same time, that push has made members of the right feel much more embattled and alone in the American social and power ecosystems.

His remarks come as Mr. Sanders has appeared to gain ground here in South Carolina, a state Mr. Biden has considered his electoral firewall, after the Vermont senator soundly defeated Mr. Biden in the first three nominating contests.
You do see that in the debate you've had so far among policy wonks among, for example, my colleagues at the American Enterprise Institute, some of whom are for the Romney idea and some of whom are against it. Where there's an empirical question about, if you move from our current suite of policies to this policy, what effect does it have on people's incentive to work in various situations? And given this effect on people's incentives what effect would it actually have on work effort? Then there's this other question, which is, how much should we care about that? And particularly for social conservatives, if the question is not, should we scale back our participation in the paid labor force in order to spend more time on video games, but rather should we do that in order to spend more time raising children? Then we should look at it differently and we don't think of a reduction in labor, paid labor supply, as the end of the world or necessarily even a bad thing.
Their plan limited spending for Medicare and turned Medicaid and most other welfare programs over to the states. House Republicans, in particular, were keen on using a shutdown to get Mr. Clinton to sign their bill.

Enrollment in N.Y.C. schools drops sharply, especially among preschool-age children. Children arrive for class on the first day of school reopening in December in Brooklyn. Credit... Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images New York City's school enrollment fell sharply this year, the latest sign that students across the country have left the public school system temporarily or even perhaps permanently during the coronavirus pandemic. Enrollment in the nation's largest public school system, with nearly 1 million students, fell by about 4 percent, or roughly 43,000 students, from the previous year, according to data released by the city on Wednesday. Most of the enrollment drop was concentrated in early grades, especially prekindergarten classes for 3- and-4-year-olds. The decline reflects how some parents are delaying enrollment because of the limitations of remote learning, which are particularly acute for young children, while others are opting for home-schooling, either short-term or indefinitely. The decline in enrollment is sobering news for the school district, which has partially reopened its classrooms while many other large urban school systems have struggled to do so. The new numbers could affect state aid to the city's public school system, though it is not yet entirely clear how. Still, enrollment in New York City has been declining at lower rates for years, as many students have left traditional district schools for charter schools, which now enroll over 100,000 children. Public school enrollment has also declined in states across the country in recent months, including Massachusetts, Montana and Missouri.

The social safety net depends on public support to survive. And one way to generate that support is to make it as strong and expansive as possible, with the most ambitious policies you can bring to fruition. Conservatives understand this in their bones. As Democrats debate their choices and decide on a presidential nominee, they should also keep this lesson uppermost in their minds.
Because of the stimulus bill, the tax credits that help you buy insurance will be higher than ever before — enough to pay for a free silver plan for someone with an annual income of around $19,000, or to lower premiums by as much as $1,000 a month for someone earning around $60,000 in an expensive market. If you go to Healthcare.gov today, you won't see those new prices, but you will still qualify. If you want coverage right away, you will eventually qualify for a refund if you pay too much at first.

But if there is ever going to be a viable claim along these lines, this is it. After all, no court has ever held that the president has the power to consciously aim, in bad faith, to destroy Congress' handiwork. Yet with his attacks on this law, that is precisely what Mr. Trump has been doing. No matter how you feel about Obamacare, we should all care about that.

Analysis: McConnell was done with Trump. The G.O.P. said not so fast. Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, has been circumspect about how the Republican Party can break away from former President Donald J. Trump's grip. Credit... Oliver Contreras for The New York Times Three times in recent weeks, as Republicans grappled with a deadly attack on the Capitol and their new minority status in Washington, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky carefully nudged open the door for his party to kick Donald J. Trump to the curb, only to find it slammed shut. So his decision on Tuesday to join all but five Republican senators in voting to toss out the House's impeachment case against Mr. Trump as unconstitutional seemed to be less a reversal than a recognition that the critical mass of his party was not ready to join him in cutting loose the former president. Far from repudiating Mr. Trump, as it appeared they might in the days after the Jan. 6 rampage at the Capitol, Republicans have reverted to the posture they adopted when he was in office — unwilling to cross a figure who continues to hold outsize sway in their party. For Mr. McConnell, a leader who derives his power in large part from his ability to keep Republicans unified, defying the will of his members would have been a momentous risk, putting his own post in peril and courting the ire of the far right.
With the political madness of recent weeks — the shutdown and the smackdowns, the incitements and the indictments — it's easy to forget there is much actual governing to be done by the new Congress: bills to introduce, nominees to consider and, for House Democrats in particular, oversight of the executive branch to conduct. Major oversight.
Specifically, trade war is causing Republicans considerable grief in farm country. Meanwhile, tariffs appear to be unpopular in industrial states, too. In fact, it's hard to find any large group that likes Trump's trade policy .
But increasing all the services that help connect people with coverage may take time. Biden administration officials may find themselves hamstrung by the lack of pre-existing networks of outreach workers. State officials say such networks were crucial to getting the word out during their extra sign-up periods.
What does it mean for the Republican Party and for Republican Party politicians that in the most recent Pew poll I saw, 64 percent of Republicans think Donald Trump actually won the election, that in a fair vote count, he won? Almost two-thirds of Republicans believe that.
South Africa has given emergency approval to the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and is reviewing applications by rival manufacturers, the country's medicines regulator said on Wednesday. Helen Rees, the chairwoman of the regulator, the South African Health Products board, announced the decision during a news briefing and said that the minister of health would share more details on the country's next steps later in the day.
At a time of pandemic and economic disaster for so many Americans, especially and ironically in states where President Trump has many followers, what does he decide to do? Imperil health care for as many as 23 million of his countrymen. This deplorable timing further convinces me that Mr. Trump is, to use a term coined by James Cowles Prichard in the 1830s, morally insane.
The company's main focus has been selling private insurance under Medicare. Humana released word of its withdrawal on Tuesday after it announced that it would no longer pursue a merger with Aetna, another large insurer. The Justice Department won a legal challenge against the combination last month.
It's a pretty extraordinary step for the president to take sides, not just against a law that's already on the books, but really the biggest piece of social legislation that's been passed in recent history. And he does it at the urging of some of his most conservative advisers in the White House, including the chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney —
Mr. Price, perhaps more than Mr. Trump, has long been committed to the Affordable Care Act's demise. But now he will have to manage the law's many programs. Obama administration officials called insurers, cajoling and reassuring them. If Mr. Trump wants the markets to be vigorous, he could use his self-described deal-making skills to woo insurance companies into the stabilizing markets.
Yes, say policy experts and consumer advocates. Health plans — and subsidies to help low-income consumers pay for premiums — are in place for this year. Healthcare.gov and the state-based insurance marketplaces are open for business, for consumers who do not have job-based coverage and are seeking individual policies.
We're going to have that party who lost a bunch of seats on that in 2018 versus a party that we argue with each other about the best way to try to make sure that people get health care coverage, but at least we're trying to move in that direction. And this is a salient, personal, human fact. Your health care, your housing, getting your kids educated, getting your kids taken care of in child care. Every single one of those, I like where we are. I like where I am in this fight because I think it's the right fight to have and I think we must be in this fight. We cannot take a pass on this.
KK: Senator, a number of your opponents have proposed in various ways either new entitlements or other programs that would give cash directly to low-income families.
So, Mark, where did you start your conversation with Graham?
And you may start out with modest increments and increase them over time, but there's no reason that we should be treating a country that is producing goods through prison labor or child labor or unsafe working standards or by polluting the earth, that we should treat a country that produces goods in that way the same way we're treating a country that produces goods with standards that are much closer to ours. We simply put our own businesses and our own workers at a competitive disadvantage, so we end up doing things like exporting pollution. Can't pollute here in the United States, but move this polluting industry. This way that you're going to paint dolls or produce chips, move it somewhere else where they have no environmental standards and then resell, and then sell those goods back in the United States.
KK: But this isn't expanding the arsenal at all. These are existing weapons that may or may not be in southern Turkey.
Much of the bitter debate over how to repeal and replace the law known as Obamacare has focused on cutting Medicaid and subsidies that help low-income people buy insurance.
But it's reasonable to think that most of the attrition can be attributed to the spike in prices, as the Trump administration concludes.
It seems to me that one of the things that social conservatives in particular, although not only my fellow social conservatives should look at, is this thing that you mentioned about scheduling practices, about these flexible scheduling practices. And it may be — one would want to do some empirical work on if you put restrictions on that what kinds of effects would it have on employment and national — but it may be that you just need to stop companies from being able to engage in these practices, because people need predictable work lives and work schedules. And that, that is a case where competition, as great as competition is in a lot of ways, is not going to lead you to an optimal outcome. Because maybe you can get a little bit of edge from a kind of exploitative practice that undermines the flourishing of families, which is a crucial component of our society's flourishing. And so maybe Republicans and Democrats alike, at the state level at least, should look into restricting these kinds of corporate practices. And I actually was talking about this with somebody we both know as a libertarian and saying, I wonder if there's some way we can solve that, and she just said, well, maybe we should just ban it. And it does seem to me that, that is something you see here and there some interest in it.
No, but look. All right, so what do you want to do? You want just give up? Say, Aw, gee, Mitch McConnell ….  Let's go get the begging bowl and say give me a crumb or two, and I will say thank you. That's what it means now to be a Democrat to the party in opposition.
But there is a plausible argument that Bloomberg's candidacy could be a boon to whoever faces Donald Trump in November. The vast bulk of his money so far has gone not into renting out arenas for campaign rallies or chartering planes to crisscross the country but into advertising: more than $200 million in less than two months. His television and radio ads represent more than three times the combined ad spending of every other Republican and Democratic presidential candidate, save for his fellow billionaire Tom Steyer, over the last year, according to the data firm Advertising Analytics.
Health insurance is supposed to provide access to health care, but it is also a financial product, intended to protect people from catastrophic bills if they are sick or injured. It is still early to measure the health law's full impact, but several studies have found that low-income Americans have become less vulnerable to health-related financial shocks. Studies have found that fewer people struggled with medical bills or avoided medical care because of cost, and that medical debt and bills in collections have declined.
In an email, Rhodes noted that
A nationwide poll conducted by SurveyMonkey for The New York Times found that six in 10 Americans support a wealth tax. The slice of the electorate least likely to support it is Republican men with college degrees.
KK: But does it drive down wages for American workers?
And today, the president summoned G.O.P. lawmakers to the White House for the second time in less than a month, after two versions of a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare failed.
MC: But with particular policies, like not everybody's going to be down with banning fracking altogether, especially in the state of Pennsylvania.
Well, I'll start with 43 million Americans who are dealing with student loan debt. And not all of them are having trouble, but a whole, whole bunch of them are. Or how about the parents of 12 million children who are struggling to find child care? And I'm not just talking about one narrow slice. I'm talking about a whole bunch of parents across a wide range of ZIP codes and income categories who are struggling. I'm talking about the 36 million Americans last year who didn't have prescriptions filled because they simply couldn't afford it. Or the 35 million Americans who didn't go have a lump checked out at the doctor, or some other medical condition, because they were afraid they couldn't afford the — and these are people, most of them, many of them, with insurance, right? Couldn't afford the co-pay, couldn't afford the deductible. I think people are feeling this in their lives right now. And what is the spark, which is what I hear your question to be? It's you show them a path out. It doesn't have to be this way. Can I just say, the first time I think I came to The New York Times was during the financial crisis.
The thing is, both of these claims might well be true! A simple, single-payer system would probably have lower overall costs than a hybrid system that preserves some forms of private coverage.
U.S. names envoy to Iran amid tensions with Tehran and criticism from conservatives. Robert Malley, seen with Secretary of State John Kerry in 2015. Mr. Malley has been tapped by President Biden to be his special envoy for Iran. Credit... Brian Snyder/Reuters President Biden has named Robert Malley, a veteran Middle East expert and former Obama administration official, to be his special envoy for Iran, despite charges from conservatives that Mr. Malley would offer too many concessions in trying to strike a new nuclear deal with Tehran. Two senior State Department officials said Mr. Malley would be responsible for persuading Tehran to rein in its nuclear program — and stop enriching uranium beyond limits imposed by a 2015 deal with world powers — and agree to new negotiations before the United States lifts its bruising economic sanctions against Iran. It is far from clear if the strategy, as directed by Mr. Biden, will succeed. Iran has repeatedly said it will not come back into compliance with the 2015 nuclear accord until the United States eases its sanctions, setting up a high-stakes contest over which side will blink first. Returning to the nuclear deal, which was negotiated by the Obama administration, was among Mr. Biden's campaign promises after President Donald J. Trump withdrew from it in 2018. Since then, Iran has steadily violated the agreement that had sought to limit its nuclear program, and last year, international inspectors concluded that it again had enough fuel to build a bomb.
Setting aside the politics of the upheaval, the mechanics are not obvious, and could cause policymakers enormous headaches. Here are some provisions that would be particularly hard to make disappear or untangle from the health system.
Well, I have concerns. Not about electability, a topic about which nobody knows anything. Never mind what today's general election polls say: What will polling look like after the inevitable Republican smear campaign? The answer to this question depends, in turn, on whether news organizations will cooperate with those smears as gleefully as they did in 2016.
For a clearer definition of exuberances, see: the Green New Deal, Medicare for All and abolishing Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
In 2009, when the Affordable Care Act was being written, Sarah Palin popularized the phrase Obama's 'death panel,' which became a rallying cry for the Tea Party.
Yes. I just think it's got this — no one has to say there is a conflict of interest, and I'm not trying to talk about anyone's individual circumstances, but I think one of the things we have to deal with in public life is the appearance of conflict of interest. You know, that's supposed to be the guiding principle, for example, for judges. It's not whether or not there is a conflict of interest, it's whether or not people in the public could reasonably be concerned that it were, because it's important that you believe that judges are acting independently and not influenced because they're going to get money or someone in their family is going to get money. And so that's where I think the analogy is the closest, and whether you make it a rule of ethics or whether do you actually just make it part of the law, I think is a fair question, but I get why we should push in that direction.
BS: What do you say about disenfranchisement? Forgive me for not knowing.
And what he did was he proved that blame for gridlock ends up being directed towards the party in power, and that the minority can really easily deflect blame simply by saying, well, you guys are in power, figure out a way to get things done. And if you sort of spread it out over time — and I remember this having been there and trying to sort of mount communications campaigns to lay the blame at Republicans' feet — it's really hard because people just don't want to hear it. They don't want to hear it. It sounds like excuses. And it's diffuse. It happens over weeks and months. There are very few action-forcing points where you can use to hang the blame. So McConnell carried out that experiment. He proved the Republicans suffered, really, no blame at all. And then they have this massive success in the 2010 midterms taking back the House, gaining upwards of 50 seats in the House and seven seats in the Senate, taking Democrats down from 60 seats all the way to 53. So there's just really no question that his experiment worked and proved that obstruction in our current polarized environment is a successful political strategy for the party that's out of power.
archived recording (mick mulvaney) And it's hard to know where to begin when you're talking about how bad the current health care legislation is for small business.
At least a half-dozen Republican senators have expressed doubts about the Republican leadership strategy of using the budget resolution to fast-track legislation to repeal the law, with a delayed effective date to allow time to find a replacement in the future.
Mr. Trump's criticism of Mr. Obama for his handling of the Russian hacking, both in his recent tweets and in a TV interview over the weekend, seemed to be a tacit admission, for the first time, that Russia did attempt to undermine Hillary Clinton through hacking and the dissemination of fake news on social media.
If people participate in different numbers, in bigger numbers, if it changes the type of people who want to participate in the spring election that's not necessarily always seen the biggest turnout, that changes who can win.
It is about whether they will protect America's political institutions or turn to tearing them down. But parties don't act or evolve in vacuums. They are shaped by institutions. They are shaped by their internal institutions and the broader systems in which they operate, and that's why I wanted to have Yuval Levin on the show today. Yuval is the director of social, cultural, and constitutional studies at the American Enterprise Institute, as well as the author of a bunch of great books, but most recently, A Time to Build, which I highly recommend. He's someone who's been trying to reform the Republican Party for a long time. He's served in the Bush administration. He's very influential with more traditionally conservative Republicans in Congress. And importantly, he thinks in institutions, not just candidates or messages. And so that's what I wanted to talk to him about. What is the Republican Party? What has it become? And how can the institutions that are driving that evolution be made more responsible? How can the institutions that surround not just the Republican Party, but the Democratic Party, force them to be better, help them to be healthier, make sure politics is about what is done for real people, how people's lives are changed and not symbolic fights, not just who rules? Yuval and I have been debating some of these questions for years now. And as you'll hear, there's quite a lot we disagree on, but these are the kinds of discussions that need to be had.
From most people's perspective, yes, he was not a Democrat. He voted against overtime. He voted against Obamacare. He voted against the Dream Act in 2010. It just was clear: He was not only out of step with the district, but really out of step with the Democratic platform.
Mr. Biden pressed the point on Wednesday. He's gone after every corporation in the world — I don't disagree on all of it with him, Mr. Biden said. But I have not seen him go after the gun manufacturers.
KK: O.K., Kristen's going to kill me, but thank you so much for coming.
• We will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts of information before we changed our platform to dramatically reduce data access in 2014, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious activity.
Editors at The Times also consulted dictionaries. And they had some prior experience with the matter, having approved the use of the L word once before in reference to Mr. Trump.
So this is one of my things where I recommend not so much a show as a performance within a show. But I'm going to recommend Meryl Streep's performance on the second season of Big Little Lies on HBO. The season as a whole has been a little bit more forced. But Streep has showed up, basically, as the mother of a character who was killed by the female characters in the first season. It's sort of a cliche to praise a Meryl Streep performance, but it really is just a tremendous performance as this particular kind of older, WASP-y, slightly passive-aggressive—
The Super Tuesday-first strategy often gave Mr. Bloomberg the only political microphone in many of these states, as candidates with fewer resources had to focus most of their television budgets on Iowa and New Hampshire. In some mid-size markets, he remains the only candidate on air.
That's a nice one. I like that. So look, I think it's one of the things that, as a country, it's time for us to take it on.
BS: Right. You have a lot of people in this country who actually, if you asked them about Obamacare, they hate it. These are the same people who are being wounded by the constant diminution of medical care under the Trump administration. How do you convince those people? That's the issue, because he's talking about fake news and disbelief. We had the whole discussion about death committees.
The latest example: According to Bloomberg Politics, a Trump campaign staffer emailed surrogates on Sunday telling them not to talk about the Trump University case. Mr. Trump had been facing criticism for his racist comments about the judge in that case, Gonzalo Curiel, and the email told surrogates, The best possible response is 'the case will be tried in the courtroom in front of a jury — not in the media.'
A 2-cent wealth tax, and now let's talk about what kind of change we could make. Two cents, and we can do universal child care. We can put $800 billion into our public schools. We can make a federal commitment for the first time in history to public education K-12, and we can do the same thing for college, and we can cancel student loan debt, and an enormous boost to our economy.
I've heard you make this argument on another podcast, I think was on 5:38, where you argued that a lot of 2024 hopefuls have learned the wrong lesson from Trump in 2016. That Trump won largely because he was seen as a moderate in the party, not because he just played to the base. That's a challenging argument to hear at this moment, so give it to me in more detail.
Their candidates were presented as the patriarchs, protecting the house from invaders with dark skin.
Look what Frances Perkins got accomplished, first in Albany, but then when she went down to Washington. So here's a woman, she goes to Albany at a time when women don't even have the vote and gets herself appointed the head of a fire commission. And by the way, every time you see one of those lit-up fire exit signs, thank Frances Perkins, O.K.? But she not only does that, she then immediately expands it into labor law and workers and worker safety and worker protection overall. As you know, she then goes down to Washington, becomes the first woman cabinet official, and look at what she gets done in a short period of time. Social security, minimum wage, right to join a union, end of child labor, the weekend, my personal favorite [LAUGHTER], that Saturdays and Sundays are not treated like Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. But think about it that way. So we start with the corruption. That's what Perkins started with. She started by outing the corruption.
Unraveling the Affordable Care Act would deal a catastrophic blow to the safety net. The health exchanges and new insurance regulations? Gone. Medicaid expansion, which even in its truncated form has reached people in 36 states? Gone. The host of protections for people who get health care through jobs and private insurers? Gone. Republican elites might cheer this destruction, but soon enough they would face millions of voters who pulled levers in 2016 believing that Trump and the Republican Party would protect them.
So if you could rewrite the rule, how would it read?
And then we started to realize that patients who were coming in with no fever but abdominal pain actually had findings on their X-rays and chest CTs that were consistent with this coronavirus, Covid-19. So someone in a car accident gets brought in and we get a CT scan of them, and their lungs look like they have coronavirus. We were seeing a lot of patients who probably had Covid, but we didn't realize. Ten residents and also many, many of our nurses and a few of the attending physicians got sick. The anxiety of this situation is really overwhelming. All of the doctors, it's hard for us to get tested even if we want to, even if we have symptoms. We're exposed over and over again. We don't have the protective equipment that we should have. I put on one N95 mask in the morning. I need to have that N95 mask on for every patient I see. I don't take it off all day. The N95 mask I wore today is also the N95 mask I wore on Friday. We're always worried that we'll be out of N95 masks. What's a little bit scary now is the patients that we're getting are much sicker. Many of the young people who are getting sick don't smoke, they're healthy, they have no co-morbidities. They're just young, regular people between the ages of 30 and 50 who you would not expect to get this sick.
Cambridge, Mass. — I've been at Harvard University for 17 years, but I've never been in a classroom here. I'm a cook in the dining halls. I work in the cafeteria at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health, where every day I serve amazing students studying medicine, nutrition and child welfare, as well as the doctors and researchers who train them.
Yet not all is lost on the issue for Republicans. Many Democrats, by rushing toward a single-payer Medicare for All plan, are being pulled along by ideological yearnings instead of practical realities. Medicare for All would upend all current public and private insurance arrangements, including employer coverage for about 180 million people. Further, even the sponsors admit these plans would require significant middle-class tax increases.
Several members of the Trump family have come under fire for profiting from Donald Trump's administration in possible violation of the emoluments clause, including Ivanka Trump, who was paid more than $1 million from her ties to the Trump Organization last year. And former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter held a lucrative position on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. In late September, Ms. Warren was, in the words of one reporter, uncharacteristically flustered when asked about the Biden matter.
But the president has filled up his press conferences with so many titans of business and industry — most of them lining up for an introduction — that we're on titan overload.
There are some things that may change that, but, really, what we find is that people who have voted in the past are likely to vote, and people who have not voted in the past are not likely to vote, said Amos Budde, a data scientist at Civis.
I'll try this one last time, although I know I'm not going to fully convince you on this. But I agree with you that we need a lot of experimentation, but it seems that we are locked in a system that cannot experiment. Whether you liked all of HR1 or not, and I can understand why you might not, the truth is, with the filibuster, none of it's going to pass because you can't put it in budget reconciliation. And one thing that I think is a really, really big problem in the system, we talked earlier about how a lot of the energy in politics has moved off of straightforward economics issues to things that get grouped into social issues, I would also say to things that should be understood is democracy issues, practically on the Democratic side, a lot of energy around voting rights issues. As you know, but I'll say for those in the audience who don't, the filibuster imposes a 60-vote requirement on almost everything, but there is a pathway called budget reconciliation, which can only be used a couple of times during a presidency and has a lot of very weird strictures on it. But one of them is you can get some things in there and protect it from the filibuster, as long as it is primarily related to spending and taxing, as long as it is primarily budgetary.
Murkowski is one of only a handful of Republican senators who have shown some degree of independence from Trump. The Republican dissenters fall into a few categories. There are the critics, the most vociferous of whom are Jeff Flake and Bob Corker, both senators who are not running for re-election. There are the strayers, among them Murkowski and Collins, who have criticized Trump and also voted against him on major legislation. Rand Paul, the staunch libertarian, votes with Trump less often than any other Republican senator, but he has also gone out of his way to defend him. Lindsey Graham votes with the president slightly more often than Murkowski and Collins, but he joins them in yet another category: the pragmatists. Those senators have staked out the now-controversial position that they would rather get something done than nothing, even if it means compromising with Democrats. Murkowski, who has exercised her independence in all three ways, has nonetheless managed to bring back to her state its most long-desired spoils — more opportunities for drilling and more opportunities for building in previously protected wilderness.
Democratic lawmakers have a few questions for Alexander Acosta. President Trump's labor secretary has been summoned to appear before the House Oversight and Reform Committee to explain his role in the 2008 plea deal given to Jeffrey Epstein, the wealthy financier accused of sexually abusing and trafficking scores of teenage girls.
So what has Schultz done to deserve his Two Minutes Hate? His political views bear about as much resemblance to those of a typical conservative as an olive does to a grape. He supports Obamacare, denounced the Trump administration's decision to leave the Paris Climate Accord, and promised to hire 10,000 refugees globally in response to the 2017 travel ban. He was raised in a Brooklyn housing project and was the first person in his family to go to college. His billions were fairly earned offering products and services people want.
Of 138 people tested in Hai Duong, 72 were positive for the virus, Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long said, according to a recording of comments made at an urgent meeting on the sidelines of the Communist Party congress. All of those patients work at a local electronics factory, local news media reported. The first worker found to have contracted the virus is said to have had contact with a Vietnamese national who later traveled to Japan, where he tested positive for the variant that has spread in Britain. The other 10 cases appear to have originated with a worker at Van Don International Airport in Quang Ninh Province who was responsible for taking arriving passengers to quarantine.
President Obama's health care battles foreshadow some of what Senator Warren might face in trying to institute her single-payer system. Mr. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in March 2010 after a protracted fight in Congress, and by November 2011 the Supreme Court had agreed to hear a case challenging its constitutionality.
The prices are significantly higher than those that existed before Obamacare and, nationally, expensive premiums have long been a pain point for the Affordable Care Act. But the plans that exist now offer a wider set of benefits and cannot limit annual or lifetime benefits. That's a key trade-off that Obamacare's architects felt was worth making: a requirement that insurers cover a wide range of medical conditions, even if that meant plans became more expensive.
But it's hard. It's a lot easier not to take on the drug industry. It's a lot easier not to take on the insurance industry. It's a lot easier not to take on the oil industry. But every single issue we care about, every single issue — think about it on climate. All across this country people are saying climate, climate, climate. If you're not willing to take on the corruption, we're going to get laws passed that are going to have great names: Save the World; Everything Is Green; Now Safe for Unicorns.
Nancy Pelosi, the House Democratic leader, cited news reports indicating that insurers around the country were using Trump administration policies to justify 2019 rate increases, in Maine, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Virginia and Washington, among other states.
I think it's almost hard to underestimate how disruptive it would be. Just to give one example, right now we have private health insurance companies that cover most Americans. These are big corporations. They're among the largest and most —
I would offer Bernie Sanders $50,000 to debate, absolutely, he said, referring to the Vermont senator. What in the world does this have to do with her being a woman?
A 2017 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that generic competition has weakened in recent decades, leading to higher prices for generics. EpiPen and insulin prices, in particular, have skyrocketed. Senator Warren's Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would authorize the government to manufacture active ingredients for medications or contract outside entities to manufacture generic drugs and lower prices. But Senator McConnell has railed against socialist price controls in the health care system.
JW: So you think a constitutional amendment?
But that's my point. It doesn't. That's what I just said.
Mark Zuckerberg has held the line on Facebook's decision to allow political ads, even as Twitter banned them. The company's approach came under scrutiny after it said Mr. Trump's re-election campaign would be allowed to run an ad with false claims about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter. Mr. Zuckerberg said this is about free speech and not the profit motive.
Oklahoma was also the first state to ask the Trump administration for permission to convert its Medicaid program to block grant funding, an idea strongly pushed by Mr. Trump's health appointees. The state would receive a lump-sum payment from the federal government to run the program with additional flexibility. Opponents of that proposal worry that such a funding formula could struggle to keep up with increased enrollment in an economic downturn.
Lauren Kelley: Sure. I wanted to ask about reproductive rights.
I'm sorry, say it again. Facebook?
Which I would say is like, you see that in a lot of QAnon people, you see it in Donald Trump post-election stuff, and you see it in the Republican Party, where most House Republicans voted to reject the results of the election. I mean, at some point, I think you have to say, however people feel in their heart of hearts, once you're willing to say publicly you believe this then it becomes harder not to act as if you believe it.
Being relevant to Donald Trump, being in his orbit, helps me influence the things that I think are good for our country. And then —
NATO members agreed, in 2014, to a goal of spending 2 percent of their G.D.P. on defense, but in 2017 the only countries to meet that goal were America, Britain, Greece, Poland and Estonia. Mr. Trump chastised fellow member states at a 2017 summit, declaring that 23 of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should.
I don't think you have to wait, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority leader, told reporters this week. I would move through and repeal and then go to work on replacing. I think once it's repealed, you will have hopefully fewer people playing politics, and everybody coming to the table to find the best policy.
The tension between incremental and transformative change has been a feature of the 2020 campaign. Mr. Obama, for instance, weighed in to say that the typical American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system, an implicit critique of Senator Warren's and Senator Sanders's campaigns.
I would have to say the answer to that is probably the military, and it's not a coincidence that the military is also the one national institution that Americans say they trust in large numbers. I don't think that's just because the military is good at what it does, but because it takes men and women and turns them into soldiers and Marines and airmen and so forth. And we have a sense that they come out better than they came in. When somebody tells you that they went to Harvard, you might think, well, that's a smart person. She got into Harvard. When somebody tells you they went to the Naval Academy, you think, that's a serious person. And it's not because they got in but because the Navy somehow made them that way. I think we have a very strong sense that the military is in the business of forming people. And if more institutions thought about how they look in this respect — are we approaching the country in a way that says, we take people and make them better or our people or people you can trust — I think we'd be in better shape.
Her financing plan drew heavy fire as misguided and unrealistic, including from some of her Democratic competitors. Former Vice President Joe Biden's campaign dismissed it as mathematical gymnastics, while Mr. Sanders charged it wasn't progressive enough and would have a very negative impact on creating jobs. Around this time, Ms. Warren's poll numbers and fund-raising took a turn for the worse.
Go deeper: The virtual shutdown of much of China's economy is hurting business around the world, including multinational firms, truck drivers and tour guides. All our planning has been turned upside down, said Michael Smerling, the owner of a company in the U.S. whose Chinese suppliers have been shut down.
Whoever gets the Democratic nomination, she or he will run in part on proposals to increase government spending. And you know what that will mean: There will be demands that the candidate explain how all this will be paid for. Many of those demands will be made in bad faith, from people who never ask the same questions about tax cuts. But there are some real questions about the fiscal side of a progressive agenda.
Let me ask you both something, which is if there's one thing Donald Trump is good at, it's manipulating public opinion.
The United States doesn't have a meaningful cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions, he pointed out. The private insurance markets in Obamacare have been undermined by President Trump and other Republicans. The Earned Income Tax Credit isn't nearly as large as it could be.
It looks like the beginning of the end for Obamacare as we know it.
You know on part of this, I think part of the answer is current law enforcement. You correctly describe it, in harassing people, in trespassing. And we need to make sure at federal, state, and local levels that people who are seeking health care of any kind have access to that health care and are not denied that opportunity. I think our laws are there. I think the weakness is our failure to enforce. That's how I see now. If there are gaps in that, I'm certainly open to understanding them better, but that's how I see it.
Reed: Another idea, floated by Donald Trump — who would do away with the exchanges in any event — is to induce competition by allowing insurers to sell across state lines. But, as you've written, that may not work any better to give people a wider choice of plans at better prices. If Hillary Clinton wins, what do you think the political odds are for adopting something like the public option? Do you think Congress would go along? Would state legislatures?
At that point, all the candidates will be able to do is wait: for the verdict and, they hope, for one of those elusive tickets out of Iowa.
Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., noted this trend on Thursday during a call with reporters.
No, I think it's right, and I think I took a similar approach to McConnell in my book, the chapter on this episode — I call it The Uniter — because what McConnell was essentially doing was uniting the two wings of his party. The judges was the one issue where the establishment wing of the Republican Party could reliably unite with the Tea Party base. And he had that insight. And it ended up being the glue that held those two sides together and led a lot of establishment Republicans to hold their nose and vote for Trump and potentially provide the margin of victory. In his book, Carl Hulse, The New York Times correspondent, argues that this was the decisive factor potentially. So no, I think it's absolutely correct. What's important to remember is that Republicans controlled the Senate Majority at the time. So one way to think about this is, what would we do as liberals if Chuck Schumer had been Majority Leader, and Donald Trump had nominated a Supreme Court justice? You can just imagine how the resistance base would have freaked out and told Schumer not to bring up Trump's Supreme Court nominee. So, expecting McConnell to have done differently is, in some ways, expecting him to defy the structural incentives that he's operating under.
CW: Sure. And they have too much power, not just in an economy, they have too much power in a democracy, and they keep consolidating and expanding — are you worried about individual employees there? You know, Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel.
The stalemates that have come to define the budget process have helped set the stage for repeated shutdown showdowns. It is a broken process that has enabled and empowered partisan bad faith by setting up a situation in which everything is riding on a few enormous bills. So lawmakers try to hook other priorities — immigration, say, or health care — to must pass legislation in hopes of using the leverage to push them through.
Sometimes Democratic leanings, other times Republican? Check.

Rhiana Gunn-Wright, a 29-year-old Rhodes scholar, works for the think tank New Consensus and helped design the Green New Deal. When I spoke with her, I was struck by her sense of political realism and how different it was from the old definition. For a long time, environmental activists have shown an almost compulsive — and in many ways admirable — honesty. They have chosen policies, like carbon taxes, that emphasize the downsides: Energy prices will rise. The Green New Deal and the recent clean-energy ballot initiatives do the reverse. They emphasize the benefits of clean energy and minimize the downsides. There is a lot of anxiety and uncertainty in America today, Gunn-Wright said. Any solution that is tied to tangible economic benefits is going to have a better chance of passing.
Global Roundup South Korea races to tamp down an outbreak in schools, and other news from around the world. Disinfecting a missionary training school in Gwangju, South Korea, on Wednesday. Religious groups in South Korea have driven several coronavirus outbreaks. Credit... Yonhap/EPA, via Shutterstock The South Korean health authorities said on Wednesday that they were conducting mandatory testing of dozens of religious schools, as the country struggled to tackle a wave of cases linked to a Christian missionary society. South Korea reported 559 new cases on Wednesday, including 100 linked to a school in the southern city of Gwangju. That school is one of six operated by International Mission, a Christian missionary society, that have collectively reported more than 300 infections this month. Yoon Tae-ho, a senior health official, told reporters on Wednesday that the health authorities were conducting mandatory or recommended testing of people at 32 of International Mission's facilities. The group is based in the based in the central city of Daejeon and operates schools across the country. International Mission apologized on Monday, saying in a statement that it thought the infections could have been influenza, not the coronavirus. Religious groups in South Korea have driven several coronavirus outbreaks, including one linked to the Shincheonji Church of Jesus last winter in the southeastern city of Daegu. An antigovernment demonstration led by a Christian church in Seoul last summer also contributed to a sharp rise in cases, forcing the government to implement tighter social distancing restrictions.
This is a critical step forward, the first step toward bringing relief from this failed law, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said.
No, but look. All right, so what do you want to do? You want just give up? Say, Aw, gee, Mitch McConnell ….  Let's go get the begging bowl and say give me a crumb or two, and I will say thank you. That's what it means now to be a Democrat to the party in opposition.
The future of America's health insurance system has already been a huge part of the 2020 presidential race. At campaign events over the past year, voters have shared stories of cancer diagnoses, costly medications and crushing medical debt.
Oh, I'm not going to do names.
The brief version is: The Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the health law was legal even though it overreached in requiring people to buy health insurance, because that requirement — known as the mandate — wasn't really a requirement. People could choose not to have insurance and instead pay a fee, which meant that the mandate was more akin to a tax on the uninsured. Congress clearly has the right to impose taxes.
Of course, polls also showed Obamacare to be unpopular in 2013. More important, recent polls showed that most voters didn't believe the government should be shut down over the Dreamers. Most polls also showed support for the Democrats slipping as the debate dragged on. And as I explained in my column yesterday, there is abundant evidence that a prolonged debate over illegal immigration helps Republicans, not Democrats.
Most Americans have probably never heard of Leonard A. Leo, who has long served as executive vice president of the Federalist Society, an organization of conservatives and libertarians who place a premium on individual liberty, traditional values and the rule of law. But as Mr. Trump begins the process of filling what could be the most federal court vacancies left to any president in nearly a half-century, Mr. Leo is playing a critical role in reshaping the judiciary.
There are places like this — traditionally Democratic, white working-class areas where Mr. Obama still showed important strength — across the Northern United States. In Pennsylvania alone, there are similar regions along the Beaver River — north of Pittsburgh — or in the Scranton-Wilkes Barre area in northeast Pennsylvania. There's Youngstown and Warren, Ohio — or a whole strip of towns along Lake Erie, from Toledo, Ohio, back to Erie, Pa. Many of these same areas broke heavily for Mr. Trump in the Republican primary.
After Senator Warren said during the October debate that the United States should get out of the Middle East, her campaign clarified that she was referring just to combat troops. Noncombat troops have long been stationed in the region for a variety of reasons including ensuring a free flow of oil.
Clinton notes that Trump has insulted not only women but also Muslims, Latinos, the disabled, and others. He's an equal opportunity bigot. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
The White House budget is generally viewed as a political messaging document. Congress, which is responsible for approving government spending, is under no requirement to adhere to White House requests. Lawmakers have previously rejected many of Mr. Trump's attempts to gut domestic programs.
THE final deadline for enrolling in health insurance for 2017 under the Affordable Care Act is on Tuesday. But with so much turmoil and uncertainty surrounding the law's future, should consumers bother to shop for coverage?
But though the discharge petition had stalled, King and Heritage Action could justifiably declare a victory of principle and, eventually, an I-told-you-so. Overall, those who pledged fealty to repealing Obamacare fared better that November than those who didn't. As King told me recently: The Barry Jacksons and the John Cornyns were clearly wrong. Look at what happened to the Blue Dogs in 2010. There were 53 of them when Obamacare passed. Now I don't know if you can count three of them. King was exaggerating, but not by much — there are 18 members of Congress's Blue Dog Coalition today. Pelosi made them walk the plank, and they fell like tenpins after that. Since then, I don't think there's been a freshman Republican who didn't run on the full repeal of Obamacare.
Here are some questions and answers about medical debt:
After vetting Chinese suppliers of masks, gowns, face shields and swabs, another call by Mr. Benioff, to the FedEx C.E.O. Fred Smith, secured planes and trucks for distribution. As David writes:
Well, that's a hard question. I don't know the answer to that. I'm sure there's a range. I've been reading Mike Konczal's Freedom from the Market, which I'm finding very interesting. I disagree with it, but it's learned and thoughtful and smart. But I bet you could recommend some books to me that I wouldn't think of.
Medicare goes away, it's a new Medicare system, Mr. Biden said. It may be as good, you may like it as well, it may or may not, but the transition of dropping 300 million people on a totally new plan, I think is a little risky at this point.
You know, this is a hard hypothetical to take on until you actually know what's happening. Again, you've got to back this one up on where we should have started. When the unrest first started unfolding in Hong Kong, for Donald Trump to step back and say in effect, gee, I think China's going to crack down on Hong Kong, and effectively inviting it, I think is the wrong place for the United States to be. I think that we should have been in a position from the beginning, saying to China, we support these efforts in Hong Kong. That's part one.
Some of its agreements were struck weeks after those reached by the United States and Britain. AstraZeneca and some European opposition politicians say that the delay put the bloc at the back of the line for deliveries. The commission has challenged those claims.

One more player hires more lobbyists, spends more money on campaign contributions, puts more money into bought-and-paid-for experts and think tanks so that nothing will change.

Well, I would take the combat troops out of there now. I see no immediate reason we'd send combat troops into the region, but I'd get the combat troops that are there now out.
Senator Sanders's idea is that everyone in America would have access to health insurance that's provided by the government that covers a wide array of medical services, and for which they do not have to pay any money when they go to the doctor.
Following the change in administration, the deputy solicitor general, Edwin S. Kneedler, wrote to the justices, the Department of Justice has reconsidered the government's position in these cases. The purpose of this letter is to notify the court that the United States no longer adheres to the conclusions in the previously filed brief of the federal respondents.
We are rightly proud of the high standards of medical care we know how to provide in the United States.
Yes. I do think that the Europeans need to bear a significant share of the cost of defense of Europe. I don't think that hectoring or embarrassing them is a way to get there. I think we get there by talking about the ways that work best for them on the ground, but I do think it's important. It's an important partnership, and it should be a partnership.
A further amendment added another $15 billion, to create a program called invisible risk sharing. The legislation is fairly vague about how the program would work, but authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to set up another program to reimburse health insurers for very sick patients with the funds.
BA: Are tariffs the leverage that you use to secure those types —
But Bannon — Bannon is right about the Democrats. But if Trump is the one talking about race, that doesn't help him. Right? I mean we went through this with the midterm elections. Trump went out and talked up the border caravan and how the Democrats were going to let illegal aliens into the country as his closing argument. And there's no evidence that it worked. Trump is helped when the media elevates Ilhan Omar or A.O.C. as the face of the Democratic Party because they are far left. And I think most voters aren't remotely close to where they are. But if Trump is the one doing race talk, I think he's losing.
March 4, 2020, 12:02 a.m. ET March 4, 2020, 12:02 a.m. ET In Texas, there are two wins for the chosen candidates of the Washington incumbents. Image Representative Kay Granger at a subcommittee hearing on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., on Thursday. Credit... T.J. Kirkpatrick for The New York Times Representative Kay Granger, Republican of Texas, fended off the most expensive and brutal challenge of her political career. Her opponent, Chris Putnam, a former technology executive backed by more than $1 million in spending, had attacked her for voting on massive spending bills and failing to show unwavering loyalty to President Trump. But shortly before midnight on the East Coast, Ms. Granger received a call from Mr. Putnam conceding the race, her campaign staff said. The primary in her district, Texas's 12th, is all but guaranteed to decide the general election's outcome. In the Texas Senate race, M.J. Hegar, who has the blessing of the Senate Democratic campaign arm, earned a spot in the primary runoff. Whoever wins that runoff will go on to challenge the Republican Senator John Cornyn. Read more
So whenever people are being paid outside the legal system, it undercuts protection for everyone and gives an advantage to the employers who move outside the legal system. You know, look, it's part of the same basic principle. Everybody should follow the same set of rules. And if our labor standards are there's a $15-an-hour minimum wage, then everybody should pay it. If the labor standards are that you don't get to put somebody up working in an elevator shaft who has no training, then every employer should have to follow that. And any time an employer can get the work done by not following the rules, that employer gets an unfair advantage, and that unfair advantage undercuts the strength of everybody who follows the rules, undercuts the economy, undercuts workers.
Advocates for Medicaid beneficiaries said they disagreed with the Trump administration's assertion, in approving Kentucky's plan, that work requirements were consistent with the goals of Medicaid because work could improve people's health.
For a governor known for his fixation with polls (he has spent nearly $300,000 on them since the start of 2017), the anti-Trump strategy is informed by months of focus groups and survey research, according to people involved with the campaign. Mr. Cuomo has rotated the issues he has challenged Mr. Trump on — immigration, abortion and guns most loudly of late — but the broader frame of him leading the charge against the White House has been the same.
And how did much of the Republican Party respond? By criticizing the four women at least as much as Trump— it's the latest sign that Republicans appear to be approaching full Trumpification. What Trump wants, it seems, many Republicans are happy to do. Ross, I realize this may not be your favorite kind of discussion in which Michelle and I ask you to answer for the outrages of Donald Trump and the Republican Party. But here we go. So what did you think about the reaction of other Republicans to Trump's comments this week?

We had a fire, and the fire there was millions of people who lost their homes, but the fire by itself doesn't get it done. The fire by itself wasn't enough. You had to be ready with the big structural change and had to have somebody from the inside who would fight for it.
These steps destabilize the health care system and will increase costs and undermine patient protections for millions of Americans, said Representative Robert C. Scott of Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Education and Workforce Committee, where Mr. Azar testified.
I have not finished reading the report, but they look like they've laid out their ducks. The Trump administration evidently does not wish to put up a defense and call its own witnesses. In fact, it seems to be still in the process of trying to block witnesses from coming and block documents from exposure. Yeah. And look, I think they've got enough. And if they've got enough, it can't be that the House impeachment process is the tail that gets wagged by Donald Trump based on when he's willing to allow access to various witnesses or various documents. Not even Richard Nixon tried to stop people from testifying or tried to stop the House from getting access to documentation. So they've got what they've got. If it's enough, then go forward.
America regularly renegotiates its defense cost-sharing agreements with host countries. In November, Mr. Trump asked Japan to quadruple its payments for the American troop presence.

And that language of who rules, of the great middle of the country exercising the power it's entitled to, is very much a part of the language of the populist tradition in America. But of course, there's a politics of who rules on the left, too. It takes the form of a certain kind of identity politics, of counting minorities and women and the first this and the first that. And these things matter to people. They're important. I don't mean to degrade it. But I think that the question for us in the coming years is whether we can move a little more in the direction of a politics of what does government do and less of a politics of who rules on both the left and the right. I think the health of both parties depends on that being possible.
Right. And that's the position they held for about a week.
Right. We had talked about this with you during the midterms — that there had been this huge public shift on Obamacare and that voters who might have previously been against it now do not want it taken away.
Right. Even though it does redouble the loyalty of his base.
Towards a policy direction that would make it more reasonable for Republicans to say they are actually a working person's party, or as you'll hear in this, appearance party. One of those Republicans is Ramesh Ponnuru. Ramesh is senior editor at The National Review. He's a columnist at Bloomberg View, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Somebody I don't always agree with, but I always try and read and listen to. As always, my email is ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. Here's, Ramesh. So let me start here. If Republicans had passed another big COVID stimulus, prior to November, maybe one as Donald Trump wanted with $2,000 checks, do you think Trump wins a second term and Republicans keep the Senate?
There were, first, a series of social movements: There was the Clapham sect. This was a group of evangelical leaders, arising from the general religious revival, that sought to eradicate slavery, spread the faith, discourage indebtedness, build Sunday schools, reform behavior and basically spread what we now call Victorian morality.
So, first off, investment – typically spending on infrastructure or research, but there may be some room at the margin for including spending on things like childhood development in the same category. The defining characteristic here is that it's spending that will enhance society's future productivity. How should we pay for that kind of outlay?
Jesse Wegman: Senator, I want to just take you back for a moment to Mara's question about swing states and swing state voters and your point about large structural changes that people warn you off. The other day, you repeated your argument that you wanted to be the last president to win the Electoral College and the first to win the national popular vote. How do you expect — I'm assuming you're not talking about a constitutional amendment. How do you expect to get there in five years, unless you're the president, unless you win the Electoral College and Donald Trump wins the popular vote in 2020?

Indeed, turning us back into that kind of country is the G.O.P.'s true goal, and is what will happen if the party gets its way either as a result of the current lawsuit or through legislation during a second Trump term.
We have more filibusters than ever and less compromise than ever, more party-line votes than ever. We have more filibusters than ever and more moments of divided government. As Francis Lee has noted, this has actually been the most competitive era in American government ever, and we have less cooperation than ever. The parties are bitterly divided. And I think that my argument, which really traces back to something you were saying, is that politics is healthier when it is about what we do. Because then at least electorates can say, well, we elected the Republicans, and they did this tax bill or they got rid of Obamacare, which they promised to do, but I didn't like that because my sister had health insurance through Obamacare, and I didn't realize she was going to have health insurance anymore. So I'm going to vote for the Democrats. Or you can elect the Democrats, and they pass a Green New Deal or Medicare For All or whatever it might be, and maybe you like that or maybe you don't. But what we're in now, we're actually just endlessly caught in the bickering phase. We are caught in unpleasant, angry political negotiations that mostly don't go anywhere. And so politics becomes less about what we do than, as you put it, who rules. I feel like if your view on this was right, politics would look better right now, and these various blockages we have would encourage compromise.
Re Don't Try to Fix Obamacare. Abolish It (Op-Ed, March 16):
But in the last few years, the years of Obama's Caesarism and Trump's caudillo act and Congress's utter uselessness, I've developed a limited sympathy for Kennedy's imperial approach. If he contributed to our republic's deformation he did not act alone, and what he delivered was, in some sense, what both the political class and the public increasingly desire from their government: not republican deliberation but quasi-monarchical action.
And why is that, Margot? Why is this idea during this period of nationalized medicine, government-run health care — why is it being limited to such small groups of Americans?
And I know it's tough between here and there. I was in a very tough primary back in 2012 and I wasn't in any primary at all in 2018, so those are my two electoral experiences.
Because of the stimulus bill, the tax credits that help you buy insurance will be higher than ever before — enough to pay for a free silver plan for someone with an annual income of around $19,000, or to lower premiums by as much as $1,000 a month for someone earning around $60,000 in an expensive market. If you go to Healthcare.gov today, you won't see those new prices, but you will still qualify. If you want coverage right away, you will eventually qualify for a refund if you pay too much at first.
That, in turn, prompted an increased frequency of small shutdowns as politicians struggled with deadlines, said Roy T. Meyers, a political science professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who has written about the history of shutdowns.

Now, that's only for collective bargaining agreements, but that's real money in the pockets of those union numbers. Secondly, what at least some of the unions liked about this is the unions never have to bargain on this one again, once you get all the way to Medicare for all, because their workers will have health care coverage. Which means they can bargain once again over wages and working conditions and keeping jobs here in the United States instead of having to go back to their members year after year after year and say: We just bargained. Great for you. Your salary will go up one half of 1 percent, and your deductible will only go up by another $2,000.

And then the third thing that I think that happens is the Democrats are kind of on their heels. They're not in control of Congress anymore. They're not in control of the White House. They don't actually have to govern. And so I think that makes them a little bit more open to something that's more idealistic, that's more aspirational.
And there will always be a way out. The problem is not the Supreme Court — it's the First Amendment itself. The challenge in regulating campaign spending is not deciding whether money is speech or corporations have rights, it's defining the boundaries of the election. Elections are a special zone, and by regulating spending clearly intended to influence the election, we keep it a zone of political fairness, where voters hear all sides and elected officials can remain independent. (Think of it like the signs limiting electioneering within 75 feet of the polling place.)
Either way, Team Trump recognizes the immediate political potential of its new messaging. The president's gift for waging culture war has served him well in keeping his fans riled up and his critics off-kilter. By turning trade into a matter of national pride — a clash of civilizations, if you will — he's reminding supporters that he is fighting for them against both foreign competitors and globalists here at home. This can help distract from whatever economic pain they're experiencing. At least for now.
But surprise — a raft of new polls show that some of the most hard-core Trumpsters are starting to get a clue. I know, hold your applause.

House passage of the Obamacare repeal bill left that chamber's Republicans in a no-win situation. They took the hard vote, but because the Senate failed to follow suit, no one can claim a victory. Now Democrats hope to extract a price. Far from the liability that the Affordable Care Act has been in past elections, Democrats believe health care will be a key advantage heading into this fall's midterm elections.
In a rare bit of good news, the French drug maker Sanofi said on Wednesday that it would help produce more than 100 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, starting this summer — but those doses will most likely come too late to salvage vaccination plans for the first half of 2021. When the European Union approved its first vaccine in December, it was already weeks behind nations like the United States and Britain. While it is flush with cash, influence and negotiating heft, the bloc of 27 nations has also found itself lagging countries such as Israel, Canada and the United Arab Emirates. Last week, the European Union's executive branch, the European Commission, set a goal of having 70 percent of its population inoculated by this summer. Just days later, the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, pronounced that difficult. As of this week, a mere 2 percent of E.U. citizens had received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to numbers collected by the research site Our World in Data. That compares with around 40 percent for Israel, 11 percent for Britain and just over 6 percent for the United States. Many countries, particularly poorer ones, are struggling to secure any vaccines at all. But the delays in Europe have created tensions. Some critics have blamed the European Commission, which struck deals on behalf of the member states to secure a total of 2.3 billion vaccine doses from several companies.

If it's the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, I'll personally nominate Trump for the Nobel Prize. But let's see.
What's remarkable about those top three is that they have radically different systems. Britain has true socialized medicine — direct government provision of health care. Australia has single-payer — it's basically Bernie down under . But the Dutch rely on private insurance companies — heavily regulated, with lots of subsidies, but looking more like a better-funded version of Obamacare than like Medicare for All. And the Netherlands actually tops the Commonwealth Fund rankings.
A nationwide poll conducted by SurveyMonkey for The New York Times found that six in 10 Americans support a wealth tax. The slice of the electorate least likely to support it is Republican men with college degrees.
Normally, you can buy insurance only during a six-week period each fall. But the Biden administration established a special enrollment period that runs through mid-May, and most state marketplaces have done the same. This means you can go to Healthcare.gov and sign up for insurance now.
The $4.4 trillion budget Mr. Trump released on Monday spends as much over 10 years as any budget offered by President Barack Obama, whose policies Republicans blamed for ballooning the size of the federal government and hobbling the economy. It does not attempt to achieve balance at the end of that time, despite optimistic economic growth projections that far exceed what most economists say is possible.
How do you explain that shift?
Another approach would be to let people buy into Medicare at some point before they become eligible for the program at age 65. Hillary Clinton proposed this during her presidential campaign. Congress could also provide more generous subsidies to help middle-class people buy insurance on Obamacare exchanges. At the state level, four million people would gain coverage if Florida, Georgia, Texas and the 16 other states that have not expanded Medicaid under Obamacare changed their minds and opted in.
Tying is an arrangement where to buy one product, a consumer also has to buy a different product from a separate market. An example the F.T.C. offers is a drugmaker that required all consumers buying its medicine for schizophrenia to also buy its blood-monitoring service. The Supreme Court has treated the practice as illegal in the past, but more recently lower courts have permitted it under the more flexible rule of reason.
Yes and no. I think you have to see the Affordable Care Act as a sort of compromise. As a moderate proposal that expands some government health care, expands some private insurance, keeps a lot of what already exists and doesn't take things away from people. But I also think that it did change Americans' expectations about what the role for government was in health care, and also what kind of health care they were entitled to. So, you know, we're moving closer to the idea that everyone should be able to have health insurance, even if they're poor, even if they don't get insurance through work. And there are certain guarantees in the Affordable Care Act, like the guarantee that people who have pre-existing health conditions should be able to buy insurance —
But the measure landed in rough seas ahead of a vote that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, wants next week. Four conservative senators, Rand Paul of Kentucky, Ted Cruz of Texas, Mike Lee of Utah and Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, announced that they would oppose it without changes — more than enough to bring it down.
The Biden administration plans to reopen enrollment in many of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, both to help those who may have lost health insurance during the pandemic and to offer coverage to those who did not have any and now want it. The move will be announced on Thursday as part of an executive order describing administration policies on shoring up health insurance coverage, according to three people familiar with the details.
The cables were published late on Saturday by The Mail on Sunday, span a period from 2017 to the present and include candid assessments of American domestic politics and Washington's treatment of Iran over its nuclear weapons program.
Presiding over the case is Judge Reed O'Connor of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas, who was appointed by President George W. Bush. The judge has previously blocked Obama-era efforts to extend medical leave protections to same-sex couples and to include gender-identity discrimination as a form of sex discrimination under the health law.

Lee/The New York Times It has not been a good night for Michael R. Bloomberg, who spent hundreds of millions of dollars only to win a single contest on Tuesday: American Samoa, where roughly 350 people caucused. He earned four delegates for his efforts there. But he did have a few strong spots within states, in some poetically perfect places. He won Pitkin County, Colo., home to Aspen, and Summit County, Utah, home to Park City. He also has a narrow lead, for now, in Napa County: the heart of California wine country. Read more
At the same time, the health department is setting limits on how far states can go with their experiments: Idaho recently proposed a scheme to allow insurers to sell plans that do not comply with all of Obamacare's regulations, with the goal of creating a market for less expensive, less robust coverage, but last week the department rejected the plan as illegal (Gov. Butch Otter didn't see it as a rejection but as an invitation to continue discussing the specifics). And while the Trump administration approved a request to add work requirements to Medicaid in Arkansas, it has held off on approving a rollback in enrollment.
After the Kavanaugh hearings, I think the question that everybody has on some low level about what happened to Graham is now the question we're all openly asking — what happened to Lindsey Graham? So did you actually pose that question?
Democratic candidates, in contrast, have offered detailed plans, which typically cost trillions of dollars raised via new taxes on corporations and the rich, to expand health care coverage and reduce costs for American patients. Health care remains a top issue for many of Mr. Trump's supporters, while Democrats' Medicare for all plans have fared well in many opinion polls.
I just don't think that's Trumpification either. That is an example of a pre-existing pathology in the Republican Party where you have a hyperpartisan desire to use the courts as, basically, super legislators. But that predates Trump. I don't think anyone in Congress wants the judge to overrule Obamacare because it would be a huge mess for Republican legislators. And I think it's— I doubt that Trump himself wants it to happen. I suspect it's a faction within his administration. If the judge rules against Obamacare, it will be a partisan decision and a foolish one. But I think that's a problem with partisanship in general and Republicans in general, that it's only tangentially connected to Trump.
Many Oklahomans have too much income to qualify for Medicaid under state rules, but not enough to qualify for subsidies to help them buy private insurance in the federal marketplace.
And if those consumers develop chronic conditions, it said, they could face financial hardship until they enroll in more comprehensive plans that comply with the 2010 law.

The messages in these rural areas are fairly diverse — Mr. Bloomberg has run 38 different ads in Duluth alone — though nearly one third of them in each market deal directly with health care. Only a few go after Mr. Trump as aggressively as Mr. Bloomberg has in other states.
It would seem as if safe voting and public health would be an issue in which partisanship would be left to the side and that Democrats and Republicans can agree on the best way to move forward. But in Wisconsin, there is no issue in which that can be left aside. What we see is a state that has become so deeply wrested by Republican control that even something like safe voting turns into a mud fest. And for this governor, for the Democratic governor Tony Evers, that's been clear since the day he was elected.
It'll be free for anybody who's under 18. It'll be free for a family of four making less than $50,000 a year, and it will have a small price for everyone else. This is the advantage to having already identified how you can pay for this.
About 10 million Americans lost their homes to foreclosure sales between 2006 and 2014, the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis.
Times columnist David Brooks noted in The Road to Character that Ms. Perkins discovered her calling to service and organizing after witnessing the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist fire. The analogy to something like the student loan debt crisis or child care, of course, isn't perfect — the debt crisis, for instance, has been slow burning as tuition rates have risen far above the inflation rate since the 1970s.

But Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, welcomed the announcement as an important step to expand consumer choice, competition and access to health care.
Yes. I just think it's got this — no one has to say there is a conflict of interest, and I'm not trying to talk about anyone's individual circumstances, but I think one of the things we have to deal with in public life is the appearance of conflict of interest. You know, that's supposed to be the guiding principle, for example, for judges. It's not whether or not there is a conflict of interest, it's whether or not people in the public could reasonably be concerned that it were, because it's important that you believe that judges are acting independently and not influenced because they're going to get money or someone in their family is going to get money. And so that's where I think the analogy is the closest, and whether you make it a rule of ethics or whether do you actually just make it part of the law, I think is a fair question, but I get why we should push in that direction.
But I take your question seriously. The place I might be most likely to fail is to get only part. Now, part's better than none, right? But only part. And that's a deeply worrisome thought.
Removing those provisions will result in renewed uncertainty in the individual market, create a patchwork of requirements in the states, cause rates to go even higher for older Americans and sicker patients, and make it challenging to introduce products and rates for 2019, said Matt Eyles, the president and chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers.
One parallel Senator Warren has used in her plans for breaking up Facebook is the government's antitrust case against Microsoft in 1998, which Senator Richard Blumenthal and Tim Wu wrote in The Times made Microsoft a gentler giant.
The first thing you need to understand is that Obamacare has been a highly successful program. When the legislation was passed, Republicans insisted it would fail to cut the number of uninsured and would blow a huge hole in the federal budget. In fact, it led to major gains in coverage, reducing the uninsured rate to its lowest level in history, at relatively low cost.
A graduate with a professional degree expects to earn $2.3 million more than a high school graduate. The Brookings Institution's Adam Looney estimated that under Senator Warren's plan the bottom 20 percent of borrowers by income get only 4 percent of the savings.
There's also reason to think that, in a world where community rating and guaranteed issue disappear but the rest of Obamacare remains, many more people would be turned down for insurance than in the pre-A.C.A. days. That's because the Trump administration wants to leave other insurance regulations in place that didn't exist before the health law. Obamacare says that all health plans need to cover a standard set of health benefits and can't limit the amount they will pay in a year. In the old days, plans often didn't cover prescription drugs or treatment for mental illness. Those strategies helped weed out customers who had expensive health needs and limited the companies' risk.
James Dao: Moving from Europe to Asia, if China were to send troops, massive numbers of troops into Hong Kong, and impose a violent crackdown there similar to Tiananmen Square in 1989, what would you do as president?
We have moved in a direction that in fact, the progressive — now 'progressive' means 'Bernie,' said Mr. Biden, who is a relative centrist but added that throughout his career he had been considered a liberal liberal.
And what happens after a week?
One State Department official said that negotiations remained far in the distance and that Mr. Malley would initially consult with leaders in Europe, in the Middle East and in Congress before any talks began. The official said American negotiators would ultimately seek a longer, stronger but also broader deal to curb Iran's missiles and proxies — another strategy that Tehran has already refused to consider. But it echoes what the Trump administration had demanded when it withdrew from the 2015 deal and imposed a pressure campaign of harsh sanctions and military threats against Iran and its senior officials. Even before Mr. Malley was appointed, conservatives had accused him of being too accommodating toward Iran and Israel, although dozens of foreign policy experts described him as an astute analyst and accomplished diplomat. Lara Jakes and
So why did it take so long for Mr. Zuckerberg to respond? Kate Losse, an early Facebook employee and Mr. Zuckerberg's former speechwriter, told the NYT: My guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked.
As that party's primary rages on this year, we may need reminders of people like the 59-year-old white woman from Massachusetts we came across who voted for Hillary Clinton three years ago but is a self-described conservative who doesn't think women should always have a right to an abortion. Could a zinger at a town hall that puts down pro-life arguments earn a candidate plaudits online and on MSNBC, but make others like her feel ignored or vilified? Even for the unwaveringly pro-choice, it's a politically handy question to keep in mind.
Asian -Americans are the fastest-growing group in the United States and most economically unequal. While we are business leaders in a rapidly changing service economy, we are also low-income new immigrants: waiters, seamstresses and home health care workers who suffer under the double whammy of political invisibility and economic insecurity as wages stagnate.
Everybody gets a fair shake next week, and the Democrats who do well will be elevated to a whole new level on the Trump enemies list, assigned a dumb nickname and attacked in the rants our president thinks of as speeches.
What book that you've read in the last year would you recommend most to the audience?
The notice to the court, filed late Monday by the Justice Department, could not have come at a more opportune time for Democrats. The finding by Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, that there was no evidence of a criminal conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia, dashed the hopes of the most partisan Democrats that the House would impeach the president.
The answer has a lot to do with history: For decades, congressional Republicans have opposed — almost unanimously — any top priority of an incoming Democratic president. Biden and his aides believe they will be playing Charlie Brown to a Republican Lucy if they imagine this time will be different.
Look at the example. He said, I will take your money to lie about other candidates. What does that mean for our democracy? Not even meet the minimal standard that TV ads run, right?
And why would it be controversial in the New Deal period, when it seems like the idea of government taking care of people is very much in vogue?
But you know what else baby boomers did? Helped bring an end to the Vietnam War. Advanced the causes of equality for women, for black people and for L.G.B.T. Americans. Engineered the digital revolution. If we're not the dynamos we once were, maybe it's not because we're sanguine or jaded. We could just be pooped.
And he also was like a sidekick, kind of the Gilligan to John McCain's Skipper.
With Nixon, it was the Southern Strategy, raising alarms about the dismantling of Jim Crow laws.
So let me explain what the plan is. The plan is the employer has to keep paying in as the employer does right now. The one exception to that is if you have a collective bargaining agreement, and the employer is paying in more than whatever is the standard minimal that employers are paying in. That difference goes to the workers in cash.
This is the same Ben Carson who has inveighed against the purveyors of division, who played a video at his presidential campaign announcement in Detroit in which the narrator said in part:

KK: It's a very bad idea for the children to ——
And in reality, it is the precise reverse. Bipartisanship is something the majority wants and the minority does not have an incentive to give them. Because as you just said, if the majority looks like they're doing a great job governing, they have these big bipartisan bills, they can run for reelection on that. And then the minority remains the minority. So if you want bipartisanship, you need to give the minority a really, really good reason to work against their own political self-interest and cooperate on these bills. There may not be that reason. I'm not actually sure in a polarized system, bipartisanship is something we will ever get in high numbers. Other political systems do not have this fetishization that the opposition party is going to work with the governing party to govern. The opposition party opposes and the governing party governs. And then you see how that works out. But this is a really, really important point and something I think that Mitch McConnell understood, frankly, better than any Senate leader before him. He understood that he could get the majority back by sabotaging their ability to govern. And that was an important strategic insight.
The virtual meeting, which Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the new C.D.C. director, attended along with other officials, was laden with scientific details, clearly an effort by the new administration to make good on the president's pledge to be more transparent than his predecessor about the administration's response. During the briefing, Dr. Walensky also pleaded with Congress for additional money, saying scientists really need to have access to those resources to do the amount of sequencing and surveillance that we need in order to detect things when they first start to emerge. One variant, which has surged in Britain and burdened its hospitals with cases, has been increasingly detected in the United States. Federal health officials have warned that the variant, which is more contagious, could become the dominant source of infection in the United States by March, and would likely lead to a wrenching surge in cases and deaths that would further overwhelm hospitals. Other variants spreading in South Africa and Brazil have also caused concern. I look at the data form the U.K. and how quickly it got really bad in terms of its contagiousness and how much it could cause a spike and I am really worried about that, said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, in an interview Tuesday. It's also widespread across the U.S. — 20 some odd states have already identified it. That is the big one that I worry about.
I want to key in on that, because I think that's a really interesting way of putting that. So, let's go back to Rubio and Lee here. What they say in their statement about the Romney plan and I'm paraphrasing this but I'm getting it mostly right is to say, to be a pro-family party is to be a pro-work party. And they mean here, as you just said, paid work. Now, most parents want to get paid for their work. Even if the Romney plan passed, you'd be getting a very small amount of money from the government to stay home with children. It's not the amount of money you need to even be above the poverty line with a couple of kids. And so to make that decision in the ways people would, would tend to mean — and I've done reporting on cases like this. It tends to mean people have sick parents of their own, children with disabilities, they have a terrible boss, or a hellish commute, they have their own mental health issues. People don't want to live in poverty for no reason, despite what Paul Ryan used to say about government being a hammock, not a safety net. It's horrible to just be on social insurance.
By backing a flimsy, state-initiated lawsuit to throw out the entirety of the Affordable Care Act, President Trump has made himself and Republican candidates in 2020 vulnerable to attacks that they want to take health insurance away from millions of people.
Yes, the Democratic candidates need to talk about health care. Polls show that it is a top — if not the top — policy concern for their voters, and the issue was a pillar of the party's successful platform to win control of the House in 2018. But there are other health care matters that could use more attention, such as surprise medical bills, reproductive rights and the Republicans' continuing efforts to dismantle Obamacare — which have gained far more traction than many people predicted, threatening coverage for millions of Americans.
At the White House, President Trump's press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, defended the arrangement, saying that because remdesivir is an inpatient drug given by infusion, patients are highly unlikely to have to pay for it and hospitals have to eat the cost of treatment use.
It's not too hard to imagine a Trump who pursued this strategy much more aggressively, doling out checks and assistance to his core constituencies at every opportunity. One of his early advisers, Steve Bannon, urged as much at the start of Trump's administration, calling for an economic nationalism to match the president's anti-immigrant rhetoric. It's an approach that may have left him more popular than he is now, or at least, less unpopular.
Mayor Bill de Blasio wants 5 million New Yorkers vaccinated by June. Vaccines being given out in the Bronx this week. Credit... James Estrin/The New York Times In his final State of the City address, Mayor Bill de Blasio offered a sprawling vision of New York City's recovery from a pandemic that has taken tens of thousands of lives and destroyed the city's economy. The mayor committed to accelerating the city's vaccination efforts and set a goal of inoculating five million New Yorkers by June. He also said he would begin in May to bring back to offices the thousands of city employees who have been working remotely, and would safely reopen schools for all students in September. New York City's vaccination effort is the foundation of a recovery for all of us, the mayor's 18-page recovery plan says. With every vaccine shot, New York City moves closer and closer to fully reopening our economy, restoring the jobs we lost and ensuring equality in our comeback. If the federal government provides enough stimulus dollars to the city, Mr. de Blasio said, he will create a City Cleanup Corps of 10,000 temporary workers to focus on beautifying the city — an idea he compared to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression. Mr. de Blasio also proposed two plans to help small businesses: a $50 million recovery tax credit program for businesses that have faced hardships from the pandemic, and a $100 million recovery loan program to help shops stay open.

They could do this tomorrow, Judge Engelhardt said, leading Mr. Letter to dryly point out that Mr. Trump would need to sign off on new laws, too.
But let me finish my point. If you fight on ground where I think you've got lots of bipartisan support and you lead a damn fight — and then — just — if you can deliver a 2-cent wealth tax, which has wide popularity, when I get to sign the piece of paper that cancels student loan debt for 43 million Americans, that's Democrats and Republicans. I think at that moment, the world starts to shift. I think at that moment, a whole generation of people who have only seen the government as debt collector starts to shift. Will we get 100 percent of the folks on board? No. But will we get a lot more? Will we begin to talk about a democracy that doesn't just work increasingly for a thinner and thinner slice of the top, or will we start to talk about a democracy that works for all of us? That 2-cent wealth tax is about child care. It's about things that touch people's lives. It's about universal pre-K for 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds. It's about a $50 billion investment in historically black colleges and universities, tuition-free. Technical school, two-year college, four-year college. You just deliver on something that matters to people. Now they've got a stake in democracy. It feels like it pays off, that it's not just marching in the street over and over and over, and the next day you wake up and it's a little bit worse than it was today.
CW: Andrew Yang said in one of the debates that you're applying a 20th-century framework to antitrust when it comes to Big Tech. Why is he wrong on that, and what makes your proposal to break up Big Tech adequate for the unprecedented profits of Silicon Valley?
I think he's a kook. I think he's crazy. I think he's unfit for office.
Over several decades, it's become increasingly clear that how immigration debates are framed is important. One of the more subtle anti-immigration tactics — employed by the Trump, Kennedy and Johnson administrations, as well as some on the political left — is to suggest that reducing immigration could preserve more jobs for American workers and lead to higher wages, but economic research has consistently disputed the notion that limiting immigration would increase domestic employment or raise average wages. The prevailing view of economists is that immigration increases economic growth; while some workers might benefit from immigration restrictions, more would suffer.
Which you're saying resulted in resentment? It's the curve of rising expectations. When it's interrupted, people go nuts. After World War II, G.I.s got mortgages so they could live in the suburbs and buy a house, buy a car, then a TV. Their kids could go to college. Their grandchildren could be doctors. That was the promise of America. That promise is over. That drives people crazy, and then they target, they objectify, they need a scapegoat. So it's not just Michelle and Barack. They are part of the larger phenomenon. To go from them to Trump is a seismic revolution that is the result of a collapse of expectation.
Gail: Can you imagine running a restaurant in New York or New Jersey, waiting out the shutdown, and then discovering that you're not going to be able to reopen because places like Arizona and Texas tried to avoid suffering, and then hosted a coronavirus comeback?
BS: Is it my imagination or are we hearing almost nothing about voter disenfranchisement in this campaign, when in fact we saw disenfranchisement actually tipped races in Florida and Georgia? And post-Obama, all kinds of disenfranchisement methods came online.
So my plan to forgive student loan debt is capped at $50,000 and an income of $250,000. And the reason for that is because it is the best way, not only to give maximum forgiveness to a lot of people who are struggling, but it also helps close the black-white wealth gap, and is part of the reason that the N.A.A.C.P. endorsed it along with the other parts I was doing about investment in our colleges. But I really worked through hard on these numbers to deal with exactly that question and that's why I got the numbers where they are. I don't think they raise that same issue. I'm not ——
But he redeemed much of that record with one action: He cast the crucial vote against G.O.P. attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That single nay saved health care for tens of millions of Americans, at least for a while.
Why is defending the Affordable Care Act in the Supreme Court hard? That's what lawyers are for, sure. That's a legal issue, and they've got a whole bunch of lawyers in the federal government.
Rivals like KKR and Blackstone have already made the transition, which has helped bolster their stock prices.
It is hard, at least for me, to do justice to how sinister, in a way that sort of builds slowly, but she is such a monster. She does it not in a scenery-chewing way but in this very subtle, incisive way. I don't know. I'm very much looking forward to the final episode in which they've contrived to put her on trial as a mother. I think there's such a hunger at this point to see her unmasked. It'll be interesting to see if the show can give the people what they want.
So, during a private lunch in February 2009, Mr. Biden slid a memo across the table to Mr. Obama, outlining a role to erase those doubts: quarterbacking the implementation of the $787 billion economic stimulus that had been rammed through Congress a few days earlier in the depths of recession.
The pandemic has exposed some of the glaring weaknesses in the A.C.A., said Paul Starr, a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton who served as a health policy adviser to the Clinton administration. When millions of workers lose their jobs, most of them also lose their health coverage, and the A.C.A. does not provide for any automatic backup or means of transferring coverage to a publicly subsidized alternative.
Whether on tax reform, whether on repealing the Affordable Care Act — that was both in 2017, but into 2018 on foreign policy.

He continued: If we can't puncture some of the mythology around austerity, politics or tax cuts or the mythology that's been built up around the Reagan revolution, where somehow people genuinely think that he slashed government and slashed the deficit and that the recovery was because of all these massive tax cuts, as opposed to a shift in interest-rate policy — if we can't describe that effectively, then we're doomed to keep on making more and more mistakes.

In Donald Trump's two-plus years as president, his approach to policymaking has often been defined by an unsavory stew of indecision, inaction, flip-flops and outright lies.
Margot: I think the public option seems like a weird match with the market structure of the Affordable Care Act. Imagine this scenario: The public option can get every doctor and hospital to accept Medicare prices, and it's able to achieve really low administrative costs. In that case, it's an insurance plan with a lot of structural advantages over the competition. The existing insurance companies, mostly, are already losing money in this market, and several of them are already leaving or going under. Why would they stick around longer if they can't get many customers, and they can't make money on the ones they keep? In another version, the public option doesn't have any special advantages, and is just another insurance plan in the marketplace. In that case, do you think the government will do a better job of running an insurance company than the insurance industry? We're learning that this is a hard business. I guess, in that case, it would operate as another choice.
Some insurers worry that consumers will be confused and may see short-term policies as a substitute for major medical coverage.
And how did much of the Republican Party respond? By criticizing the four women at least as much as Trump— it's the latest sign that Republicans appear to be approaching full Trumpification. What Trump wants, it seems, many Republicans are happy to do. Ross, I realize this may not be your favorite kind of discussion in which Michelle and I ask you to answer for the outrages of Donald Trump and the Republican Party. But here we go. So what did you think about the reaction of other Republicans to Trump's comments this week?
At the same time, though, he has relied on personnel who are associated with 2010-era G.O.P. orthodoxy, rather than elevating the kind of conservatives who have actively theorized for a more populist right. Trump's choice of Steve Moore to the Federal Reserve is a recent case study: Instead of elevating a principled inflation dove (National Review editor and Bloomberg columnist Ramesh Ponnuru would have been my outside-the-box choice), Trump picked a hack who was obsessed with imaginary inflation under Obama, and only flipped to back a looser monetary policy because, well, it was the Trumpy thing to do.
JW: You think if they vote in the next two weeks that that will be a sufficient amount of time and what they've done, what they ——
Jesse Wegman: Senator, I want to just take you back for a moment to Mara's question about swing states and swing state voters and your point about large structural changes that people warn you off. The other day, you repeated your argument that you wanted to be the last president to win the Electoral College and the first to win the national popular vote. How do you expect — I'm assuming you're not talking about a constitutional amendment. How do you expect to get there in five years, unless you're the president, unless you win the Electoral College and Donald Trump wins the popular vote in 2020?
A Washington hospital system apologizes after offering vaccines to wealthy donors. The Overlake Medical Center in Bellevue, Wash., last spring. Credit... Grant Hindsley for The New York Times A Washington hospital system apologized after The Seattle Times reported that it had offered vaccines to wealthy donors while others went without the coveted shots. Overlake Medical Center & Clinics sent an email to about 110 donors who gave more than $10,000 to the hospital system, telling them they could register for open appointments by invite only. The report drew a rebuke from Gov. Jay Inslee, who said during a news conference on Tuesday that the practice was simply unacceptable. Overlake's president and chief executive, J. Michael Marsh, apologized in a statement, adding that even those donors would have been required to show that they were eligible for the vaccine under state guidelines. We recognize we made a mistake by including a subset of our donors and by not adopting a broader outreach strategy to fill these appointments, and we apologize, Mr. Marsh said. The hospital's conduct mirrors that of other facilities that have made news for prioritizing wealthy donors over the rest of the population. A Florida nursing home and assisted living facility called MorseLife Health System came under investigation after The Washington Post and The New York Post reported that it had prioritized its donors as well. Another, Baptist Health in Miami, invited a donor to get a shot.
Well, they go back to trying to find creative workarounds. So the first thing that some of the local jurisdictions do is close and limit their polling locations. Some of the more drastic examples include Milwaukee, the biggest city in the state, going from 180 polling locations, typically, down to just five or seven.
The House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, to strengthen voting rights and ethics provisions, in March 2019 and sent it to the Senate. It is now awaiting a vote there.
This did not move forward. Nor has a plan from Senators Tim Kaine and Michael Bennet to create a version of Medicare, which they call Medicare X, available to all Americans.

Michael Conway, who served as counsel for the house Judiciary Committee during the Nixon impeachment inquiry, said President Nixon also tried to deny the investigators access to key materials, but Mr. Trump has gone a step further. Mr. Conway said, Nixon was equally resistant to turning materials over and documents, but he did allow people to testify.
If it were up to the doctors, they'd say let's shut down the entire world, Mr. Trump said. This could create a much bigger problem than the problem that you started out with.
Before she was a United States senator, Kamala Harris was the San Francisco district attorney and the California attorney general. Now, as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president, Ms. Harris often says she is eager to prosecute the case against President Trump.
The repeal bill approved last month by the House would bar the use of federal tax credits to help purchase insurance plans that include coverage of abortion. But senators said that provision might have to be jettisoned from their version because of complicated Senate rules that Republicans are using to expedite passage of the bill and avoid a filibuster.
Re May the Best Woman Win, by Michelle Goldberg (column, Jan. 22):
States were allowed to suspend the requirement during the recession, but most have brought it back as unemployment has dropped. It generally applies to adults ages 18 to 49 unless they are pregnant, have dependent children or are medically certified as unfit for employment.
Credit Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times The United States is 43rd in the world in its ability to track potentially dangerous new mutations of the coronavirus, according to President Biden's coronavirus czar, who used the White House's first public health briefing to issue a stark warning that the United States will remain vulnerable to the deadly pandemic unless Congress quickly passes a coronavirus relief bill. We are 43rd in the world in genomic sequencing — totally unacceptable, said Jeffrey D. Zients, Mr. Biden's Covid-19 response coordinator, citing December data from the GISAID Initiative, which provides a global database of coronavirus genomes. In a brief interview later, he corrected himself, saying he had since learned that the United States was now behind 31 other nations. At the briefing, he also warned that the federal government still faces shortages of personal protective gear and other essential supplies that it will not be able to buy if Congress does not pass Mr. Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus rescue plan. Scientists have warned that, with no robust system to identify genetic variations of the coronavirus, the United States is woefully ill-equipped to track dangerous new mutants, leaving health officials blind as they try to combat the grave threat. Dr. Anthony. S. Fauci, the president's senior adviser for Covid-19, who also spoke during the briefing, said the National Institutes of Health is now working with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on research aimed at adapting vaccines so that they have on the ability to neutralize these mutants.
But we agree that the circus atmosphere surrounding the Affordable Care Act — exemplified this week by the abrupt decision by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to delay the vote on the Senate's replacement bill — is generating uncertainty, which in turn is jeopardizing the future of public-private partnerships.
Mr. Mitchell bought a similar policy the same year from a broker who promised to find the best plan in Kansas at the best price. He was found to have invasive ductal carcinoma, a type of breast cancer, in early 2018. His doctor told him that he needed surgery, but the hospital where it was scheduled told him that he did not have insurance coverage.
The full impact of the executive orders will be hard to predict, but there is no doubt that they will damage health care markets and will harm the poor and the chronically ill.
Well, actually, you're going to have to explain to me what Andrew was — if I'm going to have to argue back against Andrew, you're going to have to tell me exactly what Andrew's argument is.
But she told Andrew that was a mistake. She decided to become co-C.E.O. alongside Stuart Haselden, who was meant to be the sole chief executive, because the company had let inaccurate reporting influence the timeline of a transition plan that we had.
WASHINGTON — Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has sat in the center seat on the Supreme Court bench since his arrival in 2005. But only this term did he assume true leadership of the court.
About 10 million Americans lost their homes to foreclosure sales between 2006 and 2014, the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis.
Why are Republican policy ideas falling so flat? At one level, the answer is obvious: G.O.P. policies are unpopular because they hurt far more Americans than they help. Why should anyone expect cutting taxes on the rich while taking health care away from the sick to be popular?
We think it's great the stay is in place, Mr. Flentje said. Those things don't need to get sorted out until there's a final ruling.

Or perhaps the New Orleans court will rule against the law and the Supreme Court will again reaffirm its constitutionality, overruling the appeals court.
A 2017 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that generic competition has weakened in recent decades, leading to higher prices for generics. EpiPen and insulin prices, in particular, have skyrocketed. Senator Warren's Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would authorize the government to manufacture active ingredients for medications or contract outside entities to manufacture generic drugs and lower prices. But Senator McConnell has railed against socialist price controls in the health care system.
MC: And nobody does well at this question.
Yeah, I think that I think that is true. That's a good point. So first of all, let's say you have a poll question on x crazy thing. Millions and millions of people are gonna, just all the way down, believe that crazy thing. But then millions of other people, if I could maybe paraphrase what you're saying as, are signaling they're belonging to a tribe, one of whose marks is accepting x as a non-insane view, right, as a tolerable view. That's not a meaningless act and it's not a harmless act if the x in question genuinely is crazy.
A public option, supporters say, is the logical next step in the expansion of access begun under the Affordable Care Act, passed while Mr. Biden was in office. We have to protect and build on Obamacare, he said.
Making the right choice means finding a match between your fluctuating health needs and the changing plans. It is as complicated as it sounds. Getting the best coverage for the lowest cost often requires switching plans nearly every year but very few people do this, leaving them with higher costs and less effective coverage. A study from the University of Pittsburgh, for instance, found that only 5 percent of Medicare beneficiaries in 2009 chose the cheapest plan that will cover their prescription drug needs.
1. G.O.P. Senate leaders are out of options in their efforts to repeal and replace the health care law, at least for now.
The way I see it is, I have lived opportunity, she said. I've lived the kind of opportunity that comes from a government that invests a little in its kids, a government that tries to keep the playing field a little bit level for folks like my family.
There's also health policy, where Trump, having failed to repeal Obamacare — which would have been a huge blow to working families — has engaged instead in a campaign of sabotage that has probably raised premiums by almost 20 percent relative to what they would have been otherwise. Inevitably, the burden of these higher premiums falls most heavily on families earning just a bit too much to be eligible for subsidies, that is, the upper part of the working class.
Virus advisers warn the U.S. will remain vulnerable without the quick passage of a relief bill by Congress. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:15 - 0:00 transcript White House Covid-19 Team Warns of Virus Variants Members of President Biden's coronavirus response team said they are increasing surveillance of potentially dangerous Covid-19 mutations. The variants have been identified recently, seem to spread more easily. They're more transmissible, which can lead to increased number of cases and increased stress on our already taxed health care system. In the United States, 308 cases of the 117 variant that originated from the U.K. have been confirmed in 26 states as of Jan. 26. We also identified this week, our first case of the P1 variant in the United States in Minnesota. To date, no cases of of the B1351 variant that was first detected in South Africa has been identified in the U.S. C.D.C. is committed to working with international and state and local partners, and increasing surveillance to monitor the situation and share as soon as we learn more. The N.I.H. will be collaborating with the C.D.C. in looking at what the functional characteristics of these are. For example, we will be monitoring in real time the effect of antibodies that we induced with the current vaccines and with future vaccines as to what impact they have on the ability to neutralize these mutants. Members of President Biden's coronavirus response team said they are increasing surveillance of potentially dangerous Covid-19 mutations.
There's been a relentless campaign of sabotage by the Trump administration to deny people health care, and thankfully, the new Democratic majority in the House has taken action, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at a Wednesday news conference to push the legislation. But the Republican-led Senate? No movement. Nothing.
And the only question for Snowe, Collins, Grassley, and those folks would be if they wanted to get a piece of the credit for it and if they wanted to help shape the policy to move it in their direction. They still could have decided no, but the bill would have passed. It would have passed faster. And the policy design would have been much more effective. We wouldn't have had to jerry rig it all these different ways that we did that made the benefits take longer to kick in, harder to execute, and all these things that ended up making a worse bill because we had to get 60 votes. The other thing that I would say to the central idea that bipartisanship is necessary to create lasting policy is that it just has never proven to be true. The Senate was a majority vote institution for the vast majority of its existence, all the way up until, arguably, the '70s and the '80s, when things started to more routinely face the filibuster in the 60-vote threshold. So if you think that that's a requirement, then you would have to discount any piece of legislation that you think was a good piece of legislation that passed over those previous 200 plus years. Medicare was not required to get a supermajority. It passed on a majority vote basis. It never had to clear a supermajority threshold. It never faced a filibuster.

I don't have a complete theory for how this self-deception has been accomplished: My column threw out several possibilities but hardly exhausted the list. But the possibilities I cited were mostly sub-rational — a reaction to Trump's media dominance, a reaction to his winning streak, a reaction to his demagogue's charisma, a tribal wishful thinking — plus the logical fallacy that having once proved pundits wrong Trump can always do so.
People make too much of the word 'unprecedented,' but this was truly unprecedented, in how much money he spent, how quickly he spent it and how unopposed that money was, said Ken Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco.
Yeah. It is that sense of affirmation, the sense of rightness that Republicans enter into Evers's administration with, and it allows them to openly flout the typical means of political pressure that the governor tries to put on them around the election.
By now everyone who follows the news has a sense of how badly the Trump administration and its allies botched and continue to botch the medical side of the Covid-19 pandemic. Weeks of denial and the failure to implement remotely adequate testing allowed the virus to spread almost unchecked.
The governor and state Republicans keep holding this line that voting was something that was so essential, that the primary was something that was so important, that they would try to find some workarounds that included expanding access to absentee ballots and encouraging people to use that measure. It included counties taking precautionary measures which include maybe drive-through voting or socially distanced lines. But besides all of these creative measures, there is an increasing fear, particularly among poll workers, that the election would be unsafe for them to staff. These are people who, 90 percent of them are senior citizens.
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, met last week with Mr. Price to hash out alternatives, and they have been in close contact with the relevant committee leaders and staff members to begin hammering out ideas that could come into relief at the end of the month, when Republicans have their annual policy retreat.
Along with a slow and steady course on oversight — no impeachment talk, please! — the speaker is pressing a policy agenda more evolutionary than revolutionary. Democrats dominated the midterms, she said, with a simple message of better health care, better jobs and less swampy politics. We did not engage in some of the other exuberances that exist in our party.
I disagreed with them. So for example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership had a robust investor state dispute resolution mechanism, which multiple of our trade treaties have had for decades now. And I just think that's fundamentally wrong. It's a two-tier system that says, in effect, we'll make a bunch of promises in a trade deal on the environment, on use of prison labor, child labor and on anything else, and then we'll give two entirely different enforcement mechanisms.
He seems to be adrift morally, politically.
MC: —— that requires you to pass comprehensive immigration reform.
Now it's time for our weekly recommendation when we give you a suggestion meant to take your mind off of politics. Ross, it's your turn. What do you have for us?
For Joseph R. Biden Jr., campaigning these days means virtual fund-raisers. Shuttered field offices. And rallying support by live stream, a tactic vulnerable to severe technological difficulties, as he discovered on Friday evening.
Perhaps the most encouraging example for carbon-tax advocates has been Canada. The province of British Columbia enacted a carbon tax in 2008, and it has worked well. It includes a clever provision to reduce political opposition: Every dollar that is raised is returned to families and businesses through tax credits. An all-star roster of Nobel laureates and former Republican and Democratic presidential appointees — including Treasury Secretaries George Shultz and Lawrence Summers and the Federal Reserve chiefs Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan — recently signed a joint statement in favor of a similar carbon tax for the United States. But it remains a long shot in this era of government distrust. Even in Canada, the politics have become trickier. A nationwide carbon-pricing plan went into effect this year, and conservative leaders are fighting it intensely.
The Obama administration interpreted the provision about sex discrimination to include discrimination on the basis of gender identity. Under the original 2016 rule, health care providers and insurers would have been required to provide and cover medically appropriate treatment for transgender patients.
I think it's certainly been a function of the Trump era that this has happened. The Trump era has been incredibly devoid of policy substance. And that's partly a function of the president himself having had no interest in it, and the party becoming so tied around the axle of his personality that it's become just impossible to have policy conversations. You have people who just don't want to get on the wrong side of Trump. So where does that mean you ought to be on health care? I don't think any of them really knew, and they just didn't want to touch it. And it's absolutely right that there just hasn't been a lot of interest in conservative policy work. Look, I work, as you say, at a conservative think tank. The work we do is public policy work. I was brought on at AEI in 2019. I'd been at another think tank before that for about a dozen years. But I was brought on, really, in part to start a project that would make the health of American institutions, you might say the infrastructure of our political life, an explicit subject of inquiry of think tank work.
The speaker of the House's institutional responsibilities date to the founding of our country, but the modern speakership is focused largely on its political roles: protecting the House majority and advancing the party's policy goals. Success in one dimension — as Speaker Paul Ryan's decision to retire reflects — does not always translate into success in the other.
When Senator Warren suggested that Vice President Biden is running in the wrong primary, he responded in a Medium post that called such attacks condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view.
(Last month, The New York Times examined the history of federal government shutdowns. Below is a version of that breakdown, which has been lightly edited.)
When told that former Vice President Biden criticized her health care plans, Senator Warren answered with a critique of moderate Democrats: Democrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies. She also suggested Mr. Biden is running in the wrong primary.
The president's blunt remarks came in response to a reporter's question about his recent attacks on the Republican war hero who represented Arizona, and who died last year of brain cancer.
The Nobel was a tribute to the originality and influence of his work developing economic models that help people think about how to slow climate change. It also seemed to be a cri de coeur from the Swedish academics who choose the economics laureates: Climate change is a threat like no other. Fatal heat waves, droughts, wildfires and severe hurricanes are all becoming more common, and they are almost certain to accelerate. Avoiding horrific damage, as a United Nations panel of scientists recently concluded, will require changes in human behavior that have no documented historic precedent.
So let me push back on what your theory of change is, because the way the Affordable Care Act worked is we passed it, and then it was four years later when the benefits came in, and they kind of bumped into place, right? Look at it the other way around. What I propose is as many people can get into it as want to get into it, and then once they're in, try taking it away from them, because that's what the fight then shifts to. How did we end up hanging on to the Affordable Care Act when the Republicans had the House, the Senate and the White House? The answer was we ended up hanging on to it because enough people across this country said, You're not going to take this away from me.
First, there's the saga of Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. The Supreme Court allowed states to opt out of this expansion. But accepting expansion should have been a no-brainer for every state: The federal government would initially pay the full cost, and even in the long run it would pay 90 percent, meanwhile bringing money and jobs into state economies.
The two rulings, one a rebuke to the Trump administration and the other a boon to Republicans, was consistent with Chief Justice Roberts's insistence that politics should play no role in judging. We don't work as Democrats or Republicans, he said in 2016.
About 60 million people are covered under Medicare, the federal insurance program that covers people over 65 years old and people with disabilities. Even though the main aim of the A.C.A. was to overhaul the health insurance markets, the law touches virtually every part of Medicare, said Tricia Neuman, a senior vice president for the Kaiser Family Foundation, which did an analysis of the law's repeal. Overturning the law would be very disruptive, she said.
But a lot of people get — the only option they have is very difficult exploitative labor. And something things like child allowances do is also give them a little bit more economic room to say, no, to jobs that aren't very good. So they can get a job that is better, that is better for their family and allows them to also be a better version of a role model, but also a direct parent to their children. And I guess where I'm going with this is that one, I think a Republican Party based on being a parent's party would be actually electorally lethal for the Democrats. I mean, I think it's a very scary thing for the Democrats to consider. But two, that party would have to actually want to make work better. That party might want to do things like a higher minimum wage. There is some interest in wage subsidies, so I don't want to take away from that. But for a party that cares so much about work, I often see it less interested in how that work actually functions in a family specific life, then in of idealized abstract conception about the inherent dignity of wage labor.
The vote was 51 to 48. During the roll call, Democrats staged a highly unusual protest on the Senate floor to express their dismay and anger at the prospect that millions of Americans could lose health insurance coverage.
In the House of Representatives, two bills have been proposed recently to address crises like the one now facing our family. The Ban Surprise Billing Act, sponsored by Lloyd Doggett, Democrat of Texas, would require hospitals to notify patients and get consent if they will be receiving any out-of-network treatment. And last week, the Ways and Means Committee sent the Consumer Protections Against Surprise Medical Bills Act to the House floor. This would also flag potential out-of-network costs for patients, and require insurers and providers to settle disputes through arbitration.
And I still believe that Obama could and should have taken a couple of big banks into temporary receivership as the price of being bailed out. Obama definitely showed too much respect for the bankers who got us into the financial crisis in the first place.

Kathleen Kingsbury: So we don't have very much time together. We all know your résumé and your bio, and many of us have met you in the past, so you don't mind if we just jump right into questions?
But let me go back to a couple of things in there because there's a bunch of interesting stuff in that answer, and I want to stay here on institutions for a minute. I want to express sympathy for the idea that there are a lot of key institutions that very much lean left in their personnel. I think that's true for the media. I think that is true for academia, without doubt. I could completely understand conservatives saying that they need their own counterparts that are based in places that are more conservative because where people are matters, that are filled with people who are more conservative, but that do the same kind of thing. So you're at the American Enterprise Institute. The American Enterprise Institute is, in some ways, a reaction to a sense that Brookings is a left-leaning institution, and it's, I would call it, the center left. And AEI, in my view, is a really good conservative institution. I don't agree with everybody there. Some people I really disagree with. But it functions the way I would understand that kind of operation to function, which is it does the same kind of work as Brookings, but it is staffed by more conservative people. That has not happened in a lot of other places where Republicans have tried to build alternatives. I'll take the media, which I know very well, as an example here.
Not all aspects of reform carry quite the same partisan or ideological tinge. Criminal-justice reform, intended to reduce the harms of mass incarceration, seems to be one of the few genuinely bipartisan agenda items in Washington. (Trump himself, who rails against savage criminals, has spoken about reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance.) Campaign-finance reform occasionally rallies support across party lines, as do a few select aspects of immigration reform.
I want to note something on bipartisanship that struck me as an interesting example of how this plays out. So there was a real interesting bipartisan proposal that came out over the last week, which is Senator Mitt Romney's child allowance plan, which is, in my view, a genuinely fascinatingly excellent piece of legislation. I have my quibbles with the way it's paid for, but you'd be creating a universal child allowance in this country and simplifying a lot of other anti-poverty programs in a way that, from every analysis I've seen, would massively cut child poverty, massively cut it — cut adult poverty, too — and really, I think, be a step forward. That is the kind of thing you wish to see, right? That is a space where you could really imagine Democrats and Republicans working together. And what was interesting to me was that immediately, the Republican senators who have been most vocal on increasing support for children, increasing, in this case, the child tax credit, which is a more complicated, less progressive, and universalist way of doing it, Marco Rubio and Mike Lee came out against Romney — instantly. There's not been, to my knowledge, even one Republican Senator who said they would work with Romney on this plan. And I was thinking in the aftermath of that that — not the aftermath. I mean, this is still a live ball with reconciliation particularly because you could pass that plan with just Romney and the Democrats.
Some are at increased risk because of age, and some have health problems like diabetes or asthma that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified as risk factors.
But only two hours after she introduced the bill, leaders of a more centrist group known as the New Democrat Coalition said Congress should initially focus on shoring up the Affordable Care Act, stabilizing insurance marketplaces and holding down prescription drug costs.
Trump in general was preaching to his base, and I don't think he did what he needed at a time when GOP is in crisis. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
But isn't that why he simply never brought it to a vote? I mean, so much of the Senate, there are so many bills that could have an unusual coalition. But I think an undernoticed reason that you have very few bipartisan votes in the Senate is the leadership doesn't bring bills that split their own caucus to the floor. And in this case, one of McConnell's key moves that liberals are very angry about to this day, but he didn't provide Garland a hearing. And I always understood that as trying to forestall exactly the situation you're talking about. Whether it was 13 or three, he didn't ever want to be in a situation where Republicans were asking themselves, does Merrick Garland deserve the seat? So he never let it get to a point where it would matter if he lost anybody because he controlled the floor structure, which I'm not really sure I think is a good way for the Senate to work. And I'd be curious for your thoughts on it. But my understanding is that was the key playwright there. So it never would have had an opportunity for Murkowski to break on the vote, because there was never going to be a vote because McConnell's never going to hold a vote.
On Friday, the World Health Organization reviewed the details of its investigation into the origin of the coronavirus in China, and what it hopes to learn from the visit. Credit Credit... Hector Retamal/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images After months of delays, a team of World Health Organization scientists tracing the pandemic's origin began its field work on Friday in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus was first detected. The W.H.O. said its team of 15 experts planned to visit hospitals, laboratories and a live animal market over the next several weeks in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, where the virus was detected in late 2019. As members start their field visits on Friday, they should receive the support, access and the data they need, the W.H.O. said on Twitter. All hypotheses are on the table as the team follows the science in their work to understand the origins of the #COVID19 virus. The Chinese government had repeatedly sought to delay the inquiry, apparently out of concern that the experts would draw attention to the government's early missteps in handling the outbreak. But it relented under mounting global pressure. The W.H.O. experts were first asked to undergo 14 days of quarantine in Wuhan, which ended on Thursday. They plan to speak with some of the first patients to show symptoms of Covid-19, as well as with medical workers and Chinese scientists, according to the W.H.O. Their fieldwork will include a visit the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where some of the first cases were detected.

I'm just saying these things will come back as you have to win voters in swing states, things like that.
How Their Experiences Have Shaped Them
Save our health care! Barbara Miller shouted.
How about a different hypothesis: the foundations for Trumpism were laid in part by conservatives who made dishonesty about policy a routine part of Republican politics, and also both-sides-do-it journalists who enabled that culture of lying. This left the Republican establishment helpless in the fact of someone who lied as much in a day as they did in a week, because they couldn't credibly make the case that policy dishonesty was disqualifying.
Critics of the wealth tax point out that only four European countries now have one, down from 12 in 1990. In France, the wealth tax triggered an exodus of the ultrarich and didn't raise as much revenue as anticipated.
Many of the Republican congressmen who held town halls during this recess have heard the wrath of many of their constituents.
Mr. Ryan had earlier postponed the initial House vote that was scheduled for Thursday to coincide with the seventh anniversary of the Affordable Care Act's signing. Mr. Trump confronted the possibility of a humiliating loss on the first significant legislative push of his presidency.
The so-called special enrollment period is intended to help people who have lost coverage in the past year, but it will be open to those who want health insurance for any reason, in the 36 states that use Healthcare.gov. The decision was reported earlier by The Washington Post.
The list of new policies goes on. There is money in the American Rescue Plan to expand food stamps, bolster state welfare programs, and increase federal support for child and dependent care. Put all this together and the bill is expected to reduce overall poverty by more than a third and child poverty by more than half. It is, with no exaggeration, the single most important piece of anti-poverty legislation since Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society, itself the signature program of a man who sought to emulate F.D.R.
If Republican leaders still believe that, they're not acting like it.
Senate leaders are now hastily trying to rewrite a sprawling tax bill — one that touches almost every part of the economy — and then pass it mere hours later. They need to do so because an independent Senate analysis late yesterday made clear what everyone already knew: The bill would add to the deficit enormously. In a normal legislative process, the Senate would have received that analysis long before taking any vote.
So Rubio and Lee were the two Republican senators who had been most forward on trying to put forward pro-family, pro-child policies more recently. And their immediate opposition, combined with the silence or opposition of any other Republican Senator, really struck me for its ferocity actually. One of the reasons I'd wanted to chat with you about this is that this seems to me to put two parts of the Republican coalition very much in tension. There is the Paul Ryan side of the party, the welfare reform side of the party that says, if you want to get anything from the government, anything at all, you have to work, including as a single mother, including by the way, in some cases as a married parent. And then another part of the party that has traditionalist family views. It would like to see more parents, but, I think, usually mothers staying at home with their children that would like to see it be more possible to have a single breadwinner families. And particularly in this post-Trump moment where I do think there's been more assertiveness again from social conservatives, saying they've gotten a raw deal in the party recently. Romney seems to be coming in and saying, the party's focus on work, on paid formal labor, as the only kind of valuable work and its dismissal of parenting as a valuable form of work, is wrong.

Depending on which state you live in, you may need to provide documents showing that you recently lost your job. You may also need to provide proof that your income is now lower than it was when you filed your last tax return, if it has fallen. In calculating your income for this purpose, you should include any unemployment benefits you are receiving, including the additional $600 a week that will be paid temporarily under the new economic relief legislation. You do not need to include any stimulus payment you get from the government.

The American government's antitrust battle with the oil industry perhaps epitomizes a 20th-century approach to antitrust — in 1911, the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of Standard Oil. Of course, many would argue that the country's dependence on oil and its addiction to Facebook aren't totally comparable.
No. This is on budget reconciliation.
I think Medicare for all is the right solution.
Whether we're talking about workers or we're talking about the environment, who has to meet what standards? And there are big corporations who figured out how to game the system. Where standards are high, then move that part of the operation somewhere else where standards are low and save a nickel. Because these corporations, they don't have any loyalty to a country, they just have loyalty to their own bottom line. And they play this all around the world.
And when they do, variations of that simple question — Why would an innocent man, and a jury interested in the truth, not want all the evidence out and all the witnesses to testify? Wouldn't you if you were innocent? — will take on even more power.
How stupid is our country, Trump asks. And the fact that he is the GOP nominee is one sad answer! — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
And I'll note, you can listen to Yuval. He was on the show just a couple of weeks ago. The episode is called, Can the Republican Party be Saved? What's the last book you read that actually changed your mind about anything?
But a degree worse, two degrees worse. I watch that, and I watch as one more player in the game gets even more deeply embedded in Washington and Washington decision making. One more player hires more lobbyists, spends more money on campaign contributions, puts more money into bought-and-paid-for experts and think tanks so that nothing will change. It's like you talk about hardening between right and left. That's not the hardening. The part that's happening is it's hardening between the top and the bottom.
We will be lower than that number, Mr. Trump told reporters as the death count kept by Johns Hopkins University approached 38,000. But I really believe it could have been millions of people had we not done what we did.
Part of the flip can be attributed to demographic changes in Southern California. But these largely suburban districts were also core to the suburban revolt against Mr. Trump that had begun as soon as he was elected, and brought in a wave of more moderate Democrats in states from California to New Jersey. Indeed, Representative Harley Rouda, who won in the 48th district, which is in Orange County, has endorsed Mr. Bloomberg.
In 2012, Massachusetts Democrats, worried about a tough fight against Republican Senator Scott Brown, coalesced around Ms. Warren, knocking her only primary challenger, an immigration attorney, Marisa DeFranco, off the ballot. Winning in November is more important to Democrats than standing behind one woman who wanted to challenge another one for the right to run for U.S. Senate, Boston Globe columnist Joan Vennochi wrote at the time. Whether Ms. Warren could beat Mr. Brown, the incumbent, was more of a tossup, though by late summer 2012 most polls had her ahead.
KK: Well, so you're going to kill the filibuster?
There we go. But the point is there are some things about tech that are special. I mean, that we're seeing for the first time. Ways that you can be anti-competitive that we hadn't seen before, just like that was true in the early 1900s about, you know — you had the oil supply, and you also owned all the gas stations and how that one worked. We broke that apart.
J. HENRY NEALE JR., SCARSDALE, N.Y.
Any attack on the A.C.A. must start with the recognition that at least 23 million Americans (the Obama White House estimate) and perhaps more than 26 million (some private experts) have been added to the health care rolls. As shown below, this has driven the percentage of Americans without insurance down to 9 percent, by a considerable margin the lowest in history.

Ms. Harris challenged Mr. Biden on his opposition to busing during the 1970s and 1980s by describing her experience as a child.
Mr. Bloomberg is attempting to turn his ad campaign into delegates in several ways: through an inundation of expensive markets with a potentially responsive suburban population; with heavy spending in a state where he will clearly lose the topline battle but can still sneak some delegates; or by a simple domination of the airwaves.
A look into some of these ad buys gave an indication of how Mr. Bloomberg might amass delegates, even while losing some states, to be competitive. Because the Democratic primary features proportional delegate allotments, often by congressional district, a candidate who comes in third or fourth over all in a state, but has an exceptionally strong showing in a certain area, can still amass a significant delegate count.
Mr. Cohen did not land a hoped-for job in President Trump's administration — he imagined himself as chief of staff — and in January last year he left the Trump Organization, where he had long served as the in-house fixer without a clear portfolio. But he managed to turn what looked like an exile into a lucrative opportunity.
Well, I would add he also got a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Yet Ms. Verma, who frequently echoes Mr. Trump's attacks on the health law, also said on Twitter that Americans continue to experience skyrocketing premiums and limited choice under the law.
President Biden yesterday continued his rat-a-tat run through the major policy areas he focused on during the campaign, issuing a range of executive actions and directives on health care. He ordered the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces reopened to let people buffeted by the coronavirus pandemic find coverage.
Who brought this latest case and why?
And really won a lot of bipartisan respect, a lot of respect across the aisles. Took on some pretty unpopular issues within his caucus.
archived recording The legislature — they came in, the gaveled in for about 10 seconds, gaveled out and they moved on. They said that was not a serious proposal and said the time for proposals like that was several weeks ago when the crisis began.
Texas, for example, allowed insurers to charge women higher premiums than men (a practice that was outlawed or restricted in 12 other states, mostly Northeastern ones). Individual market insurers could deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions. The average individual market plan around that time came with a $222 monthly premium. The plan was not required to cover expensive benefits such as childbirth or prescription drugs.
Talks continued this evening and a deal could come anytime, but Democrats were blocking action on the $1.8 trillion package to get stronger protections for workers and restrictions for bailed-out businesses. Above, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.
Henry Olsen, my former colleague, wrote a wonderful book about this a couple of years ago. And so I think that the struggle that we see now, that we've seen in the Trump era, that we'll see in the post-Trump era, a struggle for the party's identity between populist forces and conservative forces is an old story. And almost all the arguments that are being had have, in some form, been had before. But the post-Reagan party imagined itself to be a little different than that and understood itself as more unified around a set of conservative principles than its electorate really was. I think that reality is much more powerfully evident in the wake of the last few years and will define the direction of the party's struggle for its own identity.
As Donald Trump entered the second year in office, he seemed determined to destabilize his administration's fragile status quo. He pushed out a cluster of advisers, replacing them with people he liked watching on TV. He forged ahead on his long-promised policy of trade war. He decided to take the starring, summit-organizing role in his own North Korean brinksmanship. And he stepped up — well, or just continued, it's hard to make quantitative judgments — his rhetorical war against the Robert Mueller investigation.
You're asking the fundamental question about how you break them up. This was the question for Standard Oil. How did they break up Standard Oil? They ended up doing it actually by geography back in those days, but that's obviously a very different world from the world we live in right now.
Schultz's politics are to the left of mine, but I would vote for someone like him in a heartbeat if the other names on the ballot are Trump and, say, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Isn't candidate diversity supposed to be something liberals believe in?

Biden Signs Orders Aimed at Expanding Health Care President Biden used executive action to reopen enrollment in Affordable Care Act marketplaces, a step in his broader agenda to bolster the act with a new optional government health plan.

These are times when the party was not able to contain the populist energies that emanated from its base. The Republican Party has had the same challenge, and we're almost distracted by Reaganism. If you told a history of the Republican Party now, you'd probably put Reagan at its center and sort of think about that as a rise and fall. But I think Reagan is better understood as a kind of detour from a history that is otherwise a story of a constant struggle between populism and conservatism — populism, inherently, a kind of bottom-up, democratic force. Conservatism is almost inherently elite driven, or at least elite minded. And the party has seen itself as a fight between these two for a very long time. Ronald Reagan was able to harness the energy of the Republican populist base in ways that I think were quite constructive and that were also a decent fit for what the more elite-minded conservative side of the party wanted to do. And so it was able to put this fight to the side for a little while, or at least to kind of take over its form, its shape. That also had to do, I think, with the rise of supply-side economics, which actually began as a populist response to more elite-minded, libertarian kind of fiscal consciousness. It's a little hard to remember now, but it was very much that. And Reagan, in a lot of ways, was a populist figure.
Senator Warren has released one of the most robust housing plans in the 2020 field, including the creation of a Tenant Protection Bureau modeled after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The sky-high rates of homelessness across the country was a major focus of Times reporting last year — read it here.
The reliance on an ad hoc system of budgeting has made it even more difficult for Congress to keep the nation's fiscal house in order. The continuing resolution passed by the House this week would have added about $30 billion to the national debt.
Mr. Trump has unsettled markets with trade threats aimed at China, which The Times has editorialized against. He famously boasted Trade wars are good, and easy to win. But a recent Axios report noted that China's exports to the United States dropped 23.1 percent this year.
MC: And nobody does well at this question.
In response to Thursday's executive orders on health care, you report, lawmakers from both parties have urged the president to continue the payments, voicing concern over how ending the subsidies would affect their constituents. If only our president shared this concern. He clearly does not care how his actions (or tweets) affect anyone but himself.
Revenues caught up with the underlying risk of the population, said Kurt J. Wrobel, the chief actuary of the Geisinger Health Plan in Pennsylvania. With more experience, we can better estimate the expected cost of health claims.

It's 5 percent of the pay for. Give me a break. No, we have passed it, and actually ——
The tax bill in fact set to $0 — zero dollars — the penalty for not purchasing insurance. It did not otherwise impose any kind of legal duty on people to buy insurance. Indeed, the president and his congressional supporters repeatedly cheered the law's repeal of the mandate; they, and the Congressional Budget Office, did not understand the bill to be strengthening it.
No. Let me tell you this, that's what's changed.
MC: I think we can agree that there are huge problems here. But to Katie's point, and then I'm going to throw it to Jesse. You have to be careful to balance the big promises with the over-promising, because then you risk the disillusionment, which I think we saw during the Obama administration. And back to kind of Katie's question about how you pay for a lot of these things. I mean comprehensive immigration for one, you can't do that through budget reconciliation.
archived recording Now the bills would put lawmakers in charge of litigation, which would effectively block incoming Democratic Governor Tony Evers and the Democratic Attorney General-elect from withdrawing the state from a lawsuit to overturn Obamacare.
On Tuesday, Marilyn Tavenner, the chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans, a leading industry trade group, warned that the state marketplaces were already on unstable financial footing. Failing to continue the funding aimed at low-income Americans, she said, would have far-reaching consequences because the business would become much tougher for insurers.
Here's what you need to know:
It's not just any insult, either. With Yankee Doodle, the Redcoats were delivering the most puerile, schoolyard insult in the schoolyard insult book. They were suggesting that American soldiers were gay.
Senator Warren visited Beijing in 2018, as Mr. Trump was waging a tariff war on China. She criticized his chaotic foreign policy, while arguing that America cannot support an economic system more integrated with China's while it fails to respect basic human rights.
I was surprised by how fast it happened. I wasn't surprised that he sort of came up with a really big theory of what should happen next and then eventually let it disintegrate, because we've seen that pattern a number of times. But to pick a fight this big and to stick with it for so little time is the definition of politically counterproductive.
But obviously we're not seeing that yet. On Wednesday, across New York City, 45 ZIP codes had a seven-day average positive test rate at or over 10 percent, according to city data. At the same time, some public health experts expressed concern that too much focus had been placed on vaccinations — as opposed to limiting the spread of the virus. Restaurant owners across the state have also asked officials to push back their state-mandated 10 p.m. closing time to midnight. Mr. Cuomo said Wednesday that the state was looking at those requests, but would not be changing the hours at this time. Months ago, Mr. Cuomo pledged he would largely lock down areas where positive test rates consistently topped 4 percent, closing indoor dining and curbing other high-risk activities. But few communities have faced new rules in recent weeks following changes to how areas of the state are divided into three color-coded zones, red, orange and yellow, that specify what measures apply in each place. Outside of areas with zoned restrictions and New York City, indoor dining at restaurants has been permitted at 50 percent capacity statewide. On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo said that, statewide, all orange zone designations would be lifted, allowing activities like retail businesses operating at 50 percent capacity, in six places including Staten Island, Erie County and Westchester County. Brooklyn, Nassau County and Suffolk County were among 16 areas where Mr. Cuomo said the less-stringent yellow zone rules will be eliminated.
2. Do Senate Republicans have the votes to pass a health care bill?
The fact that you had the senior-most members of the congressional party saying so clearly to a president they helped elect and have loyally supported, we don't want to touch health care — it would have been sort of unimaginable to someone five years ago that that would happen with a Republican president in office.
I'm not saying this is right, but that's the rational political calculation for them. So that's why you have Rubio, Lee, and all these others who supposedly care about this issue coming out and shooting it down. The irony here is that the framers saw this coming. And they identified this misperception about supermajority threshold at the time in 1789. The reason they saw it was that they had just finished having direct firsthand experience with the Articles of Confederation, which did require a supermajority threshold for most major categories of legislation. And so, in Federalist 22, Alexander Hamilton addresses this misperception head on. And he says, what at first sight might seem a remedy, referring to a supermajority threshold, is, in fact, a poison. And he says — now I'm going back to my words, but he says you might think it would cause compromise, but really, what it does is, it provides an irresistible temptation for the party that's out of power to make the party in power look bad. He uses the words to embarrass the administration and the good functioning of government. So it's not what you would think at the time. You think, oh, 60 votes. Well, there's 50 Democrats so that means they got to get 10 Republicans, so that's going to force bipartisanship. But really, what it does is, give Republicans the ability to simply make Democrats look bad at all times. And in a polarized environment, that's the rational political choice.
This article is just the latest indication that health care legislation is going to be a huge problem for Republicans. As the former chief executive of John Hancock Insurance Company, which once sold health insurance, I think it is fair to say that health insurance sold on an individual basis is a difficult proposition no matter how it is done.

In short, the American public seems to have wised up; voters seem to have recognized the G.O.P.'s reverse Robin Hood agenda of taking from ordinary families and giving to the rich for what it is.
We had a fire, and the fire there was millions of people who lost their homes, but the fire by itself doesn't get it done. The fire by itself wasn't enough. You had to be ready with the big structural change and had to have somebody from the inside who would fight for it.
Likewise, federal officials could be more receptive to state requests for waivers under Medicaid, the federal-state program that covers more than 70 million low-income people. A number of Republican governors and state legislators would like to charge higher premiums or co-payments than are now allowed. Some states want to provide a less generous, less expensive package of benefits, or require some able-bodied adults to engage in work activities as a condition of receiving Medicaid.
An earlier government estimate suggested that about 300,000 people who didn't qualify for help paying their premiums in 2016 would qualify in 2017. If that calculation proved true, enrollment among people without subsidies actually fell by around a million people.
I think these are our most vulnerable members of society, and we have to treat them accordingly and to try to do everything for them. Moshe Kantor, president of the European Jewish Congress, this week called on European leaders to ensure that Holocaust survivors, who like other people of advanced age are extremely vulnerable to the virus, were given access to the vaccine. The organization estimates that approximately 20,000 Holocaust survivors are still living in Europe today. Throughout their lives, they have shown mighty strength of spirit, but in the current crisis, many have sadly died alone and in pain, or are now fighting for their lives, and many others are suffering from extreme isolation, Dr. Kantor said, speaking during an International Holocaust Remembrance Day event held online this week. We have a duty to ensure that Holocaust survivors are able to live their last years in dignity and in the company of their loved ones.

Senator Warren has argued that the sheer size of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon pose a real threat to innovation and competition in the technology industry. Mr. Yang has argued that her diagnosis is 100 percent correct but that her solution isn't fully effective because competition doesn't solve all of the problems.
No, It's fine. So I actually start with the big vision. You know, if you gave me a chance, I'd do a constitutional amendment to protect the right of every American citizen to vote and to make sure that vote gets counted so you put real federal muscle behind it. I also talk about that for a specific reason, because a lot of Americans are shocked to know that that's not already in the Constitution and that there is no federal muscle behind that.
So the way I see this is I think the old left-right division, yeah, there's a lot of that. But I think there's a very different division in America, and that is an America that's working for a thinner and thinner slice at the top and not working for much of anyone else. And there are a lot of Democrats, a lot of independents and a lot of Republicans who see that.
Supporting the option were Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services; Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; and Andrew Bremberg, the director of the Domestic Policy Council at the White House.
There are practical virtues in some of these initiatives: Efforts to expand the availability of cheaper, less regulated plans, for example, can provide alternatives to Obamacare's ever-rising premiums. But there are risks as well. Thanks to the way the health law's subsidies are structured, Mr. Trump's decision to cut off subsidy payments is likely to increase overall federal spending. The design of the cost-control board was legally questionable, but it represented an effort to cap the growth of America's largest entitlement program, and Republicans replaced it with nothing.

Critics of the wealth tax point out that only four European countries now have one, down from 12 in 1990. In France, the wealth tax triggered an exodus of the ultrarich and didn't raise as much revenue as anticipated.
Can I just say quickly we've exaggerated them very specifically to put women in a subservient position. Right? So that's the problem, I mean, basically saying that women aren't fit, weren't fit to vote, then weren't fit to run for office, or basically only fit to be a sort of live-in maid, and concubine, and nanny, and are built to do all of the drudgery that men don't want to do but that then kind of makes men's lives easier. That wasn't an accident. But in a way, I think you kind of have to be cognizant of gender in order to see the way that it still functions to women's detriment.
For the most rational case for Trump's electability, though, and one that some Republicans have probably internalized, I recommend reading this Will Rahn piece touting Trump's chances against Hillary, and particularly these passages:
Several states that expanded their Medicaid programs could reverse course if the Republican plan became law.
But why can't Republicans come up with a better alternative to Obamacare? Are they just incompetent? Possibly — but even if they did know what they were doing, they couldn't produce a superior plan, because no such plan is possible. In particular, unless you're willing to move left instead of right, by going for single payer, the only way to guarantee coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions is a system that looks a lot like Obamacare.
Their goal was to assure Justice Anthony M. Kennedy that his judicial legacy would be in good hands should he step down at the end of the court's term this week, as he was rumored to be considering. Allies of the White House were more blunt, warning the 81-year-old justice that time was of the essence. There was no telling, they said, what would happen if Democrats gained control of the Senate after the November elections and had the power to block the president's choice as his successor.
But it's just not the case that a minority party can force the majority party to do what it wants if only it summons enough righteous anger. It never has been. It's another version of the Green Lantern Theory of politics — that if you care enough and try hard enough, you can do anything.

But the conservative firebrand lost a bid for minority leader to Representative Kevin McCarthy of California following the 2018 elections. Mr. Jordan's decision not to run was first reported by The Plain Dealer of Cleveland. No major candidate has formally entered Ohio's 2022 Senate race since Mr. Portman's Monday announcement that he would not seek a third term. But Republicans said to be weighing a bid include Josh Mandel, the former state treasurer who lost a 2012 race to Senator Sherrod Brown; Frank LaRose, Ohio's secretary of state; J.D. Vance, the Ohio-born author of Hillbilly Elegy; Jane Timken, the Ohio Republican Party chairwoman; and several members of Ohio's congressional delegation. Two other Ohio Republicans, Jon A. Husted, the state's lieutenant governor, and former Representative Pat Tiberi, have said they will not run for Senate. Ohio Democrats who have expressed interest in running for the Senate include Representative Tim Ryan, who was among the early field of candidates vying to unseat Mr. Trump in 2020; Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, who is also considering running for governor in 2022; and Dr. Amy Acton, the former director of the Ohio Department of Health, who received encouragement on Twitter from Connie Schultz, Mr. Brown's wife. Mr. Portman is one of three Republican senators who has said he will not seek re-election in 2022. Senators Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Richard M. Burr of North Carolina are also retiring, leaving the party to defend three seats in what are expected to be competitive states next year.
In addition to people who lack insurance, the open enrollment period is expected to apply to people who have A.C.A. coverage but want to switch plans, Ms. Cox said.
The Justice Department brief did not go so far, but it said that Judge Reed O'Connor should void both the mandate and the protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions, while leaving in place the expansion of Medicaid in more than 30 states.
You mention his name any time over the last six months to 12 months, and you get this combination grimace, shrug, follow-up question — yeah, what's going on? And in all the sort of Trump-era Republican mysteries, when we ask ourselves, what happened to this person, why is this person changing his or her mind so much now about Donald Trump, Lindsey Graham kind of is the signature mystery of the Trump era as far as what these conversions look like. Lindsey Graham grew up in a very small town in South Carolina, the town of Central, South Carolina. And his parents owned a bar there called the Sanitary Cafe. And not only did they own it, but they lived in an apartment right behind the bar. They shared a restroom with the patrons of the bar. And he went from there — he was the first member of his family to go to college. His parents died when he was in his early 20s. He joined the military. He eventually got into politics and then was elected to Congress and, eventually, was elected to the Senate, where, over the years, he's become known as kind of a reliable conservative, pretty partisan Republican.
Virtually the entire decrease came in the 39 states that use the marketplace run by the federal government, HealthCare.gov. In the 11 states that sell coverage for the Affordable Care Act — popularly known as Obamacare — through their own marketplaces, enrollment remained the same as last year. Seema Verma, the administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, congratulated her agency in a Twitter post on the most cost-effective and successful open enrollment to date!
And the reason they can do it is that most of the things that are going in that relief package are, at least arguably, budget-related. It's sort of a primary purpose test.
Five. Five percent. We are widening racial wealth gaps in this country right now. Opportunity is shrinking for our children, and people see this. It's 12 years later. It's 20 years later from a whole set of promises that this was going to get better, and it hasn't gotten better, but people watch at the same moment. They don't look around and see a country that's getting poor. Look out your window, right? They don't look around and say, God, America's really on a downslide. They look out and they say, America is doing great. G.D.P. keeps going up. The stock market keeps going up, unemployment is down, but my family is stretched to the breaking point. My debt load is bigger than ever, and I look over the edge and see where my children are headed. I don't even see my children able to replicate what I have. I don't see them able to buy my house. I don't see them having even the job stability I had. I see them carrying more debt at 19 than I carried at 35.

America regularly renegotiates its defense cost-sharing agreements with host countries. In November, Mr. Trump asked Japan to quadruple its payments for the American troop presence.
— Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, conveyed in no uncertain terms to the White House that this was a non-starter in the Senate, that the president was free to do what he wanted to do on health care, but that Senate Republicans were not going to be taking the lead on this.

Bashing Obamacare instantly became a winning Republican message — an indictment of its polarizing namesake, of big-spending Democrats and of the boogeyman of creeping socialism all rolled into one. During the 2010 midterm election cycle, opponents of the A.C.A. spent $108 million on ads pillorying it. As a reward to the 87 Republican freshmen whose victories had enabled the party to retake the House, Eric Cantor devoted part of his first day as the House majority leader to introducing H.R. 2, the Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act. It would become the first of more than 50 bills that would pass the House over the ensuing four years designed to repeal, defund, restrict or delay implementation of Obamacare. None of them stood any chance of becoming a law — they were dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate. But to Heritage Action, they served a purpose: in the organization's parlance, to lock in members, to orient the Republican Party to conservative principles so that it would do the right thing.
Times columnist David Brooks noted in The Road to Character that Ms. Perkins discovered her calling to service and organizing after witnessing the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist fire. The analogy to something like the student loan debt crisis or child care, of course, isn't perfect — the debt crisis, for instance, has been slow burning as tuition rates have risen far above the inflation rate since the 1970s.
Under the reinsurance program, the government was supposed to collect $12 billion in 2014, but actual collections totaled $9.7 billion. Courts have held that when funds fall short of expectations, a federal agency should try to achieve the original statutory scheme as much as possible.
Michelle Cottle: So here's a question about ——
So I actually disagree with a lot of what Farhad said, even though, Farhad, I think you and I come from a pretty similar place ideologically. I agree with you both about the prison of gender expectations and about the need for they to refer to people who don't want to identify with a gender. So I'm old enough that the word still trips me up a little bit. But you know, I use it, and you need it for the people who want it. Where I disagree is the idea that it should be universalized, for a couple of reasons. I mean, first of all, I think there is a real difference between changing language to adapt to an underlying changing reality and trying to use language to change the underlying reality. I think the second is very fraught. It enrages people. It makes them feel like they're being forced to participate in a lie or in propaganda. I think that people's attachment to the gender binary is extremely deep. And different societies and different cultures attribute different qualities to men and women. So these qualities aren't essential. They're extremely historically contingent. And this can be changed when they don't suit us anymore. There might be an argument to make for rooting this out altogether. But it's very hard, for at least me, to picture what that society would look like.
He directs the Justice Department to take sides in a lawsuit that has been making its way through the federal courts. It was brought by Republican legal officials in a number of states. It has been ruled on by one judge in Texas that the Affordable Care Act is invalid.
The president's fans cheer his pugilism, as though he was bravely defending himself — and them — against big, bad bullies. But all too often, the price is paid by the innocent and vulnerable: migrant children snatched from their parents at the border, federal workers thrown into financial turmoil by the government shutdown, farm workers and manufacturers caught up in the trade war, the millions of Americans who stand to lose their health insurance if the administration keeps laboring to kill Obamacare.
The Green New Deal, as the name suggests, is essentially a program to create good jobs and simultaneously expand the use of clean energy, mostly through federal spending and performance standards. The resolution quickly became a symbol of the Democratic Party's insurgent progressives, attracting criticism from the right and the center. Some of the criticism was fair. The resolution is too vague to be rigorously analyzed; it's a statement of principles, not a detailed policy. In places, the Green New Deal puts more emphasis on left-wing priorities than on fighting climate change. It mentions repairing historic oppression yet omits nuclear power.
You do what you can with 50 votes to offer people what's possible. And then when lots of people get experience with it and they say, I like this, this works for me, then we vote on it and everybody gets better off and gets to try it. I think that's what's going to happen on Medicare for all. In fact, I think that is the way that we can solve our health care problems.
What's the perfect in this case? Climate-policy purists are focused on the notion of a carbon tax to discourage greenhouse gas emissions, and they look down on any proposal that doesn't put such a tax front and center.
To certain audiences. He said facetiously — but not really facetiously — you recall that in 2010, John McCain turned himself into the most conservative senator in the Senate when he was running for re-election in 2010. That was the re-election when John McCain sort of tried to disassociate himself with the term maverick, when, in fact, two years earlier, he had based his entire presidential campaign about being a maverick. People at that point were asking, what's going on with John McCain? So I think, in a sense, he was pointing out the synergy between his hero eight years ago and what he was going through today. But again, that's a pretty transparent way of looking at and describing what is happening to someone when they are essentially doing political contortions. [MUSIC] Lindsey Graham is, one, a good politician, two, someone who is fully aware of what the political reality is for him as a conservative or someone who wants to be re-elected in a very conservative state and a very conservative party, and is someone who knows very much how Washington works.
Thus, Representative Jason Chaffetz insisted that the public outcry is just a paid attempt to bully and intimidate; Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, calls all anti-Trump demonstrations a very paid, AstroTurf-type movement. And the tweeter in chief angrily declared that protests have been planned out by liberal activists — because what could be worse than political action by the politically active?
KK: Do you feel comfortable with there still being nuclear weapons in Turkey?
Beware the glass cliff. Ms. Fraser will be the first woman to lead a major American bank. Given Citi's faltering fortunes, she will contend with the perception — backed by research — that women are more likely than men to be given tough cleanup jobs when promoted to top roles, setting them up for failure. (See also: Ginni Rometty at IBM and Mary Barra at G.M.) Here's what Ms. Fraser had to say:
CW: Can I ask about that?
BS: Last question. What are you likely to fail at as president?
Yes. I just think it's got this — no one has to say there is a conflict of interest, and I'm not trying to talk about anyone's individual circumstances, but I think one of the things we have to deal with in public life is the appearance of conflict of interest. You know, that's supposed to be the guiding principle, for example, for judges. It's not whether or not there is a conflict of interest, it's whether or not people in the public could reasonably be concerned that it were, because it's important that you believe that judges are acting independently and not influenced because they're going to get money or someone in their family is going to get money. And so that's where I think the analogy is the closest, and whether you make it a rule of ethics or whether do you actually just make it part of the law, I think is a fair question, but I get why we should push in that direction.
14 million fewer people will be enrolled in Medicaid in 10 years.
Critics of Senator Warren's student debt plan say it would unfairly benefit those on the path to becoming highly paid professionals.
Consumers come in, eager to see their coverage options, said Jesus Frias, an insurance counselor at Variety Care. We go through their case, we help them apply, and often we find that they are not eligible for Medicaid or subsidized coverage in the marketplace.
But on Sunday, Jeb Bush was also asked to answer for his father's and brother's appointees to the Supreme Court — specifically David Souter, appointed by President George H. W. Bush, and Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., who was appointed by President George W. Bush and helped uphold President Obama's health care law.
A Washington Post tally of President Obama's campaign promises found that he kept 11 promises (expand hate crime statutes, insure more Americans, establish a credit-card Bill of Rights), compromised on 12 (end the war in Iraq in 16 months, increase the earned-income tax credit) and failed on 17 (raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation, create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants).
But I get it. There are right now, Democrats against Democrats on this. But understand this, we'll get into a general election. Oh, I know what the insurance industry will want to do. I know what Donald Trump will want to do. But the truth is we're going to have the party who tried to take away health care from 35 million Americans, said it was O.K. to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions and is continuing to follow that right now, both in their lawsuits and in their agency practices, and millions of people have lost their health care.
BS: Well, you had your fire.

What's happened to Lindsey Graham? Not a damn thing. Nothing.
So many people are saying it's going to be OK, everything's fine, we have what we need. And if this goes on for a month or two or three or five like it did in China, and we're already this strained, we don't have what we need. I don't really care if I get in trouble for speaking to the media. I want people to know that this is bad. People are dying. We don't have the tools that we need in the emergency department and in the hospital to take care of them, and — and it's really hard.
Plandemic went online on May 4 when its maker, Mikki Willis, a little-known film producer, posted it to Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and a separate website set up to share the video. For three days, it gathered steam in Facebook pages dedicated to conspiracy theories and the anti-vaccine movement, most of which linked to the video hosted on YouTube. Then it tipped into the mainstream and exploded.
The defeat of Senator Luther Strange, Republican of Alabama, in a primary election on Tuesday night appears to have ushered in a season of savage nomination fights and activist-led attacks on party leaders, especially on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. Despite enjoying the strong backing of President Trump, Mr. Strange lost by a wide margin to Roy Moore, a firebrand religious activist and former judge, who denounced Mr. Strange as a puppet of the Senate leader.
At least when the Republicans are in power, you certainly hear a lot of criticism of the filibuster. I think they're wrong. I think they're wrong because, ultimately, we're all likely, sooner or later, especially in an era where power shifts back and forth, to find ourselves in that large minority facing that narrow majority. And I think it is important that narrow majorities can't make big changes in how our government does what it does. That's not a reason for us being unable to make any changes in how our system works. I think that is the result of a different problem, of a sense that we are passive in the face of the structure of the system. I talk to a lot of members of Congress. For my sins, I spent a lot of time with congressional Republicans. And I would say, they all have complaints about how Congress works. They all even have complaints about how the budget process works. When you say to them, well, you could just change it, it's up to you, that feels like news. And it's not the way they've ever really thought about the role they have. I think changing that and helping people see that the structure, the rules of the system — within the bounds of the Constitution, which are pretty broad bounds, in most respects — that system can be changed, and we should think about how it should be changed.
I'm eager to get to you and your folks the remainder of what I call the entire health initiative, Mr. Biden told Mr. Barkan. That goes beyond Obamacare with a public option or Medicare for all, goes beyond that in terms of a whole new care network across the board, of giving people more flexibility, allowing people to not have to make choices between their job and taking care of a parent who's dying.
The latest attempt is a lawsuit claiming that the 2017 tax cut, which reduced the penalty for not having insurance to $0, somehow made the entire Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. It's a ludicrous claim, both in terms of substance — would the law suddenly become constitutional if the penalty were a penny? — and because it's clear that this was not legislators' intention.
WASHINGTON — Standing before a diverse new class of House Democrats, in the shadow of their new female speaker, President Trump showed on Tuesday how he planned to govern in a divided Washington.
Yeah. I think we need to bring our combat troops home.
You don't think debates about racism —
I was at Netroots Nation last weekend. And they had converted most of the bathrooms in the convention center into all-gender restrooms. What it meant was basically that you sort of had to, if you're a woman, you kind of had to often walk by men in urinals to go use the bathroom. I thought that maybe I was the only person who was so stodgy and old-fashioned as to feel mildly uncomfortable. But there was one bathroom in another part of the building that hadn't been converted, and it had, like, three stalls. And there was this huge line of women waiting to use it. Don't get me wrong. Trans women have every right in the world to use women's bathrooms. Trans men have every right in the world to use men's bathrooms. I think that this kind of rush to pretend that gender is not an important organizing principle can end up trotting on the needs of women for whom their lived experience is that it necessarily is.
Since entering the Democratic race in November, former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg has outspent almost all of his opponents in TV advertisements, spending over $100 million in just the first month.
KK: Well, so you're going to kill the filibuster?
A photojournalist for The Times spent three weeks in Mosul, Iraq, documenting the battlefront and the humanitarian crisis there.
We should be building on Obamacare, we should not scrap Obamacare, he said, rising to his feet as he addressed a cheering crowd.
He also defended the Obama administration's record on health care and immigration, something he would continue to do, fiercely and energetically, throughout two other stops on Saturday, though speaking at AFSCME, he stopped short of accusing his opponents of criticizing Mr. Obama, an argument he had made following the debate. At AFSCME, he said that the administration's controversial deportation practices focused on felons.
Senator Warren said in March that she hopes to pass a constitutional amendment to protect every American's right to vote. She added, Every vote matters, and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.
Yeah, this is something I always want liberals to understand better about Mitch McConnell. He is not a unique, evil genius. He's simply somebody who correctly understands the incentives of the system that we have set up and that we allow to roll forward. And in a way, he's weaker than other Senate leaders. A lot of other Senate leaders, because of their feelings about the Senate, because of how they wanted to be remembered, they fought the incentives of our zero-sum electoral system. They fought against the currents that were happening in their time. And maybe they weren't entirely successful, but the thing McConnell does is capitulate to them. The thing McConnell does is say, OK, I am here to represent the Republican Party and to represent its interests. And so, obviously, my job is to maximize the Republican Party's power and strategic advantage under the rules to get the outcomes that I want. That isn't some crazy tactical insight. It's simply being unwilling to do what a lot of other leaders have done, which is show restraint because you're worried about where that path will lead. [MUSIC PLAYING] One of the things that I always try to tell people about the Senate — and because of your time there, I'd be curious to hear how much you think this is a viable way of explaining it.
Many Democratic politicians criticized the decision Wednesday as insensitive to the needs of the public in a crisis, including Joe Biden, who leads the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also released a statement, suggesting it may become a campaign issue. Democrats made health care a centerpiece of many House races in the 2018 midterm elections.
Opposed Obamacare from day one, voting against it.
They assume that congressional leaders have the ability to direct what in effect would be gigantic energy firms and gigantic investment houses without giving sweetheart deals to vested interests, without getting corrupted by this newfound power, without letting the whole thing get swallowed up by incompetence. (This is a Congress that can't pass a budget.)
Which would put us in kind of a familiar situation of having considered a big government-run health care system and saying, no, thanks.
The court granted requests from Democratic state officials and House members who wanted to thrust the fate of the Affordable Care Act into the public eye just as Americans prepare to vote this November. The Supreme Court did not say when it would hear the case, but under its ordinary practices, arguments would be held in the fall and a decision would land in the spring or summer of 2021.
NF: But it's also about the Medicare for all plan.
I'm sorry, say it again. Facebook?
Those experiences help explain why Warren thinks that bigger changes are sometimes more feasible than modest ones. Bigger changes — tangible, new ideas — can overcome voter cynicism. A lot of people don't believe you can actually make any change on economics, Warren says. I would add another, even larger, example to the pattern: Obamacare. Trump has undone many of Obama's more modest changes, on taxes, climate and other areas. But Obama's grandest accomplishment endures. For all its flaws, it proved too popular to kill.
Democrats could use budget reconciliation to speed up Biden's pandemic stimulus bill. The reconciliation process allows Congress to advance certain spending and tax bills on a simple majority vote. Credit... Oliver Contreras for The New York Times If President Biden wants to quickly enact his $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal over Republican opposition, Democrats have a powerful tool they could use to do it: a fast-track process known as budget reconciliation. With reconciliation, Democrats could muscle through the package — which would provide billions of dollars for vaccine deployment, another round of stimulus checks and an extension of unemployment benefits — on a simple majority vote, bypassing a messy filibuster fight that would require them to win over enough Republicans to reach a 60-vote threshold. While Mr. Biden has said he wants to abandon the partisan tactics of the past and forge compromises with Republicans, he has also proposed an ambitious plan that stands little chance of broad support from the party. And there is little time to maneuver it through both chambers before jobless benefits lapse in March. We want to work with our Republican colleagues to advance this legislation in a bipartisan way, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said at a news conference on Tuesday. But the work must move forward — preferably with our Republican colleagues, but without them if we must.
Well, I think there certainly was a way in which the populism of white Southerners moved from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party in the course of the mid-20th century. And that certainly played a part in the transformation of our politics that created the kind of modern arrangement of our parties as we know them so that by the 1990s, it was natural to expect that Republicans would win elections in the South and lose elections in the Northwest and the Northeast and the parties were fighting for the Midwest. American politics hasn't always been like that, but it's been like that for some time, as a result of that transformation. I think it's certainly not all that's going on, but what you point to is a process that happens in both parties, where there are populist energies, which have a lot to do with the base energy of the party. There's also a kind of elite, more intellectual-minded consensus at the top that tries to, as you say, harness this in constructive ways, that tries to use it to the good but also to contain some of what's dangerous about it. The Democratic Party, obviously, has had to struggle with itself in this way over and over in the course of the second half of the 20th century. At times, it has been unable to contain that and has brought itself to the point of really dramatic electoral losses. Think about '72 or '84.
Some insurers worry that consumers will be confused and may see short-term policies as a substitute for major medical coverage.
I'm David Leonhardt. And this is The Argument. This week, have we finally reached full Trumpification of the Republican Party?
A Federal District Court judge in Texas agreed, ruling that the entire law was invalid, but he postponed the effects of his ruling until the case could be appealed. In December, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, agreed that the mandate was unconstitutional but declined to rule on the fate of the remainder of the health law, asking the lower court to reconsider the question in more detail.
And the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court deserves special attention. There's a lot we don't know about Kavanaugh, partly because Senate Republicans are blocking Democratic requests for more information. But we do know he's starkly, extremely, anti-labor — way to the right of the mainstream, and well to the right even of most Republicans.
Would a President Jeb Bush have signed a strong executive order on religious liberty, or would a President Marco Rubio have started construction of a wall? Would President John Kasich have had the intestinal fortitude to execute such a huge reorganization of the Environmental Protection Agency, dismantling the liberal bureaucracy that with its deeply embedded biases harms our economy? Would President Mitt Romney have pushed through such a major tax overhaul? No way. What makes Mr. Trump different is that he just doesn't care what the bed-wetting caucus says about his policies.

For those who are too poor to afford health insurance, Medicaid is a lifeline. This joint federal and state program doesn't care whether you're white or black, Christian or Muslim, Republican or Democrat, a city dweller or a rural resident. In states that expanded their Medicaid programs under Obamacare, all you have to be is poor enough to qualify.
And when the loss of economic opportunity led, as it usually does, to social dysfunction — to broken families and despair — all too many whites were ready to blame the victims. The problem, many asserted, lay in black culture — or, some hinted, in racial inferiority.
But it's to work with nations and say, you want access to the American consumer, you've got to start raising your standards in a meaningful way. And here's where the long-term goals are, here's where you are, here's what constitutes moving toward those. And I think that's where a lot of folks would like to go, and frankly we should be working with other nations on helping, not just those who lag way behind, but those who have good standards to be using the same kind of approach to trade. The idea that trade is just about tariffs is just old 20th century. Trade today in the 21st century is about regulation. It's about who's going to have to meet what regulatory standards.
Like, meaning — give me a time frame.
The change would require states to define their own package of essential health benefits, so that people who shop will be eligible for federal subsidies to help them pay their premiums. That means that the benefits in a standard plan are likely to vary by state. Before Obamacare, fewer than 10 states required insurers to cover maternity care, for example.
In place of a common vision is a truly unappetizing stew. Modest subsidies to help people buy insurance are the Mini-Me versions of Obamacare policies, so reduced as to be almost completely useless to millions of people, especially older and lower-income people and those in states with high medical costs, such as Alaska, North Carolina and Oklahoma — all of which happen to have voted for Mr. Trump. Another provision is an old conservative hobby horse championed by people like House Speaker Paul Ryan: cutting federal spending on Medicaid, which provides insurance to 74 million poor, disabled and elderly Americans. The main goal here is to cut taxes for the rich, even though the change would devastate beneficiaries, state government budgets and public hospitals.
Six centuries later, in the United States, a growing labor movement before World War I culminated, after the war, in stronger unions, widespread strikes and the end of the 12-hour workday. The war, in addition to the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918, resulted in a shortage of working men, so many of these jobs opened to women for the first time. In turn, women gained more power to argue for things like higher wages and the right to vote.
With the primary season winding down and the midterms soon upon us, it's time to point out that this election is not about what you may think it's about. It is not a choice between the particular basket of policies offered by the candidates for House or Senate in your district or state — policies like gun control, right to choose, free trade or fiscal discipline. No, what this election is about is your first chance since 2016 to vote against Donald Trump.
Alex Kingsbury: The Trump administration has made an effort to get Europeans to pay more for their own defense as being part of NATO. Is that a goal that you support even if you don't support the way he's going about it? And how might you achieve those goals?
Look, I have argued for a long time that we need not to expand our nuclear arsenal, and that is the direction the Trump administration has been taking us.

In the October Democratic debate, Times national editor Marc Lacey asked Mr. Yang to comment on Senator Warren's calls to break up companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google. Mr. Yang said Senator Warren is correct in her diagnosis of the problem but breaking up the companies isn't an adequate solution because using a 20th-century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new tool kit.

'Tomorrow our fridges will be empty,' one European health official says as vaccines dwindle. Nurses preparing vaccines at a nursing home in Spain last week. Credit... Manu Brabo/Getty Images The European Union has been besieged by problems since it approved its first coronavirus vaccine in December and rushed to begin a vast immunization campaign, but now its woes have snowballed into a full-blown crisis. With the pain of supply shortages being felt across Europe, Spain on Wednesday became the first E.U. country to partly suspend immunizations for lack of doses. It announced that it would suspend the vaccination program in Madrid for two weeks, and warned that Catalonia may follow suit. Tomorrow our fridges will be empty, said Josep Maria Argimon, a regional health official in Catalonia, referring to the dwindling supplies of vaccine. Tensions were also raised by an escalating dispute with AstraZeneca over the drugmaker's announcement that it would slash deliveries of its vaccine by 60 percent because of production shortfalls. When the European Union approved its first vaccine, made by Pfizer and BioNTech, in December, it was already weeks behind rich nations like the United States and Britain. While it is flush with cash, influence and negotiating heft, the bloc of 27 nations has found itself behind not just the U.S. and Britain, but also other countries like Israel, Canada and the United Arab Emirates. Across the world, many countries, particularly poorer ones, are struggling to secure any vaccine at all. Last week, the E.U.
Senator Warren has proposed using the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice to undo anti-competitive mergers currently in place, then passing legislation designating companies worth more than $25 billion in revenue as platform utilities.

You mention his name any time over the last six months to 12 months, and you get this combination grimace, shrug, follow-up question — yeah, what's going on? And in all the sort of Trump-era Republican mysteries, when we ask ourselves, what happened to this person, why is this person changing his or her mind so much now about Donald Trump, Lindsey Graham kind of is the signature mystery of the Trump era as far as what these conversions look like. Lindsey Graham grew up in a very small town in South Carolina, the town of Central, South Carolina. And his parents owned a bar there called the Sanitary Cafe. And not only did they own it, but they lived in an apartment right behind the bar. They shared a restroom with the patrons of the bar. And he went from there — he was the first member of his family to go to college. His parents died when he was in his early 20s. He joined the military. He eventually got into politics and then was elected to Congress and, eventually, was elected to the Senate, where, over the years, he's become known as kind of a reliable conservative, pretty partisan Republican.
I'll be the first to admit I'm as surprised as anyone to be in this position, said Brad Woodhouse, the executive director of the health care advocacy group Protect Our Care . Mr. Woodhouse worked at the Democratic National Committee when the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, and saw Democrats struggle to discuss it in the years afterward. But every poll we take, it's the issue that's most important to people.
There is also no mention of a national ban on fracking, which Mr. Biden has avoided calling for, despite pressure from young climate activists. But there are other signs that progressives on the task force were able to push Mr. Biden to the left.
Democrats, of course, also tend to oppose Republican presidents' policies and often try to obstruct them. But on the question of legislative compromise, there really has been a recent difference between the parties. (Which can be a difficult thing for us journalists to acknowledge: We're more comfortable portraying the parties as mirror images of each other.)
Now we are at another hugely plastic moment — a moment when the world is experiencing four climate changes at once: There's a change in the climate of the climate — the hots are getting hotter, the wets wetter, the droughts drier, the forest fires fiercer. There's been a change in the climate of globalization — we are going from an interconnected world to an interdependent one. There's been a change in the climate of work — machines can think, reason and manipulate as fast, and increasingly better, than human beings.
So just make the brief case for us about why you think it's important for us to start using they on an everyday basis more often and he or she less often.
The arguments did reveal some tensions between the Republican states that brought the case, led by Texas, and Mr. Trump's Justice Department. For example, a lawyer for Texas took issue with a puzzling new Justice Department position — revealed in a May brief — that the ruling should apply only in the 18 plaintiff states, not nationwide. The Republican states would need to evaluate if they had been the victim of a bait and switch, said the Texas lawyer, Kyle D. Hawkins.
Five and a half years —
Senator Warren's Medicare for all would require $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over the next 10 years. She has promised the money won't come from raising taxes on the middle class and maintains that between defense cuts and a wealth tax, the costs would be covered. But of course, that would require Senate approval — and Senator McConnell has sworn it won't happen as long as I'm majority leader.

Murkowski, whom Palin had tried to cast as part of the entrenched establishment, suddenly became the underdog, a shift that galvanized her campaign. Her team passed out plastic bracelets that said, fill it in, write it in, with the correct spelling of her name. Murkowski defeated Miller, with the help of traditional Democratic constituencies like women and Alaska Natives. It was an unusual coalition for a Republican, said Mark Begich, at the time Alaska's other senator and a Democrat.
The question now is whether Trump will pay any price for betraying all his promises. Democrats took the House in 2018 largely because of the popular backlash against his attempt to destroy Obamacare. But there's a real danger that Democrats will blow the election by making it a referendum on ambitious ideas like so-called Medicare for all that are unlikely to become reality, rather than on Trump's ongoing efforts to destroy programs Americans love.
O.K.? And I have seen the billionaire go on TV and cry about it.
Josh, routinely described by mentors as respectful, has built a technology investment firm called Thrive that is worth billions. His crown jewel, a health insurance company called Oscar, was structured around Obamacare — the main thing Trump has been trying to explode.
Excuse me, where did that right come from, in your mind?
In November 1981, President Ronald Reagan, in a fight with Congress over $8.5 billion in budget cuts he wanted, ordered the furlough of 241,000 government employees. It was the first time a shutdown of that size was ordered.

Why is Republican support for Biden's economic plans a puzzle? Because most of the Republican rank and file believe (based on nothing but lies) that the election was stolen. So we're in a peculiar position where a substantial number of voters don't believe Biden has the right to be running the country, but effectively approve of the way he's running it, at least in terms of economic policy.
This denial of racism is the heartbeat of racism. Where there is suffering from racist policies, there are denials that those policies are racist. The beat of denial sounds the same across time and space.

But there is no magical fix for Obamacare. Our health care system is a messy hybrid of the public and private sectors. Obamacare eschewed radical change — which would have been even less popular, given the disruptions — for progress within the current framework. And the law has done far more good than bad, by expanding insurance coverage and helping slow the growth of medical costs.
The question of intent has informed National Public Radio's approach to covering Mr. Trump's many disputable claims: that he saw thousands of people in Jersey City cheering as the World Trade Center collapsed on Sept. 11, for example, or that the news media had made up a feud between him and the country's intelligence agencies, despite his own tweets likening those agencies to Nazi Germany.

But on the other hand, we have other diplomatic initiatives and it's really important that we're trying to work with this country, and they're important to us strategically for this reason and we have this ongoing negotiation in that political thing. Drag your heels, drag your heels, drag your heels, until the jobs have disappeared here. And then once you go forward, you've got to go forward through a different kind of court that's much slower.
In a statement Wednesday, Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey recommended that Congress include a special enrollment provision in its next round of coronavirus legislation. He had also proposed such language be included in the last bill. At a time when our health care system is already under enormous strain, it makes no sense to willingly allow even more individuals to go without coverage, he said.

The Supreme Court is weighing a Republican-backed legal challenge to the Affordable Care Act. A ruling is expected by June. But in oral arguments in the case in November, a majority of the justices indicated that they would reject attempts to kill the law.

The Affordable Care Act continued to grow in popularity after Republican efforts to repeal the legislation in 2017 — a recent poll found that over half of the public favors the legislation.
WASHINGTON — Ever since Republicans got down to the business of repealing the Affordable Care Act, the Senate has been singled out as the likely problem. Any plan that could zoom through the House would hit roadblocks among Senate Republicans, many of whom have resisted a wholesale repeal of the health law without a robust replacement plan.
As the chart below shows, lower income Americans of all ages and older ones in middle income brackets would receive materially less in government support under the Republican proposal than they are currently getting through Obamacare.
The budget reconciliation rules that would allow Republicans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act have strict limits. The rules are primarily intended to protect legislation that affects spending or revenues. The health law includes insurance market standards and other policies that do not directly affect the budget, and Senate Republicans would, in many cases, need 60 votes to change such provisions.
So you feel a genuine —
A month later, Heritage Action turned up the heat on the 34 Democrats — most of them so-called conservative Blue Dogs — who voted against Obamacare in March but had yet to sign King's discharge petition. In a press statement, Needham declared, I know their constituents, who will be attending town halls this August, are eager to hear why they do not support the repeal effort. In September, a single Democrat, Gene Taylor of Mississippi, added his signature. The tally reached 173, well short of what it would take for King's bill to make it to the House floor — much less to get it passed and then sent over to the Senate, where Republicans' appetite for abolishing Obamacare altogether was less acute than it was in the House.
Republicans including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Mike Lee of Utah joined Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive Democrats in condemning Robinhood's decision. By the afternoon, the company had committed to allowing limited buys of these securities.
KK: O.K., the Electoral College is really important to Jesse. So much of the biggest change in recent years has come through the Supreme Court. Who would be your Supreme Court nominees?
Well, I would take the combat troops out of there now. I see no immediate reason we'd send combat troops into the region, but I'd get the combat troops that are there now out.
I generally make a point of saying, paid labor, rather than labor when I wish to talk about work for a paycheck. You don't want to gloss over the enormous amount of work that gets done inside a household in raising kids especially. And yeah, I do think that is something that has gotten devalued for various reasons. That would mean households do need to make money and you want as many of them being able to sustain themselves as possible. But we aren't and shouldn't be materialists. And this gets, actually, to another point about the future of the Republican Party. There's been a lot of discussion over the last several years about the Republicans being a Workers' Party. There's something to be said for that compared to being a business owners party. It certainly makes more political sense. But I think being a parent's party is in some ways more attractive than either of those because that's something that includes material dimension, but it's not just replacing one materialist vision with another.
But we need, it seems to me, better language for what we're dealing with here because I think we keep having and then rebutting arguments that don't actually get at what is worth being concerned about, which is simply that these groups have too much power. At the same time, I'll often hear on the left, well, just break them up. But if you actually look at the ways people would do that, if you split up Amazon Web Services from Amazon and you split Instagram off of Facebook, I don't think the situation would actually change in any significant way or people would be any less concerned about it. So I think there's some conversation that needs to be had, but I'm actually struck by how insufficient our current vocabulary is at least in politics. I'm sure there are people in academia and elsewhere debating this at a much higher level of sophistication.

If this were ever put into practice, there would have to be several new Pentagons built to house the hundreds of thousands of new social planners. The elite universities would have to be transformed into technocratic academies in which the children of the rich were trained so they could be dirigistes for the state.
The Oxford team, which was in charge of the earliest trials of the vaccine, did not want to vaccinate older people until they had collected extensive safety data for younger participants, Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, said in an interview with La Repubblica, an Italian newspaper, this week. Other vaccine makers, Mr. Soriot said, decided to vaccinate older people in trials before they had accumulated as much safety data, allowing them to make stronger claims about efficacy in that age group. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration is waiting on data from a clinical trial that enrolled about 30,000 participants, mostly Americans, and that will include more older people. The results are expected in the coming weeks. AstraZeneca is expected to have sufficient safety data from that study to file for emergency use authorization from the F.D.A. around the first week of March.

I am in this fight because my daddy ended up as a janitor. I got my big chance at a commuter college that cost $50 a semester, because a bunch of taxpayers had invested in that college. That opportunity is not there today. That same college costs $15,000 now. Kids have to load up on debt to go there today. That's not expanding opportunity in this country. We've got a choice to make as a nation and the good news about 2020, the door has opened just a crack, that all the things that have been broken for so long, Donald Trump has made so much worse and gotten so many people off the sidelines, we actually have a chance. Not just to nibble, but to make big change.

One thing I think about when trying to evaluate Donald Trump's success and the lessons of it is that those of us, and this describes you and me, who are policy wonks by inclination and trade, have a tendency to pick through Trumpism and find the policy threads. And so, he did a lot of things in the 2016 campaign made a lot of comments that were more moderate, right? He wasn't going to cut entitlements. He's going to raise taxes on people like himself. He was to give everybody beautiful, generous, healthcare. And then there are a number of Republicans who are trying to build a post-Trump, Trumpism, around his policies. And even people who were one time critics of him, like Lindsey Graham, has said, what we need to do is keep Donald Trump's policies and just move forward from there. But I do think one question is, whether or not — what Donald Trump really understood, was that policy communication wasn't very important. And that what is uniting Republicans right now at the core of the energy in the party, is a sense of cultural threat. And you could describe that in a lot of different ways and it comes together in different ways. It's racial change, right, demographic change. It's secularization in society. He did do very well among evangelical voters, in general, and they stayed with him in a very loyal way through 2020.
So is there any alternative to Obamacare? Of course there is. We could go back to being a country in which people with pre-existing conditions and/or low incomes can't get health insurance, where for a large fraction of the population illness either goes untreated or leads to bankruptcy. That would, in part, mean becoming a country in which Americans who caught Covid-19 during the pandemic would be uninsurable for the rest of their lives.
Well, that's a hard question. I'm inclined, at first, to riff a little bit on The Lord of the Rings, but that's better as a book, really, than a movie. I think my answer, oddly enough, would be Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day is an incredibly rich movie. It's not just a conservative movie. But it makes an argument that, ultimately, we find our fulfillment not by expressing ourselves and drawing our true meaning out of our own will, but by meeting higher external standards of virtue. And I think that's a profound case for what conservatism stands for, from my point of view. It's a beautiful way to make that argument without being off-putting. It's a wonderful movie.
Clinton: We need to do our part on refugees. It's brave for a politician say that at a time when there is such fear of refugees. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
But it's to work with nations and say, you want access to the American consumer, you've got to start raising your standards in a meaningful way. And here's where the long-term goals are, here's where you are, here's what constitutes moving toward those. And I think that's where a lot of folks would like to go, and frankly we should be working with other nations on helping, not just those who lag way behind, but those who have good standards to be using the same kind of approach to trade. The idea that trade is just about tariffs is just old 20th century. Trade today in the 21st century is about regulation. It's about who's going to have to meet what regulatory standards.
Another facility reported one confirmed and six presumed Covid-19 deaths to the Health Department, according to the report. The attorney general's office, however, said the facility reported to its investigators that there were more than four times that number — 31 dead — by mid-April. Deaths in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities have accounted for about a third of the nation's some 430,000 deaths. Federal and state authorities have made vaccinating staff and residents at such facilities a top priority, though that effort has been slower than hoped. In New York, where there have been more than 42,000 virus-related deaths, the toll in the state's nursing homes has been a particular source of agony for residents and their families. It has also been a political liability for Mr. Cuomo, who has pushed back on accusations that his administration did not do enough to safeguard a highly vulnerable population. The findings of Ms. James would seem to put her in rare conflict with Mr. Cuomo, the state's three-term Democratic incumbent. Ms. James was the governor's favored choice to succeed Eric T. Schneiderman after he suddenly resigned as attorney general in 2018; she readily embraced Mr. Cuomo's political backing. The attorney general asked 62 nursing homes — about a tenth of the state's total — for information about on-site and in-hospital deaths related to the virus; investigators then cross-referenced that information with public reports of deaths issued by the Health Department.
Madison was alive, and at one point, he wrote to Calhoun and responded to his ideas. He wrote in response to Calhoun's ideas that this is not what he intended at all. But then he died, and he was the last of the framers to go. And so then, Calhoun sort of had the floor to himself to reinvent the idea of the Senate. And what you find about this — and I think an example that you raise as well — is that they're not doing this on behalf of a vulnerable minority. They are doing this on behalf of the wealthy, the powerful, and historically, throughout our history, often in pursuit of oppression of vulnerable people. For Calhoun, it was the maintenance of slavery. For senators in the Jim Crow era, it was the continued oppression of Black Americans in the reign of terror, known as Jim Crow. There was an instance in the 1940s, I believe, where there was a federal anti-poll tax bill on the floor, and you had a senator from Texas defeated on a filibuster and then tell the press immediately afterwards that the issue was not poll taxes, even though the state he represented, Texas, still had poll taxes on the book, but no, no, the issue was not Texas's continued maintenance of poll taxes, it was free speech. And so that is an out for the powerful and the oppressive to ignore the consequences of their actions and try to make this about something else.
Even worse is the way budget reconciliation quietly decides which kinds of problems the Senate addresses, and which it ignores, years after year. Both House and Senate Democrats have said that their first bill will be the For The People Act, a package making it easier and safer to vote, and weakening the power big donors wield in politics by matching small donor donations at a 6:1 rate. But the For The People Act can't pass through the budget reconciliation process, so it's a dead letter.
While not all health coverage was capped, most companies had some sort of limit in place in 2009. A 2017 Brookings analysis estimated that 109 million people would face lifetime limits on their coverage without the health law, with some companies saying they would cover no more than $1 million in medical bills per employee. The vast majority of people never hit those limits, but some who did were forced into bankruptcy or went without treatment.
It's not the role of the federal bureaucrat to impose their own meanings on the words that their representatives have enshrined into law, he said.
They will also visit the Wuhan Institute of Virology and a laboratory operated by Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The question of the pandemic's origin has caused friction between China and the United States, with officials in each country at times blaming the other for unleashing the virus on the world. Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said on Wednesday that the United States hoped for a robust and clear international investigation. Chinese officials, in response, defended the country's handling of the inquiry. We hope the U.S. side will work with China, take on a responsible attitude and respect facts, science and the diligent work of W.H.O. experts, Zhao Lijian, a spokesman for the Chinese foreign ministry, said at a news conference in Beijing on Thursday. Chinese officials said on Friday that several passengers traveling to China from the United States had falsified coronavirus test results so they could gain entry to the country. The Chinese consulate in San Francisco said the passengers had changed their test results from positive to negative and that other travelers had lied about test results. The consulate did not provide details about the passengers or the punishments they might face. China maintains strict border control rules, including a requirement that travelers present results from antibody and nucleic acid tests before they fly. The consulate said the passengers had violated public health laws. The way they put others at risk is odious, the statement said.
This action demonstrates that President Trump is committed to fixing the damage caused by Obamacare as soon as possible, said Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming.

The record of the Trump administration was such a grab bag of Trump's distinctive nationalist policies, and just old line Republican stuff, and a little bit of, frankly, a little bit of the reform conservative stuff that I was pushing, among many others for a few years. It's a grab bag, right? So, different people who say that, oh, it's Trump's policies. They mean totally different things by that, right? Lindsey Graham might mean tax cuts when he is talking about that. And Senator Cotton might be talking about a crack down on illegal immigration. And one of the problems that Republicans have right now is that every argument inside the party ends up being sucked into the vortex of an argument about Trump, and Trump personally, Trump's personality, and so forth. And he's paralyzed the Republican policy debate for that reason. And the fact that there's so little coherence to Trump and to his record has helped contribute to that as well. [MUSIC PLAYING]
NF: In the last month or so, your — I know you don't poll, but others do, and your poll numbers have gone down, and it seems to coincide with your major rollout of your health plan and the attacks you've gotten, basically painting you as extremist, going too far, both from Wall Street, from other candidates and elsewhere. And I'm wondering if that's because people are afraid of what you're proposing as much as others might like it?
So, there's a new conservative take on who's to blame for Donald Trump — and the answer, it turns out, is liberal commentators, and me in particular. Yep, by denouncing the dishonesty of people like Mitt Romney, I was crying wolf, so that voters paid no attention to warnings about Trump.
But what about the people who are being covered by government-run health care programs like Medicare? Do they like it? Is it working well for them in this period — the 1960s, the 1970s?
I don't like that cartoon, said CNN's chief marketing officer, Allison Gollust, who was in Zucker's office when I asked about it. I don't know why you framed it.
Consumers come in, eager to see their coverage options, said Jesus Frias, an insurance counselor at Variety Care. We go through their case, we help them apply, and often we find that they are not eligible for Medicaid or subsidized coverage in the marketplace.
b) Gente que muera en la intemperie
That sort of glibness, in turn, is likely to give already-ascendant Democratic ideas a boost. The party's enthusiasm for Medicare for All has flourished recently in part because it exists in a vacuum, with little if any substantive competition from the right. There are serious practical and political impediments to making a transition to single payer, from the enormous increase in federal spending and the tax increases it would almost certainly entail to the disruption that would be caused by the elimination of current private health insurance coverage for millions of Americans.

Washington also had a higher than usual rate of younger people among the 7,000 who took advantage of that state's extra enrollment period last spring.
Now successful is a relative term: Our president is still deeply unpopular, still under investigation and embroiled in scandal, still unable to push a substantial agenda through the Congress, still likely to see his party lose the House of the Representatives in November.
I'm biased because he's a very good friend of mine. But, I think, I would give both to a progressive, who wants to learn about conservatism, and the other way around, Yuval Levin's, book The Great Debate about the debate between Thomas Paine and Edmund Burke. Because Yuval, being a conservative, is very much on the Burke side of this. But he does such a nice job and is such a fair-minded articulator of their different positions. I mean, my own experience was that I ended up being a little bit, maybe more sympathetic to Paine and a little bit less sympathetic to Burke by the end of that book.
A Medicare for All plan would in effect say to these people, We're going to take away your current plan, but trust us, the replacement will be better. And we're going to impose a bunch of new taxes to pay for all this, but trust us, it will be less than you and your employer currently pay in premiums.
Yeah, absolutely. I think it gets at a very interesting point and a very important point in this moment, when we have a new administration that, it seems to me, wants to make some cross-partisan deals. Because the point you make really can help us see where those deals are to be had, which is not quite where they would have been had 15 years ago, as you say. My first job in Washington, now more than 20 years ago, an even older man, was for a Republican member of Congress named Bob Franks, who was really a wonderful member and a great mentor. He was a pro-choice Republican. He was, in every other way, and absolutely mainstream Republican. He was in the leadership some of his career. He was on the Budget Committee. But he didn't agree with most other Republicans in the House about abortion. That kind of Republican today would have a much harder time being as central as Franks was in the Republican Party in that time. And I think it's even more the case on the Democratic side that a pro-life Democrat, of which there were many in that time when I started working in the House, would have a very hard time now functioning in the party.
The candidates in the second debate spent more time discussing civil rights and spent less time on jobs and the economy.
On NPR's Morning Edition on Wednesday, Mary Louise Kelly explained that she had looked up the definition of lie in the Oxford English Dictionary. A false statement made with intent to deceive, Ms. Kelly said. Intent being the key word there. Without the ability to peer into Donald Trump's head, I can't tell you what his intent was. I can tell you what he said and how that squares, or doesn't, with facts.
Was this climb-down a reaction to threats of retaliation, or did the administration not at first realize that the tariffs would mainly hit our allies? Either way, Trump may have gotten the worst of both worlds: angering countries that should be our friends and establishing a reputation as an untrustworthy ally and trading partner, without even doing much for the industry he was supposedly trying to help.
Why is Republican support for Biden's economic plans a puzzle? Because most of the Republican rank and file believe (based on nothing but lies) that the election was stolen. So we're in a peculiar position where a substantial number of voters don't believe Biden has the right to be running the country, but effectively approve of the way he's running it, at least in terms of economic policy.
To calculate how many people would be uninsured under the Republican plan, the C.B.O., a nonpartisan agency of economists and statisticians, also had to estimate what would happen if the Affordable Care Act were not repealed.
MC: So as you're out there trying to convince people to join you on this mission, at certain times, and certainly in the debates it's come up that people who do not embrace your path lack the political courage or will, or they're scared, as you've said, to embrace big change. Now, certainly this will appeal to a lot of Democratic voters, but there are also a lot of more moderate swing voters, Democratic voters who will be put off by the idea that just because they don't embrace your particular policies, they somehow are not courageous or that they're wrong in their ideas. So how do you reach out to these people, because you can't win the nomination just with the progressive base. You've got to kind of convince these people who are nervous about the big ideas. For instance, Medicare for all that you're pitching is not a overwhelmingly popular idea.
And it sounds like at the end of the day, he is being honest in the sense that nothing did happen to him. He is the same guy.
If Facebook has way too much power.
Tucked into President-elect Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus plan is a one-sentence provision that could drive billions in federal subsidies to help people afford to buy health insurance.
So let me do both of these, because I think there are two answers. There are two pieces in this answer. One is, I think attacking the corruption in Washington brings a lot more people together than most folks recognize, and that it really does reach across party lines.
Right. Even though it does redouble the loyalty of his base.
KK: As student loan debt has come up a couple of times, I want to make sure we have a question.
Oh, I'm not going to do names.
Serge Schmemann: Let me ask you about the Middle East. In the October debate you said, I think we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. Did you mean nowhere in the Middle East? Do you think — for example, who should control the Persian Gulf, freedom of navigation, should we close down the air base in Qatar?
Why attacking corruption and getting some structural change in our economy that actually is about not just the wealth gap top to bottom, but this fact that more and more and more of our value is being sucked up to the top, and more and more people are sliding back behind it. And not having power at the polls. How those three things are tied to each other.
What that means is that the door is open for a responsible Republican plan to improve the nation's mixed public-private health system. If the party's leaders were so inclined, they could take advantage of the Democratic overreach by embracing reforms that would build upon what exists and make it work better. Such a conservative reform plan would look something like this:
It doesn't go to a doctor making $1 million a year who also has $1 million in student loan debt.
In the case of steel, here's what happened: First came the splashy announcement of big tariffs, ostensibly in the name of national security — infuriating U.S. allies, which are the main source of our steel imports. Then came what looks like a climb-down: The administration has exempted Canada, Mexico, the European Union and others from those tariffs.
And it seems to me that what's happened in the Republican Party is that you had a generation of people like Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney who thought that everybody was really in it for the tax cuts, thought that this economic libertarianism was sincere instead of a cipher for a broader set of grievances. Trump has stripped that all away and gone back to giving the base of the party what it wants. Once you discover that this is what the voters of the Republican Party wanted, I don't see how you go back to giving them what they don't want so much.
Now senators are searching for changes to make the bill more politically palatable. But the notion of making those changes today and then speeding immediately to a vote is madness. There would be no time for experts to consider the consequences — to discover the sort of problems and unintended effects that last-minute changes are bound to create. By the time they did, the Senate would have passed it.
Well, you know, it obviously depends on the program, but I worry about — for example, increasing the dollar payment on Section 8 vouchers, it doesn't seem to increase the supply of housing. Instead, it seems to make a segment of landlords richer. So I'd rather take that money and put it directly into increasing housing supply.
And less than a minute later —
Exactly when the health care vote will occur is not yet clear. The current version of the compromise bill strips away minimum requirements for coverage, like maternity care, hospitalization and prescriptions.
It's true: If you just take Trump's mixture of positions, quasi-positions and non-positions and apply them to our current partisan divides, he does seem like he could have a large constituency in the American center. As a blue-state social liberal campaigning as an America First populist, he offers a kind of mash-up of stances taken by Acela corridor Bloombergists and Middle American radicals, and while some of those positions cost you turnout on the Republican side, on paper you could make up for that deficit by winning voters in the center who are turned off by libertarianism or neoconservatism or religious conservatism, but who'd give a tough-talking businessman who doesn't seem all that ideological a second look.
provides guidance to many low and middle income countries where women do not have access to doctors or nurses, he said. The W.H.O. 's recommendation was also made in the context of limited supply of the vaccines, Dr. Hombach said. I don't think the language is discouraging, but the language is stating the facts. Pfizer plans to begin a clinical study in pregnant women in the first half of 2021. Moderna said it was establishing a registry to record outcomes in pregnant women who receive its vaccine. Apoorva Mandavilli and
BS: Well, you had your fire.
You wrote a book arguing that the left-right divide is all there, or at least a version of it is all there, in the debates between Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine. So if someone has never read any primary sources from either person, where should they start?
The tragedy of today's Republican Party lies partly in how far it has tumbled from its heights.
And the fraudulence of this bill aside, even serious, nonfraudulent regulation of insurance companies isn't enough in itself to provide affordable coverage for pre-existing conditions. If that's all you do, those who sign up for coverage will be a lot sicker than those who don't, which means a bad risk pool, which means high premiums. That was New York's experience: Before the A.C.A., it had strong regulations on insurers, but high premiums meant that only people with health problems bought insurance on the individual market (as opposed to getting it from their employers), and this in turn kept premiums high.
Several candidates made pitches for the direction of the Democratic party. Representative Eric Swalwell of California directly went after Mr. Biden's age, and Mr. Sanders pivoted from a question about diversity in the party to reiterate his economic message.
So let me do the pitch, because I'll tell you exactly what the pitch is. That is the Affordable Care Act already requires employers to provide health care for their workers if they have more than 50 workers. I propose we just keep that in place, and that will yield about $9 trillion over the next 10 years. That's what they pay.
But the Trump administration has signaled loud and clear that its campaign against Obamacare is not over; that it will stop at nothing to achieve in court what it could not achieve in Congress; and that it doesn't care how many people are hurt if the Affordable Care Act is undone.
Since that day, as Trump's presidency has confirmed many of her fears, Gabriel has transformed her life. She used to be at home most nights, watching TV. Now she goes to political meetings three or four evenings a week, sometimes with Abby in tow. I could go every night — there's always something going on, she told me. Besides volunteering on local Democratic campaigns, she's working to coordinate volunteers across campaigns, to make sure they're deployed to the candidates who most need help.
That said, we can and should acknowledge that this bill is, as Biden once said of Obamacare, a very big deal for the country. And we can marvel, at least a little, at the trajectory of his political career, as this consummate centrist and proud bipartisan dealmaker begins to move in somewhat unexpected directions.
We must fight to make sure that we pass a Medicare for all health care system. [CROWD CHEERING]

Well, actually, you're going to have to explain to me what Andrew was — if I'm going to have to argue back against Andrew, you're going to have to tell me exactly what Andrew's argument is.

From your lips to Joe Manchin's ears. Let's do a couple of book recommendations before we wrap up here. Let me begin with the obvious one. What's just your favorite book?
You know, Astead, I'm struck by the fact that earlier on, you told us that Democrats and Republicans in the state, they had basically been on the same page about this primary until the virus gets worse and the governor advocates for a different kind of voting system through absentee ballots. And then it all breaks down, and Republicans are attempting at every turn to block him now in court. And how do you explain that? I mean, how do Republicans in the state legislature explain that?
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said Thursday that addressing entitlement spending is what you need to do to fully deal with this debt crisis, though Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader from Kentucky, said he has ruled out doing so this year.
But it's hard. It's a lot easier not to take on the drug industry. It's a lot easier not to take on the insurance industry. It's a lot easier not to take on the oil industry. But every single issue we care about, every single issue — think about it on climate. All across this country people are saying climate, climate, climate. If you're not willing to take on the corruption, we're going to get laws passed that are going to have great names: Save the World; Everything Is Green; Now Safe for Unicorns.

The court had heard arguments on the law a month earlier, and Kennedy had already told the other justices he considered it unconstitutional. He wanted to strike it down. Roberts had a different view, wanting to invalidate some of the law and keep other parts. During their conversations that April, the two of them talked through the substantive issues that the case involved, like the law's health insurance mandate, the cost of insurance premiums and so on.
And I think some of those people are bringing new energy to the single-payer moment.

No one had seen him, and he was told to stick the flyer on the wall, next to several other notices of missing people. He's not homeless, but he chooses to be on the streets, said Mr. Duran. We went to all the hospitals, police, the parks. Andy Bales, the chief executive officer of the Mission, had just sent an email to his staff, asking them to spread the word to all of our guests to vote. Share your voice, be part of it, is what he likes to say to the people living at the Mission. The homeless crisis here disproportionately affects black men, and many of the voters at the Mission said they were voting for Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose candidacy has focused on African-Americans. I'm most familiar with Joe Biden, said Patrick Wright, 50, who is African-American and recently got out of prison. He is living at the Mission while he tries to get his life back on track. Read more
But it's not going to be real change because so long as the lobbyists are writing it, so long as they're the ones who are in the ears of the folks in the House and the Senate, we're just going to keep making little, tiny changes, and I just don't think we can keep doing that.
It redoubles the loyalty of some part of his base. But if we assume his base is 45 percent of the country, then after Charlottesville his approval rating went down into the mid- to low 30s. So there's a big chunk of his base that I think believes in the Trump is a populist fighting for you message, and doesn't like the bigotry, and doesn't like the racism. So I think it's a big mistake to attribute these sort of multidimensional, chess-move brilliance to Trump's move here. What actually happened was that the Democratic Party was tearing itself apart because Nancy Pelosi and the leftward fringe in Congress can't get along with each other. And Trump saw a political scrum and wanted to jump in it because that's what he does. I expect his approval ratings to go down after this. We'll see what happens.
KK: Oh my god, we're running out of time. We have a bunch of questions around technology. [LAUGHTER]
The good news is that America is a far less racist, far more tolerant nation today than it was in 1970. Remarkably, multiple polls show a majority of Americans approving of the protests inspired by George Floyd's death, and strong disapproval of Trump's response.
This is the advice — some might even call it a warning — that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has been drilling into her caucus of late. If Democrats want to send President Trump packing in 2020, she told The Times recently, they must resist being pulled toward the hard, partisan fringes in ways likely to turn off the middle.
The proposal is also notable for what it did not include. In previous years, Mr. Trump's budget has proposed repealing the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with a system that would provide block grants of funding to states with far fewer rules about how the money should be spent. The new budget backs away from that approach. It leaves the law's funding in place but asks Congress to develop policies that would advance the president's health reform vision, with a corresponding price tag, which it says would save $844 billion over the decade.
If you have recently lost your job-based coverage, you can qualify for a special enrollment period to buy insurance on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Coverage there is subsidized on a sliding scale according to income, and there are several choices of plan in most markets.
That means that in 10 years, the number of uninsured Americans would be closer to what it was before the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama's signature health law, took effect.

But the other half, let's say you have a complaint because the trade agreement had said that some other country would permit unionization or would not use low-wage workers beyond a certain point. Do you get a path like that? A quick resolution? And by the way, I should point out: That quick resolution? There's no appeal from it. It is immediately enforceable against a government. So you can go straight against Canada for raising its environmental standards. You can go straight against a South American country for raising its standards to protect its children's health from smoking.

Then, for a few key months in 2008, previously solicitous media outlets began running hostile stories about him. A common theme was Mr. McCain's angry outbursts. Typical of the genre was a story at Alternet describing Mr. McCain as someone who should never be near the red button and another in The Washington Post, McCain: A Question of Temperament. The Post story was filled with quotes like this one from former Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican: His temper would place this country at risk in international affairs, and the world perhaps in danger. In my mind, it should disqualify him. The Boston Globe brought out Senator Thad Cochran, who said that the thought of a McCain presidency, sent a cold chill down my spine.
In a fundamental sense, Trumpism is the culmination of that strategy. Commentators keep calling Trump a populist, but the only way in which he actually caters to working-class white voters is by appealing to their racial animus. He may be successful in doing so partly because it's the only thing about his political persona that's sincere: All indications are that he really is a racist.
I'm convinced that this is part of his obsession with former President Barack Obama. Obama was quickly granted the thing Trump never had: upper-class acceptance and adulation.
We must fight to make sure that we pass a Medicare for all health care system. [CROWD CHEERING]
Right, I just want to cut in here to say that in the old welfare system it had a structure where, oftentimes, for somebody on welfare getting $1 in paid labor wages would cut a $1 in welfare earnings. So, it was a situation, I've spoken to Cathy Eaton, the researcher about this, where unless you could get a job in '96 that was — or '95 let's say before the reforms, that was above $8 an hour, which for many single parents was hard. It actually wasn't economically worth it to go back to work. That is not the structure of the child allowance, which if you can get a job that's about $200,000 a year, then you begin to lose some of the child allowance. But that's a very different kind of incentive structure.
Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, said the number of sign-ups was remarkable in view of headwinds created by premium increases for 2017 and by the uncertainty of the entire health law after Mr. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.
But we're only now starting to get a sense of the Republican Party's cruelty toward the economic victims of the coronavirus. In the face of what amounts to a vast natural disaster, you might have expected conservatives to break, at least temporarily, with their traditional opposition to helping fellow citizens in need. But no; they're as determined as ever to punish the poor and unlucky.
Not so, not so … but then neither have Republican voters simply cast the electability issue aside. Instead, on the evidence of polls, even many not-Trump voters have convinced themselves that Trump is the most electable candidate available, that he's better positioned than his rivals to beat Hillary, and that given the alternatives supporting him is actually the pragmatic thing to do.
In some ways, the bill is less generous to the rich and less punishing to the poor than previous drafts of the legislation. The super-rich no longer qualify for a tax credit. Unlike previous drafts, which allowed anyone, regardless of income, to qualify for assistance, the bill offers the full subsidies only to individuals earning less than $75,000 a year or to joint filers earning $150,000. The subsidies slowly decrease above that threshold, meaning the country's unemployed millionaires would still have to pay full freight for their health insurance.

To be sure, we are better off with the A.C.A. than without it, Mr. Starr added, but we ought to be prepared to go beyond it and create a system that doesn't leave so many Americans in the lurch.
The relief bill President Biden just signed is breathtaking in its scope. Yet conservative opposition was remarkably limp. While not a single Republican voted for the legislation, the rhetorical onslaught from right-wing politicians and media was notably low energy, perhaps because the Biden plan is incredibly popular. Even as Democrats moved to disburse $1.9 trillion in government aid, their opponents mainly seemed to be talking about Dr. Seuss and Mr. Potato Head.
So we know Sanders loses the primary, and so his campaign ends. What happens to Medicare for all after that?
According to Gallup, in the first week of January 2004 more than half of surveyed Americans were satisfied with the direction of the country. Within a few weeks, however, that number had fallen below 50 percent. It has never recovered. Since the 2008 financial crisis, it has not cracked 40 percent. For well over a decade, a supermajority of Americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. Pew surveys consistently show that a majority of Americans believe that their children will be financially worse off than they are. At the present time, citizens do not believe that America is great.
And who has benefited from those systems in the past, and who might benefit if they were to change along the lines of what Governor Evers is asking for?

Not total income. Total wealth. The top one-tenth of 1 percent, the part I want to hit with a 2-cent wealth tax, 3.2 percent. 3.2 percent. They have wealth managers who are managing these huge funds that are growing at what rate? Six percent a year, 8 percent a year, 10 percent a year?

Whether the Affordable Care Act should be repealed has been one of the highest-profile health policy issues ever since its passage in 2010. Health economists are clear on this: They strongly reject repeal, with 89 percent opposing the idea.
We're going to have that party who lost a bunch of seats on that in 2018 versus a party that we argue with each other about the best way to try to make sure that people get health care coverage, but at least we're trying to move in that direction. And this is a salient, personal, human fact. Your health care, your housing, getting your kids educated, getting your kids taken care of in child care. Every single one of those, I like where we are. I like where I am in this fight because I think it's the right fight to have and I think we must be in this fight. We cannot take a pass on this.
Of course, many Sanders supporters will claim that I'm only saying this because I'm in the pay of billionaires, or something.

But something deeper and more systemic is at work here that has little to do with the Affordable Care Act or John Roberts. The scapegoating of Chief Justice Roberts is the clearest demonstration yet of a profound shift in the political polarity of judicial activism. For decades, conservative politicians railed against the judicial activism of judges who overturned democratically enacted legislation, accusing such judges of seeking to use the power of the courts to impose their own political and social agendas. It was one of the easiest ways to score political points.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a request from Democratic state officials and the House of Representatives to quickly consider whether to hear an appeal of a decision with the potential to wipe out the entire Affordable Care Act. The move means the court will almost certainly not hear the case in its current term, which ends in June.
Unleashing free-market competition meant that many of us could not even get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions. When we were able to get it, premiums went up each year so that after a few years we'd be forced to start shopping for a new plan, usually with ridiculously high deductibles.
Instead, it projects that deficits will grow $7 trillion over the next decade as the United States continues borrowing huge sums of money — a number that could double if the administration turns out to be overestimating economic growth and if the $3 trillion in spending cuts the White House has floated do not materialize in Congress.
Because for me, they all are about a central question and that's: Who's going to get opportunity in this country going forward? Will opportunity be reserved just for those born into privilege? Or will opportunity be something that we say as a country, we're willing to make some hard choices to invest, so that all of our kids get those opportunities?
Furthermore, a fundamental component of rates is the age of enrollees: Older people use more care than younger people, and that is reflected in rates. D.C. Health Link works hard to make sure that we have a good age mix. Our largest enrollment (37 percent) is 26-to-34-year-olds. This helps keep rates down.
Then when you actually had the beer summit, did President Obama say anything helpful, or was that whole thing pro forma? Oh, that's interesting. I was at Martha's Vineyard, and I had been getting instructions from the White House, through Glenn Hutchins. They told me not to wear a bespoke suit. We don't want it to be about class. All of the sudden I was the upper-class black person against the working class. I go, I'm the victim! They go, No, don't wear one of those suits. I go: These are the only suits I have. I'm not going out to Sears and Roebuck and buying a suit. Then they go, Do not fly down in a private plane. Glenn Hutchins owns a private plane. Glenn's a billionaire. He's one of my best friends. The only way we could get to Washington was on Glenn's plane, because there was fog. Anyway, we got to the White House, and we and Sgt. Crowley's family all got to the library at the same time. I walked over to Sgt. Crowley. He had his kids there, and I said to them: Hi, I'm Professor Gates. Hope you come to Harvard one day. Maybe you'll take one of my classes. Then I said to him, Can I have a word with you? He and I went off and did the beer summit ourselves. I said, Look, I don't know about you, man, but I just want this to go away. He goes, This is a nightmare.
What beloved local business have you lost in the pandemic? We'd like to hear about it. After 117 years in business, Harrell's Department Store in Burgaw, N.C., became a casualty of the pandemic. Credit... Jeremy M. Lange for The New York Times The economic upheaval caused by the pandemic is changing communities across the country as hundreds of thousands of businesses close, leading to lost livelihoods and empty storefronts. Many of these businesses were neighborhood pillars, beloved locales that we returned to over and over again. In your neighborhood, maybe it was the bar where you met friends after work, the restaurant where your family celebrated birthdays or the bookstore where you loved to browse. Now they are gone. The New York Times would like to hear from you about a local business that has shut down. Why was it special to you, and what do you miss about it? How is its absence altering the fabric of your community? Tell us about it here. We may contact you with a few follow-up questions. And if you can, please share a photo of the business as well.
I would even say that the American Rescue Plan compares favorably with the signature legislation of F.D.R.'s first 100 days, in that its $1.9 trillion price tag dwarfs the mere tens of billions (in inflation-adjusted dollars) spent by Congress during the earliest period of the New Deal. The challenge is very different — a Great Depression and its attendant unemployment and immiseration versus a health crisis and its economic impact — but the ambition is of similar scope.
I've already made the pitch, and I actually had several unions say that it's a really good approach. I don't remember if the U.A.W. was one of them.
Over the weekend, Lindsey Graham spoke at the annual gathering of the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he once again praised President Trump and boasted about their close relationship.
And put simply, one should expect Republicans to hold the Senate more often — quite a bit more often — because they have this quite substantial, and as far as we can tell, growing advantage in the geography of the country. Now Democrats could get rid of the filibuster and add things like DC and offer statehood to Puerto Rico. But even that wouldn't fully balance the scales. So one thing I've heard from some Democrats — this is not crazy — is that they worry that getting rid of the filibuster will simply mean that Republicans, who will control the Senate more often, will have more power. What do you tell them?
I'm Ezra Klein, and this is The Ezra Klein Show. [MUSIC PLAYING] There's a book I've been thinking about a lot lately. It's by Daniel Ziblatt, who's a Harvard political scientist, and it's called Conservative Parties and the Birth of Democracy. And what he shows in that book is that democracies live or die based on how responsible their conservative parties are. [MUSIC PLAYING] In particular, the question is whether the center right quarantines the anti-democratic far right, in which case democracies tend to live and thrive, or it allies with them, in which case, the far right often takes over and democracies often fall. We are in that kind of moment right now. There is a rising far right that has become explicitly, dangerously anti-democratic. It will not be stopped by the Democratic Party because it does not care what the Democratic Party thinks, and it does not rely on the Democratic Party's voters for its support. It will not be stopped by the mainstream media because it doesn't care what the media says about it. It will either be stopped by more sober members of the Republican Party, it be purged by them, as has happened before, or it will take over the Republican Party. And right now, right now it feels like it is taking over the Republican Party. The most important division between the parties right now is not over deficit reduction or capital gains taxation or the proper role of government in the health care system.
So far, Mr. Trump's secretary for health and human services, Tom Price, has taken every opportunity to gloat about the health law's setbacks, even as he is administering its programs.
For example, the creation of the food stamp program didn't just make the lives of recipients a bit easier. It also had major positive impacts on the long-term health of children from poor families, which made them more productive as adults — more likely to pay taxes, less likely to need further public assistance.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — With approval from the Trump administration fresh in hand, Kentucky is rushing to roll out its first-in-the-nation plan to require many Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer or train for a job — even as critics mount a legal challenge to stop it on the grounds that it violates the basic tenets of the program.
Senator Warren introduced the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act in August 2018, which includes provisions to block government officials from becoming lobbyists, bar federal judges from owning stocks and more, all to be overseen by a new Office of Public Integrity. Much of what's outlined in that bill made its way into Senator Warren's campaign plan to end Washington corruption.
In the case of health care, it was a lot easier to peddle scare stories about Obamacare before it went into effect, insuring tens of millions, than it is to defend taking away coverage people already have.
But that is the specific, right? This is the place where Democrats have fired on Democrats about how we're going to do health care. And I'll make two pitches on that. One is I think the best way we're going to do health care — this is just what I believe — is you do what you can to bring down costs. You got a little success on the table. It's a lot of success. It's hundreds of millions of dollars of success. You've got that on the table. You start to offer people what's possible.

And finally, a recommendation. And it may be a cliche, but greatness is good. [MUSIC PLAYING] This week, President Trump used a racist trope to criticize four women of color in Congress — Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib. Trump told them to, quote, go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came. Then the president doubled down on the sentiment.
Well, look, I'm going to start. I don't want Mitch McConnell, obviously.
And what was Medicare at this moment when President Johnson signs it into law?
Obamacare's subsidies were calculated to ensure that middle-class people didn't have to spend more than a set percentage of their income on insurance. And a timely analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation (based on a slightly earlier draft) shows that, in most parts of the country, low-income people would face a much larger gap between the value of their tax credit and the retail price of insurance than they do now.
Needham and Chapman knew there were risks in allying themselves with King, an inveterate bomb-thrower with a deep yearning for the spotlight. But King was also a tenacious conservative. On June 16, he introduced his discharge petition, and Heritage Action began sending out emails to the foundation's 661,000 members, urging them to pressure representatives on both sides of the aisle to sign it — ominously adding in a news release that those who fail to support this effort are responsible for Obamacare. The petition soon picked up two highly influential signatories: Representative Tom Price of Georgia, an orthopedic surgeon who was chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the House's internal conservative think tank; and Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, a staunch conservative and personal hero of Needham's who refused to vote for Bush's Medicare bill in 2003.
Well, I think, from the very beginning, the conservative movement itself has consisted of both. For example, the struggle around McCarthyism early in the early days of modern conservatism in the 1950s really tells this story in a lot of ways, where there was a populist force that spoke to real concerns. Some of were the same concerns that more traditional conservatives had. Some of them weren't. And the politics that arose out of the populist side of this became ugly politics fairly quickly and had to be kind of contained by the rest of the party. But the balance was where the party really existed so that this struggle between Nixon's side and, at first, the Goldwater side then the Reagan side has always been this fight between grassroots activism, which tended to be populist, and more of a Washington-centered, increasingly over the years, conservative, intellectual coalition. And the kind of arguments that, say, Pat Buchanan made in the 1990s are very similar in tone and substance to the sorts of things that worked best for Donald Trump. I think Trump found that vein and found that he could direct it to his own benefit. And he spoke to a sense in the party that had long been there, a sense that really begins from the premise that the elites in our society are corrupt, that the elites in our society are failures. This is the way Trump often spoke about them. It's the way populists generally speak about them.
And he gets more unpopular when he does things like what he did this week. Right? Like —

The beneficiaries: everyone who gets health insurance through a job, including members of Congress.
The A.C.A. brought the country's uninsured rate down to record lows several years after it was enacted in 2010, but even before the pandemic some 28 million people had no coverage. Still, an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 27 million Americans could have lost job-based health coverage between March and May, and that a vast majority of them — 79 percent — are eligible for new coverage from Medicaid or subsidized private plans.
The Affordable Care Act has survived numerous court battles and repeal efforts, but a new case is threatening the law's future once again. A federal judge in Fort Worth, Tex., will hear arguments Wednesday on whether to grant a preliminary injunction that would suspend the health law until the case is decided. He has also indicated that he might go straight to ruling on the merits of the case.
BS: But I don't really hear the candidates talking about that. Why is that?
In other words, for Gilens, the glass is half empty, for Rhodes, half full.
But on the other hand, we have other diplomatic initiatives and it's really important that we're trying to work with this country, and they're important to us strategically for this reason and we have this ongoing negotiation in that political thing. Drag your heels, drag your heels, drag your heels, until the jobs have disappeared here. And then once you go forward, you've got to go forward through a different kind of court that's much slower.
So I would say the next big thing that happens in this timeline is that we get the Affordable Care Act in 2010.
Margot: Maybe. There is, of course, some sort of utopian health insurance plan that is able to be affordable because it manages care so well and keeps people really healthy without requiring a lot of medical services. But the government Medicare program is not really like that. It gets most of its cost advantages through price controls. Of course, Medicare is changing a lot. The Obama administration has been experimenting with new ways to pay doctors and hospitals, designed to improve quality and squeeze out wasteful care. But, so far, those experiments aren't making a big difference to the bottom line. Realistically, I think the best chance for a public option plan to compete with insurers right away is probably just to pay doctors and hospitals less — and maybe spend less on overhead and profits. That could change over time.

So whenever people are being paid outside the legal system, it undercuts protection for everyone and gives an advantage to the employers who move outside the legal system. You know, look, it's part of the same basic principle. Everybody should follow the same set of rules. And if our labor standards are there's a $15-an-hour minimum wage, then everybody should pay it. If the labor standards are that you don't get to put somebody up working in an elevator shaft who has no training, then every employer should have to follow that. And any time an employer can get the work done by not following the rules, that employer gets an unfair advantage, and that unfair advantage undercuts the strength of everybody who follows the rules, undercuts the economy, undercuts workers.
I think you're overlooking the places where we're not divided. I have three brothers back in Oklahoma. One is a Democrat. Do the math, the other two are not. And yet, all three of my brothers and tens of millions of people around this country get furious over the fact that Amazon reports $11 billion in profits last year and paid zero in taxes. All three of my brothers understand that we have an America that works great for giant drug companies, just not for people trying to fill a prescription. Works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for people who are worried about climate change.

Advocates for Medicaid beneficiaries said they disagreed with the Trump administration's assertion, in approving Kentucky's plan, that work requirements were consistent with the goals of Medicaid because work could improve people's health.
Lauren Kelley: Sure. I wanted to ask about reproductive rights.
That's right. Around the same time that Congress passed Medicare, they also created a program called Medicaid that served the very poor in America. But essentially, there was a huge group of Americans in the middle who were left out of both programs.

But that it's a way in which you see the 60-vote threshold impeding bipartisanship. It seems plausible to me that there are bills out there that could get, let's call it 43 Democrats and nine Republicans, and in theory, pass, because that's a majority. But you can't pass a bill like that under a 60-vote threshold. So one of the very few actual glimmers of opportunity for bipartisanship here, a Republican comes up with a great bill, his own party is not going to let him pass that. And so Manchin and Sinema could work with Mitt Romney on this, but not in a filibuster world.
I'll defend the Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the Trump administration. That I can do all by myself.
'There Is No Plan to Make a Plan'
Obamacare was devised with a mix of new spending and taxes, along with cuts to the federal Medicare program, so that it would save more than it cost. A recent forecast from the Congressional Budget Office estimates that, if left in place, the Affordable Care Act will continue to save federal dollars through at least 2025. (Recent legislation has made some small changes to the law's tax provisions, but analysts at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget ran the numbers again and found very little difference.)
You know on part of this, I think part of the answer is current law enforcement. You correctly describe it, in harassing people, in trespassing. And we need to make sure at federal, state, and local levels that people who are seeking health care of any kind have access to that health care and are not denied that opportunity. I think our laws are there. I think the weakness is our failure to enforce. That's how I see now. If there are gaps in that, I'm certainly open to understanding them better, but that's how I see it.
Trump Claims to Protect Pre-Existing Health Conditions. That's Not What the Government Says.
By late January, Ms. Hurd had begun to believe that the only way for her family to have any access to health care was to drop their insurance and save the $928 a month to spend on care when they need it. Harry's recent illness had rattled her, and Matt wanted to see a chiropractor for back pain that was threatening his ability to work.

Political campaigns are normally a game of budgeting exercises and allocating finite resources, which dictates where ads are aired and when. But if the resources are no longer finite, there can be blanket advertising even where there isn't essentially as big of a return on investment.
Meanwhile, we're racing toward the big Democratic presidential debates. People, are you ready? Some of you may be concerned that you don't know the names of all the candidates. Some of you who do know all the names may be concerned that means you have no life.
BS: Just to tie in with Charlie here, let's just take the prescription problem.
And so when somebody — when I was first thinking about running for president, somebody said to me, Primaries are hard. You've never been in one and they're hard, because the people you think are going to be your friends turn out not to be your friends. And ——
This is the most unethical sham since I've been in politics. And if you really wanted to know the truth, you sure as hell wouldn't have done what you've done to this guy.
But that assumption, which I made before looking at the performance of the companies' shares, couldn't be further from the truth.
Four years ago, at this point in the last presidential election cycle, the jobless rate was 8.3 percent and the economic recovery was in a relatively early stage. Then, worries centered on rising gas prices, deep consumer debt and government layoffs.
I think you're overlooking the places where we're not divided. I have three brothers back in Oklahoma. One is a Democrat. Do the math, the other two are not. And yet, all three of my brothers and tens of millions of people around this country get furious over the fact that Amazon reports $11 billion in profits last year and paid zero in taxes. All three of my brothers understand that we have an America that works great for giant drug companies, just not for people trying to fill a prescription. Works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for people who are worried about climate change.
BA: I appreciate that the toaster is still your preferred consumer appliance.
MC: —— that requires you to pass comprehensive immigration reform.
The House passed the bill, voting almost entirely along party lines, 234 to 179, just hours after the Trump administration announced it had secured 500,000 treatment courses of a newly approved drug to treat Covid-19, remdesivir, but at a price. The drug's maker, Gilead Sciences, will charge at least $2,340 per course, after weeks of donating the drug to hospitals with severely ill patients.
I'm a 31-year-old stage IV cancer survivor. By some measure of luck and picking the right doctor, I'm still here. My total treatment costs were around $3 million. Million. I haven't made $3 million in my entire lifetime, nor have most people.
KK: Simultaneously though, all of the things that you've suggested you would need to do in order to afford Medicare for all, a wealth tax, cutting the defense budget, comprehensive immigration reform, would require the Senate's approval.
The fixation on Mr. Bloomberg, the free-spending multibillionaire, reflected his rising prominence in the Democratic race, even though he is skipping the first four nominating contests and focusing on the 14 Super Tuesday states that will vote on March 3.
While the individual mandate may be dead, the employer mandate — the requirement that many companies offer health insurance to their workers or pay a penalty — is very much alive. Under Mr. Trump, the Internal Revenue Service has been pursuing companies that fail to comply with the mandate and, according to the agency, was sending penalty notices to more than 30,000 businesses around the country.
Today, I got called a [expletive] by this guy. Then I said to myself, hey, didn't this guy call me, like, four years ago? Yes.
New York City-born Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London, would be the ideal vice-presidential pick for Donald Trump. Both are bullies and both are boorish. Neither would have to walk away from the other one's comments. And they could share the same hair dye.
John Broder: We have combat troops in Syria now fighting ISIS.

I am an American expat who has been living in Germany for many years and have intimate knowledge of and experience with its health care system. Jamie Daw's essay is not representative of the realities, pitfalls and serious systemic problems that exist in the German system and do not reflect the fact that most of the population is getting substandard care. Indeed, the German system is just as bad as the American system, just with a different set of failures that need to be addressed.
KK: Yes, I am, undocumented immigrants, excuse me.
To the ends, to the objectives that I want.
Just a few weeks ago, Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress were talking about how Obamacare's insurance markets were floundering, and how insurance companies were fleeing while prices were spiraling out of control.
The longest shutdown in American history ended on Friday, after 34 full days. That easily exceeded the previous record, under President Bill Clinton in 1995, of 21 days.
Under the Republican plan, the premium for a typical low-income 64-year-old, after subsidies, would jump to $14,600 a year, from $1,700 a year, but rise slightly for a 40-year-old with the same income.
Yet he also points out that the ideas can claim some more narrow but still substantial successes, such as Medicare's prescription drug program and the market for laser-eye surgery. The question is whether a market-oriented approach will work when it's expanded to an entire health care system.
KK: But you have to admit, many of the things you're saying are the same pitch Obama gave us in 2008, and Obama, of course, got health care done, but with a lot of compromises and left a law that I think by everyone's estimation is flawed. So what's different in 2020 — excuse me, I don't know what year it is, 2019 — than it was in 2008?
So what I've done for Trump is I don't think inconsistent with what I've done with others. But here's the difference. It's more important, and he's receptive.
For now, the coronavirus pandemic is an epic of sorrow, and has many mortal months still to run. But in the midst of our suffering, our grief for loved ones lost, our loneliness in social isolation, we have a chance to re-engineer our world.
For anyone trying to make sense of the Supreme Court run by Chief Justice John Roberts, yesterday's two big decisions were helpful.
The highest-profile current attempt to redefine climate policy is the Green New Deal. In February, two Democrats — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the House and Ed Markey in the Senate — released a 14-page resolution calling for a huge federal effort to fight climate change.
KK: It's a very bad idea for the children to ——
I wrote a very big Sunday review cover at the beginning of the presidency saying that, Democrats need to go big and they need to go fast and to do that they need to get rid of the filibuster. And then of course. Senators Manchin and Sinema said, Absolutely not. We will never do that under any circumstances. And so there is simply no doubt the Democrats are going to end up disappointing a lot of their base on a lot of issues, particularly around things that you can't do through direct economic measures. So statehood for DC and the offering of statehood to Puerto Rico, democracy reform, gun control, immigration reform, et cetera. But you can through budget reconciliation, get tremendously large economic and health care bills done. I think even plausibly, we'll see, but plausibly a public option certainly lowering the Medicare age. So we're going to have to see what that looks like in a year. Whether or not Democrats think Biden has delivered beyond their expectations for him or under-delivered, really depends on what happens with the Budget Reconciliation bills and how ambitious Democrats are willing to be with them. But I would say he surprised me to the upside, so far.
The only areas still under yellow zone restrictions are the Kew Gardens and Forest Hills areas of Queens, two parts of the Bronx, Washington Heights in Manhattan and Newburgh in Orange County, he added. Elsewhere, general precautions will still limit gyms to 33 percent capacity and residential gatherings to 10 people, among other broader safety measures. We're not going to wait six to nine months to start to reopen the economy, Mr. Cuomo said. We're not waiting because the future is what we make it.
Two months later, Texas and the 19 other states filed suit in the Federal District Court in Fort Worth, asserting that the mandate could no longer be justified as a tax and should therefore be struck down — and arguing that as a result, the rest of the law must be invalidated, too.
But Mr. de León's struggles suggest that this moment of transition remains a work in progress. He would seem to have the right political makeup to lead the party to its next chapter. He is more liberal than Ms. Feinstein at a time when the left is on the rise. He is Latino in a state where the power of Latino voters continues to grow. And he is coming off almost four years as president of the Senate, giving him a platform to present himself as one of the state's most aggressive leaders in opposing Mr. Trump.
But the extent to which Mr. Trump is doing well among white working-class voters is important to Democrats. There are more white working-class voters than is generally believed, and Mr. Obama was stronger among these voters than typically assumed.
MC: I think we can agree that there are huge problems here. But to Katie's point, and then I'm going to throw it to Jesse. You have to be careful to balance the big promises with the over-promising, because then you risk the disillusionment, which I think we saw during the Obama administration. And back to kind of Katie's question about how you pay for a lot of these things. I mean comprehensive immigration for one, you can't do that through budget reconciliation.
He questioned whether Democratic Senate candidates in a red-leaning states would believe it was in their political interest to have a self-proclaimed socialist at the top of the ticket.
But we won't be, because this logic lacks the cultural imagination required to see that Trump's positions won't get a hearing with groups that might find them appealing otherwise, precisely because they're associated with, well, Donald Trump himself.
The tax law overhaul of late 2019 eliminated the home office deduction for employees from 2018 through 2025. Employees who receive a paycheck or a W-2 exclusively from an employer are not eligible for the deduction, even if they are currently working from home, the I.R.S. said. Read more. How does the family leave credit work? Self-employed people can take paid caregiving leave if their child's school is closed or their usual child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak. This works similarly to the smaller sick leave credit — 67 percent of average daily earnings (for either 2020 or 2019), up to $200 a day. But the caregiving leave can be taken for 50 days. Read more. Have rules changed on charitable giving? Yes. This year, you can deduct up to $300 for charitable contributions, even if you use the standard deduction. Previously, only people who itemized could claim these deductions. Donations must be made in cash (for these purposes, this includes check, credit card or debit card), and can't include securities, household items or other property. For 2021, the deduction limit will double to $600 for joint filers. Rules for itemizers became more generous as well. The limit on charitable donations has been suspended, so individuals can contribute up to 100 percent of their adjusted gross income, up from 60 percent. But these donations must be made to public charities in cash; the old rules apply to contributions made to donor-advised funds, for example. Both provisions are available through 2021. Read more.
And so, at the confirmation hearing on his nomination to become attorney general, Mr. Barr said that he would review the Justice Department's position in the Texas lawsuit. Apparently he did just that — but instead of mounting a vigorous defense, he doubled down on killing Obamacare. It's as if Mr. Barr said to his predecessor, Jeff Sessions: You thought your position was crazy? Hold my beer.
I am in this fight because my daddy ended up as a janitor. I got my big chance at a commuter college that cost $50 a semester, because a bunch of taxpayers had invested in that college. That opportunity is not there today. That same college costs $15,000 now. Kids have to load up on debt to go there today. That's not expanding opportunity in this country. We've got a choice to make as a nation and the good news about 2020, the door has opened just a crack, that all the things that have been broken for so long, Donald Trump has made so much worse and gotten so many people off the sidelines, we actually have a chance. Not just to nibble, but to make big change.

# #3 Medicaid work requirements New change States can make some Medicaid recipients prove they are working or looking for work. Previously States could apply for waivers to impose work requirements, but they might not get approved. Who's happy with this change Conservatives, particularly members of the Republican Study Committee, a conservative House group that met with President Trump last week
Does President Obama deserve credit for these gains? No. In general, presidents and their policies matter much less for the economy's performance than most people imagine. Times of crisis are an exception, and the Obama stimulus plan enacted in 2009 made a big positive difference. But that stimulus faded out fast after 2010, and has very little to do with the economy's current situation.
J. HENRY NEALE JR., SCARSDALE, N.Y.
Peter Thiel, an early Facebook investor, called Senator Warren dangerous, to which Senator Warren responded good. Mr. Zuckerberg said a Warren presidency would suck for the company, according to audio leaked and reported in The Verge.
So Mr. Cruz has a truth problem. But what else can we learn from this encounter? That the Affordable Care Act is already doing enormous good. It came too late to save one man's life, but it will surely save many others. Why, then, do we hear not just conservatives but also many progressives trashing President Obama's biggest policy achievement?
Yell out Lindsey Graham's cell phone number, which, to my memory, has never been done before in American politics. Predictably, the crank calls, the threats commenced immediately on Lindsey Graham's cell phone.
Democratic candidates, in contrast, have offered detailed plans, which typically cost trillions of dollars raised via new taxes on corporations and the rich, to expand health care coverage and reduce costs for American patients. Health care remains a top issue for many of Mr. Trump's supporters, while Democrats' Medicare for all plans have fared well in many opinion polls.
KK: But does it drive down wages for American workers?
But that is the specific, right? This is the place where Democrats have fired on Democrats about how we're going to do health care. And I'll make two pitches on that. One is I think the best way we're going to do health care — this is just what I believe — is you do what you can to bring down costs. You got a little success on the table. It's a lot of success. It's hundreds of millions of dollars of success. You've got that on the table. You start to offer people what's possible.
As to how a President Jeb Bush would choose a justice, he said, The lesson learned is you pick someone with a proven, longstanding record, a history that you can point to.
Some plans had waiting periods for care. Cancer treatment, for example, is not covered in certain plans during the first month a person is enrolled in a plan, and no treatment for illness is covered in the first five days. That's the kind of detail that might be easy to overlook when signing up for a plan if you aren't expecting a cancer diagnosis.
Look, I have argued for a long time that we need not to expand our nuclear arsenal, and that is the direction the Trump administration has been taking us.
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — With approval from the Trump administration fresh in hand, Kentucky is rushing to roll out its first-in-the-nation plan to require many Medicaid recipients to work, volunteer or train for a job — even as critics mount a legal challenge to stop it on the grounds that it violates the basic tenets of the program.
There we go. But the point is there are some things about tech that are special. I mean, that we're seeing for the first time. Ways that you can be anti-competitive that we hadn't seen before, just like that was true in the early 1900s about, you know — you had the oil supply, and you also owned all the gas stations and how that one worked. We broke that apart.
Evers would not have the power to regulate guns in the same way that existed for his predecessor. They also limit early voting, which is a kind of tool of access to the ballot box that has sometimes helped Democrats, because more people in bigger areas can get to the polls. These were all really nakedly partisan, and Republicans didn't really even try to hide it.
It's not whether he apologizes or not. It's abhorrent, Mr. Biden said of the policy, adding, Let's get something straight. The reason that stop and frisk changed is because Barack Obama sent moderators to see what was going on.
argues that one of the best ways for the president to pay for ambitious policies and help honest taxpayers is to restore the funding the I.R.S. needs to effectively battle tax cheats. Enrique Krauze writes that Biden, in working with his Mexican counterpart President López Obrador, can promote a moderate approach that might be of great benefit to the U.S.-Mexico relationship and to Mexicans.
No, but I think this is important.
The United States doesn't have a meaningful cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions, he pointed out. The private insurance markets in Obamacare have been undermined by President Trump and other Republicans. The Earned Income Tax Credit isn't nearly as large as it could be.
For many Americans, the Affordable part of the Affordable Care Act has seemed like an empty promise, as premiums, deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs continue to be an extraordinary burden on millions of households.
This interview was conducted by the editorial board of The New York Times, which will announce its Democratic primary endorsement on Jan. 19.
To say the least. And then even when Donald Trump was elected, even when he became president, Lindsey Graham and John McCain were still none too happy with the fact that Donald Trump was president. They kind of held their powder for a while. They weren't terribly vocal. But there were certain occasions where Lindsey Graham was actually quite vocal and really wasn't trying to hide his feelings at all. After the Charlottesville demonstration and ultimately murder —
No, It's fine. So I actually start with the big vision. You know, if you gave me a chance, I'd do a constitutional amendment to protect the right of every American citizen to vote and to make sure that vote gets counted so you put real federal muscle behind it. I also talk about that for a specific reason, because a lot of Americans are shocked to know that that's not already in the Constitution and that there is no federal muscle behind that.
And was always, again, very derivative of the energy that John McCain brought to everything that John McCain did. So, 2015.
In particular, Warren's latest proposal on child care – and the instant pushback from the usual suspects – has me thinking that we could use a rough typology of spending proposals, classified by how they might be paid for. Specifically, let me suggest that there are three broad categories of progressive expenditure: investment, benefits enhancement, and major system overhaul, which need to be thought about differently from a fiscal point of view.
The Justice Department's move gave the unveiling an urgency that not even she could have anticipated.
Senator Warren's anti-corruption plan includes provisions to extend conflict-of-interest laws to the president and vice president, compel government to divest from privately owned assets and restrict the ability of lobbyists to be hired for government jobs. It takes aim in particular at many of the practices that the Trump family has used to profit from office, which The Times has editorialized against.
The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips. And here's our email: letters@nytimes.com.
You know, this is a hard hypothetical to take on until you actually know what's happening. Again, you've got to back this one up on where we should have started. When the unrest first started unfolding in Hong Kong, for Donald Trump to step back and say in effect, gee, I think China's going to crack down on Hong Kong, and effectively inviting it, I think is the wrong place for the United States to be. I think that we should have been in a position from the beginning, saying to China, we support these efforts in Hong Kong. That's part one.
This sort of mandate is not the most efficient way to reduce carbon emissions, as economists like to point out. It requires regulators to choose reasonable benchmarks for different companies — or to set a uniform one that all must meet. Carbon pricing, if aggressive enough, encourages bigger reductions from companies that can cut their emissions more cheaply.
So the way I see this is all I can do is get out and tell you what I'll fight for, and I'll point out the difference between the two. I try not to get over my skis. No, I do. I've really tried hard not to be personally critical of other candidates. I got a little heated once, but once, and because I think this is the fundamental question. Do you think that this democracy, do you think that this economy, do you think this government is going to make it if all we're offering are little nibbles around the edges?
The public option was once considered too far-reaching — champions of the idea in Congress could not muster quite enough support to include it in the Affordable Care Act in 2010. But it is now seen as a more moderate alternative to Mr. Sanders's plan, which would all but eliminate private health insurance and enroll everyone in a government-run program.
Well, I thought you were going to recommend Lane Kenworthy's book, actually.
The main trade association for health insurers came out strongly against the administration's position.
In the more prominent one, Roberts joined the court's four liberal justices to strike down a restrictive Louisiana abortion law. It was the third major decision this month in which Roberts sided with the liberals, having already done so on L.G.B.T.Q. rights and immigration.
And if you think about what the F.D.R. administration was trying to do, they were trying to build a sort of basic public social safety net for people, to protect them and prevent them from falling through the cracks.
Look what Frances Perkins got accomplished, first in Albany, but then when she went down to Washington. So here's a woman, she goes to Albany at a time when women don't even have the vote and gets herself appointed the head of a fire commission. And by the way, every time you see one of those lit-up fire exit signs, thank Frances Perkins, O.K.? But she not only does that, she then immediately expands it into labor law and workers and worker safety and worker protection overall. As you know, she then goes down to Washington, becomes the first woman cabinet official, and look at what she gets done in a short period of time. Social security, minimum wage, right to join a union, end of child labor, the weekend, my personal favorite [LAUGHTER], that Saturdays and Sundays are not treated like Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. But think about it that way. So we start with the corruption. That's what Perkins started with. She started by outing the corruption.
Ross, I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that you're not a big fan of getting rid of the pronouns he and she.
And as I wrote last week, the economic good news of recent years — not as good as Trump claims, but the economy has indeed been strong — largely reflects the reality that after hobbling the economy with fiscal austerity under Barack Obama, Republicans have embraced runaway deficit spending under Trump.
We are at another watershed moment that could result in national suicide and the end to everything we Americans hold dear. As the damage and outrages pile up, it's important to remember that Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski are enabling them with their affiliation, even when they dissent. They could halt the whole charade, and alter the course of history, with a press release.
Nixon designed his campaign, one of his advisers explained, to allow a potential supporter to avoid admitting to himself that he was attracted by the racist appeal.

I think it's mystifying to a lot of people. It's certainly mystifying to me.
I'm not going to do this. I'm just not. I'm not here to take on Joe Biden and what Joe Biden has done. I'm glad to talk to you about why I'm running for president, but not to attack him.
Since scolding member nations at the 2017 summit, Mr. Trump has followed up with strongly worded letters to NATO nations advising that if they don't increase their payments, it will be increasingly hard to justify why American soldiers continue to sacrifice their lives overseas.
Republican senators have been able to dodge that question for months while the matter was in the House, but not any longer. And you can already see how uncomfortable it makes them by the way Senator Martha McSally literally ran away from and denounced a CNN reporter when he asked her if the Senate should consider new evidence as part of the impeachment trial. There is a reason McSally fled.
There may be other strange rules. A review of some plan documents from Families USA found an Illinois plan that would cover only hospitalizations beginning during the week — inpatient stays that began on the weekend would not be allowed except in rare circumstances.
This interview has been edited and condensed from two conversations.
Such a decision could end health insurance for some 21 million Americans and affect many millions more who benefit from the law's protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions and required coverage for pregnancy, prescription drugs and mental health.
WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Thursday struck down a Trump administration rule that allows small businesses to band together and set up health insurance plans that skirt requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
So, what is it that Rubio and Lee mean, in your view, when they say that the way to be pro-family is to be pro-paid-work, when what they are saying is that in the case of a single mother with three kids who believes there is a reason that it is better for her to stay home with her kids at this point in their development, they are saying, no, we here in Washington know better than you do what would be good for your family and that's to go to paid work. Like they're the heroes of their own story. You're in this movement more than I am. What is the case for why Rubio and Lee know better than that mother what's good for her family?
The health care bill unveiled Thursday by Senate Republicans has been out in the open for less than a week, and there are many obstacles to clear before it can become law: an uncertain Senate vote, a return to the House for final approval, a presidential signature.
End Citizens United, a group with more than four million members and half a million donors around the country, has voiced support for Senator Warren's proposed anti-corruption plans. The group has noted that both President Obama and President Trump won election in part by portraying themselves as tougher on opponents. Read more in The Times.
The state would mail 3.3 million eligible voters a ballot, whether they requested it or not. And that represents a real change in how kind of the electoral process would work throughout the state.
No, it's not fine. I really want to say that this is really — I am upset about this, and I want everybody else to be upset about it. And I need to come up with a new name for budget reconciliation, so people don't tune me out when I talk about it. But let me give an example from the bill that I want to talk about. So Biden's big rescue package is going through budget reconciliation. It's going through budget reconciliation because it cannot get 10 Republican votes in the Senate. And so you are already seeing things get carved out of it that are important. So you can pass a big expansion of the Child Tax Credit in reconciliation. You can do $1,400 checks in reconciliation. But something that is obviously important and very cheap for the government and an efficient thing we could do would be emergency paid leave, making sure that people, when they are sick, can stay home without it being a terrible economic hardship on their family. And that could get taken out of the bill because it doesn't fit reconciliation. It looks like the same thing will happen probably to the $15 minimum wage. And obviously, Senator Bernie Sanders is trying to keep that from happening. But I would be surprised if he is successful in that. You worked in the Senate. You worked for Harry Reid. You were his deputy chief of staff. Did it feel crazy to do things this way?
In October 2019, Senator Warren tweeted: Facebook has incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. Mark Zuckerberg is telling employees that he views a Warren administration as an 'existential' threat to Facebook. The public deserves to know how Facebook intends to use their influence in this election.
The numbers indicate that even in areas hit hard by the virus, the overwhelming majority of people have not yet been infected, Dr. Hensley said.

KK: We have some foreign policy questions for you.
This is our chance to turn that one around.
To decode this very un-P.C. put-down, you first need to know that the song has only a nominal connection to pasta. The macaronis were members of a subculture of British fops in the 1760s and 1770s, who took their name from the Italian ingredient that would have seemed exotic and sophisticated in England at the time. The trend started with aristocrats, but caught on with middle- and working-class lads as well.
No, it's fine. It's just that look out there. People's financial circumstances have gotten worse. The amount of student loan debt has been going up at a rate of $100 billion a year. Oh, here's one. Just saw some data not long ago out of the Department of Education. Go take a look 20 years out on people who borrowed student loan debt. Ninety-four percent of whites have paid off their student loan debt. Want to guess what the percentage is for African-Americans is?
So why would President Trump, the leader of the Republican Party, who had to have watched that same midterm that you're describing, why would he do this if the takeaway of that midterm is that the Affordable Care Act is no longer toxic and might even be liked by a wide cross-section of Americans?
Such a decision could end health insurance for some 21 million Americans and affect many millions more who benefit from the law's protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions and required coverage for pregnancy, prescription drugs and mental health.
Republicans say this is a way to free people from the straitjacket of federal regulations. Under Obamacare, people have been forced to buy insurance plans they don't want and can't afford, said Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming.
March 3, 2020, 11:17 p.m. ET March 3, 2020, 11:17 p.m. ET Biden pulls off a big upset in Massachusetts. Joseph R. Biden Jr. pulled out a stunning victory in Massachusetts, an outcome that did not even seem within the realm of possibility this morning, when it seemed clear that it was a two-way race there between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. With 91 delegates to award, Massachusetts was not the biggest prize tonight, but for Mr. Biden, it may have been the biggest upset: one of the most liberal states in the country, the home of one of his opponents and next door to the home of another. For Mr. Sanders, it was a big disappointment: Mr. Biden was expected to do well in the South, but New England was supposed to be the progressive wing's territory. But it was nothing short of devastating for Ms. Warren, who had been counting on a win in Massachusetts, at the very least, to show that her candidacy was still viable. While she is above the 15 percent viability threshold to earn some delegates, she is in serious danger of finishing third. Read more
Senator Warren has argued that the sheer size of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon pose a real threat to innovation and competition in the technology industry. Mr. Yang has argued that her diagnosis is 100 percent correct but that her solution isn't fully effective because competition doesn't solve all of the problems.
I've already made the pitch, and I actually had several unions say that it's a really good approach. I don't remember if the U.A.W. was one of them.
This argument was always specious, but it looks especially absurd in light of the coronavirus tearing through the world. America's inadequate health care system, far from increasing liberty, is poised to make death panels more likely.
Mr. Biden was also pushed to defend some of his own record, including his support for the 1994 crime bill. He repeated a claim he has made before — that the crime bill did not put more people in jail like it's argued. Many experts have linked the measure to an acceleration in mass incarceration.
In the months to come, I hope that every other 2020 candidate offers answers to the questions that Warren has taken on: How can corporate America again help create a prosperous, growing middle class, as it did from the 1940s through the 1970s? How can the power of giant corporations — over consumers, workers and smaller businesses — be constrained? How can the radical levels of wealth inequality be reversed? How can the yawning opportunity gaps for children of different backgrounds be reduced? How can the next president make changes that will endure, rather than be undone by a future president, as both Obama's and Clinton's top-end tax increases were?
Exactly. A 2-cent wealth tax just means if you don't lift a finger, your fortune only grows at 4 percent, 6 percent, 8 percent. And yet how many people in this country who are so sophisticated and knowledgeable — right — say you could never get a wealth tax because the billionaires and millionaires won't let it happen? Well, what the hell? This is a democracy.
Because they are using a special budget process, Republicans won't be able to repeal all provisions of the health law. But it seems like a good time to look at the major changes Obamacare brought to health care, which of those changes may now disappear, and what might replace them.
I'm not sure what I'd say. I think, in some ways, Bob Putnam's book The Upswing, which was just published last year, offers a picture of early progressivism that was eye-opening, in some respects that was a little fuller than what I had focused on before, and that I think is worth reading for anybody on the right or the left. I think that's probably the latest book I've read that's really changed my mind about something. It changed my mind about the nature of the case that the early progressives were making and changed for the better, in some ways.
From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today: Two years ago, he called Donald Trump a kook, a bigot, crazy and unfit for office. Now he lavishes praise on the president at every turn. What happened to Lindsey Graham? It's Tuesday, March 5.
On the domestic side it, something I have often thought about the post-Civil-Rights-Act Republican Party is that it was a party that harnessed a lot of the energy in the politics of white resentment or white frustration with a changing society and a federal government that was, in many cases, helping those changes along. And it harnessed that energy for, strangely, tax cuts for rich people, corporate deregulation, that there was a way in which the party was very much one thing in the base and then a very much another at the elite level. And you could always see this in polling. I mean, Paul Ryan was Speaker of the House, and you would see this polling that base Republicans wanted to raise taxes on rich people. They wanted a higher minimum wage. They wanted more spending on programs for the poor. How much of what we're seeing is that different structural changes in the parties, in the media ecosphere have allowed those things to be decoupled and so forces that, at one point, the party elite or structures were able to hold in check have just begun to predominate? They're able to get their candidates in through primaries. They're able to get their message out through social media. And so what we're seeing now is what always was there, and it's that thin layer that was restraining it or rechanneling it is what has changed?
And you had an African-American president who was seen as an outsider by a lot of older white Americans. And into that mix stepped Trump with this mix of superficial economic populism, and birtherism, and bigotry. Was it inevitable that Trump was going to be the Republican nominee? I don't think, in hindsight, it actually was. Is it inevitable that the party has to be Trumpified permanently? I don't think it is. I mean, I think the failure of Republican politicians right now is their failure to say, what can we offer to our voters instead of America, love it or leave it? That as much as the failure to condemn Trump more forcefully is the problem for the Republican Party going forward. It has to figure out what it makes of the Trumpist turn.
And so it also does something weird, right, which is mechanisms. You might have two ways you could do the same thing. So you could potentially raise people's incomes by passing a direct wage subsidy, like the Earned Income Tax Credit the government pays out to them, or you could do it by raising the minimum wage.
The Kaiser Family Foundation's Health Care Tracking Poll has found a decline in public support for Medicare for all since the start of the year. Now roughly 51 percent of American adults are in favor of a single-payer system and 47 percent are opposed, whereas earlier this year 57 percent backed it and 37 percent were opposed.
A 2018 Gallup poll found that a record-high 75 percent of Americans say immigration is a positive, including majorities of all parties. Yet immigration reform has become a wedge issue in Congress, with the government brought to a shutdown multiple times over issues like the treatment of Dreamers and the funding for Mr. Trump's border wall.
The question for progressives — a question that is now central to the Democratic primary — is whether these failings mean that they should re-litigate their own biggest political success in almost half a century, and try for something better.
But in the Senate, Republicans would need support from some Democrats if they are to replace the Affordable Care Act.
WASHINGTON — The most powerful and ambitious Republican-led Congress in 20 years will convene Tuesday, with plans to leave its mark on virtually every facet of American life — refashioning the country's social safety net, wiping out scores of labor and environmental regulations and unraveling some of the most significant policy prescriptions put forward by the Obama administration.
Right. Which to be clear, you do have at least one senator saying just that and some congressmen saying just that.
MC: And there is a good question. How do you do that if Mitch McConnell still holds that Senate?
The White House said President Trump was scrapping health insurance subsidies, and he signed a separate order allowing the sale of cheaper polices with fewer benefits.
Democrats enjoy a strong edge with voters on health care, with 40 percent trusting them on the issue, compared with 23 percent who trust Republicans more, according to an April poll by The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
And why is that, Margot? Why is this idea during this period of nationalized medicine, government-run health care — why is it being limited to such small groups of Americans?
Maybe. I mean, it could be that this is the only way that we're going to get the kind of cultural change that would be required to make a policy change of this magnitude, but I also think that there are real risks here. It's totally possible that America could engage with this idea, and we could have a big debate about it in a presidential election, and then could thoroughly reject it. And then we sort of end up with the kind of politics around health care that we've had for a long time, where these sort of universal health care proposals are put forward, it's decided that they're kind of too radical for where we are, and they get shelved again.
I cite Poland because so many Poles (including the Krzysztofowicz family, later renamed Kristof) came to America for a better life, yet today American babies are one-third more likely to die in their first year of life than Polish children are (and twice as likely as Italian, Portuguese and Czech babies!). Meanwhile, American women are four times as likely to die in pregnancy and childbirth as Polish women, according to the World Health Organization.
State and federal lawmakers are exploring ways to increase coverage and lower costs. For example, the Nevada Legislature passed a bill in June that would have allowed people who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid to buy into that program. The bill, which would have required a federal waiver, did not become law because Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican, vetoed it. But the idea has other backers. Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii said on Tuesday that he would introduce a bill that would explicitly allow states to let people buy into Medicaid.
In all three, NextGen and its allies worked to put an initiative on the ballot that would require local utilities to use much more renewable energy, like solar and wind. The proposed increases were big: Every state would need to more than double the share of its renewable energy by 2030. This kind of requirement is known as a performance standard, and it has a long history of success in many fields, reducing house fires, medical errors, deaths in car accidents and the use of lead paint and asbestos.
Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, has described the goal this way: to become a country where the spread of H.I.V. has been effectively halted, because every American with H.I.V./AIDS is receiving treatment and every American at risk for H.I.V. is engaged in the right, proven prevention strategy.
As far as you can tell, how much is Biden's appeal to black voters solely about his association with Obama? Biden, wisely, has wrapped his arms so tightly around Barack Obama that they're inextricably intertwined, at least in his speeches. He's polling so positively among black people because of the Obama residue. But that could change overnight. I haven't endorsed any candidate, because I have too many friends. Elizabeth Warren was my colleague. I did Bernie Sanders's family tree. In 2018, I got an award in Delaware, along with Joe Biden and Ron Chernow. I spent a whole evening with Biden, and I liked him. All of this is to say that I have been sort of watching the field. But, I mean, I'm going to vote for whatever Democrat emerges. I want to say this right, because I haven't said this to anybody: Among all the candidates, the person who I believe could stand toe-to-toe, strongest and longest with Donald Trump is Mike Bloomberg.
The new options will help people struggling to afford coverage under the 2010 law, said Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services. These plans aren't for everyone, he said, but they can provide a much more affordable option for millions of the forgotten men and women left out by the current system.
The tension between incremental and transformative change has been a feature of the 2020 campaign. Mr. Obama, for instance, weighed in to say that the typical American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system, an implicit critique of Senator Warren's and Senator Sanders's campaigns.
And I think some of those people are bringing new energy to the single-payer moment.
LK: And a growing concern during the Trump era about violence. And I'm just wondering how you would address that, if that is in fact something that's not going to go away once the Trump era ends, which I think is a safe assumption.
Consistent with whatever is revealed. You can't do speed independently of facts, right? But if that's what we've got and it's enough information for a charge of impeachment, then I think they can go forward and I think they should.
But as he signed the orders in the Oval Office, Biden acknowledged that they did not represent the sorts of bold steps forward that he had taken on climate the day before. The best way to describe them: to undo the damage Trump has done, he said. There's nothing new that we're doing here, other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring the Medicaid to the way it was.
The supposed reason was that he wanted to bring back U.S. manufacturing. If that were really his motivation, he failed: Amid a generally strong economy, we're experiencing a manufacturing recession, and estimates from the Federal Reserve suggest that Trump's tariffs, which have raised business costs, have actually reduced manufacturing employment.
So whenever people are being paid outside the legal system, it undercuts protection for everyone and gives an advantage to the employers who move outside the legal system. You know, look, it's part of the same basic principle. Everybody should follow the same set of rules. And if our labor standards are there's a $15-an-hour minimum wage, then everybody should pay it. If the labor standards are that you don't get to put somebody up working in an elevator shaft who has no training, then every employer should have to follow that. And any time an employer can get the work done by not following the rules, that employer gets an unfair advantage, and that unfair advantage undercuts the strength of everybody who follows the rules, undercuts the economy, undercuts workers.
But that's my point. It doesn't. That's what I just said.
Their candidates were presented as the patriarchs, protecting the house from invaders with dark skin.
Well, I would add he also got a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Earlier, he set the tone for the pro-Obama messaging in his AFSCME appearance Saturday morning.
After the endorsement interview, Senator Warren reached out to Mr. Warzel to clarify her response on 20th century antitrust. In that follow-up interview, she said: Antitrust law is a very valuable tool and breaking them up would have important effects but what I realized after I left in the room is that I was pulled in a different direction but I never finished to say that antitrust law is important but not the only tool we need. I don't believe that markets alone are going to fix all the problems we're facing on the tech side. Particularly the issues around privacy and the values that come from aggregation on platforms and how that value would be distributed. I don't believe only antitrust works but I do believe its a powerful tool we should be using in dealing with Big Tech.
Right. So I've identified pay-fors, and I lay out that if you want, you can get into it, and you've got a three-year period to be able to do it at a deeply subsidized price or at no price at all.
# #4 Medicaid block grants New change States have an option to receive lump-sum Medicaid payments. Previously States received a flat per-beneficiary payment for Medicaid patients. Who's happy with this change Conservatives, particularly members of the Republican Study Committee
Members of Mr. McConnell's leadership team were incensed at Mr. Mulvaney and allies like the acting White House budget director, Russell Vought, for rekindling a fight that served Democrats so well in 2018 and could harm vulnerable incumbents in 2020, according to two senior aides with direct knowledge of the situation. The maneuver may make it much less likely that Mr. Vought, the chief of staff's handpicked successor to head the Office of Management and Budget, will be confirmed by the Senate, the aides said.
No, but I think this is important.
People noticed, and debated its use. That is because, from the childhood schoolyard to the grave, this is a word neither used nor taken lightly. It stands apart from most other terms in the linguistic ballpark of untruths, including falsehood, which Chuck Todd, the host of Meet the Press, recently used to counter the Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway's Orwellian phrase, alternative facts.
The nation responded to the turmoil both from the bottom up and the top down.
Well, I'm not sure about that. I mean, so, obviously, I don't think that the racist tweets have majority support in this country. But we don't have majority rule in this country. And so does it fire up enough of the Trump supporters who came out for him in 2016, stayed home in 2018, enough of those to make a difference in the few unrepresentative states that end up deciding all of our fates in our system of minority rule? I hope not, but maybe.
Why? Who do you think his constituency is? I know Mike Bloomberg socially. Every summer I go to a dinner on Martha's Vineyard with Mike Bloomberg. I've argued with him about policies that I didn't like. He is enormously intelligent and capable. When he was mayor, I watched him. He could wear it lightly. It's not like Jimmy Carter with the weight of the world on him. I think that he's tough, and I think he could take on the bully Donald Trump. Very few people can stand up to a bully. Mike's got some bully in him. I think he's good.
I said there were going to be two parts to this. So I've done part one about the inside/outside theory of change, but the second part, that's why we've got to do this through grass roots movement. We cannot do this through television commercials. If winning the presidency, and I'll speak only to the Democratic side, is about who comes in, and oh, let's see, drops $37 million in one week on TV ads, and that's what it takes to win a Democratic primary, then we have a democracy that's just our TV ads versus their TV ads, and at that point, they're fake news. They claim ours is fake news, right? Everybody just gets farther and farther and farther into their corners.
Thank God for New Yorkers that we have his tenacity, his toughness, his competence and his experience because he knows how to push back, said Maggie Moran, Mr. Cuomo's campaign manager.
In the Age of Trump, the bar for adding something new to this genre is high. Steven Brill, a writer, lawyer and entrepreneur who founded The American Lawyer and Court TV, offers his take in Tailspin. The book was born when Brill was stuck in traffic in a taxi one night on the Van Wyck Expressway coming home from Kennedy Airport. Fortunately, Tailspin is better than its grumpy origin story. Brill describes a slow-motion process of perverse meritocracy in which, as one law professor tells him, the elites have become so skilled and so hardworking that they are able to protect each other better than ever before. Or, as Brill labels it, Moat Nation.

Yes. And I think I am less worried than some about, yes, you know, elevating the profile of these four women is just what Trump wanted, in part because the symbol of the Democratic Party in 2020 is going to be the Democratic nominee, who's not going to be one of these four women. But there are also a lot of people in this country for who they are an inspiration. You know, there's a lot of new voters. There's a lot of young voters. Those are the people I think, in many cases, who are going to be knocking on doors and giving a campaign its kind of cultural vitality. And so not only do you need these four women, you also need the perception that the party supports them. It doesn't mean that the party supports everything that they do, but you certainly don't need a House speaker who's out there elevating her fights with these four women in public and kind of seeking to publicly denigrate and marginalize them.
House passage of the Obamacare repeal bill left that chamber's Republicans in a no-win situation. They took the hard vote, but because the Senate failed to follow suit, no one can claim a victory. Now Democrats hope to extract a price. Far from the liability that the Affordable Care Act has been in past elections, Democrats believe health care will be a key advantage heading into this fall's midterm elections.
Senator Warren visited Beijing in 2018, as Mr. Trump was waging a tariff war on China. She criticized his chaotic foreign policy, while arguing that America cannot support an economic system more integrated with China's while it fails to respect basic human rights.

A white liberal progressive — as this reviewer would be labeled — confronts the issue of race in America with beliefs that make it difficult to face a reality that their fellow citizens of black or Hispanic origin take for granted. Basic to the liberal creed, for example, is the idea, as Barack Obama liked to say, echoing Martin Luther King Jr., that the arc of history bends toward justice. For many Americans, the arc never bends in any direction, least of all toward justice. Likewise, liberals believe that we can empathize, truly understand the racial pain of Americans of color and the racial resentments of an abandoned white working class that thinks their salvation lies with Donald Trump. If any moral quality has been strained to the breaking point in the polarization of our era, it is empathy, ours included.

In a rare bit of good news, the French drug maker Sanofi said on Wednesday that it would help produce more than 100 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, starting this summer — but those doses will most likely come too late to salvage vaccination plans for the first half of 2021. When the European Union approved its first vaccine in December, it was already weeks behind nations like the United States and Britain. While it is flush with cash, influence and negotiating heft, the bloc of 27 nations has also found itself lagging countries such as Israel, Canada and the United Arab Emirates. Last week, the European Union's executive branch, the European Commission, set a goal of having 70 percent of its population inoculated by this summer. Just days later, the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, pronounced that difficult. As of this week, a mere 2 percent of E.U. citizens had received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to numbers collected by the research site Our World in Data. That compares with around 40 percent for Israel, 11 percent for Britain and just over 6 percent for the United States. Many countries, particularly poorer ones, are struggling to secure any vaccines at all. But the delays in Europe have created tensions. Some critics have blamed the European Commission, which struck deals on behalf of the member states to secure a total of 2.3 billion vaccine doses from several companies.

In a rural district like that, retail campaigning in a packed presidential primary schedule can be difficult, and the airwaves become even more important. So Mr. Bloomberg has put roughly $900,000 on air in Duluth, compared with just $17,000 by Ms. Klobuchar and $19,000 by Mr. Sanders.
You know, this is a hard hypothetical to take on until you actually know what's happening. Again, you've got to back this one up on where we should have started. When the unrest first started unfolding in Hong Kong, for Donald Trump to step back and say in effect, gee, I think China's going to crack down on Hong Kong, and effectively inviting it, I think is the wrong place for the United States to be. I think that we should have been in a position from the beginning, saying to China, we support these efforts in Hong Kong. That's part one.

Mr. Zuckerberg said this is about free speech and not the profit motive.
The conservatives' touchiness about the chief justice's reliability is easy enough to understand. It stems from his unexpected vote in 2012 to uphold the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. The Washington Post columnist George Will, who had excellent access to the Supreme Court while his friend Antonin Scalia was alive, provided an early indication of trouble ahead in a column he published a month before the court issued the Obamacare decision. Mr. Will's target in the column, headlined Liberals Put the Squeeze to Justice Roberts, wasn't the media but rather Democratic politicians who were warning about damage that would befall the court if a five-member majority made up of Republican-appointed justices struck down President Barack Obama's prime legislative accomplishment. In die-hard conservative circles, Chief Justice Roberts is still regarded as a traitor, even though it is surpassingly difficult to think of other examples of apostasy aside from his votes in the two Obamacare decisions.

Supporters of the bill, under which health care would be available to all Americans without premiums, co-payments, deductibles or similar charges, did not say how much it would cost or how they would pay for it. They said their proposal could save huge sums by cutting administrative costs and the bill-paying bureaucracy that works for insurance companies and health care providers. And Ms. Jayapal mentioned the possibility of levying a wealth tax on the wealthiest Americans.
WASHINGTON — The Trump administration said on Tuesday that 11.8 million people had signed up for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplaces for 2018 — roughly 400,000 fewer than last year. The drop was relatively small, given that Mr. Trump had sharply cut federal outreach efforts and the open enrollment period was half as long as in past years.
Well, there are elements to that bill that I would support, and there are elements that I would not. There's a lot of things dumped in there, some of which are just ways of helping Democrats, but others are, I think, ways of broadening the electorate. I would support much more experimentation with things like rank-choice voting. I think the House should allow multi-member districts, which could be done just by a small change in federal law, ways of allowing the diversity of the country to be reflected a little more, especially in the House of Representatives. I think there is room for experimentation within the boundaries of the constitutional system that reaches much further than we've allowed for, and in general, that we should think of this moment as a time to try some institutional reforms, to expand the House some, which is way overdue and could help in a lot of ways, including by rebalancing the electoral college and other things, to try some reforms to the budget process in Congress that could help break some logjams, and to try some electoral reforms. The coming decade ought to be a decade when we try a lot of these kinds of ideas out and get ourselves into a mode where we think about changing rules to improve things. I just don't happen to think that the protections against majoritarianism are the right rules to play with.
Such groups are often chartered under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax law, which grants a tax exemption to social welfare organizations.

I think it tells you that a lot of G.O.P. elected officials still have this sense that the bigoted strain in Trumpism can just sort of go away when Trump does.

JI: So you have, on one hand, the boldest public option that's probably been offered by any of the Democratic candidates. On the other hand, you have the most aggressive Medicare for all universal plan that's been offered. You'll be, if I understand it correctly, starting with this aggressive public option hoping to segue to a Medicare for all by year three, and in the middle of all that, you will probably be called upon to defend the Affordable Care Act at the Supreme Court level. How do you think about those three — and of distinct — that just seems like an awful lot of health care reform.

PhRMA's $6.1 million, unrestricted donation to AAN was its single-biggest grant in 2016, dwarfing its $130,000 contribution to the same group the year before. Closely associated with House Republicans — AAN has a former Republican senator and two former Republican House members on its board — the group backed the failed G.O.P. health bill intended to replace the Affordable Care Act. It also supported the successful Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which reduced corporate taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars over a decade.

The health care taxes were all created as part of the Affordable Care Act, where they were designed to offset the cost of expanding insurance coverage to low- and middle-income Americans.

Pensemos en otra política de suma importancia: la atención médica. ¿Cómo se conformó Trumpcare? ¿Acaso la administración y sus aliados consultaron a expertos, estudiaron las experiencias anteriores con las reformas de salud y trataron de vislumbrar un plan congruente?

De hecho, los líderes parlamentarios insistieron en la aprobación del proyecto de ley antes de que la Oficina Presupuestaria del Congreso de Estados Unidos (CBO) —o cualquier otra entidad— pudiera evaluar su posible impacto.
I will also fight to knock back the influence of money, because I think every time we do that, that's what that anti-corruption bill is about. It's about calling out the big drug companies. It's about calling out the big insurance companies and just disrupting the fabulous patterns they have right now to get their way in Washington. In the first 100 days, I'll go to Congress and try to get what we can get on 50 votes. What we can get on 50 votes is to offer Medicare to everybody who's 50 or older.
Recently I've been looking for examples of national comebacks — nations that were plagued by turmoil, inequality and polarization, but that managed to get their act together and emerge stronger than before.

That's largely because fewer employers would offer coverage with the repeal of the employer mandate, which required large employers to offer affordable health insurance.
Republican congressional leaders are trying to put together a plan that could pass muster with the Trump team and also win approval in the Senate under fast-track procedures that would neutralize the threat of a Democratic filibuster.
Mr. Trump's criticism of Mr. Obama for his handling of the Russian hacking, both in his recent tweets and in a TV interview over the weekend, seemed to be a tacit admission, for the first time, that Russia did attempt to undermine Hillary Clinton through hacking and the dissemination of fake news on social media.
Senator Warren has laid out an ambitious timeline that would put children and families under Medicare for all in her first 100 days through a congressional maneuver, then fully roll out her system by her third year in office.
Mr. Trump seems oblivious to these trends. His sparse health care proposal is built around a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, without any regard for the millions of people who would be hurt by that change. Twenty million Americans have gained health care coverage in the six years since the law was passed, bringing the uninsured rate to a record low. The law has problems — for example, there are too few insurers offering coverage on the health exchanges in rural and suburban areas — that the next president and Congress will need to fix. But it is generally working effectively and has cost the government less than expected, according to the Congressional Budget Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.
The problem is that while the A.C.A. uses government funds to cap the percentage of income that each person must spend to pay for a robust health care plan, the Republican approach would almost certainly provide millions of individuals and families with less than the cost of quality insurance.
WASHINGTON — The House on Thursday passed a suite of health care bills that tied shoring up the Affordable Care Act to lowering drug prices, as Democrats tried to hold Republicans to their campaign promises to secure coverage for pre-existing medical conditions and rein in the cost of prescription medicine.
I went to Washington. I came here to New York to talk to people about the idea for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and I heard two things over and over and over. Part one, that's a great idea. It would actually make a real difference. That would be structural change, or as I now say, big structural change, in financial services. And part two, don't even try, because you'll be up against the big banks. You'll be up against Wall Street. You'll be up against all of the Republicans. You'll be up against half the Democrats. You'll never get it done. But we did get it done.
The American Rescue Plan is only a start. Because the administration was limited by the budget reconciliation process, many of its provisions need to be made permanent. Which is to say that there is still a lot of work left for the Biden administration and the Democratic majorities that exist, for now, in Congress, much of it tied to whether the Senate will reform itself to allow majority rule.
The health care law established so-called risk corridors meant to help insurance companies cope with the risks they took when they decided to participate in the law's marketplaces without knowing who would sign up for coverage. Under the program, the federal government would limit insurance companies' gains and losses on insurance sold in the marketplaces from 2014 through 2016.
This did not move forward. Nor has a plan from Senators Tim Kaine and Michael Bennet to create a version of Medicare, which they call Medicare X, available to all Americans.
Right. Which to be clear, you do have at least one senator saying just that and some congressmen saying just that.
What's remarkable about this determination is that the usual arguments against helping the needy, which were weak even in normal times, have become completely unsustainable in the face of the pandemic. Yet those arguments, zombielike, just keep shambling on.

Senator Warren has proposed using the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice to undo anti-competitive mergers currently in place, then passing legislation designating companies worth more than $25 billion in revenue as platform utilities.
While Mr. Trump lorded over Twitter, important lessons for him lurked, unwatched, on YouTube.
But a second maneuver, an accounting one, helped its standing in financial markets immensely, said Sheryl Skolnick, director of United States equity research for Mizuho Securities. In November 2015, UnitedHealth made an adjustment on its balance sheet, setting aside an initial premium deficiency reserve of $200 million for expected losses in those marketplaces.
PORTLAND, Me. — Brandy Staples, a 39-year-old breast cancer survivor, had expected to become eligible for Medicaid coverage this month after Maine voters approved an expansion of the program last fall. Instead, she found herself in a courtroom here on Wednesday, watching the latest chapter unfold in a rancorous, drawn-out battle over whether she and thousands of other poor people in the state will get free government insurance after all.
Charlie Warzel: Senator, how do you first campaign in and then govern a country as polarized as the one that we're living in right now? Because this doesn't feel like a disagreement on a few policies. This is a situation where the cost of letting the other side wins seems almost too much to bear for the other side. And if you look at impeachment, you see politicians literally inventing alternate realities rather than compromise or disparage a party leader. How do you realistically navigate that and get things done? Because it doesn't feel like a divide that you can heal away.

It is about whether they will protect America's political institutions or turn to tearing them down. But parties don't act or evolve in vacuums. They are shaped by institutions. They are shaped by their internal institutions and the broader systems in which they operate, and that's why I wanted to have Yuval Levin on the show today. Yuval is the director of social, cultural, and constitutional studies at the American Enterprise Institute, as well as the author of a bunch of great books, but most recently, A Time to Build, which I highly recommend. He's someone who's been trying to reform the Republican Party for a long time. He's served in the Bush administration. He's very influential with more traditionally conservative Republicans in Congress. And importantly, he thinks in institutions, not just candidates or messages. And so that's what I wanted to talk to him about. What is the Republican Party? What has it become? And how can the institutions that are driving that evolution be made more responsible? How can the institutions that surround not just the Republican Party, but the Democratic Party, force them to be better, help them to be healthier, make sure politics is about what is done for real people, how people's lives are changed and not symbolic fights, not just who rules? Yuval and I have been debating some of these questions for years now. And as you'll hear, there's quite a lot we disagree on, but these are the kinds of discussions that need to be had.
Republicans, who previously failed to gain enough votes to replace President Obama's health law, attempted a third measure to repeal major parts of the Affordable Care Act without a replacement. That plan has collapsed.
I think that people's attachment to the gender binary is extremely deep.
They describe a heated meeting in the White House on Monday, in which Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump's acting chief of staff, pressed the president to keep his campaign promises to upend the law and urged him, along with other officials, to try to seize control of the health care issue from Democrats.
So Lindsey Graham said, John and I were relevant together. I mean, it was, like, we're sharing a meal together. We're sharing a value system together, and that value system was relevance. And I was confused by the word. I said, what do you mean by that? And he said, relevant is like, in the middle of everything. Relevant is you're making a difference.
BS: Is it my imagination or are we hearing almost nothing about voter disenfranchisement in this campaign, when in fact we saw disenfranchisement actually tipped races in Florida and Georgia? And post-Obama, all kinds of disenfranchisement methods came online.

Still, voters there broke with him on this issue, albeit by the margin of one percentage point. The ballot initiative drew 30,000 more voters than the state's Senate primaries, suggesting that some Oklahomans came out specifically to support the insurance expansion.
Given the size of California — the nation's most populous state with nearly 40 million people — approval there alone would be a milestone in the movement toward legalized pot, and no matter that federal law still outlaws it. Voters there narrowly defeated an initiative that would have made pot legal in 2010, but it is back on the ballot now with polls suggesting it is heading for an easy win, particularly in a high-turnout presidential election year.
Fifty years ago, Richard Nixon transformed this historic heartbeat of denial into an intoxicating political philosophy. His presidential candidacy appealed to George Wallace-type segregationists while also attracting Americans who refused to live near dangerous black residents, obstructed the desegregation of schools, resisted affirmative action policies, framed black mothers on welfare as undeserving, called the black family pathological and denigrated black culture — all those racists who refused to believe they were racist in 1968.
Sometimes, though, one party really is doing a better job than the other. To refuse to admit it is to miss the story.
This interview was conducted by the editorial board of The New York Times, which will announce its Democratic primary endorsement on Jan. 19.
KK: We have time for, I think, one or two more questions.
On the economy, Trump could reach out to moderate voters with a minimum-wage increase. In a January poll from The Hill , 55 percent of registered voters said they would support raising the federal minimum wage to $15 per hour from $7.25. While only 36 percent of Republicans supported $15 per hour, 70 percent said they would support a lesser but still significant raise. Only 14 percent of registered voters want the minimum wage to stay the same and only 5 percent think it should be reduced or eliminated. In the same survey, an even larger number of voters — 59 percent — said that they support a 70 percent tax rate on the amount of income over $10 million. By adopting both policies, Trump could claim the middle and grow his coalition beyond its current confines.
KK: Well, one more personal question for you. Who has broken your heart?
Even if Democrats sweep the 2020 elections, the incrementalist history of health policy reform in the United States suggests that an expansion of the current Medicare program is the most probable outcome. And yet the sizable role private insurers already play in Medicare is largely overlooked, even as they cause substantial administrative burdens for beneficiaries.
People don't like their private insurance companies, they like their doctors and hospitals. Under our plan, people go to any doctor they want, any hospital they want. The quickest way you get there is create competition with the insurers. God bless the insurers if they want to compete.
But if your complaint is a labor complaint, that is, gee, here I am in America and I'm trying to compete against workers in a foreign country who are getting paid a dollar a day. What's your path? Well, first you've got to go to the U.S. government and persuade the U.S. government that they should go after this country, for which we know what has happened. U.S. government has repeatedly — and this is not just by — well, yeah, we get your point.
Mr. Azar and Ms. Verma had been discussing the idea with the White House for several months, but were unable to persuade Mr. Mulvaney and his allies, who shot down the proposal in two meetings at the end of last week, with the president's blessing, administration officials said.
I talk about Citizens United, although that one again is either going to take constitutional amendment or some change in the personnel at the Supreme Court to reslice that issue. But I think it is important to keep that one on the table. And I talk about it because when I close, I talk about why those three things are related to each other.
CW: Can I ask about that?
Robert Bork was President Ronald Reagan's failed Supreme Court nominee in 1987. He wrote extensively on antitrust legislation and redefined it from a focus on helping small businesses to promoting economic efficiency, according to Barak Orbach, professor of law at the University of Arizona.
The most that can be achieved, and it's a lot, actually, is to convey to the swing voters — the independents, suburban women and moderate Republicans who delivered the House to the Democrats in the 2018 midterms — just how much this president is ready to put himself above the law. And, therefore, four more years of his presidency, when he would no longer be restrained by the need for re-election, would be catastrophic for our country's unity and for the institutions and norms that have sustained it since 1776.
Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, is all but certain to vote no on the procedural vote, no matter what legislation Mr. McConnell promises to put before the chamber if the initial hurdle is cleared.
Still, Brill does have some stunners in store. The most surprising parts of Tailspin come at the end, when he tries to forecast what might happen next, offering a rather extraordinary mix of doomsaying and wishful thinking. He envisions a day when things get so bad that President Trump's supporters will awaken to the debacle that their choice produced. He foresees coal miners deciding to march on Washington and demand help in transitioning to an energy industry of the future. He anticipates the productive public fury that would erupt if a bridge collapses on the same day or in the same week that two trains derail, a big city loses electricity and a school system finds out that its water fountains are gushing lead.
Several of the candidates who spoke earlier in the day would go on to deliver emotional appeals for combating gun violence in later statements, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who said he had tried to reach Mr. O'Rourke.
It is hard to overstate just how down-is-up this argument is. Courts determine whether to invalidate other provisions in a law based on their assessment of Congress's intent and whether Congress would have wanted other provisions to go into effect if one provision did not. The department's argument is that without the mandate, Congress would not have wanted the guaranteed-issue and community-rating provisions.
So the effect is that the promises that are put into trade agreements like T.P.P., they may all look the same on paper, but man, they are nowhere close to each other in terms of what happens with enforcement. Multinational corporations are given the opportunity basically to opt out of laws they don't like, where protections that are supposed to be written for our workers, for the worldwide environment, for human rights standards, just get left by the curb.
So let me push back on what your theory of change is, because the way the Affordable Care Act worked is we passed it, and then it was four years later when the benefits came in, and they kind of bumped into place, right? Look at it the other way around. What I propose is as many people can get into it as want to get into it, and then once they're in, try taking it away from them, because that's what the fight then shifts to. How did we end up hanging on to the Affordable Care Act when the Republicans had the House, the Senate and the White House? The answer was we ended up hanging on to it because enough people across this country said, You're not going to take this away from me.
BS: Just to tie in with Charlie here, let's just take the prescription problem.
MARMET, W.Va. — There were the beauty queens, ages 6 to 60, riding in style in the Labor Day Parade, including Teen Miss West Virginia Coal. There was the man driving a pickup truck memorial to 29 workers killed in a 2010 mine disaster, each victim's portrait airbrushed on metal.
In the case of social media, Begala declared:
It's got to be Master of the Senate. I mean, there's just no — no one holds a candle to Caro. And the reason I like it is that he is not reverent for the institution in a way that I think a lot of people who write about the Senate are. And he is very good about showing how the individuals who have come through the institution have shaped it. And I think his work — I mean, I don't want to seem presumptuous to say, but was hugely influential on my own.
And then there's labor policy, where the Trump administration has moved on multiple fronts to do away with regulations that had protected workers from exploitation, injury and more.
I try to tell people when they think about Congress and its operation to not think about Congress, to just imagine you work in an office, and you work for a boss. And you don't like your boss, and you don't like what your boss is working on. And that importantly, for your boss to finish his project, he needs your help. And if you don't help him, he won't finish his project, and you may become the boss. And if you do help him, he will finish his project, and you may lose your job. And even if you don't lose your job, all your friends are going to be mad at you. So what do you do? And I think the answer's pretty obvious. You wouldn't help your boss. But that is actually how Congress works, as best as I understand it. And yet, we expect people to overwhelm their own self-interest, minority players to overwhelm their own self-interest, because of tradition or something.
So the phone thing happens. The relationship did not improve over the course of the campaign.
Given greater flexibility to set their own policies, several governors said, they would like to trim the number of people in Medicaid and the array of benefits offered in both the public program and private plans sold in the markets.
In states that have expanded eligibility under the health law, Medicaid is available to people with annual incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty level, up to $27,724 for a three-person family and $16,242 for an individual. And states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility have generally had much broader gains in insurance coverage.
You have to take the idea that the real victims here are Josh Hawley and Mitch McConnell. They're the ones who need defenses of minority rights, not people who are being systematically denied the right to vote.
archived recording (donald trump) So we're going to get rid of Obamacare. And I said it the other day. The Republican Party will become the party of great health care. It's good. It's important.
Finally, McCain recognized that the military wasn't the only way that Washington could use its awesome power for good. When I interviewed him during the 2008 presidential campaign, he described his economic hero as Theodore Roosevelt — a free-enterprise, capitalist, full-bore guy who realized that prosperity depended on government agencies that need to do their job as well. The outlook led him to favor policies (albeit too sporadically) to fight climate change and expand community colleges.
He sits at the nexus of an immensely influential but largely unseen network of conservative organizations, donors and lawyers who all share a common goal: Fill the federal courts with scores of judges who are committed to the narrow interpretation of the Constitution that they believe the founders intended.
BA: What is the specific standard that you would apply in antitrust? Right now we basically have a consumer pricing setup.
But that's my point. It doesn't. That's what I just said.
JI: I want to just pivot very quickly to health care. It seemed like a good moment. With respect to what you will fight for, can you talk a little bit about Medicare for all and where it ranks in terms of your priorities, and then to kind of sort of reiterate the question, how do you convince people who are wary of massive health care overhaul yet again that that's the right approach to that problem basically?
writes that if the president wants to follow through on pro-union campaign promises, there are many pro-labor things Mr. Biden can do even without Congress. Chye-Ching Huang argues that one of the best ways for the president to pay for ambitious policies and help honest taxpayers is to restore the funding the I.R.S. needs to effectively battle tax cheats.
His intent is to offer coverage not only to those who lost it during the pandemic, but also to those who did not have insurance and now want it, according to a senior administration official who previewed the new policy during a conference call Thursday morning. The so-called special enrollment period will run from Feb. 15 to May 15. The official said the reopening would be accompanied by the kind of robust patient outreach — including paid advertising, direct outreach to consumers and partnerships with community organizations and advocacy groups — that was abandoned by the Trump administration. Typically, Americans in the 36 states that rely on the federal marketplace can buy Obamacare insurance only during a six-week period in the fall, a restriction meant to encourage people to hold coverage even when they are healthy. The sign-up period for this year's coverage ended in mid-December, with enrollments only slightly higher than they were last year. But the Trump administration did little to advertise it. Once the coronavirus struck, Mr. Trump faced pressure to reopen enrollment for the millions of Americans losing their jobs, but he refused. Mr. Biden's actions take aim at a number of Mr. Trump's policies. In 2018, citing complaints about the price of Obamacare coverage, the Trump administration issued a rule that extended the length of less expensive short term policies from three months to up to three years.
SS: The Obama administration tried that, Trump administration tried that in different ways, but no results. What kind of leverage would you use? What would you do?
KK: Yes, and even more practically, is it enough to get anything passed in Mitch McConnell's Senate?
If the current lower court ruling from Texas is ultimately upheld, the case could have major consequences throughout the health care system. Estimates from the Urban Institute suggest that around 20 million more Americans would become uninsured. And a wide range of federal health policies, including consumer protections, payment reforms, drug approval processes and fraud penalties, would have to be unwound.
What will President Trump's first recession look like?
WASHINGTON — The heavens part. The light shines down. The rise in the oceans begins to slow. The world is once more bathed in the mystical glow of a messiah. Our redemption from Donald Trump is at hand.
The newfound Democratic health care enthusiasm may not translate into victories, of course. Republican campaigns are turning away from health care as a major issue this cycle, planning to pay more attention to other messages like immigration, job creation and attacks on Democrats. When they talk about health care, many candidates are focusing on Democratic efforts to expand public health insurance coverage, not on continued calls to repeal Obamacare.
Actually, I don't think of what I say that way. What I think of is the leadership possibilities that the candidates for president are offering. I don't know anybody who sits around and says, I want to make peace with corruption. I don't know where those people are in America who think it's O.K. that Amazon makes $11 billion and pays nothing in taxes. I haven't seen those people. Now, maybe they just stay away from me, but I don't think so. I think —
The way I think we get something done in Washington, it's the Frances Perkins story. It's not enough to organize on the outside and have the marches in the street. Before the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire, there had been dozens of marches, right? Lots of high profile. But the guys who ran the factories figured out it was a lot cheaper just to grease palms in Albany than it was to actually change their practices and put up adequate fire escapes and fire preventive measures. So just pushing from the outside, it's not enough to get it done. Just fighting it from the inside is not enough to get it done. But the one-two punch of pushing from the outside and leading it from the inside is where you see real difference.
As the nation confronts the coronavirus crisis, the presidential candidates are facing a new challenge to their pursuit of the Democratic nomination: how to connect with voters during the height of the presidential primary campaign — from a safe distance. Both Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders, his chief rival in the primaries, have had to pull back from large-scale events this week and allow their staff members to work from home.
Public health experts say the entire global system of buying doses, pitting one country against another with little regard for equity, is unfit to the task of ending a pandemic that respects no borders. For the European Union, problems with its vaccination campaigns have reinforced criticism of the bloc's bureaucracy. Unable to speed up vaccine makers, the bloc's leaders have instead resorted to threats about the export process, a sign of the severe pressure facing them as the European Union falls far behind Britain and the United States, which made advanced purchases of vaccines earlier, and have been quicker to authorize the shots and get people inoculated. Britain has given vaccines to 10 percent of its people so far, compared to about 2 percent in the European Union. Britain was the first country to authorize a fully tested coronavirus vaccine, and the government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson has trumpeted its successes. Benjamin Mueller and
First, with the former governor of Texas on the ticket, even a bozo like Donald Trump would be unlikely to lose the state.
The Affordable Care Act continued to grow in popularity after Republican efforts to repeal the legislation in 2017 — a recent poll found that over half of the public favors the legislation.
The Fourth of July is upon us, so it's time once again to sing what is arguably our most baffling national ditty, Yankee Doodle Dandy. Maybe you've noticed: Some of the lyrics seem like the work of a prankster on acid. Who else could have conceived a vignette as bizarre as a man riding a pony into town, then sticking a feather in his cap that, for unknown reasons, he insists on calling macaroni?
In other words, could it be that the problem with Chief Justice Roberts is that he isn't sufficiently political in the right direction? That was certainly the message Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas sent last month when called the chief justice the tip of the spear in playing politics. In remarks at the Heritage Foundation, he explained: Chief Justice John Roberts knowingly, clearly and unabashedly rewrote Obamacare twice. What we are seeing is nothing more than naked politics being played by the United States Supreme Court. (By twice, Governor Abbott was referring to the chief justice's majority opinion last year in King v. Burwell, which saved the statute from a contorted reading that would have stripped the federal government of the ability to set up insurance exchanges.)

So voters are right to believe that health care is very much an issue in the midterm elections. It may not be the most important thing at stake — there's a good case to be made that the survival of American democracy is on the line. But it's a very big deal.
In December, former Vice President Joe Biden said that he would consider choosing Senator Warren as his running mate and wondered whether she would choose him. The Senator, for her part, has suggested she might prefer a woman.
No, I know he did, but I don't know what that means.
But some progressives have questioned the decision to route patients into private health plans, which will cost the government more because of the high prices they pay for care.
Ignoring the binding vote, Gov. Paul LePage has refused to expand the program, blasting it as a needless, budget-busting form of welfare. He vetoed five expansion bills before the issue made the ballot, plus a spending bill this month that provided about $60 million in funding for the first year. Earlier this month he went so far as to say he would go to jail before I put the state in red ink by adding at least 70,000 more low-income adults to the state's Medicaid population of 264,000.

Today, however, the Republican Party has become radicalized. It opposes once-bipartisan ideas as a matter of course: an assault-weapons ban, Obamacare (which was shaped by ideas from the Heritage Foundation and Mitt Romney) and virtually any effort to slow climate change. The G.O.P.'s radical turn means that climate activists can no longer search for a compromise between the two parties, in the hope that their leaders will try to sell it to skeptical voters. Republicans have made clear that they will instead stoke the skepticism for their own ends. Doing so pleases the oil and coal industries, which are generous campaign donors. It also helps win elections. To a lesser degree, the conservative parties in Australia and Canada are mimicking this strategy.

Yeah, I'm not sure if that's true either. I mean, I do think that he's able to take certain extremely fringe ideas and mainstream them. But, yeah, we shouldn't forget about the fact that he is extremely unpopular.
Well, I think that's part of the story. I would broaden it a little to say that the threat of communism for more than half a century, and really from the beginnings of the modern conservative movement in the 1950s, say, the danger of communism organized Republican thinking about both foreign and domestic issues. Certainly, it unified the party around a fairly aggressive stance in the Cold War, especially after the Nixon years and into the Reagan years, where Republicans moved from a party of detente to a party of confrontation and rollback. But the opposition to communism also organized the domestic coalition in a variety of ways. Opposing communism meant defending religious traditionalism. It meant opposing a kind of threat that was, at the very least, secularizing, if not atheistic. And so the party became a home for Christian conservatives over the decades, gradually, slowly. Opposing communism meant making the case for capitalism, and the party became the home of the case for capitalism, gradually, of market thinking, and not just about global economic affairs, but about domestic policy. And so there were certainly a lot of ways in which understanding the American situation is fundamentally oriented by the challenge of communism. It gave a logic to the Republican coalition that helped it take shape. I think the Democratic party was much less organized around that question and much more organized around the character of American society itself, and the question of the Soviets was just never as central an organizing principle.
Now, that's only for collective bargaining agreements, but that's real money in the pockets of those union numbers. Secondly, what at least some of the unions liked about this is the unions never have to bargain on this one again, once you get all the way to Medicare for all, because their workers will have health care coverage. Which means they can bargain once again over wages and working conditions and keeping jobs here in the United States instead of having to go back to their members year after year after year and say: We just bargained. Great for you. Your salary will go up one half of 1 percent, and your deductible will only go up by another $2,000.
archived recording Republicans won everything in Wisconsin in 2010.
Lindsey Graham has certainly ascended to the role of one of Donald Trump's two or three closest advisers on the Hill. The backdrop to this, though, is that Lindsey Graham's best friend, John McCain, is going through a very, very public, difficult illness. And Donald Trump basically didn't let up at all. He was still criticizing John McCain for his vote against the Affordable Care Act repeal of 2017. But also, John McCain, through his office, even through his illness, was not shy about criticizing Donald Trump for things like Helsinki, Charlottesville. And Donald Trump was not one to let this lie and was going to bash John McCain right back. So you had this situation where Lindsey Graham and the president were becoming very close and public friends, whereas John McCain was dying a very, very slow and tragic and public death. So I think people began to ask this question, what was going on with Lindsey Graham, in maybe a more personal framework, because John McCain and he were known to be so close, and John McCain, obviously, was very sick.
Now that you've insured an additional 20 million people, you can't just take the insurance away from these people, he added. It's just not the right thing to do.
Most Texans gaining coverage have done so through the health law's insurance marketplaces. The premiums in Texas have tended to be lower than those elsewhere in the country, but there have been some big increases in recent years. The monthly price of a midlevel individual market plan has increased to $462 this year, up from $359 in 2017.
Some of the smartest military analysts I know think that investing in so many big, new weapons systems is the equivalent of taking sledgehammers to droplets of quicksilver, considering that so many enemies we face today are super-empowered individuals or nations that have opted to hurt us with cheap cyberweapons and cheap but massive swarming tactics.
MC: —— that requires you to pass comprehensive immigration reform.
I mean, I feel like I see in my children a response to society in sort of everything they do. I mean, they're incredibly molded by their friends, by what they hear in school, by us parents. And my worry is not for them at their age right now. As I said, they're eight and six. It's like how they think about gender and the role of gender, and how they think about, especially, their preferences and their interests, how those are shaped by society at large. At an early age, they're being pushed in these directions that I don't know accurately reflects how they would live in another kind of society. This is all just a little bit academic though. Because changing pronouns or just my writing a column about changing pronouns isn't going to effect any of this. But it's the larger backdrop to my feeling that the importance that we put on gender and the kind of almost invisible role in our day-to-day lives that gender plays on what we do is just too high. And much of my desire in writing this or in talking about pronouns is to just point out how stifling some of this can be.
Unlike an administration functioning during normal times, the Biden team can't simply add people to a meeting at the last minute, or run someone into the building. It couldn't be more different in feel and temperament from the opening weeks of the Trump administration, when the Oval Office was often compared to Grand Central Terminal. Former President Donald J. Trump's office served as a bustling focal point of all West Wing activity as aides wandered in and out and then simply hung about, once it was clear that there was no formal structure for meetings or policymaking, and that for Mr. Trump, out of sight was out of mind. All West Wing staff members are still tested daily even though a growing number of administration officials are getting vaccinated. There are also fewer people working in the building, and those who are there rarely leave the campus for lunch. There have been awkward moments in hallways, when staff members don't recognize each other because everyone is required to wear an N95 mask and many have opted to double-mask, officials said. The measures are in place because of a realization that while it may be impossible to prevent the coronavirus from entering the White House complex entirely, it is possible to reduce the risk of widespread infection if someone on the president's team gets sick. The rules have been put in place by Anne Filipic, the director of management and administration, and Jeff Wexler, the White House director of Covid-19 operations.
All eyes on Lindsey Graham and another Democratic member trying to come up with some sort of bipartisan compromise.
Before the law, employer-provided plans often set strict limits on what they would pay toward medical bills during a single year and over a lifetime. An estimated 105 million Americans had some sort of lifetime cap before the passage of the health care law.
They pass a number of bills that limit the power of the incoming Democratic governor and take away things that were available to his Republican predecessor.
Peter Thiel, an early Facebook investor, called Senator Warren dangerous, to which Senator Warren responded good. Mr. Zuckerberg said a Warren presidency would suck for the company, according to audio leaked and reported in The Verge.
Senator Warren has released one of the most robust housing plans in the 2020 field, including the creation of a Tenant Protection Bureau modeled after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

White House press aides did not immediately respond to a request for comment. And one official, who asked for anonymity to speak about the meetings, insisted that Mr. Mulvaney had simply been convening people with various views so that the president could make his own decision. But Mr. Mulvaney was described as leading the charge to back the suit, in an account of the two meetings that was described by a half-dozen people with knowledge of what took place.
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear a third major challenge to the Affordable Care Act, setting up likely arguments this fall in a case that could wipe out President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement.

Key data of the day Here is why U.S. deaths remain near record highs while new cases are declining. It usually takes several weeks for a coronavirus infection to develop into severe illness. Credit... John Moore/Getty Images How is it that Covid-19 cases and deaths in the U.S. aren't moving in the same direction? As President Biden's new coronavirus team held its first public briefing on Wednesday, trends in the two closely watched metrics were painting a confusing picture. Average daily reports of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. have decreased 33 percent over the last two weeks, but reported deaths in the same period have remained near record highs. One key common-sense factor goes a long way to clear the confusion. The people whose deaths are being reported now were probably infected — and then reported as new cases — weeks or even months ago. So their number mainly reflects the spread of the virus in November and December, when it was surging in most of the country. Deaths are lagged by at least three weeks after case reports, Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said Wednesday. There are other factors that could contribute to a disconnect between the case and death trends, like a shift in how many especially vulnerable people were becoming infected. But Dr. Nuzzo said she did not think that was the case now.
Oh, right, Steve Daines, yeah, he went on a sort of America, love it or leave it kind of thing. Yeah. But I think, in general, the Republican response is either a kind of condemnation, like the one Romney gave that is not as strenuous as it should be, or a kind of let's pretend Trump didn't say that and just say, yeah, Trump's right that it's bad that these Democrats are socialists.
This debate exploded into the open during Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential announcement speech. The address is now remembered for Goldwater's promise to offer a choice, not an echo. Less well-known, but perhaps more telling, is the rationale for his candidacy that comes a few paragraphs earlier. Goldwater says, with some disgust, I have not heard from any announced Republican candidate a declaration of conscience or of political position that could possibly offer to the American people a clear choice in the next presidential election. This was Goldwater's promise: if Republicans nominated him, the election would not be an engagement of personalities. It will be an engagement of principles. Goldwater, of course, won the nomination and got destroyed by Lyndon Johnson.
I think knowing that he had a cushion of 13 votes gave him the confidence to make that snap decision and say, look, I don't know if I can hold Collins, Ayotte, and Murkowski for a year from voting for President Obama's nominee, but I'm pretty sure that I can hold 13 Republicans from breaking ranks.
If Facebook has way too much power.
Reed: Another idea, floated by Donald Trump — who would do away with the exchanges in any event — is to induce competition by allowing insurers to sell across state lines. But, as you've written, that may not work any better to give people a wider choice of plans at better prices. If Hillary Clinton wins, what do you think the political odds are for adopting something like the public option? Do you think Congress would go along? Would state legislatures?
So you might think that this sort of really left-wing idea of doing a universal health care would just go away, but instead it starts to gain in popularity, and we see this in a couple of different ways. Public opinion surveys show steady and modest increases in the number of Americans who seem interested in this idea when they're asked about it. And the other thing that happens is we start to see way more Democrats in Congress signing on to proposals like the Sanders proposal. So Sanders himself had a bill that he had brought forward in previous Congresses and, basically, no one wanted to co-sign it. And then he brought it again in 2017, and all of a sudden he had, I think, 16 co-sponsors, including lots of really ambitious Democratic senators that we expected to run for president, and we now see are running for president. And there's a bill in the House that had been introduced year after year with very few co-sponsors, and all of a sudden, again, in 2017, we saw the majority of Democrats in the House were signing onto this bill.
Long before the pandemic, state and especially local health departments were way underfunded, Abby said. We saw the effects of that over the past year. Local health departments are going to have so much work to continue doing, moving forward, to prevent flare-ups of the virus and keep this kind of thing from happening again.
Over all, though, the panel spent the most time on the question of whether the rest of the law should fall if Judge O'Connor was correct in scrapping the insurance mandate — and Judge Elrod and Judge Engelhardt, based on their questioning, seemed to firmly believe he was. Judge Engelhardt asked Mr. Letter, the House lawyer, why Congress could not remedy the situation by writing a new health law or set of laws.
But I want every delegate at this convention to understand that as long as I'm a vote —
Mr. Obama has said that in a private meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia last fall, he confronted Mr. Putin about the hacking, and told him to cut it out, there were going to be serious consequences if he did not, but that he had been reluctant to say anything publicly that would be perceived as affecting the presidential election.
Exactly. A 2-cent wealth tax just means if you don't lift a finger, your fortune only grows at 4 percent, 6 percent, 8 percent. And yet how many people in this country who are so sophisticated and knowledgeable — right — say you could never get a wealth tax because the billionaires and millionaires won't let it happen? Well, what the hell? This is a democracy.
And we had a black president.
I've never been called this much by a president in my life.
It doesn't go well. The legislature gavels in a session this past Saturday.
I've already made the pitch, and I actually had several unions say that it's a really good approach. I don't remember if the U.A.W. was one of them.
This is the same Ben Carson who has inveighed against the purveyors of division, who played a video at his presidential campaign announcement in Detroit in which the narrator said in part:
Dogs, though known for their loyalty, can take only so much from one abusive human. Alas, the same cannot be said for the aging, white, rural and southern people who make up Trump's base. He can lie to them, hurt them with tariffs, make a mockery of their values, suck up to freedom-hating dictators they once distrusted, and they'll stick with him. Cult 45 is thought to be impermeable.
The second reason to be skeptical of the critics is that their big assumption depends on the belief that a long shutdown would have put more political pressure on the Republicans and Democrats. As evidence, the critics cite polls showing that most voters believe the Dreamers deserve to remain in this country.
JI: So you have, on one hand, the boldest public option that's probably been offered by any of the Democratic candidates. On the other hand, you have the most aggressive Medicare for all universal plan that's been offered. You'll be, if I understand it correctly, starting with this aggressive public option hoping to segue to a Medicare for all by year three, and in the middle of all that, you will probably be called upon to defend the Affordable Care Act at the Supreme Court level. How do you think about those three — and of distinct — that just seems like an awful lot of health care reform.
People buying those plans may face some unpleasant surprises. The plans are likely to require applicants to fill out detailed health histories, and to exclude those with prior illnesses. They also are likely to exclude or limit services — like addiction treatment, maternity care or prescription drugs — that all Obamacare plans require. Association plan buyers have tended to have problems with fraud. And some short-term plans have a history of declining to pay for serious illnesses after the fact.
Kelly Mays, an English professor who said she favored Ms. Klobuchar and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, called it a little frightening that you can buy your way in at this late date. Standing in line to vote on Sunday afternoon, she said she thought Ms. Warren's chances in Nevada were probably not great, but I also think people are counting her out way too early.
Madison Hardee, a lawyer at Legal Services of Southern Piedmont, in Charlotte, N.C., said that enrollment stories can be an incredibly powerful tool to connect with consumers. Such testimonials are urgently needed, she said, because consumers in North Carolina are already starting to get notices about health insurance companies leaving the marketplace, and they fear the changes will reduce their ability to get quality, affordable coverage.
Look at the example. He said, I will take your money to lie about other candidates. What does that mean for our democracy? Not even meet the minimal standard that TV ads run, right?
So if you could rewrite the rule, how would it read?
This interview was conducted by the editorial board of The New York Times, which will announce its Democratic primary endorsement on Jan. 19.
The evidence of that coming betrayal is obvious in the choice of an array of pro-corporate, anti-labor figures for key positions. In particular, the most important story of the week — seriously, people, stop focusing on Trump Twitter — was the selection of Tom Price, an ardent opponent of Obamacare and advocate of Medicare privatization, as secretary of health and human services. This choice probably means that the Affordable Care Act is doomed — and Mr. Trump's most enthusiastic supporters will be among the biggest losers.
The Fed cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point yesterday, matching analyst expectations. Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, cited slowing global economic growth and the uncertainty wrought by Mr. Trump's trade war with China. He also announced another move to bolster growth: an early end to the central bank's effort to shrink its balance sheet.
A growing divide has emerged among unions over whether to support Medicare for all. Roughly 95 percent of union workers had health care access in 2019, while just 68 percent of nonunion workers did.
He was the outer-borough boy whose father's boxlike office was on Avenue Z in Brooklyn; he always dreamed of making it to Manhattan and breaking into the big league.
MC: And nobody does well at this question.
So the effect is that the promises that are put into trade agreements like T.P.P., they may all look the same on paper, but man, they are nowhere close to each other in terms of what happens with enforcement. Multinational corporations are given the opportunity basically to opt out of laws they don't like, where protections that are supposed to be written for our workers, for the worldwide environment, for human rights standards, just get left by the curb.
So whenever people are being paid outside the legal system, it undercuts protection for everyone and gives an advantage to the employers who move outside the legal system. You know, look, it's part of the same basic principle. Everybody should follow the same set of rules. And if our labor standards are there's a $15-an-hour minimum wage, then everybody should pay it. If the labor standards are that you don't get to put somebody up working in an elevator shaft who has no training, then every employer should have to follow that. And any time an employer can get the work done by not following the rules, that employer gets an unfair advantage, and that unfair advantage undercuts the strength of everybody who follows the rules, undercuts the economy, undercuts workers.
JI: So you have, on one hand, the boldest public option that's probably been offered by any of the Democratic candidates. On the other hand, you have the most aggressive Medicare for all universal plan that's been offered. You'll be, if I understand it correctly, starting with this aggressive public option hoping to segue to a Medicare for all by year three, and in the middle of all that, you will probably be called upon to defend the Affordable Care Act at the Supreme Court level. How do you think about those three — and of distinct — that just seems like an awful lot of health care reform.
I thought at the time, it was a usefully provocative title. And I overestimated the extent to which people would actually, at least read the introduction. I certainly think that over the last 15 years, it has become more and more central to my political thinking that we have a real difficulty understanding the beliefs of people who are unlike us or who disagree with us. And so it's important whenever we come across an opposing view, or something that our initial response is to oppose, or reject, or be horrified by, to stop and think, is it possible for an intelligent person of good will to believe this? And try to do a real work of imagination in figuring that out. And I did try to do that in the book, but I'd say I've tried to do it more frequently in both directions. So, I was opposed to Trump from the get-go, but I did try to argue, I could totally see why somebody might support Donald Trump in the Republican primaries in 2015 and 2016. And we shouldn't just assume that everybody who supports him is supporting him for obnoxious reasons or hateful reasons. And the same is true of people on our left. And yet, I find that a lot of people are not willing to make that effort. And some people even make a point of pride, on left and right, of not making that kind of effort.
But the other half, let's say you have a complaint because the trade agreement had said that some other country would permit unionization or would not use low-wage workers beyond a certain point. Do you get a path like that? A quick resolution? And by the way, I should point out: That quick resolution? There's no appeal from it. It is immediately enforceable against a government. So you can go straight against Canada for raising its environmental standards. You can go straight against a South American country for raising its standards to protect its children's health from smoking.
But look at the difference it makes if there are multiple Facebooks out there. If you can get to anybody's page regardless of who they go through, it becomes like the phone company, right? You can have any different brand of phone, but as long as I hit the same set of numbers, I will reach you. If you could do that through Facebook, then you've got competitors offering, hey, I tell you what. You come use my site, and I won't be sharing your personal data with anybody. I will offer better security than those other yahoos offer. I will offer you a 2-cent rebate for all of the advertising. I will offer you the option to click out of ads, or you'll only get one ad every minute. That's what competitive markets do.
JI: I want to just pivot very quickly to health care. It seemed like a good moment. With respect to what you will fight for, can you talk a little bit about Medicare for all and where it ranks in terms of your priorities, and then to kind of sort of reiterate the question, how do you convince people who are wary of massive health care overhaul yet again that that's the right approach to that problem basically?

But Mr. de León's struggles suggest that this moment of transition remains a work in progress. He would seem to have the right political makeup to lead the party to its next chapter. He is more liberal than Ms. Feinstein at a time when the left is on the rise. He is Latino in a state where the power of Latino voters continues to grow. And he is coming off almost four years as president of the Senate, giving him a platform to present himself as one of the state's most aggressive leaders in opposing Mr. Trump.
MG: Your standing in some of the polls in the swing states is not as competitive as some of the other candidates'. Do you think that this issue is hurting you in the swing states like Michigan? If not, what do you make of the discrepancy in swing states?
Before the Affordable Care Act, in the district and in almost all states, people were locked into existing plans because of medical underwriting: insurers charging people higher rates for using medical care and rejecting people from coverage. Thanks to the health law, many D.C. customers switched to comparable plans and saved.
Mr. Trump, during a Times interview in which he made several misleading statements, said he would make the information available at some point.
President Trump's own words tell us that his nominee to the court will almost certainly vote to overturn Roe v. Wade and eviscerate affordable access to health care for millions of Americans. President-elect Donald Trump said in November of 2016 that I'm pro-life; the judges will be pro-life. During the campaign, he speculated that after he appointed two or three judges to the bench, Roe v. Wade will go back to the individual states.
Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, is all but certain to vote no on the procedural vote, no matter what legislation Mr. McConnell promises to put before the chamber if the initial hurdle is cleared.
In fact, let me quote you a New York Times article from just last week that I thought was terrific, and that's about a 2-cent wealth tax and how it is popular across political lines and it's popular, why? Because most of America gets that they're getting cheated in this game, and you get that wherever you are on that income scale until you get up to the very top.
A White House spokesman would not confirm the number of people allowed in meetings, or the time limits on such gatherings. But he said that in-person meetings were limited and that colleagues were socially distancing. So far, officials said, the measures appear to be working. But they concede that it's a difficult way to run a White House, just as it was a difficult way to run a campaign and a difficult way to run a transition. Adjusting to doing most meetings via video and doing most of our work with colleagues remotely has not been a massive leap, said Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary. It has been a long adjustment as humans to not being able to hug old colleagues or shake hands with new ones, but so far we don't feel that it has prevented us from doing our jobs.
They absolutely should sign up, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. Unless something drastic happens, she said, consumers should have coverage and, for those who qualify, help with premiums through the end of the year.
Last week's setback on health care revealed the limits of an inexperienced White House, but one person has emerged as an effective wingman for a president short on help: Vice President Mike Pence.
The strategy of reminding voters that she was at the forefront of pushing for universal health care could help Mrs. Clinton appear more authentic as she tries to compete with a populist liberal candidate who identifies as a Democratic socialist. But the new line in her stump speech could also evoke a tumultuous period during President Bill Clinton's administration when the first lady was tasked with overhauling the health care system — and ultimately failed. Her proposals at the time aimed to provide universal health care, though they would have made employers responsible for their workers' insurance, while Mr. Sanders envisions a government-run system.
The G.O.P. plan would also limit funding for all enrollees by giving states a fixed sum per enrollee, rather than making an open-ended commitment to provide funding based on need.
Some short-term plans also limit how much they will pay per day of care, like a Lifeshield plan sold in several states, which advertises its freedom to choose any doctor or hospital, but pays a maximum of $1,000 of hospital bills per day, or $250 for an ambulance ride.
The first thing you need to understand here is that Republican talk of repeal and replace has always been a fraud. The G.O.P. has spent six years claiming that it will come up with a replacement for Obamacare any day now; the reason it hasn't delivered is that it can't.
Clinton gave a Trumpian answer to the question about her statement about public/private views, then claimed she was Lincolnian. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
When Senator Warren suggested that Vice President Biden is running in the wrong primary, he responded in a Medium post that called such attacks condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view.
When the moderator asked who would abolish private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan, only Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ms. Harris raised their hands. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York explained that she supports Mr. Sanders' Medicare for all bill, but that it will have a transition period for people to actively buy-in.
LK: And a growing concern during the Trump era about violence. And I'm just wondering how you would address that, if that is in fact something that's not going to go away once the Trump era ends, which I think is a safe assumption.
The Nobel was a tribute to the originality and influence of his work developing economic models that help people think about how to slow climate change. It also seemed to be a cri de coeur from the Swedish academics who choose the economics laureates: Climate change is a threat like no other. Fatal heat waves, droughts, wildfires and severe hurricanes are all becoming more common, and they are almost certain to accelerate. Avoiding horrific damage, as a United Nations panel of scientists recently concluded, will require changes in human behavior that have no documented historic precedent.

Biden Jr.'s primary rally at the Baldwin Hills Recreation Center in Los Angeles. Credit... Josh Haner/The New York Times LOS ANGELES — At the Biden party in Baldwin Hills, Nicole Duquette, a public school principal dressed in red, white, and blue, was streaming election returns on her phone as people came over to pet her spaniel, wearing a Joe Biden sweater. Biden has the experience to get to work on day one, Ms. Duquette, 40, said. He's a statesman, he's centered and grounded with a good moral and ethical compass, which is not something that could be said about the current president. It's time to take back our country and restore its reputation. The music cut and the crowd started chanting, We want Joe! and United for Biden! Julia Mervis, 20, and Brett Chody, 19, made up the college student contingent at the event. Both attend University of Southern California. Ms. Chody said she was passionate about gun control, but she preferred Mr. Biden because she thought he was more well-rounded as a candidate. Nobody's perfect, but I do think Bloomberg has a lot of flaws that will keep him from getting the nomination at the end of the day, she said. Ms. Mervis made a face when asked if she thought Mr. Sanders was electable.
LK: But I wanted to ask about an aspect of it that I think gets relatively little attention.
But he defended his brother's choice of Mr. Roberts. The Obamacare decision, I was disappointed in, Mr. Bush said. But he's made some really good rulings beyond that.
This action demonstrates that President Trump is committed to fixing the damage caused by Obamacare as soon as possible, said Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming.
Yeah, I do think that's true, and I'm sure it's a more complicated story than I can see and could get into. But I would say one important force that's played a role here, and you pointed to it, too, is the increasing capture of our core mainstream institutions by the left. The core institutions of American media, the Academy, culture are just explicitly and abjectly left-leaning institutions. That has meant that to resist the left is to resist these core institutions. And that, I think, has encouraged the kind of anti-institutional mindset that, in some ways, is always there. Populism is always anti-institutional, and there's always been a populist element of the right. But the American right, at its origins, was in the business of defending the institutions. Sometimes that meant defending the institutions from the people running them, which there's a certain irony to it, but it also made a certain amount of sense. Think about William F. Buckley's first book. He was just out of Yale, and he wrote a book called God and Man at Yale, which is basically an argument for saving the great universities from the professors. I think that when conservatives think about universities now, they're more inclined to say, to hell with them, and to think that there is no saving these institutions. We have to attack these institutions. Not everybody thinks this way, and there are people who try to resist these lines of thinking. I do, and I'm not alone.
The question of intent has informed National Public Radio's approach to covering Mr. Trump's many disputable claims: that he saw thousands of people in Jersey City cheering as the World Trade Center collapsed on Sept. 11, for example, or that the news media had made up a feud between him and the country's intelligence agencies, despite his own tweets likening those agencies to Nazi Germany.
Deductibles for individual coverage increased 63 percent on average, to $1,221 per year, from 2011 to 2016 for people who get health insurance through their employers, according to a report released last week by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust. Workers' contributions to premiums grew more slowly than in previous five-year periods but still jumped 23 percent, to $1,129 a year. By contrast, average incomes were up just 11 percent, which means many people are being forced to cut back elsewhere to pay for care. And some people are choosing to forgo or delay going to doctors and hospitals when they are sick.
Even members of her own family take advantage of a flawed system, in her view, by getting Medicaid. They don't work because they don't want to, and they get free health insurance. She said. What the heck? If my husband and I, who grew up with relatively middle-class backgrounds in wealthy states, know people that mooch off the system in our immediate families, imagine what it's like elsewhere.
JB: And you would bring them all home?
Here, in the collection of lightly edited emails that follow, are the very beginnings of those stories. 1:36 a.m., 4:14 a.m., 5:22 a.m. Time of third-shifters and insomniacs.
And so there, I think what has traditionally happened in this country, the way narrow majorities sometimes became durable majorities, the way that a consensus changed was that big policies were passed, and those big policies changed the landscape. The Democratic majority in the 20th century comes out of the New Deal. The Republican majority before that comes out of the Civil War, so that's an ugly example that I prefer we don't have to go back to bloodshed. But I think it is healthy for there to be actually a fair amount of policy churn and then people can decide where they want to stand. And in part, I take your point actually quite seriously, that there is a concern about narrow majorities creating legislation that is profound and far reaching. But at the same time, if they create legislation people don't like, they won't be a majority anymore, and they'll hopefully learn their lesson. Or if they create legislation people love, maybe they do become a durable majority. But at some point, there has to be, it seems to me, more of a feedback loop, in which the public gets something akin to what they ask for and then they can hold leaders accountable for that. As opposed to the public repeatedly doesn't get what they ask for, it's not clear who to hold accountable for that, and so then you're just in this miasma of which side seems to allied with you in some spiritual, fundamental, identitarian way.
But for now, they are trying to make the most of the few hours in which their Iowa fates are still, sort of, in their hands.
The reconciliation process allows Congress to advance certain spending and tax bills on a simple majority vote, freeing lawmakers from the 60-vote threshold most legislation must meet to be considered. Since 1980, the first year the process was put in place, 21 reconciliation bills have been enacted into law. Initially envisioned as a mechanism for lowering the deficit, it was used most recently by Republicans to push through President Donald J. Trump's tax overhaul and in a failed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Here are four important things to know about the process, and how Democrats might use it: Budget reconciliation allows Congress to change taxes or spending, usually with a simple majority vote.

Trump is back to sniffing constantly. I am curious about what it means. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
In the midst of a global pandemic, Washington Republicans continue their crusade against the health and safety of the American public, said Fabiola Rodriguez, a spokeswoman for the group, in the statement. By blocking uninsured Covid-19 patients from getting health care, Trump and his allies have decided to bankrupt American families. The American people deserve to know if House Republicans will stand up for the millions of Americans who face the challenge of being jobless and uninsured during the Covid-19 pandemic.
In an email, Starr described these developments as a genuine puzzle.
Donald Trump acaba de retirar a Estados Unidos del Acuerdo de París sin tener una buena razón. No digo que su decisión sea errónea. Lo que digo es que literalmente no nos dio ninguna justificación de peso que sustente esa decisión (bueno, sí mencionó algunas cifras sobre la supuesta pérdida de empleos, pero nadie cree que sepa, o le importe, de dónde sacó esos números). Solo fue algo que se le ocurrió.
In filing the brief, the administration abandoned an earlier position — that some portions of the law, including the provision allowing states to expand their Medicaid programs, should stand. The switch, which the administration disclosed in late March, has confounded many people in Washington, even within the Republican Party, who came to realize that health insurance and a commitment to protecting the A.C.A. were among the main issues that propelled Democrats to a majority in the House of Representatives last fall.

I'm not going to do this. I'm just not. I'm not here to take on Joe Biden and what Joe Biden has done. I'm glad to talk to you about why I'm running for president, but not to attack him.
When even a bipartisan agreement on immigration reform, focused on employment-based green cards, died on the Senate floor in September, it demonstrated just how difficult it has become to get any immigration reform legislation through Congress.
Details of the strategy are in flux, and there are disagreements among Republicans about how to proceed. In the House, the emerging plan, tightly coordinated between Mr. Ryan and Mr. Pence, is meant to give Mr. Trump's supporters the repeal of the health law that he repeatedly promised at rallies. It would also give Republicans time to try to assure consumers and the health industry that they will not instantly upend the health insurance market, and to pressure some Democrats to support a Republican alternative.
It focuses on whether the law's requirement that most Americans have health insurance is unconstitutional, but has much broader implications. The Justice Department made a highly unusual decision this summer: though it disagreed with the plaintiffs that the entire law should be struck down, it decided not to defend the individual mandate or several other central provisions, including protections for people with pre-existing conditions. That prompted a coalition of 16 states and the District of Columbia, led by California, to intervene to defend the law, saying that to pause it or invalidate key components would threaten the health care of millions of people.
Now senators are searching for changes to make the bill more politically palatable. But the notion of making those changes today and then speeding immediately to a vote is madness. There would be no time for experts to consider the consequences — to discover the sort of problems and unintended effects that last-minute changes are bound to create. By the time they did, the Senate would have passed it.
But a few questions caught her off guard: how to safeguard American nuclear weapons in Turkey; how to respond if China cracked down violently on protesters in Hong Kong; and what she was likely to fail at as president.
Kathleen Kingsbury: So we don't have very much time together. We all know your résumé and your bio, and many of us have met you in the past, so you don't mind if we just jump right into questions?
The showdown is on the extreme end of tensions playing out this election year in a number of Republican-controlled states that have resisted expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Following Maine's lead, advocacy groups in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah have gathered enough signatures to get Medicaid expansion measures on their state ballots this November, although Nebraska's have yet to be certified. Already, two prominent Republicans there, a state senator and former state senator, havechallenged the effort in court.
President Biden talks with China's leader for the first time since the election. In the conversation with Xi Jinping, Mr. Biden raised issues like trade, human rights abuses and climate change. They agreed to search for common ground, but each held firm on contentious issues like the status of Hong Kong.
Hm. So despite the risks of holding an in-person primary in the middle of a pandemic, despite the fact that many states are postponing these primaries, the Republican and Democratic officials in Wisconsin say that this is necessary for the functioning of their government?
And so it also does something weird, right, which is mechanisms. You might have two ways you could do the same thing. So you could potentially raise people's incomes by passing a direct wage subsidy, like the Earned Income Tax Credit the government pays out to them, or you could do it by raising the minimum wage.
The proposed rules signal the Trump administration's urgency in trying to keep other insurers from fleeing the market after Humana's departure. The company said on Tuesday that it was losing money by insuring too many sick people without enough healthy ones enrolling. Humana had already scaled back its participation to 11 states this year, from 19 in 2016.
He's misjudging Putin. I don't think he was prepared as well as he should have been.
Corbin Trent, a spokesman for Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's campaign, declined to respond to Mr. Shapiro. She said her piece and put it out there, and that's all we have to say, he said from Hawaii, where Ms. Ocasio-Cortez is campaigning for a fellow democratic socialist and congressional candidate, Kaniela Ing.
The White House said President Trump was scrapping health insurance subsidies, and he signed a separate order allowing the sale of cheaper polices with fewer benefits.
If he fails, well, I'm sorry to remind you that most Irish poetry is rooted in despair, in a country whose currency for centuries was misery. Still, in Ireland, poets have moved the masses to uprisings and greatness — most notably, the Easter 1916 rebellion that eventually helped lead to a free Ireland.
Critics of the wealth tax point out that only four European countries now have one, down from 12 in 1990. In France, the wealth tax triggered an exodus of the ultrarich and didn't raise as much revenue as anticipated.

No, It's fine. So I actually start with the big vision. You know, if you gave me a chance, I'd do a constitutional amendment to protect the right of every American citizen to vote and to make sure that vote gets counted so you put real federal muscle behind it. I also talk about that for a specific reason, because a lot of Americans are shocked to know that that's not already in the Constitution and that there is no federal muscle behind that.
Oh, I'm not going to do names.
My fellow Americans, we face a national emergency. Never before have we had a president so utterly lacking in personal integrity, so able to lie and abuse his powers with such impunity and so blindly backed by an amoral party, an unscrupulous attorney general and a media-fund-raising juggernaut. It is an engine of raw power that will cram anything the president says or does right down your throat.
It is bigger than any offered under the Affordable Care Act — subsidies some Republicans loathe as handouts — and costs the federal government $250 billion in lost tax revenue every year.
And I don't think that's the right model.
Times columnist David Brooks noted in The Road to Character that Ms. Perkins discovered her calling to service and organizing after witnessing the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist fire. The analogy to something like the student loan debt crisis or child care, of course, isn't perfect — the debt crisis, for instance, has been slow burning as tuition rates have risen far above the inflation rate since the 1970s.
And then finally, what's the last book you read that actually changed your mind about anything?
Senator Warren has released one of the most robust housing plans in the 2020 field, including the creation of a Tenant Protection Bureau modeled after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The sky-high rates of homelessness across the country was a major focus of Times reporting last year — read it here.
I'll try this one last time, although I know I'm not going to fully convince you on this. But I agree with you that we need a lot of experimentation, but it seems that we are locked in a system that cannot experiment. Whether you liked all of HR1 or not, and I can understand why you might not, the truth is, with the filibuster, none of it's going to pass because you can't put it in budget reconciliation. And one thing that I think is a really, really big problem in the system, we talked earlier about how a lot of the energy in politics has moved off of straightforward economics issues to things that get grouped into social issues, I would also say to things that should be understood is democracy issues, practically on the Democratic side, a lot of energy around voting rights issues. As you know, but I'll say for those in the audience who don't, the filibuster imposes a 60-vote requirement on almost everything, but there is a pathway called budget reconciliation, which can only be used a couple of times during a presidency and has a lot of very weird strictures on it. But one of them is you can get some things in there and protect it from the filibuster, as long as it is primarily related to spending and taxing, as long as it is primarily budgetary.
But if the idea's straightforwardness is its great economic advantage, it has also proved to be its political flaw. Energy, for utilities and transportation, is a major cost of living. And across the industrialized world, the middle class and the poor have been struggling with slow income growth. As Nordhaus acknowledged in his speech, curbing dirty energy by raising its price may be good for nature, but it's not actually all that attractive to voters to reduce their income.
It doesn't want to be a place where violent insurrections are planned. Where do you come down on that?
But I would argue that the best option we have on the table is to seize the moment that we have right now to try to fix some of these structural problems that you're talking about. And I do think things like DC statehood and Puerto Rico statehood, if Puerto Rico wants it, would help rebalance the Senate's tilt towards rural states. That would be very significant and help create a more level playing field. Passing a John Lewis Voting Rights Act would take away some of the enormous advantage the Republicans are staked to in every single election. If we don't pass any of those things, Republicans are going to still hold all of the cards that you described. And then they're going to have the option to get rid of the filibuster whenever they want to. So we have to seize the moment. In my book, I talk about an effort to get rid of the electoral college in 1970, which might sound fantastical now, but was actually very realistic at the time and came very close to happening. The reason for it was that both parties wanted to get rid of it. The 1968 election was weird. George Wallace almost denied Nixon an electoral vote majority. So both the Republicans and the Democrats had an incentive to get rid of the electoral college. They came extremely close to doing it.
BS: Is it my imagination or are we hearing almost nothing about voter disenfranchisement in this campaign, when in fact we saw disenfranchisement actually tipped races in Florida and Georgia? And post-Obama, all kinds of disenfranchisement methods came online.
JD: Do you think it's better, then, that the Senate finish a trial as early as possible next year?
I think you should talk about the language and recognize the way that the language may not be inclusive for everyone. I mean, I never until recently made it a practice to ask people I interview, people I would mention in articles, about their gender and their pronouns. I feel like having that conversation is a good way to start. One of the ways we can talk about this is not as a replacement for traditional genders but as an addition. Offering they as a pronoun for you in addition to he or she, I think, is a kind of a way to avoid some of these problems. So most places, like airports and others, that have all-gender restrooms also have men and women restrooms. And that would be a relatively easy way to both offer it as an option and include it in the language without adding to this fear that were erasing people's identities.
KK: Do you feel comfortable with there still being nuclear weapons in Turkey?
Mara Gay: Actually, that's a perfect point for me to just ask you a question that's related. My family is from Michigan, and U.A.W. workers. One of the last things that they really love, many of them, is their health care. So I guess my question is, is both a practical one and a political one, which is why not try and expand health care access without actually taking away programs that people already like? Is there a way to do that? Is there even a way to get to what you're talking about without talking about it in such dogmatic political terms, and how do you — this is I guess the most important part of the question, I think, is how do you make the pitch to a U.A.W. worker that what you can offer is actually better than what they already have?
— despite fears that it could lead to greater levels of infection.
BS: But I don't really hear the candidates talking about that. Why is that?
With anxiety about the economy bubbling up on Wall Street and at campaign rallies around the country, the government reported on Friday that employers added 242,000 workers in February, a hefty increase that highlighted the labor market's steady gains.
But now McCain is gone, and with him, as far as we can tell, the only Republican in Congress with anything resembling a spine. As a result, if Republicans hold Congress in November, they will indeed repeal Obamacare. That's not a guess: It's an explicit promise, made by Vice President Mike Pence last week.
After weeks of criticizing Bernie Sanders's plan for a single-payer Medicare for all health care system as budget busting and unrealistic, Hillary Clinton over the past few days has a new message for voters: Universal health care was her idea first.
The judges have been good. The tax cuts, deregulation, all has worked. He's rebuilt the military.

I like that distinction between critical and alternative institutions. I think that leads to this question of underrepresentation and where it comes from. So you were saying that there is a certain amount of reaction, as the right feels more of these institutions are captured by the left. And as somebody more on the left, one of the things that seems clear to me is that part of what is happening is that the right is losing some of these institutions as it becomes more right. If the past four years had been Mitt Romney's second term, I think there is a lot of corporate America that would have been very happy to be allied with Mitt Romney. It was Donald Trump they didn't like and who pushed them to make decisions and make statements and draw lines that they wouldn't otherwise have wanted to draw. I actually see this in the media, too. I don't there's any doubt that the media became more explicitly oppositional to the Donald-Trump-led Republican Party. But the Donald-Trump-led Republican Party, and specifically Donald Trump, pushed a lot of media organizations to places they did not want to go and were very uncomfortable going. I remember all of the debates among newspapers about when do you call something that the president keeps saying and is false a lie. When do you call something that is racist, racist? Because people didn't want to do that, but there was a real heightening of the contradictions.
The second change is political. A decade ago, there was reason to think that carbon pricing could be bipartisan. It borrows from the best traditions of liberalism and conservatism by using the government to address a failure of the private market while still relying on that market. President George H.W. Bush's administration used a pricing scheme to solve the problem of acid rain. John McCain favored such a carbon scheme.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned House Republican leaders on Thursday after they named Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to serve on the Education and Labor Committee. Ms. Greene supported the QAnon movement and other conspiracies. Credit Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday rebuked House Republican leaders for naming Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to serve on the Education and Labor Committee, despite Ms. Greene's previous false claims that deadly school shootings in Parkland, Fla., and Newtown, Conn., were staged. Ms. Greene, a first-term congresswoman from Georgia with a history of supporting the pro-Trump QAnon movement, wrote on Facebook in 2018 that she agreed with one of her followers that the Parkland massacre that killed 17 students was a false flag event, a term used by conspiracy theorists to describe an act committed by one group — usually the government — for which another group is blamed. In a video posted on YouTube in 2020 by her campaign, Ms. Greene followed and harassed David Hogg, a Parkland survivor who was visiting Capitol Hill to lobby for gun safety measures. In the video, Ms. Greene demanded that he explain why he was using kids to advance his cause, shouted that she was licensed to carry a firearm, and called him a coward. Republican leaders announced this week that Ms. Greene would serve on the House's education panel.
This was a missed opportunity. We reinforced a narrative that's bad for us as a nation. It came across weak.

The administration set the amount to be contributed by each insurance company, but the total collections fell short of the amounts specified in the law. So the administration allocated almost all the money to insurers, resulting in the deposit of no amounts in the Treasury, the accountability office said.

The Congressional Budget Office recently said that around 24 million fewer Americans would have health insurance in 2026 under the Republican repeal plan than if the current law stayed in place.
From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today:
And right out of the gates, Donald Trump insults John McCain.
And you had an African-American president who was seen as an outsider by a lot of older white Americans. And into that mix stepped Trump with this mix of superficial economic populism, and birtherism, and bigotry. Was it inevitable that Trump was going to be the Republican nominee? I don't think, in hindsight, it actually was. Is it inevitable that the party has to be Trumpified permanently? I don't think it is. I mean, I think the failure of Republican politicians right now is their failure to say, what can we offer to our voters instead of America, love it or leave it? That as much as the failure to condemn Trump more forcefully is the problem for the Republican Party going forward. It has to figure out what it makes of the Trumpist turn.
Yes. I do think that the Europeans need to bear a significant share of the cost of defense of Europe. I don't think that hectoring or embarrassing them is a way to get there. I think we get there by talking about the ways that work best for them on the ground, but I do think it's important. It's an important partnership, and it should be a partnership.
This framing is crucial. When voters think about clean energy rather than climate change, some of the usual partisan patterns break down. Even many Republican voters support clean energy. In Michigan, the recently departed Republican governor, Rick Snyder, helped negotiate a 2016 deal that created performance standards for utilities. After signing the bill, he claimed it would reduce energy costs.
The importance of a grass-roots movement is there is one thing that beats fake news, and actually the data showed this, and that's somebody you know. It's somebody who actually talks to you. It's somebody who does the face to face. It's somebody who reaches out. It's somebody who knocks on your door. It's your neighbor. It's the person who talks to you in line at the grocery store. That's part of it. It's why you have to build — when I did inside/outside, it's also about the importance of building grass roots, building it from the ground up. It's why I made the decisions I made in running for president right from the beginning, which we can talk about in a minute. But for me, that's at the heart of it, and then there's a second part. I'll push first to get the anti-corruption bill through. I'll push to deliver on a meaningful anti-corruption deal. I think you can get a lot of people on board for that, Democrats and Republicans to push for it. I dare you to vote against it, right? That is a fight I will have, and it will be a fight.
When told that former Vice President Biden criticized her health care plans, Senator Warren answered with a critique of moderate Democrats: Democrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies. She also suggested Mr. Biden is running in the wrong primary.
He also dismissed questions about the wisdom of Mr. Trump's plan to end financial aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. Complaining about the troubled nations' failure to stop their people from fleeing north, Mr. Mulvaney brushed off administration experts who have cautioned that cutting aid would further destabilize the countries, likely worsening the migrant crisis.
And while we debate the ideal health system, we mustn't forget that Trump and his allies are as determined as ever to undo the progress we've made.
Consistent with whatever is revealed. You can't do speed independently of facts, right? But if that's what we've got and it's enough information for a charge of impeachment, then I think they can go forward and I think they should.
The budget's approach to health care is particularly striking given the administration's actions in court. The White House has joined a lawsuit brought by a group of Republican states that would seek to invalidate all of the Affordable Care Act. The Supreme Court is deciding whether it will take up that case or allow the lower courts to continue reviewing it. The president has repeatedly promised to release a health care plan that could be deployed if he wins in court, but has yet to do so.
Five. Five percent. We are widening racial wealth gaps in this country right now. Opportunity is shrinking for our children, and people see this. It's 12 years later. It's 20 years later from a whole set of promises that this was going to get better, and it hasn't gotten better, but people watch at the same moment. They don't look around and see a country that's getting poor. Look out your window, right? They don't look around and say, God, America's really on a downslide. They look out and they say, America is doing great. G.D.P. keeps going up. The stock market keeps going up, unemployment is down, but my family is stretched to the breaking point. My debt load is bigger than ever, and I look over the edge and see where my children are headed. I don't even see my children able to replicate what I have. I don't see them able to buy my house. I don't see them having even the job stability I had. I see them carrying more debt at 19 than I carried at 35.
March 3, 2020, 11:17 p.m. ET March 3, 2020, 11:17 p.m. ET Biden pulls off a big upset in Massachusetts. Joseph R. Biden Jr. pulled out a stunning victory in Massachusetts, an outcome that did not even seem within the realm of possibility this morning, when it seemed clear that it was a two-way race there between Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. With 91 delegates to award, Massachusetts was not the biggest prize tonight, but for Mr. Biden, it may have been the biggest upset: one of the most liberal states in the country, the home of one of his opponents and next door to the home of another. For Mr. Sanders, it was a big disappointment: Mr. Biden was expected to do well in the South, but New England was supposed to be the progressive wing's territory. But it was nothing short of devastating for Ms. Warren, who had been counting on a win in Massachusetts, at the very least, to show that her candidacy was still viable. While she is above the 15 percent viability threshold to earn some delegates, she is in serious danger of finishing third. Read more
PORTLAND, Me. — Brandy Staples, a 39-year-old breast cancer survivor, had expected to become eligible for Medicaid coverage this month after Maine voters approved an expansion of the program last fall. Instead, she found herself in a courtroom here on Wednesday, watching the latest chapter unfold in a rancorous, drawn-out battle over whether she and thousands of other poor people in the state will get free government insurance after all.
But why has Trump turned out to be such a conventional Republican? My sense is that he doesn't really care about policy, aside from protectionism, which I'll get to in a minute. And he certainly doesn't feel any empathy for less fortunate Americans, or actually anyone. So he was happy to make what amounts to an implicit deal with the Republican establishment: You get to implement your usual policy agenda, and I get a free pass on my corruption and abuse of power.
Because while most people are playing nice right now managing this virus, the wreckage, pain and anger it will leave behind will require megadoses of solidarity and healing from the top.

The filing was made in a case challenging the law brought by Ken Paxton, the attorney general of Texas, and 17 other Republican-led states. In December, a federal judge from the Northern District of Texas, Reed O'Connor, ruled that the law was unconstitutional.
In North Dakota, congressman Kevin Cramer heard from a woman with a disabled child. She asked him not to repeal Obamacare, with her family facing bankruptcy. This is what $3.5 million looks like, and she's two years old.
So it is with budget policy. Get this: Since 1977, the three presidential administrations that have overseen the deficit increases are the three Republican ones. President Trump's tax cut is virtually assured to make him the fourth of four. And the three administrations that have overseen deficit reductions are the three Democratic ones, including a small decline under Barack Obama. If you want to know whether a post-1976 president increased or reduced the deficit, the only thing you need to know is his party.
In town for Mr. Trump's inauguration, nine governors — some who had expanded Medicaid under the law and some who had refused — presented a united message: The Obama administration was too rigid in prescribing standards for Medicaid and private insurance coverage, and states need more power to set their own policies.

KK: Well, the House Democrats are fighting Mitch McConnell. [WARREN APPEARS UNIMPRESSED]
I think Robert Bork narrowed the standards we use for antitrust and for breaking up big companies. Market dominance by itself, when you totally dominate a market, that is anti-competitive. Then the platforms — this new — you want to go to the new part. The platforms themselves create a new kind of problem that we haven't seen. We can only do this by analogy, which is what we always do in law, but think of it this way. There's Amazon that owns the marketplace where people go and buy toasters and sell toasters, but they also are scraping bits of information off every one of those purchases. When they decide that your toaster business is getting very profitable, and they might like to crowd in on that, they take all that information they took from you without your consent and they go into the 2.0 version of your toaster business and move you back to page seven on the search.
I have a plan to build about 3.2 million new housing units across this country to make money available for changing zoning and working together across municipal boundaries on joint projects that increase density and trying to use the federal government as a partner to move forward in bringing down the cost overall for housing.
A spokesman said that Mr. McCarthy planned to have a conversation with her about them.
There was a little girl in California who was a part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me. So I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats.
In an interview, James Taylor, who wrote the Heartland critique, drew a direct line between problems he saw in the modeling of Covid-19 deaths and climate science, arguing that in both instances we don't have perfect information with which to make projections. The coronavirus models' failure to make accurate predictions to this point should be instructive when we are told to blindly accept certain climate models, he said.
Removing those provisions will result in renewed uncertainty in the individual market, create a patchwork of requirements in the states, cause rates to go even higher for older Americans and sicker patients, and make it challenging to introduce products and rates for 2019, said Matt Eyles, the president and chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers.
BA: What is the right stance?
Times reporting from Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley found that Senator Warren's wealth tax plan has broad support, including from 77 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of Republicans, with the exception of one demographic: Republican men with college degrees.
We can't afford to both treat his back issues and pay for insurance, she said one morning. She was crying, and it was time to go to work.
But anyway, let's talk about what I said about Romney. (By the way, I don't think I referred to him as a charlatan — I used that word to refer to supply-side economists, because that's what Greg Mankiw, who was advising his campaign, called them.) Here's a key passage:
Ronald Reagan denounced Medicare, back in 1961, as socialized medicine. If Medicare wasn't blocked, he said, one of these days we are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free. Before Medicare, only 54 percent of Americans 65 and over had hospital coverage; three years after its passage, 96 percent of older Americans did. Eighty percent to 90 percent of recipients really like Medicare — and these older Americans are the most conservative voters in the country.
Let's back up. There are, broadly speaking, two ways a country can try to achieve universal health insurance. One is single-payer: The government simply pays the bills. The other retains a role for private insurance but relies on a combination of regulations and subsidies to ensure that everyone gets covered.
Be still, my heart, but I see the latter. Some of the greatest advances in American history — liberation of slaves, Social Security, robust clean air and water mandates — were birthed by disaster.
Mr. Trump appeared to be unclear both about the timing of already scheduled votes in Congress and about the difficulty of his demand — a repeal vote probably some time next week and a replacement very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter.
Mr. Trump released his short list of potential Supreme Court nominees in May 2016. In September 2016, he released a second list with several more women and people of color, following criticisms of the white and male bias in his first.
That bill would also have eliminated federal insurance subsidies, ended federal spending for the expansion of Medicaid, and barred federal payments to Planned Parenthood clinics.
Well, I would take the combat troops out of there now. I see no immediate reason we'd send combat troops into the region, but I'd get the combat troops that are there now out.
Mr. Trump said Mr. Mueller was running an office rife with conflicts of interest and warned investigators against delving into matters too far afield from Russia. Mr. Trump never said he would order the Justice Department to fire Mr. Mueller, nor would he outline circumstances under which he might do so. But he left open the possibility as he expressed deep grievance over an investigation that has taken a political toll in the six months since he took office.
Nick Fox: What did you think of the standards in the Trans-Pacific deal?
Yeah, and this is one of the great innovations that originated with John Calhoun, the senator from South Carolina and sort of the spiritual godfather of the Confederacy. People had been experimenting with obstruction before Calhoun came along. And there's sort of a very robust discussion among historians about which exactly was the first filibuster. But what Calhoun did that makes him really the father of the modern filibuster, is that he fused obstruction with this lofty defense of minority rights and an invented idea of the minority's right to unlimited debate in the Senate. And just to level set on this, the framers did not intend the minority to have the right to unlimited debate in the Senate. They were very clear about this. I'm not an originalist, but I think it's important to establish this because this is where the conversation often goes. They implemented many rules and procedures that would allow a majority to end debate when it had become obstructionist and ceased to be about persuasion and just about blocking things. One of the major rules got taken off the rule books by mistake in 1806. No one noticed for decades, and then Calhoun in the 1830s realized that taking away this ability to end debate created the potential for unlimited debate. And so he started to say that this was what the Senate is about. And it's about the minority's ability to always speak as long as they wanted.
Yet there is at least one big area in which the Roberts court has continued to lean strongly right: business regulation.
What there was instead was something you can expect to hear a lot of between now and November 2020: If you like this economy, you should like me, too.
Senator Warren visited Beijing in 2018, as Mr. Trump was waging a tariff war on China. She criticized his chaotic foreign policy, while arguing that America cannot support an economic system more integrated with China's while it fails to respect basic human rights.
Here it may be that John Roberts, Kennedy's likely successor as our First Archon, is better suited than his predecessor to the imperial task. We know that Roberts is more temperamentally cautious than Kennedy, more interested in limited rulings than in sweeping ones. We also know that he's both more friendly to religious conservatism (witness his Obergefell vote) and more willing to let social-democratic policymaking stand (witness his vote to save Obamacare).
Obamacare has shown other signs of hardiness. This year, the Trump administration slashed the program's advertising budget by 90 percent, and withdrew key subsidies from insurance companies, leading to premium increases for some customers. But every market had at least one insurer that continued to offer plans on the Obamacare marketplaces, and sign-ups dipped only slightly.
KK: Yes, and even more practically, is it enough to get anything passed in Mitch McConnell's Senate?
Bernie Sanders endorsed you. How do you compare your results with his throughout the state? He ran far behind you. What did you do that the progressive on the national ticket did not?
Wait. No. Is that true? In what sense?
It still makes major changes to health care programs, including several that would tend to lower federal spending on Medicaid, by reducing the share of medical bills the federal government will pay for the Obamacare expansion population and imposing new requirements on beneficiaries who wish to enroll. All together, it proposed combined cuts to spending in Medicaid and Affordable Care Act subsidies that equal a trillion dollars — cuts that would mean substantial program changes.
I will also fight to knock back the influence of money, because I think every time we do that, that's what that anti-corruption bill is about. It's about calling out the big drug companies. It's about calling out the big insurance companies and just disrupting the fabulous patterns they have right now to get their way in Washington. In the first 100 days, I'll go to Congress and try to get what we can get on 50 votes. What we can get on 50 votes is to offer Medicare to everybody who's 50 or older.
KK: And then I think Brent is going to close us out.
It was a scene that underscored a challenge facing the U.S. economy and one that may be the driving factor behind greater inequality: We're not only losing jobs to overseas competition, we're losing them to technology. Obama noted the robots, too. We just saw here those robots were pretty impressive, but also pointed to the direction the economy is going, he said.
A 2017 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that generic competition has weakened in recent decades, leading to higher prices for generics. EpiPen and insulin prices, in particular, have skyrocketed. Senator Warren's Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would authorize the government to manufacture active ingredients for medications or contract outside entities to manufacture generic drugs and lower prices. But Senator McConnell has railed against socialist price controls in the health care system.
But will any of these constituencies vote for Donald Trump? For Trump the rank misogynist, Trump the KKK-flirter, Trump the deport-the-Mexican-rapists candidate? If you read seven of Trump's positions to the median Hispanic voter, they might agree with five or six of them … but Trump's favorability/unfavorability ratings with Hispanics are 12/77. If you go back to last August, before the campaign began, Trump had a 20 percent favorable rating with African-Americans; by Republican standards that's not terrible. Six months of race-baiting later, he's winning 5 percent of the black vote against Hillary Clinton. And women … well, he's losing women, let's put it that way, on a scale that no Republican nominee ever has before.
Senator Warren published an op-ed in The Washington Post in 2015 attacking the investor-state dispute settlement clause in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which she argued would tilt the playing field in the United States further in favor of big multinational corporations.
The Republican plan does not repeal the expansion but would reduce funding for enrollees who gained access to Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
On Capitol Hill, conservatives declared that they are not about to accept a health law replacement that remotely resembles the Affordable Care Act. And the I.R.S. adopted a policy for the coming tax season that could weaken the requirement for people to have insurance. The tax agency said it was reversing one aspect of an Obama administration plan after Mr. Trump, on his first day in office, issued an executive order instructing agencies to reduce burdens imposed by compliance with the Affordable Care Act wherever legally possible.
And I came here to talk with you all about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And the very short version of this story is I went around Washington talking to people about how, do not in this crisis, simply outlaw the practices that were bad, that were used on the mortgages, that are used on credit cards, because they'll be like fence posts on the prairie with nothing strong in between. And it'll take the banks and Wall Street about three minutes to figure out how to run around them by redescribing their product or slightly reinventing their product. I think you've got to have an agency that when Wall Street moves, the agency can move. That's how financial crises — it's the only way we're going to make this work.
Will my yawning internal pit of desire ever be full? Is there any amount of cash that's enough to fully satiate this ravenous beast? Will Netflix and Spotify and HBO ever stop providing me with unlimited access to hours upon hours of entertainment to distract from the ennui that awaits me in real life? How many lipsticks is too many?
He also criticized Ms. Ocasio-Cortez's analogy of catcalling, labeling it an insane accusation.
Yeah, democratic socialism. It's a case for a certain kind of welfare state. And it's a very smart book and one that every conservative should contend with and should think through.
I said there were going to be two parts to this. So I've done part one about the inside/outside theory of change, but the second part, that's why we've got to do this through grass roots movement. We cannot do this through television commercials. If winning the presidency, and I'll speak only to the Democratic side, is about who comes in, and oh, let's see, drops $37 million in one week on TV ads, and that's what it takes to win a Democratic primary, then we have a democracy that's just our TV ads versus their TV ads, and at that point, they're fake news. They claim ours is fake news, right? Everybody just gets farther and farther and farther into their corners.
Polls suggest that the public considers health care the most important issue in the midterm elections. This immediately raises the question: Do voters understand what's at stake? In particular, do they realize that if Republicans hold Congress, they will strip away protections for the 52 million Americans — more than a quarter of nonelderly adults — who have pre-existing conditions that, before passage of the Affordable Care Act, could have led insurers to deny them coverage?
That sure gets a lot done.
So let me do the pitch, because I'll tell you exactly what the pitch is. That is the Affordable Care Act already requires employers to provide health care for their workers if they have more than 50 workers. I propose we just keep that in place, and that will yield about $9 trillion over the next 10 years. That's what they pay.
Then, J.F.K. made a big move to try to expand government health insurance, at least for the elderly.
Each of the Orange County congressional districts also award five delegates, a similar opportunity for Mr. Bloomberg to build his potential haul.
I asked Lindsey Graham how he was getting along without John McCain.
NF: Why would you think, why is that ——
Farhad, let's end here with some advice from you. I was talking about your column with my 15-year-old. And I was expressing some skepticism. I'm one of those grammarian prissies who feels anxious about the difference between the singular and the plural. And my 15-year-old said to me, yeah, but, Dad, language changes. And so for people who were intrigued by the argument that you're making, how would you encourage them to make the language they use in everyday life a little bit less gendered?
So the way I see this is I think the old left-right division, yeah, there's a lot of that. But I think there's a very different division in America, and that is an America that's working for a thinner and thinner slice at the top and not working for much of anyone else. And there are a lot of Democrats, a lot of independents and a lot of Republicans who see that.
Limits on the amount of care covered
What this says to me is that if Republicans manage to hold on to Congress, they will make another all-out push to destroy the act — because they'll know that it's probably their last chance. Indeed, if they don't kill Obamacare soon, the next step will probably be an enhanced program that lets Americans of all ages buy into Medicare.
But perhaps it made those who tore apart families, who whipped insubordinates until they passed out, who sold children and cotton bales as similar commodities feel better to know that the monstrous crime of their daily enterprise could be a blessed act.
What's your favorite book on the Senate?
O.K. But he also, by doing so, he elevated these four members of Congress to really be symbols of the Democratic Party. And he kept the discussion to be about race. And what it reminded me of was this quote from Steve Bannon where Steve Bannon says, and I'm going to read it, The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got them. I want them to talk about racism every day. So it sounds like you both disagree with that.
Senator Warren's Medicare for all would require $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over the next 10 years. She has promised the money won't come from raising taxes on the middle class and maintains that between defense cuts and a wealth tax, the costs would be covered. But of course, that would require Senate approval — and Senator McConnell has sworn it won't happen as long as I'm majority leader.
But within the Trump team, the views of Representative Mick Mulvaney, Republican of South Carolina, his little-known choice to lead the important Office of Management and Budget, rank as among the most reactionary.
And then finally, what's the last book you read that actually changed your mind about anything?
I think having people here who are working under the table is both bad for American workers and bad for the American economy. One of the reasons I propose to create a pathway to citizenship for everyone who's here to stay, a pathway that is fair and achievable, is to stop the problem of two-tier hiring: those who are hired in the legal system and then those who are hired outside the legal system. People who are undocumented have no protection and are frequently subject to wage theft, to unsafe working conditions, and that's not good for anyone. It's not good for American workers. It's not good for the American economy.
Many of the people we see are destitute, Ms. Carmichael said. But they fall into the gap, and there is little we can do to help them.
The Democratic setup is more evenhanded than the Republican debates in 2015, when lower-ranking contenders were relegated to what was unkindly known as the kids' table. Afterward, many of them vanished from view forever. However, Rick Santorum is still around, now busy promoting the idea of a Catholic cryptocurrency. And Rick Perry is one of the few early Trump cabinet members who has not had to resign to spend more time with his family.
This was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. –Trump, denying that he talked about sexual assault, and minimizing it — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
Tomorrow's my birthday, so this is like a little birthday special.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent a letter to congressional leaders on Thursday notifying them that he would not defend the constitutionality of the individual mandate or the requirement for insurers to sell insurance to all applicants at standard rates — the guaranteed issue and community rating provisions.
BA: Would you reduce existing access in order to achieve that goal?
I was pissed at everybody on the other side.
If Facebook has way too much power.
A Washington Post tally of President Obama's campaign promises found that he kept 11 promises (expand hate crime statutes, insure more Americans, establish a credit-card Bill of Rights), compromised on 12 (end the war in Iraq in 16 months, increase the earned-income tax credit) and failed on 17 (raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation, create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants).
And I think right now, the push should be not to expand because that's the issue that's on the table.
March was always going to be one of the most consequential months of the presidential election. By the time we get to the middle of March, though —
The closest comparison may be the New York mayoral race in 2001, when the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks loomed over the city's general election. In presidential politics, the Vietnam War, assassinations and civil rights struggles shaped the 1968 campaign and seemed to reveal a country coming apart.
No longer will older Americans be denied the healing miracle of modern medicine.
Mr. Trump's speech on Tuesday was delivered in Monessen, Pa., the sort of place that typifies the overlooked Democratic resilience among white working-class voters, and that Mr. Trump needs in November. The area was once one of the most reliably Democratic parts of the country, and even today, Democrats still fare fairly well among white working-class voters. President Obama won Monessen by a 66-33 percent margin, and the town is at the tip of a region along the Monongahela River where Mr. Obama won among white working-class voters.
In his struggle to overcome his stutter, Biden famously recited the poems of William Butler Yeats in front of a mirror. He has used Heaney's aspirational lines again and again — in a viral campaign video, and his acceptance speech last summer at the Democratic National Convention, and at a 2013 meeting on the U.S.-Korea relationship in Seoul.

JD: Do you think it's better, then, that the Senate finish a trial as early as possible next year?
Do you remember the Bush boom? Probably not. Anyway, the administration of George W. Bush began its tenure with a recession, followed by an extended jobless recovery. By the summer of 2003, however, the economy began adding jobs again. The pace of job creation wasn't anything special by historical standards, but conservatives insisted that the job gains after that trough represented a huge triumph, a vindication of the Bush tax cuts.
Of course once again, the problem is at the top, where the president is claiming that 99 percent of coronavirus cases are totally harmless. Life with Trump keeps reminding me of that scene in Peter Pan where Tinker Bell is dying and the audience revives her by clapping to prove they all believe in fairies. Worried about a pandemic? Just keep saying everything's fine and magic will happen.
Tariffs are one of the tools. Economic agreements across countries, that many countries join together, and say, we're not going to let anyone import if they're using prison labor, for example, or if they're dumping dangerous chemicals into the water. There are lots of ways to do this, but we can't simply think of this as a tariff, no tariff protectionism barrier. It's not. It's about regulations. Look at the dang NAFTA 2.0, look at what we were negotiating for T.T.I.P. T.T.I.P. was about financial regulations, not about goods that were moving, in a sense, the old way that people think about, that you put a bunch of stuff on a barge and you ship it across the Atlantic Ocean. And we just need to tune into the fact we know what our advantage is and we need to use it, not to try to lock others out, but to try to encourage others to come in.
NF: How do you deal with the fact that while people might want big change, they're also afraid of it?
As a result, our analyses tell us about average economic growth and the middle of the distribution — but as our economy grows more and more unequal, that analysis fails to capture the experience of the many people who are left behind, particularly people of color. Ms. Rouse is a labor economist whose work includes a longtime focus on education and discrimination. If confirmed, she would be the first Black economist ever to chair the council. She previously served as a council member under former President Barack Obama. Her testimony comes at a precarious moment in the economic recovery from the pandemic and she is likely to face questions about the $1.9 trillion stimulus package that Mr. Biden has proposed to help get the virus under control and aid struggling families and workers. Data released on Thursday morning showed that the economic recovery stumbled but didn't collapse at the end of last year and that it could have a strong rebound in 2021 once the virus is arrested. Gross domestic product rose 1 percent in the final three months of 2020, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Republicans have already expressed skepticism about whether the economy needs a $1.9 trillion jolt given the $900 billion stimulus package that Congress passed in December. But with millions still out of work and the virus not yet under control, many economists say workers and businesses will need more help to make it through.
KK: But do you know of any specific evidence that immigrants drive down wages?
Our ultimate aim must be a comprehensive insurance system to protect all our people equally against insecurity and ill health.
On a Saturday afternoon in early December, inside a soaring auditorium on the campus of Stockholm University, William Nordhaus gave the crowning lecture of his half-century career as an economist. The occasion was his acceptance of the Nobel Prize in economics, which Nordhaus, a trim, soft-spoken Yale professor, had been jointly awarded. The title of the lecture was Climate Change: The Ultimate Challenge for Economics.
Yeah, I can imagine. Nobody ever wants to answer this probably. To try this, you've got to have an optimism bias. And I do. I know that. It's an optimism bias that keeps me working 14 hours a day. It's an optimism bias that pulls you in more and more people to try to talk about it.
I have a plan to build about 3.2 million new housing units across this country to make money available for changing zoning and working together across municipal boundaries on joint projects that increase density and trying to use the federal government as a partner to move forward in bringing down the cost overall for housing.
So it's possible to imagine that at least some in the party will try to resolve, or at least start acknowledging, some of these questions.
The move was largely symbolic and will not end the case, which was brought by Republican state officials. When it was argued in November, a majority of the justices appeared inclined to uphold the bulk of the sprawling law, which was President Barack Obama's defining domestic legacy.

Well, I'm not sure I accept the premise of the question, that they actually tried what I was talking about. Look, our No. 1 leverage is everybody wants the American consumer. They want access to the American consumer. They want to be able to sell us all of their stuff because the American consumer is not only the engine of about 70 percent of our economy; it's a worldwide engine. So I think it's perfectly reasonable to say, if you want to be able to trade with United States on the best possible terms, then everybody needs to raise their standards just a little. Who wants to do that?
I will also fight to knock back the influence of money, because I think every time we do that, that's what that anti-corruption bill is about. It's about calling out the big drug companies.

CW: Sure. And they have too much power, not just in an economy, they have too much power in a democracy, and they keep consolidating and expanding — are you worried about individual employees there? You know, Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel.
CW: That's just a process of fact-checking and you want that to be independent, because then there's the issue of Facebook getting involved.
At a time of high drug prices and its heaviest political expenditures in years, the pharmaceutical industry has directed substantial resources through AAN and other such groups that hide the identity of their donors and have few if any limits on fund-raising.
These emails are little chronicles of the world as it unfolds. They recount, in unadorned sentences largely free of affect, what happened on any given day. Some of these events will be forgotten. Many, especially this tumultuous year, will linger and scar.

Is American manufacturing in free fall, as Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump assert? Figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis show industrial output a tad below an all-time record level, while nearly double the output of the Reagan presidency, another supposed golden age. It's just that advancing technology allows more manufacturing with fewer workers — a change unrelated to foreign competition.
Quietly, a debate continues to rage in the Democratic Party over how far to push for a health care overhaul, including proposals such as a public option or so-called Medicare for all . With a number of pressing issues competing for priority, few lawmakers have expressed enthusiasm about diving back into a policy clash on one of the most politically complicated issues.
The Affordable Care Act was an imperfect and incomplete reform. The political compromises needed to get it through Congress created a complex system in which too many people fall through the holes. It was also underfunded, which is why deductibles are often uncomfortably high. And the law has faced sabotage both from G.O.P.-controlled state governments and, since 2017, the Trump administration.
Why attacking corruption and getting some structural change in our economy that actually is about not just the wealth gap top to bottom, but this fact that more and more and more of our value is being sucked up to the top, and more and more people are sliding back behind it. And not having power at the polls. How those three things are tied to each other.
CW: But does that fix the power consolidation that's happening right now? If you took Facebook and spun out to Instagram, say, you still have a real dominance and a power that has been accumulated there. So Facebook, for example, in the media and advertising industry.

Ms. Hanks's experience illustrates how America's employment-based health insurance system could become another liability in the country's fight to contain coronavirus. It could push workers at highest risk of serious illness from coronavirus back to work the fastest. Those people need coverage to treat the pre-existing conditions that make them vulnerable in the first place.
It's hard to say exactly, because we're talking about an unprecedented situation. But we do know that the people who are typically benefited from early voting, from early registration, from online registration, or a vote-by-mail are people who usually don't participate in the process — younger voters, minority voters, people that lean Democratic. And just in the ways that Republicans limited early voting in that special session they had after Evers won, it's the same thought process. That when more people get involved, when people who typically sit out get involved, that helps Democrats.
In terms of expanding the electorate, would you support something like HR1, the For The People Act, which Democrats want to bring as the first bill in the new Congress?
In trying to understand how one of the most conservative members of the most conservative court in decades has come to be viewed by fellow conservatives as an enemy of the people, several possible explanations come to mind. Derangement may be one. A mind-clouding obsession with the Affordable Care Act is another.
The 2010 law stipulates that some of the money shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury of the United States and may not be used for the program to provide financial assistance to insurance companies.
Well, I have to commend some of my colleagues at National Review, like Michael Brendan Dougherty and Robert VerBruggen. I'd mention Joshua Hammer, Helen Andrews, Coleman Hughes. There are a lot of voices, I find that they are increasingly people who are younger than me, which is a little dismaying. One of the plus sides of the lack of coherence and definition in Republicanism is there's a lot of interesting voices out there.

A 2018 Gallup poll found that a record-high 75 percent of Americans say immigration is a positive, including majorities of all parties. Yet immigration reform has become a wedge issue in Congress, with the government brought to a shutdown multiple times over issues like the treatment of Dreamers and the funding for Mr. Trump's border wall.
Finally, patient expectations would have to transition. Today, getting a doctor's appointment is annoying but not onerous. In Canada, the median wait time between seeing a general practitioner and a specialist is 8.7 weeks; between a G.P. referral and an orthopedic surgeon, it's nine months. That would take some adjusting.

Senator Warren said in March that she hopes to pass a constitutional amendment to protect every American's right to vote. She added, Every vote matters, and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.
The bill, which will most likely go to the House for a final vote on Wednesday, includes a significant, albeit temporary, expansion of subsidies for health insurance purchased under the act. Under the changes, the signature domestic achievement of the Obama administration will reach middle-income families who have been discouraged from buying health plans on the federal marketplace because they come with high premiums and little or no help from the government.

In a democracy, how is it that they have so much political influence that one-tenth of 1 percent can say, I rather your kid have to deal with $50,000 in student loan debt, and I'd rather you never get a chance to get a child into day care, which means you either piece stuff together in crazy ways or quit your job. And I'd rather your public schools still have tiles falling out of the ceiling and textbooks that are 11 years old than that the top one-tenth of 1 percent has to pitch in 2 cents.
It's true that so far repeated Republican attempts to destroy the Affordable Care Act have failed. In 2012 the Supreme Court rejected claims that the whole law was unconstitutional. In 2017 a Republican-controlled Congress narrowly failed to repeal Obamacare. And a variety of narrower efforts to undermine health reform and send insurance markets into a death spiral have fallen short: Markets seem to have stabilized, and one by one, states that initially rejected Medicaid expansion have been relenting.
BA: So you'd put tariffs on existing foreign imports?
The better bet seems to be an all of the above approach: Organize a climate movement around meaningful policies with a reasonable chance of near-term success, but don't abandon the hope of carbon pricing. Most climate activists, including those skeptical of a carbon tax, agree about this. Gunn-Wright says she is open to a price on carbon. NextGen's Foser says he thinks the next federal climate bill should err on the side of ambition. Podesta, who has spent as much time as anyone thinking about how to pass federal legislation on climate change, says he thinks a carbon price needs to be in a bill, so long as it isn't the focus. One option, he suggested, would be a carbon price that was both delayed until future years and initially low, increasing later. Such a price could still have a major effect on investments in clean energy, because those investments tend to be long-term.
Health care, in other words, may have decided the midterm, and is certain to play a pivotal role in the primary. And next year, it could play a pivotal role in the general election, too. But will it help or hurt the Democratic candidate?
You need a different apology, she concluded
Credit Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times President Biden, seeking to expand access to health care and strengthen the Affordable Care Act, used his executive authority Thursday to order the reopening of enrollment in the health law's marketplaces and a re-examination of Trump administration policies that undermined protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. His aim, he said in a brief signing ceremony in the Oval Office, was to undo the damage Trump has done. Mr. Biden also moved to protect reproductive rights and expand access to abortion, and took separate executive action to overturn his predecessor's restrictions on the use of taxpayer dollars for clinics that refer or counsel patients to terminate pregnancies, both in the United States and overseas. Taken together, Mr. Biden is trying to put a quick stamp on health policies that have been critical to a Democratic resurgence, especially those that back the Affordable Care Act, which he helped secure as President Barack Obama's vice president. President Donald J. Trump failed to overturn the health law, but he spent four years undermining it with a series of executive actions, including allowing the sale of cheap, short-term and small-business health plans that do not meet the law's health coverage mandates. Mr. Biden's first step is to reopen enrollment for health coverage offered through the federal marketplace created under the health law, also known as Obamacare.
Mr. Sanders identifies as a democratic socialist, and Mr. Biden was asked on the CNN program if he would support a socialist at the top of the ticket.
WASHINGTON — Emergency financing to fight the mosquito-borne Zika virus appeared likely to be delayed until after Congress returns from its Fourth of July recess, as Democrats on Wednesday sharply criticized a new Republican proposal to provide $1.1 billion, but with $750 million redirected from other federal programs.
They absolutely should sign up, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown's Center on Health Insurance Reforms. Unless something drastic happens, she said, consumers should have coverage and, for those who qualify, help with premiums through the end of the year.
JI: I want to just pivot very quickly to health care. It seemed like a good moment. With respect to what you will fight for, can you talk a little bit about Medicare for all and where it ranks in terms of your priorities, and then to kind of sort of reiterate the question, how do you convince people who are wary of massive health care overhaul yet again that that's the right approach to that problem basically?
Mara Gay: Actually, that's a perfect point for me to just ask you a question that's related. My family is from Michigan, and U.A.W. workers. One of the last things that they really love, many of them, is their health care. So I guess my question is, is both a practical one and a political one, which is why not try and expand health care access without actually taking away programs that people already like? Is there a way to do that? Is there even a way to get to what you're talking about without talking about it in such dogmatic political terms, and how do you — this is I guess the most important part of the question, I think, is how do you make the pitch to a U.A.W. worker that what you can offer is actually better than what they already have?
I do think, though, that ultimately, they won't win elections in this way, that the combination of a kind of bizarre personal charisma with a way of harnessing the anger of some of the base with a sort of grasp on how to get the kind of attention that puts you at the center of every conversation helped Trump to do this very narrowly. I don't think there are other politicians right now in the Republican Party who could pull that off. And so at the very least, if they ask themselves, how do we get anywhere? They should consider that getting somewhere might mean offering voters something they want. And I do think there are politicians in the party who do see that and who want to get to that place. You mentioned Marco Rubio. And there are others who have been more hostile to Trump who, I think, can see their way to that, too. There are others in the middle on the Trump question, people like Ben Sasse or Mike Lee or Ted Cruz, who represent very different views of Donald Trump, but who, in different ways, try to be attuned to what voters want. And I think, ultimately, the model of Trumpism is not a durable model for how the party can function. But that's as much a hope as it is a fact. And so I hope it's true.
What Is the First Issue for Your Presidency?
Democrats still need to come up with a compelling candidate against Trump. But the midterms told us that there is an important coalition of independents, moderate Republicans and suburban women no longer so sold on Trump.
Ronald Reagan denounced Medicare, back in 1961, as socialized medicine. If Medicare wasn't blocked, he said, one of these days we are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children, what it once was like in America when men were free. Before Medicare, only 54 percent of Americans 65 and over had hospital coverage; three years after its passage, 96 percent of older Americans did. Eighty percent to 90 percent of recipients really like Medicare — and these older Americans are the most conservative voters in the country.

Official Washington's fixation on the media is, of course, familiar to anyone who breathes these days. But the administration's filing resonated with something else I've been noticing lately — a meme in conservative media that there is a concerted effort on the liberal side of the ideological street, media and elsewhere, to invoke concern about the Supreme Court's legitimacy as a tool for prying Chief Justice John Roberts away from his conservative soul mates on the court.
SS: Well, speaking of using leverage, you've argued that nations that want to trade with the United States should be held to higher standards.
The staff Mr. Trump does have may be no more appealing than the candidate himself — his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was charged with battery in March. But Mr. Trump's unwillingness to listen to anyone is disturbing because he has no experience governing. He would be in desperate need of guidance on foreign policy, as Carol Giacomo has noted, and in many other areas.
This was a really bad time for us to be stuck. I'm just finishing writing a new book, which is partly about the inflection point we hit around 2007. In 2007, Apple came out with the iPhone, beginning the smartphone/apps revolution; in late 2006 Facebook opened its doors to anyone, not just college and high school students, and took off like a rocket; Google came out with the Android operating system in 2007; Hadoop launched in 2007, helping create the storage/processing power for the big data revolution; Github, launched in 2007, scaling open-source software; Twitter was spun off as its own separate platform in 2007. Amazon came out with the Kindle in 2007. Airbnb started in 2007.

archived recording (tony evers) How long do we potentially leave offices not filled because we're into July and August and we haven't held a general election?
Yes. I mean, that's why I wrote the book because everything felt upside down and sideways, and nothing made sense. And reconciliation was crazy for the reasons we're talking about here. When things failed by the filibuster, these were bills that were being blocked in the name of unlimited debate, but then immediately pulled from the floor and not debated anymore. Nothing made sense. And when you ask around for why it is this way, you get very mealy mouthed answers about Senate tradition and the wisdom of the ages and the wisdom of delay and all these things. And meanwhile, you look around, and you see the country struggling to deal with these massive issues. And it's not struggling because it's hard to find solutions. The solutions, in a lot of cases, are right there. They often exist in legislative text. They've been road tested by experts. There's not really a lot of controversy over what the solution should be. It's just impossible to get them through the Senate. And it felt crazy. And it felt like you were living in some Kafkaesque world. And when you dig into the history, you find that this is just not the way it was supposed to be. We sort of backed into it for a series of weird reasons that were never conscious decisions to make it this way. And I think it's important for people to understand that it can be different. And it is not actually that hard to make it be different.
Well, he did get rid of it for Supreme Court justices because that's what he cared about the most, and that's what he wanted to pass. I think that if Republicans retake power, the minute they have something that they really want to pass that can get 51 votes, but can't clear 60, they'll get rid of the filibuster in a heartbeat. I think that a strategy that is designed to preserve a defensive tool is not a good strategy if the opponents can get rid of that defensive tool whenever they want to. I would also say, look at the world around you today. And if you like it just the way it is, and you don't think that any big structural reforms to our democracy need to pass, anything like a John Lewis Voting Rights Act, statehood, automatic voter registration, or any other issue you care about like climate change, healthcare, income inequality, if you don't see the need for any big changes, then fine, oppose getting rid of the filibuster. If, however, you think that we need changes on any one of these issues, let alone all of them, then you have to support getting rid of the filibuster because it is the only way we're going to make major change. And I do think, look, I mean, this is — we're in a perilous moment in our democracy here. In some ways, we're picking between a lot of not great options.
Under the Affordable Care Act, people who go without insurance are subject to tax penalties. The Internal Revenue Service says that more than eight million tax returns included penalty payments for people who went without coverage in 2014.
The number of uninsured will grow by 24 million in 10 years.

Starting with trained helpers will steer shoppers clear of junk plans that may not provide all the care required by Obamacare plans, Ms. Packard said.
The 142-page bill would create a new system of federal tax credits to help people buy health insurance, while offering states the ability to drop many of the benefits required by the Affordable Care Act, like maternity care, emergency services and mental health treatment.
The Affordable Care Act already allows people who lose jobs or experience a change in income to sign up for coverage outside of the regular fall open enrollment period. What the Biden administration will do is open the marketplaces to all Americans, without requiring them to provide paperwork proving their eligibility.
Senator Warren's plan on trade, released in July, would change American trade policy by pushing the country's trade partners to abide by higher labor and environmental standards. Under her plan, more representatives from labor, environmental and consumer groups would be involved in trade negotiations, and the process would be more transparent through public disclosure of draft agreements.

It did allow people to debate if they chose to use that time. But when that debate becomes solely for the purpose of obstruction and delay and ceases to be about persuasion, you have to be able to end it on a majority vote and move the bill to the final stage of passage at a majority vote. That is how the framers intended the Senate to be. That would be a restoration of their original Senate. And that's what I think we need today.
Loss aversion actually threatened the repeal effort on two fronts: voters' fear of losing their coverage, and lawmakers' fear of losing their seats. Like the first fear, the second appeared well grounded. Republican voters wouldn't have been the only ones losing coverage, of course, but early studies suggested that losses would have been concentrated among people who voted for President Trump. The Congressional Budget Office estimated, for example, that the A.H.C.A. would have caused premiums to rise more than sevenfold in 2026 for 64-year-olds making $26,500.
The 2013 shutdown lasted for 16 days and ended amid dire warnings from the Treasury Department that it was about to run out of money. Having failed in their bid to defund Obamacare, Republicans leaders eventually worked with their Democratic counterparts on a plan to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling.
KK: Why? Do you mind telling?
The 2010 health care law includes many other provisions, such as the creation of health insurance marketplaces, premium subsidies for low- and moderate-income people and expansion of the Medicaid program, as well as changes in Medicare and public health services.
That's right. It was less of a thank you to Democrats than a punishment for Republicans, that Democrats never got the political boost back in 2010, 2012, 2014 that they hoped they would get for passing a big new social benefit. But what they did ultimately get was the benefit of voters turning against Republicans who wanted to take those benefits away. So Obamacare as a term, as a law, still kind of a mixed bag politically, but there are elements in that law, like protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions, that are enormously popular. And Republicans look back on the last campaign, the one that ended really rather badly for them, and see that as, more than anything else, the fatal political mistake they made.
But even if you accept that our country increasingly craves a kind of stabilizing central power, Kennedy's freedom-first synthesis did not succeed in supplying it. Instead, our age of opioids and suicide and sterility, and the heartland populists and Bronxian socialists that anomie has conjured up, strongly indicates that his neoliberal model needs correction — that the freedom of capital and genitals is not enough for human flourishing, that community and solidarity need to have their day, even if it comes at the expense of certain liberties and transcendentalist idylls.
Polling has consistently shown Senator Warren to be in the top tier of candidates, but not the front of the pack. She trails Joe Biden — and Donald Trump — in key swing states.
When Bush pushed through his tax cut, we had a budget surplus, so it wasn't clear to voters that less revenue might mean cuts to programs they count on. When you push through big tax cuts in the face of a budget deficit — and when your own party has spent years warning about imminent fiscal doom and demanding spending cuts — the implications are more obvious.
Oh, no!Trump is defending Assad on the basis that he is killing ISIS. In fact, Assad fought moderates because he wanted ISIS for propaganda. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
The struggles and false starts have injected more uncertainty into insurance markets that thrive on stability. An aspirational deadline of Jan. 27 for repeal legislation has come and gone. The powerful retirees' lobby AARP is mobilizing to defend key elements of the Affordable Care Act. Republican leaders who once saw a health law repeal as a quick first strike in the Trump era now must at least consider a worst case: unable to move forward with comprehensive health legislation, even as the uncertainty that they helped foster rattles consumers and insurers.
End Citizens United, a group with more than four million members and half a million donors around the country, has voiced support for Senator Warren's proposed anti-corruption plans. The group has noted that both President Obama and President Trump won election in part by portraying themselves as tougher on opponents. Read more in The Times.
Idaho residents will still be able to obtain coverage that complies with the Affordable Care Act on the state's health insurance exchange, Mr. Crapo said. But Idaho will allow other options, outside the exchange.
The cases have been reminders that the Roberts court is not reliably conservative on every issue, even though Republican presidents appointed five of the nine justices, including Roberts. Over the years, the court has also established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage (with Anthony Kennedy, now retired, as the swing vote); declined to outlaw affirmative action; upheld most parts of Obamacare; and more. These decisions have left many conservatives feeling betrayed.
At least eight other Republican-led states are hoping to follow — a ninth, Indiana, has already won permission to do so — and some want to go even further by imposing time limits on coverage.
Gail: Wow, Trump continues to bring us together. He might be dividing the country but he's uniting the columnists.
President Trump has been threatening to repeal Obamacare since before he was elected, yet in his July 19 interview with The Times, he made it clear that he doesn't understand anything about health care, conflating health insurance and life insurance. He has shown no sign since then that he is any less ignorant now.
There are leaders who are ahead of their times, leaders who are behind their times, and then there's Donald Trump, who comes from another time altogether. He's stuck somewhere closer to the Stone Age than to Stonewall. And the Supreme Court just told him so.
Mr. Upton, an influential house veteran, convinced Trump and other leaders to add another amendment — $8 billion of funding to help cover insurance costs for people with pre-existing conditions. The last-minute amendment got moderate republicans to back the bill, seemingly satisfying both factions of the republican house. The bill passed in the House 217 to 213, and now moves to the Senate for a vote. Senators will likely heavily revise it, removing and changing certain provisions and amendments to create their own palatable version and then send it back to the House .. and the process there will likely repeat itself. So for now, Obamacare will still remain the law of the land.
But he hasn't. And what he doesn't know can and will hurt you.
I mean, I actually thought that it shows the limits of Trumpification and the fact that the Republican approach to Trump's racist provocation is a kind of denial rather than a kind of wholesale adoption. I mean, I think there is a part of the Republican Party and the conservative coalition that's fully on board with the way that Trump talked about the four congressmen and the way he talks in general. But what you get from elected officials is the kind of weak condemnation of what Trump says joined to a pivot to let's talk about something else, like how bad the liberals are. Which tells you something important, right? I think it tells you that a lot of G.O.P. elected officials still have this sense that the bigoted strain in Trumpism can just sort of go away when Trump does. You would have Trumpification if Mitt Romney came out and said, Trump's absolutely right. They should go back to their home countries. Right? I mean that would be Trumpification.
We take it on by deciding we're going to take it on. We pass it through Congress, and then we set it up for the states to be able to vote on it.
The climate change task force, led by former Secretary of State John Kerry and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, declared rising planet-warming emissions a nationwide emergency. It also directly tied the effort to reduce fossil fuels to a need to address racial injustices that have led low-income communities to bear a disproportionate level of air and water pollution.
And then the third thing that I think that happens is the Democrats are kind of on their heels. They're not in control of Congress anymore. They're not in control of the White House. They don't actually have to govern. And so I think that makes them a little bit more open to something that's more idealistic, that's more aspirational.
We have trouble discerning who has decision-making authority, said Julie Mix McPeak, the Tennessee insurance commissioner and president-elect of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents state officials. We reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services. They referred us to the Office of Management and Budget, which referred us to the Department of Justice. We reached out to the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs.
Democrats choose Gary Peters to lead their 2022 Senate campaign effort. Senator Gary Peters of Michigan won his seat handily in 2014, but narrowly defeated a Republican challenger in November. Credit... Al Drago for The New York Times Senate Democrats on Thursday chose Senator Gary Peters of Michigan, a second-term moderate, to lead their campaign arm as the party seeks to hold onto and expand a razor-thin majority in 2022. Mr. Peters has a limited national profile, but he was re-elected last fall in one of the tightest and most expensive Senate races in the country. He said on Thursday that he hoped to parlay that experience into helping Democrats protect seats in key battlegrounds like Georgia and Arizona and make gains in swing states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, where the party has had some recent success. It will be a steep task. History suggests that voters tend to swing against the party in power in the first midterm election of a new presidency, and Republicans are entering the cycle determined to reclaim the Senate majority. Democrats are also preparing for a possible drop-off in enthusiasm among their voters now that former President Donald J. Trump, the Republican Party's single greatest motivator in recent years, is out of power. Still, with 14 seats currently held by Democrats and 20 currently held by Republicans on the ballot, the 2022 map generally favors Democrats.
Yeah. I think it's an enormously important question, obviously, a very challenging one. But I think that when you think about it in those terms, there is a terribly important role for elected leaders in the party who need to see themselves in more active terms and less passive terms, as people with something to say about where the party goes and not just as conduits for public sentiment. Obviously, that's part of what our elected officials need to do. But people who make politics their profession, their life have a particular role in shaping the direction of our political institutions. Part of what we've seen in the Trump era, as opposed to, say, the Reagan era, is that a leader who wants to take the energy of the party and turn it in a destructive direction can do that all too easily. I think you can also see, if you look at the Reagan era, if you look at others, that a leader that wants to take some of those same energies and turn them in more practical, constructive directions can achieve that, too. And that means that Republican leaders have to think about, what of the things they're hearing from voters do they take to be constructive and productive and they want to make something of? And focus on those. A party has to be united by what it's for together and not just by who it's against together.
Senator Warren said in an interview with Vox's Ezra Klein that many other economic policies should be accomplished before the government starts sending out checks to every American, as Mr. Yang's Freedom Dividend proposes.
Plandemic went online on May 4 when its maker, Mikki Willis, a little-known film producer, posted it to Facebook, YouTube, Vimeo and a separate website set up to share the video. For three days, it gathered steam in Facebook pages dedicated to conspiracy theories and the anti-vaccine movement, most of which linked to the video hosted on YouTube. Then it tipped into the mainstream and exploded.
The task force suggested that Mr. Biden consider several plans that his more liberal rivals had championed during the Democratic primaries, though at times it stopped short of endorsing them.
What they will vote on will not matter if senators oppose beginning debate. Mr. McConnell can lose only two Senate Republicans, now that Mr. McCain intends to be in the chamber.
As waves of sick people crash onto undersupplied hospitals, doctors are preparing to make choices about who will get access to ventilators and other equipment, and who will get only palliative care. Health workers are urging efforts to suppress the outbreak and expand medical capacity so that rationing will be unnecessary, reported The Times. But if forced, they ask, how do they make the least terrible decision?
That's the question of the hour, since they could try as early as next week. Republican senators have been meeting behind closed doors to draft their bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. We took a look at where key G.O.P. senators stand on the issue.
The Senate confirms Pete Buttigieg as transportation secretary. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:22 - 0:00 transcript Buttigieg Is Confirmed by the Senate On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., as transportation secretary for the Biden administration. Pete Buttigieg for secretary of transportation. Mr. Buttigieg, known to many simply as Mayor Pete, has demonstrated an impressive familiarity with our nation's entire transportation challenges, challenges which are pronounced in states like my own, where projects like the Gateway Tunnel are a top national priority. I know that Mr. Buttigieg is committed to working with members from both sides to improve rail and transit highways, and more, in rural communities, urban centers and everywhere in between. We all know the nominee as Mayor Pete, a man who basically came on to the national stage as a Midwest mayor who had lots of enthusiasm for making investments in America's future. So today we're considering his nomination to be secretary of transportation at a time when we need a lot of work done on transportation. And in my opinion, he's a young, energetic mayor, who is going to help us usher in a new era of transportation. Mr. McConnell. Mr McConnell, 'aye.' Mr. Romney, 'aye.' Is there anyone in the chamber who would like to vote or change his or her vote? If not, the yeas are 86, the nays are 13. The nomination is confirmed.
But Sanders isn't making a selective case, arguing that Obama should have been more aggressive on some fronts. He's arguing for a maximalist agenda on all fronts: complete elimination of private health insurance and a vast expansion of government programs that would require major tax increases on the middle class as well as the wealthy.
Yeah, exactly. I mean, it wasn't a real test of whether the ideas could get bipartisan cooperation because McConnell did everything he could to prevent it. But I actually would sort of flip it around and say, what if Obama had come into office in 2009, riding 67 percent popularity with these enormous majorities and having 60 seats in the Senate? And he'd only need a majority to pass Obamacare. I would argue that that would have been much more effective at generating Republican cooperation than the need to get 60 votes. Because everybody would have taken it as a given that this bill was going to pass. And the only question was, what does it look like, and who gets to share credit for it? The idea that Republicans are going to work with him in the first place was based on the fact that there are Republicans like Senator Collins, Senator Snowe, maybe even Senator Grassley, who'd worked on healthcare all their careers, who had endorsed on the record ideas like the ones Obama introduced, and that they could be incentivized to work with him. But instead, because of the need to get 60 votes, they were incentivized in the other direction. Democrats are ultimately able to pass it, but barely, and Republicans were able to delay it as long as possible and make it as politically painful as possible. If Obama only needed a majority, he would have passed that thing by the summer.
So we have a shrinking supply and a growing population, and that means tens of millions of people are paying more to get less. So how can you turn that around? And the answer is to make a bigger investment in housing supply directly. And that includes housing for middle-class families, for working-class families, for the working poor, for the poor, for seniors who want to age in place, for people with disabilities, for people who've been incarcerated. Expanding housing supply directly, but also using federal dollars to help encourage cities and small towns and rural areas to adopt housing practices, that will lower costs even further. I just think that's a more effective way to get real structural change.
I'm sorry. And who's fighting Mitch McConnell right now and from what platform?
Administration officials had expressed concern about the practice and considered banning it.
So I'm always wary of making political predictions, but it seems extremely unlikely to me right now for a couple of reasons. One is that Republicans are dead-set against this. So now we're left with just Democrats who would have to vote for such a bill. And then you would have to imagine that they could all agree on a proposal this radical. And I don't think that there is enough unanimity among Democrats right now on this issue. But I also think that this is a way for Democratic politicians to signal that they are signed onto a particular set of values about fairness, about affordability, about kind of all being in it together. And I think that they want to send those kind of values messages to voters, even if they're not necessarily sending them a specific policy platform that they can deliver on. And so I think it's a way to say, like, that's the mountain-top goal. We're going to get there eventually. But it's not necessarily saying, you know, on day one, I'm going to get there right away.
I generally make a point of saying, paid labor, rather than labor when I wish to talk about work for a paycheck. You don't want to gloss over the enormous amount of work that gets done inside a household in raising kids especially. And yeah, I do think that is something that has gotten devalued for various reasons. That would mean households do need to make money and you want as many of them being able to sustain themselves as possible. But we aren't and shouldn't be materialists. And this gets, actually, to another point about the future of the Republican Party. There's been a lot of discussion over the last several years about the Republicans being a Workers' Party. There's something to be said for that compared to being a business owners party. It certainly makes more political sense. But I think being a parent's party is in some ways more attractive than either of those because that's something that includes material dimension, but it's not just replacing one materialist vision with another.
In a system where the plans would need to cover expensive drugs for H.I.V. or inpatient treatment for schizophrenia, they might be more leery of taking on any customers at risk of needing such services. I would think that insurers would end up being stricter in their exclusions of people because they couldn't limit benefits, said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group.
In June, Senator Warren released a plan focused on voter disenfranchisement and election security. The plan proposes, among other measures, improved voting equipment across the country and bans on voter purges.

Administration officials said they would try to sign up more young adults, with a special emphasis on those turning 26 and moving off their parents' plans. Officials said that they would, for the first time, send letters about marketplace coverage to people who had paid the tax penalty for being uninsured, a group in which young adults are overrepresented.
Ross, I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that you're not a big fan of getting rid of the pronouns he and she.
Many of the legislators supporting Michigan's work requirements come from rural districts with high unemployment. Many of those districts are predominantly white. To protect their constituents, these legislators have included a safety valve in the bill: If you live in a county with a high unemployment rate (over 8.5 percent), you're exempt from the work requirements. The rationale? When there are no jobs to be had, it doesn't make sense to punish you for not working.
Time is of the essence, and reconciliation moves fast.
Mr. Cohen did not land a hoped-for job in President Trump's administration — he imagined himself as chief of staff — and in January last year he left the Trump Organization, where he had long served as the in-house fixer without a clear portfolio. But he managed to turn what looked like an exile into a lucrative opportunity.
It may be futile to try to restrict the influence of the very wealthy, but we can offset it by opening the system up and making it easier for a candidate to run and be heard, or for people working together to put a new idea on the agenda. Both Democratic presidential candidates have called for some kind of system of public financing that matches small donations, along the lines of New York City's program, which matches small contributions six to one. Every current citywide elected official participated in the system, and small donors, including the match, accounted for 61 percent of the money spent in the 2013 elections.
This is going away. We're going to win the battle, Mr. Trump said, citing jobs, anxiety and depression and suicide as arguments for restoring the U.S. economy.
As that party's primary rages on this year, we may need reminders of people like the 59-year-old white woman from Massachusetts we came across who voted for Hillary Clinton three years ago but is a self-described conservative who doesn't think women should always have a right to an abortion. Could a zinger at a town hall that puts down pro-life arguments earn a candidate plaudits online and on MSNBC, but make others like her feel ignored or vilified? Even for the unwaveringly pro-choice, it's a politically handy question to keep in mind.
His substantive policies, however, have followed the standard right-wing agenda: In 2017 he passed a huge tax cut, largely for corporations, that disproportionately benefited the wealthy, and almost succeeded in repealing Obamacare, in the process gutting Medicaid.
I'd say to the extent that conservative voters and writers are paying any attention to it, it's been largely positive. But conservative politicians have, as you note, been standoffish. There hasn't been a ton of criticism, but not a ton of interest either. And I suspect a lot of people are just hanging back and waiting to see how this develops and where it goes. Partly, it's gotten wrapped into the whole COVID relief debate, since Romney is trying to affect the outcome of that. But I imagine — if we assume that he's not going to get his way completely on this, this will be a continuing issue going forward. And we'll see if it takes off.

Ads that ran in Minnesota media markets
The press never tires of the Democrats in disarray story line, but that doesn't mean it's always wrong. Its latest manifestation concerns the pickle Senate Democrats are in with respect to the coming hearings for Brett Kavanaugh, President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court.
President Trump officially started his 2020 re-election campaign Tuesday night in Orlando, Fla. If the kickoff rally was any indication, Season 2 of this political reality show promises to be largely a rehash of Season 1 — except darker, whinier and even more divisive.
Asked for details on the proposal Mr. Biden was referring to, a campaign official said that his health care plan, when combined with related forthcoming proposals, would amount to more than $1 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Biden has already called to build on the Affordable Care Act and add a public option.
I think his calculation was that if he confirmed a third Obama Supreme Court nominee during the year of 2016 with a presidential election in full swing, if he had been responsible for installing a third Obama nominee on the Supreme Court and the Democrats took back the Senate and Hillary won the White House, as was widely expected at the time, that McConnell would have, at the very least, had a very aggressive challenge to his leader job. At that point, Republicans would have been in the majority for only two years, been bounced right back to the minority, and seen the confirmation of three Obama Supreme Court justices. It's not a very good record for McConnell to have been running on. So it was a bold move. I don't want to take away from that. And then he proceeded to execute it and keep people in line, which took a lot of work. But essentially, what he was trying to do was block a challenge to his leadership from his right flank and secure his right flank. And it worked. It paid off massively. But I don't think even he at the time had any idea that it would pay off as much as it has.
Today, however, the Republican Party has become radicalized. It opposes once-bipartisan ideas as a matter of course: an assault-weapons ban, Obamacare (which was shaped by ideas from the Heritage Foundation and Mitt Romney) and virtually any effort to slow climate change. The G.O.P.'s radical turn means that climate activists can no longer search for a compromise between the two parties, in the hope that their leaders will try to sell it to skeptical voters. Republicans have made clear that they will instead stoke the skepticism for their own ends. Doing so pleases the oil and coal industries, which are generous campaign donors. It also helps win elections. To a lesser degree, the conservative parties in Australia and Canada are mimicking this strategy.
I think that is not enough, Mr. Barkan said.
But one piece of context has gone little noticed: The Republican bill would actually result in more people being uninsured than if Obamacare were simply repealed. Getting rid of the major coverage provisions and regulations of Obamacare would cost 23 million Americans their health insurance, according to another recent C.B.O. report. In other words, one million more Americans would have health insurance with a clean repeal than with the Republican replacement plan, according to C.B.O. estimates.
The Justice Department's move gave the unveiling an urgency that not even she could have anticipated.
Yes. And I think I am less worried than some about, yes, you know, elevating the profile of these four women is just what Trump wanted, in part because the symbol of the Democratic Party in 2020 is going to be the Democratic nominee, who's not going to be one of these four women. But there are also a lot of people in this country for who they are an inspiration. You know, there's a lot of new voters. There's a lot of young voters. Those are the people I think, in many cases, who are going to be knocking on doors and giving a campaign its kind of cultural vitality. And so not only do you need these four women, you also need the perception that the party supports them. It doesn't mean that the party supports everything that they do, but you certainly don't need a House speaker who's out there elevating her fights with these four women in public and kind of seeking to publicly denigrate and marginalize them.

Margot Sanger-Katz covers health care policy for The Times.
The answer is some, but it looks like many newly insured Americans probably won't participate in the election. The biggest reductions in the uninsured rate came among those adults who were not registered to vote or who were registered but had not voted in the last two elections. The uninsured rate declined nearly 8 percentage points among the nonregistered. Among people who were registered voters but had not voted in the last two elections, the uninsured rate fell 11 percentage points. By comparison, among the group of people who'd voted in both elections, the uninsurance rate dropped about 6 percentage points.

Such a change would shake the entire health care system, which makes up a fifth of the United States economy, as hospitals, doctors, nursing homes and pharmaceutical companies would have to adapt to a new set of rules. Most Americans would have a new insurer — the federal government — and many would find the health insurance stocks in their retirement portfolios much less valuable.
A Federal District Court judge in Texas agreed, ruling all of Obamacare invalid, but postponed the effects of his ruling until the case could be appealed. In that ruling last month, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found that the mandate could not remain, but declined to rule on what should happen to the remainder of the health law, asking the lower court to reconsider the question in more detail.
Key data of the day Here is why U.S. deaths remain near record highs while new cases are declining. It usually takes several weeks for a coronavirus infection to develop into severe illness. Credit... John Moore/Getty Images How is it that Covid-19 cases and deaths in the U.S. aren't moving in the same direction? As President Biden's new coronavirus team held its first public briefing on Wednesday, trends in the two closely watched metrics were painting a confusing picture. Average daily reports of new coronavirus cases in the U.S. have decreased 33 percent over the last two weeks, but reported deaths in the same period have remained near record highs. One key common-sense factor goes a long way to clear the confusion. The people whose deaths are being reported now were probably infected — and then reported as new cases — weeks or even months ago. So their number mainly reflects the spread of the virus in November and December, when it was surging in most of the country. Deaths are lagged by at least three weeks after case reports, Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said Wednesday. There are other factors that could contribute to a disconnect between the case and death trends, like a shift in how many especially vulnerable people were becoming infected. But Dr. Nuzzo said she did not think that was the case now.
As for those who actively defy the president, the goal is not simply to punish them for a single transgression but to discourage them from future rebellions. Deliver a painful enough lesson, and everyone will fall into line .
80 percent of the people would like to see these kids have a better life. 80 percent of the people would like to begin to fix our broken immigration system.
In 2017, not long after Trump's victory, NextGen America, Steyer's climate-advocacy group, went looking for ways to make progress at the state level. With Trump in the White House, it was clear that the federal government would be moving in the wrong direction on environmental policy. NextGen officials decided to choose a few states where success might make a difference and send a political signal. We wanted to try to get some wins that weren't in very liberal, very Democratic places, said Jamison Foser, a senior adviser at NextGen. They ultimately settled on three states, none reliably blue: Arizona, Michigan and Nevada.

The tax law overhaul of late 2019 eliminated the home office deduction for employees from 2018 through 2025. Employees who receive a paycheck or a W-2 exclusively from an employer are not eligible for the deduction, even if they are currently working from home, the I.R.S. said. Read more. How does the family leave credit work? Self-employed people can take paid caregiving leave if their child's school is closed or their usual child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak. This works similarly to the smaller sick leave credit — 67 percent of average daily earnings (for either 2020 or 2019), up to $200 a day. But the caregiving leave can be taken for 50 days. Read more. Have rules changed on charitable giving? Yes. This year, you can deduct up to $300 for charitable contributions, even if you use the standard deduction. Previously, only people who itemized could claim these deductions. Donations must be made in cash (for these purposes, this includes check, credit card or debit card), and can't include securities, household items or other property. For 2021, the deduction limit will double to $600 for joint filers. Rules for itemizers became more generous as well. The limit on charitable donations has been suspended, so individuals can contribute up to 100 percent of their adjusted gross income, up from 60 percent. But these donations must be made to public charities in cash; the old rules apply to contributions made to donor-advised funds, for example. Both provisions are available through 2021. Read more.
What happened to me? And he said it twice. And he said —
People understand this is good for our economy. It's good for our worldwide security. If you're not willing to get out there and fight, nothing is going to change. And yeah, the fights have to be realistic. It's why I start everything with, Here's how I'm going to pay for it. You may not like how I did, but at least I laid it out there. You don't have any doubt, and I show you where every single nickel comes from because I want it to be realistic. I didn't start with free college. I started with a 2-cent wealth tax, because we can do a 2-cent wealth tax. I started with it and said, and here's how much revenue it produces. It produces a staggering amount of revenue, far more than raising income taxes, because that's what the wealth curve looks like.
And I think that if we are going to commit to the political project of eliminating gender as a social organizing principle, we should be really clear about the amount of political resources that you would have to devote to a project of that magnitude. And then, I guess, the final thing I would say is that my own relationship to femininity is pretty fraught. But I could easily imagine my trolls calling me they to call into question whether or not I am a real woman. That's probably true, I would guess, certainly not all but for some trans people who have gone through a lot of trouble to identify as a man or a woman as opposed to a person of indeterminate gender. And so we have to do a lot more thinking and arguing about what we believe about gender before we go off and try to impose it on everyone else.
Some experts say the United States is now in a race between the vaccine and the new variants. If the virus is not replicating, they say, it cannot mutate. Mr. Biden has vowed to get 100 million shots in the arms of the American people, by his 100th day in office, a plan that some say is not ambitious enough. On Monday, the drug makers Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech reported that their vaccines were effective against variants discovered in Britain and South Africa. But they are slightly less protective against the variant in South Africa, which may be more adept at dodging antibodies in the bloodstream. On Wednesday, Mr. Zients said that the Department of Health and Human Services would use the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, a law passed in 2005 that gives the health secretary emergency powers, to allow retired doctors and nurses to administer vaccines and give doctors and nurses the right to vaccinate people across state lines. And he said the president's 100 million-shot commitment does not depend on Congress passing legislation. But he ticked off a list of other priorities that require Congress to act: In order to get all Americans vaccinated, we need Congress to provide funds for vaccination. We still do too little testing in this country. We need to ramp up testing significantly. We need Congress to fund more testing in order to reopen schools and businesses and take care of people in congregate settings. Furthermore, believe it or not, we still have shortages of P.P.E.
More likely, given the state of the G.O.P. under Trump, who is no one's idea of a wonk, is that Republicans will simply decline to pursue the issue with any force, and the shabbiness of the party's current non-position will become even more glaring. Indeed, just this month, Mr. Trump continued to predict Obamacare's demise, saying he believed that it's going to be terminated, possibly as a result of the Texas case, and that in the aftermath, a deal will be made for good health care in this country. What sort of deal? I suspect that even (perhaps especially) the president doesn't know.
Tariffs are one of the tools. Economic agreements across countries, that many countries join together, and say, we're not going to let anyone import if they're using prison labor, for example, or if they're dumping dangerous chemicals into the water. There are lots of ways to do this, but we can't simply think of this as a tariff, no tariff protectionism barrier. It's not. It's about regulations. Look at the dang NAFTA 2.0, look at what we were negotiating for T.T.I.P. T.T.I.P. was about financial regulations, not about goods that were moving, in a sense, the old way that people think about, that you put a bunch of stuff on a barge and you ship it across the Atlantic Ocean. And we just need to tune into the fact we know what our advantage is and we need to use it, not to try to lock others out, but to try to encourage others to come in.
It's interesting. This is not just a debate about how to vote in a pandemic, although clearly that's what's driving a lot of this. But in the background, from what you're saying, is this other question, which is whether the systems needed to vote during a pandemic may fundamentally change who votes, how many people vote and which party wins.
WASHINGTON — One of the thorniest debates in American politics is over health care. Now add a pandemic.
We have a very active flu season, more active than most, he said It's looking like it's heading to 50,000 or more deaths — not cases, 50,000 deaths. Which is — that's a lot. And you look at automobile accidents, which are far greater than any numbers we're talking about. That doesn't mean we're going to tell everybody, 'No more driving of cars.' So we have to do things to get our country open.
In the 1990s, the Clintons have an idea to try to achieve universal health care. But largely for the same reasons that we had trouble with this before — concerns about socialism, industry opposition — those proposals essentially get batted down.
Of all Mr. Trump's grandiose claims, his pledge to restore lost manufacturing jobs remains among the most heartbreaking. Don't move. Don't sell your houses, he soothed voters in the Rust Belt town of Youngstown, Ohio, in 2017. They're all coming back, he promised of the jobs and prosperity.
So that is the political backdrop, you're saying, for this current battle over how to hold a primary in the middle of a pandemic?
As a result, candidates find themselves caught in an arms race: trying to raise enough money to compete, in contributions of $2,700 or less (far more than any middle-class family can spare), often facing opponents funding their own campaigns or incumbents with established fund-raising machines or outside money. There's a natural pressure to find a way out of that trap, using whatever technique your lawyers and consultants cook up. That's why every politician who has support from large donors now has a supportive super PAC.
I don't — I'm not — I wouldn't count on that.
At a news conference on Thursday, Ms. Pelosi expressed concern that the House's Republican leadership was comfortable assigning Ms. Greene to the education committee when she has mocked the killing of little children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, when she has mocked the killing of teenagers in high school at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. What could they be thinking — or is thinking too generous a word for what they might be doing? Ms. Pelosi said. It is absolutely appalling. Ms. Pelosi appeared to have been referring in part to a report last week from Media Matters for America, a liberal watchdog group, that said that Ms. Greene had commented approvingly on Facebook in 2018 to a user who asserted that the 2012 school shooting in Newtown in which a gunman killed 26 people, including 20 small children, was staged. That's all true, Ms. Greene replied, according to the report, though the post appears to have been deleted. Ms. Greene's penchant for conspiracy theories has created a conundrum for Republican leaders and has privately infuriated many of her colleagues in the rank and file, who are upset by many of her comments as well as the flood of negative press they have drawn. A spokesman for Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, told Axios this week that newly surfaced Facebook posts written by Ms. Greene and reported by CNN, in which she discussed executing top Democratic politicians, including Ms. Pelosi, were deeply disturbing.
Yet while context varies, the reception to the bill described in these local news reports is almost uniformly unhappy, a sentiment reflected in the polling numbers for the health care bill approved by House Republicans and in many of the interviews.
At least 158 million people across the country are being urged not to go out in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Gets endless free media coverage? Check.
No. It's a process. This is an example.
Obamacare Premiums Are Rising, Not a Little (The Upshot, June 16) does not tell the full story of how the Affordable Care Act is working in the District of Columbia.
March 4, 2020, 12:22 a.m. ET March 4, 2020, 12:22 a.m. ET Undecided until the end in Tustin, Calif. TUSTIN, Calif. — Up until the polls closed, Michael Van Duyn, a structural engineer who works in Santa Ana, was still weighing his options. I'm really on the fence, he said. Michael R. Bloomberg, he said, is successful and a capable manager, though his nondisclosure agreements don't reflect very well on him. While Bernie Sanders has been labeled a socialist, Mr. Van Duyn doesn't seen him as an evil threat. And Elizabeth Warren seems like she'd be a good mom for the country. Maybe that's what we need right now, he said. Any of them but Joseph R. Biden Jr. I just think that going forward he doesn't seem like he has a grasp of the future and where we're headed, Mr. Van Duyn said. No candidate, he added, has stated a position on infrastructure. It is one of those things that's boring to most people, he said. It's really not at the forefront of the national discussion right now. Mr. Van Duyn and about a dozen other civil engineers were at an election night happy hour hosted by the Orange County chapter of the American Society of Civil Engineers, watching the results come in California style: Taco Tuesday plus beers. Sitting next to him was Josue Vaglienty, a transportation engineer who voted for Ms. Warren. He wants infrastructure to be a priority for whoever advances to the November ballot.
Politico first reported that Mr. Mulvaney pushed Mr. Trump to get involved in the suit.
Insurers are complaining loudly about the uncertainty surrounding what will happen in the coming years, even though many states' exchanges have showed some signs of stability. Several major insurers have said they cannot begin to decide whether to offer coverage next year until the government clarifies if and how it plans to change the rules.
I said there were going to be two parts to this. So I've done part one about the inside/outside theory of change, but the second part, that's why we've got to do this through grass roots movement. We cannot do this through television commercials. If winning the presidency, and I'll speak only to the Democratic side, is about who comes in, and oh, let's see, drops $37 million in one week on TV ads, and that's what it takes to win a Democratic primary, then we have a democracy that's just our TV ads versus their TV ads, and at that point, they're fake news. They claim ours is fake news, right? Everybody just gets farther and farther and farther into their corners.
Another approach would be to let people buy into Medicare at some point before they become eligible for the program at age 65. Hillary Clinton proposed this during her presidential campaign. Congress could also provide more generous subsidies to help middle-class people buy insurance on Obamacare exchanges. At the state level, four million people would gain coverage if Florida, Georgia, Texas and the 16 other states that have not expanded Medicaid under Obamacare changed their minds and opted in.
MC: So as you're out there trying to convince people to join you on this mission, at certain times, and certainly in the debates it's come up that people who do not embrace your path lack the political courage or will, or they're scared, as you've said, to embrace big change. Now, certainly this will appeal to a lot of Democratic voters, but there are also a lot of more moderate swing voters, Democratic voters who will be put off by the idea that just because they don't embrace your particular policies, they somehow are not courageous or that they're wrong in their ideas. So how do you reach out to these people, because you can't win the nomination just with the progressive base. You've got to kind of convince these people who are nervous about the big ideas. For instance, Medicare for all that you're pitching is not a overwhelmingly popular idea.
On Tuesday, Douglas N. Letter, a lawyer for the House of Representatives, was particularly insistent that Judge O'Connor had been wrong, telling the appeals panel that the burden is on the other side to show Congress wanted this entire statute to be struck down.
Trump yet again suggests he was against the Iraq War from the beginning. He thinks if you repeat a lie often enough, people believe it. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
LK: And a growing concern during the Trump era about violence. And I'm just wondering how you would address that, if that is in fact something that's not going to go away once the Trump era ends, which I think is a safe assumption.
You know on part of this, I think part of the answer is current law enforcement. You correctly describe it, in harassing people, in trespassing. And we need to make sure at federal, state, and local levels that people who are seeking health care of any kind have access to that health care and are not denied that opportunity. I think our laws are there. I think the weakness is our failure to enforce. That's how I see now. If there are gaps in that, I'm certainly open to understanding them better, but that's how I see it.
So this would be an enormously expensive proposal. It is not necessarily expensive compared to all the ways that Americans pay for health care now. So right now, your employer, if you get employer based insurance, they pay something towards your insurance premium, you pay something towards your insurance premium. When you go to the hospital, maybe you pay a deductible. There are kind of all of these different pots that your health care dollars come from. What the Medicare for All plan would do is it would say, no one's going to pay into any of those streams — the federal government is going to pay for all the medical bills, but in order to pay that, they have to collect way more money in taxes. So various estimates say it would cost more than $30 trillion to administer something like the Sanders plan. That is a lot of money. And that is so much money that you can't just raise it by taxing the rich. You would really have to have very broad-based taxes that would reach across the income spectrum.
KK: Senator, a number of your opponents have proposed in various ways either new entitlements or other programs that would give cash directly to low-income families.
SS: Well, speaking of using leverage, you've argued that nations that want to trade with the United States should be held to higher standards.
At the same time, none of the dire predictions conservatives made about the law have come true. It didn't bust the budget — in fact, deficits came down steadily even as the A.C.A. went into effect. It didn't discourage workers from taking jobs: Employment of Americans in their prime working years is back to what it was before the financial crisis. And despite Donald Trump's best efforts to undermine it, the system isn't in a death spiral: Insurers are making money and premiums have stabilized.
If you have recently lost your job-based coverage, you can qualify for a special enrollment period to buy insurance on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. Coverage there is subsidized on a sliding scale according to income, and there are several choices of plan in most markets.
The final budget proposal of Mr. Trump's term is expected to reinforce the anti-immigration platform that helped propel him into office and will be a big part of his re-election campaign. Mr. Trump intends to ask Congress for an additional $2 billion to fund his border wall, according to people familiar with the plan, pressing ahead with one of his signature campaign pledges and setting up another clash with Democrats.
If Facebook has way too much power.
Abby told me that one big piece of the new package is money.
I mean, I actually thought that it shows the limits of Trumpification and the fact that the Republican approach to Trump's racist provocation is a kind of denial rather than a kind of wholesale adoption. I mean, I think there is a part of the Republican Party and the conservative coalition that's fully on board with the way that Trump talked about the four congressmen and the way he talks in general. But what you get from elected officials is the kind of weak condemnation of what Trump says joined to a pivot to let's talk about something else, like how bad the liberals are. Which tells you something important, right? I think it tells you that a lot of G.O.P. elected officials still have this sense that the bigoted strain in Trumpism can just sort of go away when Trump does. You would have Trumpification if Mitt Romney came out and said, Trump's absolutely right. They should go back to their home countries. Right? I mean that would be Trumpification.
KK: Yes, and even more practically, is it enough to get anything passed in Mitch McConnell's Senate?
KK: Yes, I am, undocumented immigrants, excuse me.
JW: You think if they vote in the next two weeks that that will be a sufficient amount of time and what they've done, what they ——
It's odd, in a way. After all, trade is clearly an issue about which Trump is truly passionate. He tried to kill Obamacare, but to all appearances his main concern was tarnishing his predecessor's legacy. He wanted a tax cut, but more to score a win than because he cared about what was in it. But reducing the trade deficit has been a long-term Trump obsession, so you might expect him to learn something about how world trade works, or at least surround himself with people who do understand the subject.
During the 2008 campaign, Barack Obama had assured Mr. Biden that he would be consulted on every major decision. But many on the new president's team were still Biden-skeptical, and Mr. Obama was not sure the meandering former senator had the discipline to be an effective governing partner, people close to both men said.
Bret: The G.O.P.'s refusal to consider Judge Garland's nomination was a disgrace. No argument from me there. Although I would point out that the hyper-politicization of these confirmation hearings began in 1987 with the disgraceful Democratic mistreatment of Robert Bork, the Reagan nominee who should have been confirmed. Sorry, please continue.
KK: Senator, a number of your opponents have proposed in various ways either new entitlements or other programs that would give cash directly to low-income families.
I still, on occasion, want to pick up the phone and call him. So it was a relationship that was like a political marriage.
I'll — start — I want to lie about you, that's why I ran the ad that said Mark Zuckerberg endorses Donald Trump, and they said, We'll take your money for that one, until they discovered what it actually said and said: Wait a minute. Not if you're going to talk about Mark Zuckerberg. Whoa.
Then he began backing proposals that would eviscerate the Affordable Care Act and severely damage the other programs.
I'm sort of interested that both of you seem to think that both the health care case and the racist tweets are basically bad for Trump from a political perspective.
It has also put health care back at the center of the political conversation. Republicans already took a beating on the issue in the fall midterm elections, and Democrats, who released a bill in the House to strengthen the Affordable Care Act, want to keep running on it. They'll be sure to remind voters of the Trump administration's zealous commitment to taking away their health care.
The legislation that the House passed would cover 85 percent of COBRA premiums through September. The Senate plans to bump up the amount to 100 percent, meaning the government would pay the full cost of premiums. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the more generous Senate version will cost $35 billion.
To the Editor: Re A G.O.P. Plan on Health Act: Rescind Slowly (front page, Dec. 3):
I did this interview with Senator Cotton and it had been set up as a thing on cancel culture, which is fine, and great, and there's a lot of interesting stuff to say about it. But I did say, I did ask, So OK, if this is like this huge problem in America, what are you as the Senator going to do about it? And he didn't have much of an answer to that. And I'm not sure that there really is much of an answer, other than, well, I'm just going to keep saying what I'm saying and I'm in this position where I depend on voters rather than these cultural institutions and so, I have this freedom. Which I mean, that's actually not a terrible answer to the question, but it's not a completely satisfying answer to the question either. Let me back up a second. There is some policy substance that was important to Trump. Trump, whether because he was a brilliant strategist, or because he had a certain cunning sense of these things. He did, I think, understand the red lines in the Republican Party. Because sometimes you hear people saying, well, Republicans are for Trump. Whatever he does they they'd go with him. He could do anything. He could shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue. OK, fine. He can do lots of things. He proved that he could do lots of things and still retain Republican support.
Senator Warren, then a Harvard professor, first introduced the idea of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in a 2007 paper in the journal Democracy. President Obama assigned her to build the agency after the 2008 financial crisis.
Dr. Patrick H. Conway, the acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the rules proposed on Wednesday will help protect Americans enrolled in the individual and small group health insurance markets while future reforms are being debated.
I'm not going to do names. That's enormously presumptuous.
And they both released these statements that were by the standards of these things, and you can always change your mind, you know, pretty hardcore. Sinema said she would not change her mind on the filibuster, on getting rid of it, under any circumstances. Joe Manchin went on Fox News — on Fox News — to tell people and then reiterated it to Mitch McConnell that he would never be the vote to get rid of the filibuster. They didn't leave themselves a lot of wiggle room. And so, as somebody who worked in the Senate — Sinema came after you left, but Manchin was there when you were there — what do you think was going on in their psychology or in their understanding of the political interests or needs at that moment?
Three people who stormed the Capitol tried to recruit a large following ahead of time, prosecutors say. A 15-page court document is latest indication that the authorities believe the violence at the Capitol was a coordinated and planned attack. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times One person who stormed the Capitol, a self-described leader of a militia group, solicited recruits shortly after Election Day for a basic training class ahead of the inauguration, prosecutors claim in an indictment filed Wednesday, the latest indication that the authorities believe the violence at the Capitol was a coordinated and planned attack. In a 15-page court document, prosecutors brought new allegations against three rioters who they said had connections to militia groups, claiming that they initiated a plan to recruit as large a following as possible ahead of Jan. 6. Jessica Marie Watkins of Champaign County, Ohio, who prosecutors say was a member of the far-right Oath Keepers, sent messages to a number of potential recruits for the Ohio State Regular Militia just six days after the November election. Donovan Ray Crowl, 50, whom the F.B.I. has identified as a member of the same Ohio militia group, attended a training camp in North Carolina in December. Ms. Watkins, 38, who described herself on social media as a commanding officer of the Ohio group, told the recruits that the group was planning a weeklong Basic Training class in early January.
[Read excerpts of The Times's interview with President Trump.]
I, myself, was very uncomfortable with that statement when he said it — I worked for him at the time — and would be still. But that is something like the view of a certain kind of more populist-inclined Republican politician. And it's hard to know, but I think that if the Biden era is more policy inclined — look, it's going to be more policy inclined — but if it is really an era of policy debates, where there are actual arguments and bargaining and negotiation, I think you will see these differences emerge with much greater force, differences among Republicans, on the role of government.
The formula was simple: when he was a foil against Senate Republicans, he was a straight-talking American hero; when he was running for president against Mr. Obama, he was a dangerous madman. It didn't help that his behavior in the 2008 election was quirky to the point of being erratic. Remember that at one point during the financial crisis he unilaterally suspended his campaign and flew back to Washington, and then began campaigning again a few days later having done nothing noteworthy. It demonstrated for the nation the sort of impulsiveness Arizonans had grown used to. It was supposed to be a grand gesture that demonstrated that he was above politics and therefore more worthy of the presidency than his opponent. It actually demonstrated self-indulgence and a lack of political maturity. As a result, when he faced Mr. Obama and his substantial political talents, he lost the Electoral College by 2 to 1.
So what's really behind the war on the poor? Pretty clearly, the pain this war will inflict is a feature, not a bug. Trump and his friends aren't punishing the poor reluctantly, out of the belief that they must be cruel to be kind. They just want to be cruel.
Republicans now have two powerful reasons to repeal and replace together: They hope to protect about 20 million Americans who have gained coverage under the law. And they want a politically acceptable judgment from the Congressional Budget Office on the effects of their alternative.
Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, said on Monday: We do not comment on internal deliberations or the particulars of any waiver requests. H.H.S. has been working on waivers to help states have more flexibility and provide patients access to affordable health care.
Mr. Upton, an influential house veteran, convinced Trump and other leaders to add another amendment — $8 billion of funding to help cover insurance costs for people with pre-existing conditions. The last-minute amendment got moderate republicans to back the bill, seemingly satisfying both factions of the republican house. The bill passed in the House 217 to 213, and now moves to the Senate for a vote. Senators will likely heavily revise it, removing and changing certain provisions and amendments to create their own palatable version and then send it back to the House .. and the process there will likely repeat itself. So for now, Obamacare will still remain the law of the land.
Of all the political issues that divide us, health care is the one with the greatest impact on ordinary Americans' lives. If Democrats hadn't managed to pass the Affordable Care Act, around 20 million fewer Americans would have health insurance than currently do. If Republican-controlled states hadn't refused to expand Medicaid and generally done as little as possible to support the act, national progress might have tracked progress in, say, California – so another 7 or 8 million people might have coverage.
He is a war hero —
The administration will also have enormous power to allow states to reshape their Medicaid programs — and even their local insurance markets — through waivers to existing law. Seema Verma, the just-confirmed administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, was a consultant who helped states write pathbreaking conservative proposals for their Medicaid programs. She is ideally positioned to approve many more such waivers from Republican-led states, allowing them to impose premiums, cost-sharing and even work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries.
KK: Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
It is a big improvement from the last recession, he said, when he became uninsured for several years after losing his job and getting divorced. But for Mr. Exum, 53, the law is imperfect.
There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and Republican claims about health care.
People understand this is good for our economy. It's good for our worldwide security. If you're not willing to get out there and fight, nothing is going to change. And yeah, the fights have to be realistic. It's why I start everything with, Here's how I'm going to pay for it. You may not like how I did, but at least I laid it out there. You don't have any doubt, and I show you where every single nickel comes from because I want it to be realistic. I didn't start with free college. I started with a 2-cent wealth tax, because we can do a 2-cent wealth tax. I started with it and said, and here's how much revenue it produces. It produces a staggering amount of revenue, far more than raising income taxes, because that's what the wealth curve looks like.
But a platform that simply encourages the worst possible behavior from someone in your position is the platform that you should just not have anything to do with, and that has to be part of our response to this by helping us avoid those bad cases that make bad law. But we're also going to need to think about what good law looks like in this situation. The internet's not going away, and that's a good thing. Social media is not going away, and that's a good thing. We have to learn how to live with it more constructively, and we're at the very beginning, I think, of a long process toward doing that.
The two Republican-appointed judges on the three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit — Jennifer Elrod (appointed by George W. Bush) and Kurt Engelhardt (appointed by President Trump) — seemed to have little patience for the arguments in defense of Obamacare presented by lawyers for the House of Representatives and a group of blue-leaning states. (The third judge on the panel, a Jimmy Carter appointee , remained quiet during the arguments.)
And he gets more unpopular when he does things like what he did this week. Right? Like —
In some sense, McCain's biography — and the overheated rhetoric it encouraged in discussions of his political persona — deprived him of agency. He often seemed to be playing a role created for him by others. Even his work on campaign finance reform with Russ Feingold seemed to lack a guiding principle. It was more a form of penance for his implication in the pay-to-play Keating Five scandal. He became a symbol when what Arizona needed was a legislator.
MG: Sorry. You think it has — go ahead. I'll let you finish.
Ms. Hurd has had no such peace of mind. A burst appendix would likely cost at least her individual deductible of $6,300.
Actually, I don't do polls. I haven't looked at them, so I don't know, but I'll tell you this. I'm out there fighting for those votes every single day. I've been to 29 states and Puerto Rico. I will keep doing this. I've been to blue states and red states, and talked about how we build a future. I think that's what we've got to do. We've got what, two more months before the caucuses start, but this is the question in front of us as a country. How do we think about how to go forward? Is the message going to be business as usual after Donald Trump? It's just too damn hard to get anything done. Therefore, we're just going to just kind of nibble at that problem of all the folks who can't get child care and teachers who are working three jobs?
Trump says that Islamophobia is a shame. Hm. The arsonist denounces fires. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
Now, the recovery is in its seventh year, the unemployment rate has dropped sharply to 4.9 percent and the private sector has chalked up 72 months of uninterrupted job gains, the longest streak on record. Oil prices may still be causing ulcers, but this time it is primarily producers who are feeling the pain, because prices have plunged.
Alex Kingsbury: The Trump administration has made an effort to get Europeans to pay more for their own defense as being part of NATO. Is that a goal that you support even if you don't support the way he's going about it? And how might you achieve those goals?
Clearly, this case is headed for the Supreme Court. But Trump doesn't want it heard until after the election.
The throng that came out to celebrate Mr. Trump's announcement was big and boisterous. The president may be broadly unpopular, but to much of the Republican base, he is a cult idol — Justin Bieber with a faux tan and an unearthly combover.
KK: Well, the House Democrats are fighting Mitch McConnell. [WARREN APPEARS UNIMPRESSED]
Senator Warren's Medicare for all would require $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over the next 10 years. She has promised the money won't come from raising taxes on the middle class and maintains that between defense cuts and a wealth tax, the costs would be covered. But of course, that would require Senate approval — and Senator McConnell has sworn it won't happen as long as I'm majority leader.
So which system should Democrats advocate? The answer, I'd argue, is the system we're most likely actually to create — the one that will play best in the general election, and is then most likely to pass Congress if the Democrat wins.
I find it ironic that people suggest reconciliation is somehow better for the institution, Adam Jentleson, former deputy chief of staff to the former Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, and the author of the excellent new book, Kill Switch: The Rise of the Modern Senate and the Crippling of American Democracy, told me. It's terrible for the Senate! As he notes, budget reconciliation decreases the power of committees and increases the power of the Senate leadership, since leadership drives the assembly line for putting together these mega-packages. There's no transparency and it creates a field day for lobbyists.
Zucker's tenure at CNN started inauspiciously. He talked about the need to broaden the definition of news and joked about replacing a pillow in one executive's office that said CNN = Politics with one that read CNN > Politics. There were several short-lived experiments in programming, including the return of a warmed-over Crossfire, starring Newt Gingrich. Zucker's news judgment was publicly and repeatedly called into question: In 2015, Jon Stewart devoted a large part of The Daily Show to mocking CNN for broadcasting the White House Correspondents Dinner rather than covering the protests after a black man, Freddie Gray, died in the custody of the Baltimore Police.
Trump ha dicho que los pobres podrían recibir cuidados quizá a través de programas como el Medicare. Eso es tener corazón.
And how did much of the Republican Party respond? By criticizing the four women at least as much as Trump— it's the latest sign that Republicans appear to be approaching full Trumpification. What Trump wants, it seems, many Republicans are happy to do. Ross, I realize this may not be your favorite kind of discussion in which Michelle and I ask you to answer for the outrages of Donald Trump and the Republican Party. But here we go. So what did you think about the reaction of other Republicans to Trump's comments this week?
Mr. Looney, of the Brookings Institution, estimated that the benefits from Senator Warren's plans are skewed — he estimated that borrowers with advanced degrees will claim 37 percent of the annual benefits, while representing only 27 percent of borrowers overall.
Health economists also overwhelmingly (81 percent agreement) said the A.C.A.'s individual mandate — in which people paid a fine if they chose not to be insured — was essential for its success. Without it, they said, the people who sign up would disproportionately be sicker, causing insurance to become ever more expensive. This phenomenon, also known as adverse selection, could collapse the market.
He sort of glibly said, well, if you don't want to be re-elected, you're in the wrong business. I mean, this question of what is going on with Lindsey Graham is so present around him, it's come to define him so much, that he felt completely at home even raising the question rhetorically on the stump in South Carolina.
That's exactly what we saw happen in the midterms.
The stop in Des Moines was the first event of a three-day Iowa swing for Mr. Biden, who has led in national and state polling despite appearing in the state far less than his top competitors. He appeared at just eight public events in Iowa during the first six months of this year, while 12 candidates have been at 30 or more, according to The Des Moines Register's candidate tracker.
The Times columnist David Leonhardt wrote in September that despite long positioning herself as a champion for the working class, Senator Warren has had a record of struggling to win in working-class towns and blue-collar parts of Massachusetts.
In Oklahoma, parents with dependent children generally cannot obtain Medicaid if their household income is more than about half of the poverty level — higher than $9,240 for a three-person family. Adults generally cannot get Medicaid at all if they do not have dependent children and they are not elderly, disabled or pregnant.
archived recording (tony evers) I just want to make sure people understand the complexity of our spring general election. It's not a primary election. It's only a primary election for the presidential candidates.
I will also fight to knock back the influence of money, because I think every time we do that, that's what that anti-corruption bill is about. It's about calling out the big drug companies. It's about calling out the big insurance companies and just disrupting the fabulous patterns they have right now to get their way in Washington. In the first 100 days, I'll go to Congress and try to get what we can get on 50 votes. What we can get on 50 votes is to offer Medicare to everybody who's 50 or older.
Gilens, Page and their critics basically agree on the same set of facts. Their differences emerge from their conflicting interpretations of those facts.
But even if you accept that our country increasingly craves a kind of stabilizing central power, Kennedy's freedom-first synthesis did not succeed in supplying it. Instead, our age of opioids and suicide and sterility, and the heartland populists and Bronxian socialists that anomie has conjured up, strongly indicates that his neoliberal model needs correction — that the freedom of capital and genitals is not enough for human flourishing, that community and solidarity need to have their day, even if it comes at the expense of certain liberties and transcendentalist idylls.
What I need to be, clearly, is rich. I need to invent an app or get hit by a city bus. I gotta start playing the lottery. Except, if I win, I definitely need a trustee or Britney Spears's dad to dispense a weekly allowance because I am not to be trusted. I would buy half a dozen pairs of glasses and legally download a bunch of movies I don't even like before the check even cleared. I would buy that Rainbow Brite doll I never got for Christmas 1986 and drive her around in my new car full of gasoline with my windows electronically rolled down and the air conditioner blasting, eating fistfuls of name-brand cereal and sipping an actual Capri Sun.
BS: Last question. What are you likely to fail at as president?
I would say that the one difference between a case like this and something like the Charlottesville case is that Trump's foils here are genuinely unpopular figures to the extent that they're well known. That could make this a case where he gets away with more bigotry because it's seen as a choice between Trump's bigotry and Ilhan Omar's far-left politics. But I think, in general, we have a very clear track record that when Trump is seen to be explicitly race-baiting, lots and lots of voters who might be otherwise inclined to support him don't like it.
Typically, Americans without a special circumstance can buy Obamacare insurance only during a six-week period in the fall, a restriction meant to encourage people to hold coverage even when they are healthy. The sign-up period for this year's coverage ended in mid-December, with enrollments only slightly higher than they were last year. But the Trump administration did little to advertise it. The Biden administration plans to have a large marketing campaign to announce the new opportunity and encourage people to enroll in health plans, two of the people said.
That's the Scalia approach, Mr. Bush added. He was very consistent on his interpretation and his rulings. And that's what we need.
There are too many flaws in Jamie Daw's case to enumerate in a short letter, but let me take just one: Dr. Daw states, In Germany, sickness funds leverage market power to secure lower prices, coming together regionally to negotiate contracts with doctors and hospitals . In the United States, health insurance companies — which are much larger and have much more market power than German sickness funds — have had the ability to negotiate for lower prices for the better part of a century. The result has been what we have — by far the most expensive health care system in the world.
To some extent, they understood what they were doing, that their insurance was a result of Obamacare, and that Trump vowed to repeal it. They voted for him anyway, because they liked other things about him and because they figured he wouldn't really get rid of their insurance. If anything, they hoped he would fix the parts they didn't like, just as he promised.
So whenever people are being paid outside the legal system, it undercuts protection for everyone and gives an advantage to the employers who move outside the legal system. You know, look, it's part of the same basic principle. Everybody should follow the same set of rules. And if our labor standards are there's a $15-an-hour minimum wage, then everybody should pay it. If the labor standards are that you don't get to put somebody up working in an elevator shaft who has no training, then every employer should have to follow that. And any time an employer can get the work done by not following the rules, that employer gets an unfair advantage, and that unfair advantage undercuts the strength of everybody who follows the rules, undercuts the economy, undercuts workers.
Randy Pate, a senior official at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said the Trump administration expects 600,000 people to buy the new insurance policies next year, with enrollment increasing to 1.6 million by 2022.
I wouldn't say that the stakes are low and I wouldn't. Try to minimize the stakes I care about elections and the outcomes of legislation. So, what I think the right in particular has a problem with is a kind of apocalypticism. The point of no return idea. If you lose this election, if you lose this bill, that's the end of the Republic. That's the end of freedom. You can never recover it. And people convinced themselves of this. Although they don't actually follow their own beliefs on it. Like Michael Anton, he doesn't, obviously, believe that the country is now doomed forever because Trump lost re-election. Otherwise he would have stopped talking, right? He would have stopped being involved in politics. Ted Cruz doesn't believe that Obamacare, having survived his attempt to get rid of it in 2013, means the end of the Constitution, because he's still there, right? Just as it wasn't the end of free markets and capitalism when we got Medicare in the first place in 1965, about which you could have made a stronger slippery slope argument, than applied to Obamacare. That's what I want to counter, because that kind of thinking logically could lead to defeatism despair and surrender, just as much as it could lead to extremism, and violence, and so forth. But it just strikes me as just the wrong attitude to take towards politics in a Democratic country even when we rightly care about political outcomes.
Is that a book about socialism? I don't know if it is.
Senator Warren said in March that she hopes to pass a constitutional amendment to protect every American's right to vote. She added, Every vote matters, and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.
KK: Simultaneously though, all of the things that you've suggested you would need to do in order to afford Medicare for all, a wealth tax, cutting the defense budget, comprehensive immigration reform, would require the Senate's approval.
Yeah well, I'll tell you. I underestimated Trump in 2015 because I thought of him as the latest flavor of the month of extreme right, far right candidates. Or of candidates for those Republican primary voters who described themselves to pollsters as very conservative. I made this point. I have a really embarrassing column in retrospect from mid-2015 where I said, Don't worry about Trump. Because I was like, look at all these people who've come and gone before like the Herman Cains and Michele Bachmanns of the world. This segment of the party never unites around a candidate and never dominates the Republican presidential primaries for various reasons. And the Republican presidential primary after Reagan has always gone to somebody at the center of the party, or on the left of the party, and not to anybody on the right of the party, because these very conservative voters split. They split on religious grounds, they split economic versus social conservatives, they split how pragmatic they're willing to be, and somebody comes up on the middle and left of the party and consolidates. The basic structural theory about how the Republican Party worked turned out to be correct, but I was wrong in that Trump ended up being that guy. Trump is the guy who ends up dominating among Republican voters who describe themselves as moderate and maybe the crucial constituency Republican voters who described themselves as, 'somewhat conservative.
Administration officials had expressed concern about the practice and considered banning it.
If you're a centrist worried about the gigantic spending increases Sanders has proposed, calm down, because they won't happen. If you're a progressive worried that Biden might govern like a Republican, you should also calm down, because he wouldn't.
I think if you're trying to understand those roots of the left and right and if you're trying to understand Burke and Paine that way, there are some great collections of the two of them. The challenge with Edmund Burke, who I think is just really essential to read for understanding modern conservatism in the West, is that he was a politician. He ran for office every two or three years, the entire time that he was writing everything that he wrote, so everything he wrote is directed to some dispute of the moment and requires a lot of context. But I think the collections of Burke's writings, put together, for example, by The Liberty Fund or put together in various readers — Yale Press has a great one — really do give you a sense of the nature of the arguments that he made. You should start by reading some of his speeches about America, which are really exceptionally interesting and profound and still tell us something about ourselves. And you should end up reading the Reflections on the Revolution in France, which was his deepest and fullest expression of his political views and is an extraordinarily powerful piece of writing.
The final budget proposal of Mr. Trump's term is expected to reinforce the anti-immigration platform that helped propel him into office and will be a big part of his re-election campaign. Mr. Trump intends to ask Congress for an additional $2 billion to fund his border wall, according to people familiar with the plan, pressing ahead with one of his signature campaign pledges and setting up another clash with Democrats.
But Mulvaney has set out to dismantle the C.F.P.B. He has, as The Times reports: frozen all new investigations and slowed down existing inquiries by requiring employees to produce detailed justifications and scaled back efforts to go after payday lenders, auto lenders and other financial services companies accused of preying on the vulnerable.
She accused him of willful ignorance, day by day by day as he defended the policy.
A White House spokesman would not confirm the number of people allowed in meetings, or the time limits on such gatherings. But he said that in-person meetings were limited and that colleagues were socially distancing. So far, officials said, the measures appear to be working. But they concede that it's a difficult way to run a White House, just as it was a difficult way to run a campaign and a difficult way to run a transition. Adjusting to doing most meetings via video and doing most of our work with colleagues remotely has not been a massive leap, said Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary. It has been a long adjustment as humans to not being able to hug old colleagues or shake hands with new ones, but so far we don't feel that it has prevented us from doing our jobs.
I think you should talk about the language and recognize the way that the language may not be inclusive for everyone. I mean, I never until recently made it a practice to ask people I interview, people I would mention in articles, about their gender and their pronouns. I feel like having that conversation is a good way to start. One of the ways we can talk about this is not as a replacement for traditional genders but as an addition. Offering they as a pronoun for you in addition to he or she, I think, is a kind of a way to avoid some of these problems. So most places, like airports and others, that have all-gender restrooms also have men and women restrooms. And that would be a relatively easy way to both offer it as an option and include it in the language without adding to this fear that were erasing people's identities.
The budget also proposes creating an entirely new agency to police tobacco, moving that responsibility out of the Food and Drug Administration and into the Department of Health and Human Services.
Yeah, look, that's right. Now, Trump won with more difficulty than we now tend to remember. In 2016, there were 17 candidates, and he won a plurality. And he won by first appearing to be the candidate of the moderate lane of the party and then becoming also the voice of a kind of angry populism in the party. But he did win the nomination and then narrowly, the election. What happened in 2020 was different. I think the party lost an election that it could have won because it went the way of Donald Trump, and then it lost two more in Georgia that it could have won because it followed in the path of Donald Trump. And ultimately, the experience of electoral wins and losses is the way that politicians learn lessons. There's no way around that. And for the kind of agenda that I'm describing, that's both good and bad because there is a lot to be gained by taking the path of a kind of angry populism that is largely empty of policy direction and that is hostile to the institutions. Republicans, in recent years, have done reasonably well doing that. And my argument for why they shouldn't do that is that it's wrong and that it's bad for the country. But I don't have to win elections, and so it's easy for me to say.
And if those consumers develop chronic conditions, it said, they could face financial hardship until they enroll in more comprehensive plans that comply with the 2010 law.
Several candidates referenced personal challenges as a way to discuss their policies. On health care, Mr. Biden mentioned a tragic accident in his family, and Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado brought up his own cancer diagnosis as he argued to build on the Affordable Care Act.
I know that as you sit here it looks like, wow, this woman wants to do a lot and it's hard. And the truth is, it is. I spent my whole life studying working families. Why they go broke, what's happening in America, why America's middle class is being hollowed out. Whole books written about this. And I watch every year two things as it gets worse and worse and worse. Not fire worse. That was 2008 and — everybody is ——
One of the biggest reasons premiums will go down is because insurance will become expensive for older people, causing them to leave the market, improving the risk pool.
Vice President Biden has cast the Medicare for all plan as anti-labor, arguing that unions have already painstakingly negotiated health care benefits, progress that could be undone by a single-payer system. But Senators Warren and Sanders argue that the plan is pro-labor because it would mean union members are guaranteed health care and can focus their negotiations on wage increases, family leave and other benefits.
Serge Schmemann: Let me ask you about the Middle East. In the October debate you said, I think we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. Did you mean nowhere in the Middle East? Do you think — for example, who should control the Persian Gulf, freedom of navigation, should we close down the air base in Qatar?
So John McCain passes away in August. And then just a few weeks later, you had the crescendo of the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. I mean, we all remember a very, very powerful day where there was a sense for about maybe two-thirds of the day that Justice Kavanaugh was in real trouble, that Dr. Ford's story was extremely compelling. Then all of a sudden, Republicans on the committee were speaking, and Lindsey Graham gave this real show-stopping speech.
JB: And you would bring them all home?
And in reality, it is the precise reverse. Bipartisanship is something the majority wants and the minority does not have an incentive to give them. Because as you just said, if the majority looks like they're doing a great job governing, they have these big bipartisan bills, they can run for reelection on that. And then the minority remains the minority. So if you want bipartisanship, you need to give the minority a really, really good reason to work against their own political self-interest and cooperate on these bills. There may not be that reason. I'm not actually sure in a polarized system, bipartisanship is something we will ever get in high numbers. Other political systems do not have this fetishization that the opposition party is going to work with the governing party to govern. The opposition party opposes and the governing party governs. And then you see how that works out. But this is a really, really important point and something I think that Mitch McConnell understood, frankly, better than any Senate leader before him. He understood that he could get the majority back by sabotaging their ability to govern. And that was an important strategic insight.
But a lot of people get — the only option they have is very difficult exploitative labor. And something things like child allowances do is also give them a little bit more economic room to say, no, to jobs that aren't very good. So they can get a job that is better, that is better for their family and allows them to also be a better version of a role model, but also a direct parent to their children. And I guess where I'm going with this is that one, I think a Republican Party based on being a parent's party would be actually electorally lethal for the Democrats. I mean, I think it's a very scary thing for the Democrats to consider. But two, that party would have to actually want to make work better. That party might want to do things like a higher minimum wage. There is some interest in wage subsidies, so I don't want to take away from that. But for a party that cares so much about work, I often see it less interested in how that work actually functions in a family specific life, then in of idealized abstract conception about the inherent dignity of wage labor.
What makes this lack of energy especially striking is that the American Rescue Plan doesn't just spend a lot of money. It also embodies some big changes in the philosophy of public policy, a turn away from the conservative ideology that has dominated U.S. politics for four decades.
You know, this is a hard hypothetical to take on until you actually know what's happening. Again, you've got to back this one up on where we should have started. When the unrest first started unfolding in Hong Kong, for Donald Trump to step back and say in effect, gee, I think China's going to crack down on Hong Kong, and effectively inviting it, I think is the wrong place for the United States to be. I think that we should have been in a position from the beginning, saying to China, we support these efforts in Hong Kong. That's part one.
But Monday brought caveats and counterattacks.
Above all, McCain believed in American greatness — as a reality, not a slogan. He knew that the United States could play a unique role in the world, as a defender of freedom and human dignity. He also knew that the role was anything but assured. It required hard work, good choices, compromise and sacrifice.

Charlie Warzel: Senator, how do you first campaign in and then govern a country as polarized as the one that we're living in right now? Because this doesn't feel like a disagreement on a few policies. This is a situation where the cost of letting the other side wins seems almost too much to bear for the other side. And if you look at impeachment, you see politicians literally inventing alternate realities rather than compromise or disparage a party leader. How do you realistically navigate that and get things done? Because it doesn't feel like a divide that you can heal away.
archived recording A federal judge in Texas has just struck down Obamacare. True story. Judge Reed O'Connor says the individual mandate, the part of the law that requires you to participate, is unconstitutional. And because it cannot be separated from the rest of the law, which it cannot be, the entire law is invalid.
I'm Lindsey Graham, and I approve this message.
MC: O.K., so we mark that one off, so we don't have to do immigration reform for this to work.
Well, I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes. It's almost like an Etch-A-Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.
But what they were doing was affirming fantasies and conspiracies that are dangerous to the American civic order and deadly and destructive to a functional politics. We saw that result in a mob attacking the Capitol. I think even if that had not happened, it would have been absolutely inexcusable. And it's necessary for Republican leaders to take a different path on that front.
The way I think we get something done in Washington, it's the Frances Perkins story. It's not enough to organize on the outside and have the marches in the street. Before the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire, there had been dozens of marches, right? Lots of high profile. But the guys who ran the factories figured out it was a lot cheaper just to grease palms in Albany than it was to actually change their practices and put up adequate fire escapes and fire preventive measures. So just pushing from the outside, it's not enough to get it done. Just fighting it from the inside is not enough to get it done. But the one-two punch of pushing from the outside and leading it from the inside is where you see real difference.
Frustrated state officials have ideas for stabilizing the individual insurance market, but they say they cannot figure out where to make their case because they have been bounced from one agency to another in the Trump administration.
I will say, so in the second part of your argument about the importance of gender pronouns for people who feel that it very strongly represents them, I think that that universalizing they could well be used as a way to kind of — I heard from people in comments, for example, that they felt that this could lead to something like a erasure for them. And I think that is a danger. I mean, the way that I — the thing that I come back to though is that when people use they, they are very consciously using it as a neutral pronoun. And I don't think that — I think that there would be instances where you might have it used in this trolly way. But that happens with all language. The more pernicious thing you notice all the time is people deliberately misgendering others — and then kind of inadvertently because you don't know or you don't know how to say it. And for those things, I think they takes care of it. You know, one thing I worried about in writing this, and I think it was one of the main criticisms from the left and especially for trans and non-binary people, is that what I was doing here was a kind of appropriation of what they need to do, me doing it from a position of privilege, and that I'm a cisgender man and don't really have a need for this pronoun.

Meanwhile, the great dealmaker at the White House was completely ineffectual. Mr. Trump spent a few days cajoling and threatening lawmakers, then threw up his hands and said he had done all he could and was now moving on to other matters. Groups representing doctors and hospitals, as well as public interest groups like AARP and the American Civil Liberties Union, fought hard, and even Republican governors like John Kasich of Ohio and Brian Sandoval of Nevada opposed the bill.
JI: So you have, on one hand, the boldest public option that's probably been offered by any of the Democratic candidates. On the other hand, you have the most aggressive Medicare for all universal plan that's been offered. You'll be, if I understand it correctly, starting with this aggressive public option hoping to segue to a Medicare for all by year three, and in the middle of all that, you will probably be called upon to defend the Affordable Care Act at the Supreme Court level. How do you think about those three — and of distinct — that just seems like an awful lot of health care reform.
1. President Trump doubled down on his surprise decision to try to scrap the entire Affordable Care Act. If the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out, we'll have a plan that is far better than Obamacare, he said.
And he actually got a fair amount of Dodd-Frank. And — that he did, but ——
Analysis: Why aren't progressives pushing Biden on the filibuster? Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts is one of several progressive Democrats who want to see the filibuster eliminated. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times President Biden has moved swiftly in his first days to start carrying out his agenda, signing executive orders and outlining new actions. But his most significant move may in fact be a reaffirmation of an old stance: that the Senate should protect the filibuster, the 60-vote threshold that has for years stymied expansive legislation, including on issues he now seeks to address. Progressive grumbling over the filibuster rose this week after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, initially refused to agree to basic operating rules for the chamber unless Democrats agreed to maintain the procedural tactic. But it remained just a grumble, reflecting progressives' desire to avoid intraparty warfare early in Mr. Biden's term and their belief, shared more widely in Washington, that his hand may eventually be forced. We have to recognize that the Senate has fundamentally changed from the time President Biden served, said Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, a progressive who has endorsed eliminating the filibuster. And it's made it impossible to move forward on big issues. Whatever the liberal wing of the party may want, eliminating the filibuster requires the support of the entire Democratic caucus. And several moderate senators, like Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, remain staunchly in favor of keeping it.
NF: Why would you think, why is that ——
In trying to understand how one of the most conservative members of the most conservative court in decades has come to be viewed by fellow conservatives as an enemy of the people, several possible explanations come to mind. Derangement may be one. A mind-clouding obsession with the Affordable Care Act is another.
The result has been that the population actually signing up for coverage is both smaller and sicker than it would otherwise have been, forcing insurers to charge higher premiums.
Britain was roiled by economic and demographic changes. There were financial crises, bad harvests and a severe depression. There was crushing inequality. The average life expectancy nationwide was 40, but in the industrial cities of Manchester and Liverpool it was around 28. There were widespread riots and government crackdowns. In 1819, 1,206 radicals were given the death sentence, though only 108 of them were executed.
WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Thursday struck down a Trump administration rule that allows small businesses to band together and set up health insurance plans that skirt requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
Unlike an administration functioning during normal times, the Biden team can't simply add people to a meeting at the last minute, or run someone into the building. It couldn't be more different in feel and temperament from the opening weeks of the Trump administration, when the Oval Office was often compared to Grand Central Terminal. Former President Donald J. Trump's office served as a bustling focal point of all West Wing activity as aides wandered in and out and then simply hung about, once it was clear that there was no formal structure for meetings or policymaking, and that for Mr. Trump, out of sight was out of mind. All West Wing staff members are still tested daily even though a growing number of administration officials are getting vaccinated. There are also fewer people working in the building, and those who are there rarely leave the campus for lunch. There have been awkward moments in hallways, when staff members don't recognize each other because everyone is required to wear an N95 mask and many have opted to double-mask, officials said. The measures are in place because of a realization that while it may be impossible to prevent the coronavirus from entering the White House complex entirely, it is possible to reduce the risk of widespread infection if someone on the president's team gets sick. The rules have been put in place by Anne Filipic, the director of management and administration, and Jeff Wexler, the White House director of Covid-19 operations.
JI: Let me try to frame it a different way. What do you say to critics who would argue that it will take so much political capital just to enact the first portion of this plan, the aggressive public option that you've laid out, that it would be essentially impossible to then segue to a Medicare for all? You'll spend so much capital getting that first part that it seems — people have said it seems like a pipe dream to say we're going to have this aggressive public option, and then we're going to have Medicare for all three years later.
But he was clear on one point: Plans by congressional Republicans to repeal the health law now, then take years to create and implement a replacement law are unacceptable to the incoming president.
Carlyle converted into a C corporation, the standard model for publicly traded companies. Private equity firms that have gone public have typically done so as partnerships, which saved on taxes but prevented them from being included in major stock indexes.
Yes! The same guy who ran one of the most boring presidential races in modern history. (There's no question it's not good being poor.) Early this year he turned into an impeachment hero. Now he's calling for a voice against racism and marching for Black Lives Matter.
And I know it's tough between here and there. I was in a very tough primary back in 2012 and I wasn't in any primary at all in 2018, so those are my two electoral experiences.
The legislation comes with some numbers that we didn't know before. Young adults who buy insurance coverage get $2,000 in federal cash to help them pay health premiums. Older adults get $4,000. Those numbers are higher than we've seen in previous G.O.P. proposals. But they would still mean that the Americans who have benefited most from the tax subsidies in the Affordable Care Act — individuals earning less than about $30,000 — would get substantially less help.
But whether you think that's the right goal or not, I think the effort to really create alternative institutions has not turned out to be easy or achievable for the moment.
In total, there have been 21 gaps in government funding since 1976, though the level of shutdown has varied. The current federal shutdown is a partial one, as many agencies were already funded through this fiscal year, which ends in September.
President Trump has found strong support in Oklahoma; he took 65 percent of the vote there in 2016 in a 36-point victory, and recently held a campaign rally in Tulsa, his first since the start of the pandemic.
The 2016 Vice President Apprentice would feature half a dozen V.P. hopefuls, such as Mary Fallin, Chris Christie, Scott Brown, Newt Gingrich, Bob Corker and Sarah Palin, all vying for the position. One could imagine teams competing to design the best wall along our Mexican border, developing alternatives to Obamacare and defining strategies to defeat ISIS.
The need to protect people with existing medical conditions from discrimination by insurers was a central theme in the midterm elections, and Democrats attributed much of their success in reclaiming control of the House of Representatives to voters' desire to safeguard those protections. Many Republicans also promised to keep this provision of the law, although exactly how was unclear. Before the law, some individuals were sent to high-risk pools operated by states, but even that coverage was often inadequate.
The presiding officer, Senator Cory Gardner, Republican of Colorado, repeatedly banged his gavel and said the Democrats were out of order because debate is not allowed during a vote.
We're going to have that party who lost a bunch of seats on that in 2018 versus a party that we argue with each other about the best way to try to make sure that people get health care coverage, but at least we're trying to move in that direction. And this is a salient, personal, human fact. Your health care, your housing, getting your kids educated, getting your kids taken care of in child care. Every single one of those, I like where we are. I like where I am in this fight because I think it's the right fight to have and I think we must be in this fight. We cannot take a pass on this.
At a White House meeting with members of the hard-line Freedom Caucus earlier on Thursday, Mr. Trump had agreed to the conservatives' demands to strip federal health insurance requirements for basic benefits such as maternity care, emergency services, mental health and wellness visits from the bill. But that was not enough to placate the faction, part of the reason that Thursday's vote was placed on hold.
I don't know individual employees there. What I know is the power of that place and how they're using it right now. Well —
Protections for pre-existing conditions weren't the only rules for insurers established under Obamacare. Without it, health plans could also begin limiting the total amount of financial protection they offer customers, increasing deductibles, charging higher prices to older customers, and dropping expensive categories of benefits, like prescription drugs.

For example, you still hear complaints that spending on food stamps and unemployment benefits increases the deficit. Now, Republicans never really cared about budget deficits; they demonstrated their hypocrisy by cheerfully passing a huge tax cut in 2017, and saying nothing as deficits surged. But it's just absurd to complain about the cost of food stamps even as we offer corporations hundreds of billions in loans and loan guarantees.
End Citizens United, a group with more than four million members and half a million donors around the country, has voiced support for Senator Warren's proposed anti-corruption plans. The group has noted that both President Obama and President Trump won election in part by portraying themselves as tougher on opponents. Read more in The Times.
The president did issue a call for bipartisan cooperation, and he invoked the heroism of World War II to celebrate a shared history. But on the issues that have rived Washington during Mr. Trump's turbulent presidency, he did not give an inch.
In theory, this is fertile ground for a compromise, a chance for Trump to deliver the beautiful health care he promised during the campaign. He could give up his unpopular and divisive attempt to repeal Obamacare and take the moderate path of Medicare expansion. If Medicare for all is too much, there's also Medicare for most, which would allow consumers to buy into the program as an option on the exchanges. If he wants to aim directly for the center, he could urge Republican lawmakers in states like Alabama, Florida and South Carolina to adopt the Medicaid expansion and extend health insurance to their most disadvantaged residents.
Last Sunday, though, Mr. Trump acknowledged that the toll could hit 100,000. Still, he said, it could have been much worse had his administration not acted. If we didn't do it, the minimum we would have lost was a million two, a million four, a million five, that's the minimum. We would have lost probably higher. It's possible higher than 2.2.
Cambridge, Mass. — I've been at Harvard University for 17 years, but I've never been in a classroom here. I'm a cook in the dining halls. I work in the cafeteria at the T.H.

Let Elizabeth Warren knock herself out with policy proposals. Let Kamala Harris be the adult in the room. Let Bernie Sanders bellow away.
But in the Senate, Republicans would need support from some Democrats if they are to replace the Affordable Care Act.
What Erick-Woods Erickson describes as a solution to our health care problems is exactly what we had before the Affordable Care Act, except that the reality was nothing like the outcome he describes.
As a rough model, Mr. Hutchinson pointed to a work requirement for certain food stamp recipients — a federal policy that was part of the landmark 1996 welfare overhaul — that Arkansas reinstated last year. Under that rule, able-bodied adults without dependents cannot receive food stamps for longer than three months unless they are working, volunteering or getting job training for 20 hours a week.
KK: Oh my god, we're running out of time. We have a bunch of questions around technology. [LAUGHTER]
Now senators are searching for changes to make the bill more politically palatable. But the notion of making those changes today and then speeding immediately to a vote is madness. There would be no time for experts to consider the consequences — to discover the sort of problems and unintended effects that last-minute changes are bound to create. By the time they did, the Senate would have passed it.
MG: Your standing in some of the polls in the swing states is not as competitive as some of the other candidates'. Do you think that this issue is hurting you in the swing states like Michigan? If not, what do you make of the discrepancy in swing states?
Shutdowns that included furloughs in 1984, 1986 and 1990 cost taxpayers at least $128 million, according to government estimates.
No. I thought you were talking about undocumented workers.
That loss shows that there are no guaranteed formulas for success in climate politics. If the oil and coal industries decide to fight, they can expend a lot of money and power. But the experiences in Arizona, Michigan and Nevada — not to mention California — at least clarify the political dynamics. When the debate is about the cost of living, climate activists are in trouble. When it's about clean energy or people's health, they have a much better chance.
Actually, I've done 175 stump speeches and I've talked about it in every one of them. You all haven't covered it. I talk about three things that I think we need to do ——
Some ads focus on a personal connection to the issue, like the health history of a candidate or a candidate's relative. Some focus on an opponent's role in the lawsuit. Many House campaigns are using health care as part of attack ads against Republican incumbents who voted last year for the American Health Care Act, which would have unwound major parts of the Affordable Care Act. Some ads talk about the Affordable Care Act directly, but many gesture at it more obliquely, with talk of pre-existing conditions alone.
Several states would like to expand Medicaid in a more limited way, capping eligibility at the poverty level, or $12,140 for an individual. In states that have not expanded Medicaid, eligibility varies. Parents with incomes over half the poverty level are often ineligible, and most adults without dependent children are ineligible, no matter how poor they are.
The advertisement, Mr. McCain's first television ad of the election cycle, began airing on Tuesday on network affiliates in Phoenix. It replays an interview in which Ms. Kirkpatrick declares that the health care law is the vote she is most proud of, while recounting problems with the new insurance coverage in Arizona, including premium increases and the withdrawal from the plan by a major insurer.
I don't know anybody who's afraid of the 2-cent wealth tax who isn't already a billionaire.
If you buy insurance from a broker, it may not be obvious whether a given plan will be a short-term plan or a more comprehensive Obamacare-compliant plan, unless you ask. Both insurers and brokers who help connect people with the plans will have an incentive to sell them.
The slippage has especially hurt children — a recent analysis of new census data by The Times found that the number of children without insurance rose by more than 400,000 between 2016 and 2018.
Trump keeps expanding Kushner's bloated portfolio while leaving key agencies woefully understaffed, and that's a sign that he doesn't know how government works, said a former Bush administration official who has had extensive dealings with Kushner.
And that's the next few years, but it's very much a party wrestling over its own identity.
So the effect is that the promises that are put into trade agreements like T.P.P., they may all look the same on paper, but man, they are nowhere close to each other in terms of what happens with enforcement. Multinational corporations are given the opportunity basically to opt out of laws they don't like, where protections that are supposed to be written for our workers, for the worldwide environment, for human rights standards, just get left by the curb.
And so candidates here held more than 20 events today, under the ever-present shadow of the 2016 primary.
If you already have Obamacare coverage, but you have received unemployment insurance any time this year, you now qualify for additional assistance. You should go back to the marketplace to make sure you are signed up for that extra benefit once it is set up.
To Needham, there was only one way to look at the matter. What's the point in having a conservative party if we're not going to fight a massive federal intervention in health care? he told me. It's one-sixth of our economy!
I'm sorry, but you can do it if you roll back the filibuster. I stood on the floor of the Senate when we had those votes.
JI: People were opposed to it until ——
There is a brief discussion among Democrats at that time of trying to do a single-payer system, a more universal system, where everyone gets something like Medicare, but that really, even at that time, is very much a fringe view among Democrats. The consensus idea that President Obama and the Democrats in Congress want to do is something that sort of expands on our current system, where you still have a lot of different private insurers. People have a lot of choice.
Well, when most people look at these presidential primaries, particularly in a state like Wisconsin, they think that this is just about the two candidates at the top — Joe Biden versus Bernie Sanders, and who gets the delegates out of that. But the reason why Wisconsin was holding out and keeping its primary schedule was really to do with more state and local concerns. Initially, the Democratic governor, Tony Evers, and state Republican leaders were on the same page. They both agreed that the April 7 election should go forward. And they said so for a couple reasons. Not only had the virus not really ravaged the state in the same way that we have seen in other parts of the country at the initial time in March when they were making this decision, but they agreed on the importance of the state and local races that would be decided down ballot on the same day of the presidential primary.
DOYLESTOWN, Pa. — Five years ago, the Affordable Care Act had yet to begin its expansion of health insurance to millions of Americans, but Jeff Brahin was already stewing about it.
And so when somebody — when I was first thinking about running for president, somebody said to me, Primaries are hard. You've never been in one and they're hard, because the people you think are going to be your friends turn out not to be your friends. And ——
The insurance industry, which usually supports tight limits on insurance enrollments, is backing the extra enrollment period now. Around 15 million Americans are uninsured and eligible for marketplace coverage, according to a recent analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Most would qualify for some form of financial assistance if they bought such coverage — and about four million could sign up for a high-deductible plan that would cost them nothing in premiums. For the four million people who could be getting free coverage who are instead uninsured — that, to me, is screaming out for outreach, said Cynthia Cox, a vice president at the foundation and a co-author of the analysis. It remains unclear how many people lost health insurance last year because of the pandemic, but most working-age Americans receive coverage through their employers, and millions have lost jobs. Enrollment in Medicaid, the public health insurance program for the poor and disabled, has grown substantially during the pandemic. And consumer advocates say there are also many Americans who were uninsured before but might want coverage now because of the public health crisis. Several states that run their own marketplaces established special enrollment periods last year and saw increased sign-ups.
What beloved local business have you lost in the pandemic? We'd like to hear about it. After 117 years in business, Harrell's Department Store in Burgaw, N.C., became a casualty of the pandemic. Credit... Jeremy M. Lange for The New York Times The economic upheaval caused by the pandemic is changing communities across the country as hundreds of thousands of businesses close, leading to lost livelihoods and empty storefronts. Many of these businesses were neighborhood pillars, beloved locales that we returned to over and over again. In your neighborhood, maybe it was the bar where you met friends after work, the restaurant where your family celebrated birthdays or the bookstore where you loved to browse. Now they are gone. The New York Times would like to hear from you about a local business that has shut down. Why was it special to you, and what do you miss about it? How is its absence altering the fabric of your community? Tell us about it here. We may contact you with a few follow-up questions. And if you can, please share a photo of the business as well.
The rule as it is right now, called Rule 22, it is an attempt to bring cloture — which should be closure, but it's very confusing. They changed the S to a T, and now everybody is confused about it. So right now, the rule allocates certain amounts of time for debate. So all you really have to do is decide what you want those amounts of times to be. It could be three days. It could be five days. It could be a week. But basically, it would say after this allocation of time, a majority can vote to end debate. The minority would have to use that time to its fullest. And if they don't use that time at any point, the majority would be allowed to quickly end debate and move to a final vote. Maybe people don't want a debate a bill for a week. No one's going to force them to debate it for a week if they don't want to. But let's say a week is the maximum. After that maximum amount of debate time is used, a majority could vote to end debate. The bill would then, in a day or so, move to the final stage. It would vote up or down, and the world could move on. The issue would pass or fail, majority rule, the way a democracy should work. Things would actually start getting done.
While I wholeheartedly agree with Michelle Goldberg's argument that it would be nothing short of poetic justice for President Trump to lose re-election in 2020 to a female Democrat, I worry that she is too optimistic about a female Democrat's chances in a general election, even if she can get through the competitive Democratic primary.
I don't need a poll to tell Donald Trump it's not good to say that John McCain is a loser because he was captured in a time of war.
CW: Sure. And they have too much power, not just in an economy, they have too much power in a democracy, and they keep consolidating and expanding — are you worried about individual employees there? You know, Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel.
Mr. Trump isn't the first to mount a pressure campaign on NATO member states to increase their contributions. President Bush used a summit in Latvia in 2006 to urge other nations to raise their military spending, and President Obama echoed the plea at a 2014 conference in Brussels. Mr. Trump, though, has made spending levels a more central issue.
Vice President Biden has cast the Medicare for all plan as anti-labor, arguing that unions have already painstakingly negotiated health care benefits, progress that could be undone by a single-payer system. But Senators Warren and Sanders argue that the plan is pro-labor because it would mean union members are guaranteed health care and can focus their negotiations on wage increases, family leave and other benefits.
Tomorrow's my birthday, so this is like a little birthday special.
But it's not going to be real change because so long as the lobbyists are writing it, so long as they're the ones who are in the ears of the folks in the House and the Senate, we're just going to keep making little, tiny changes, and I just don't think we can keep doing that.

Forty-two percent of Americans in that survey favored a single-payer system along the lines of what Mr. Sanders is proposing, while 31 percent opposed it and 25 percent did not take a position. Views of the Affordable Care Act are split right down the middle, with 50 percent approving of it and 48 percent disapproving of it in an April poll by Gallup.
Five and a half years —
Three people who stormed the Capitol tried to recruit a large following ahead of time, prosecutors say. A 15-page court document is latest indication that the authorities believe the violence at the Capitol was a coordinated and planned attack. Credit... Jason Andrew for The New York Times One person who stormed the Capitol, a self-described leader of a militia group, solicited recruits shortly after Election Day for a basic training class ahead of the inauguration, prosecutors claim in an indictment filed Wednesday, the latest indication that the authorities believe the violence at the Capitol was a coordinated and planned attack. In a 15-page court document, prosecutors brought new allegations against three rioters who they said had connections to militia groups, claiming that they initiated a plan to recruit as large a following as possible ahead of Jan. 6. Jessica Marie Watkins of Champaign County, Ohio, who prosecutors say was a member of the far-right Oath Keepers, sent messages to a number of potential recruits for the Ohio State Regular Militia just six days after the November election. Donovan Ray Crowl, 50, whom the F.B.I. has identified as a member of the same Ohio militia group, attended a training camp in North Carolina in December. Ms. Watkins, 38, who described herself on social media as a commanding officer of the Ohio group, told the recruits that the group was planning a weeklong Basic Training class in early January.
So the way I see this is I think the old left-right division, yeah, there's a lot of that. But I think there's a very different division in America, and that is an America that's working for a thinner and thinner slice at the top and not working for much of anyone else. And there are a lot of Democrats, a lot of independents and a lot of Republicans who see that.
Mary Trump's new book aptly calls him the world's most dangerous man in its title. Mr. Trump is a drowning man who won't hesitate to pull his country down with him.
Farhad, let's end here with some advice from you. I was talking about your column with my 15-year-old. And I was expressing some skepticism. I'm one of those grammarian prissies who feels anxious about the difference between the singular and the plural. And my 15-year-old said to me, yeah, but, Dad, language changes. And so for people who were intrigued by the argument that you're making, how would you encourage them to make the language they use in everyday life a little bit less gendered?
Everything Mr. Trump has done so far suggests that even if he were able to identify the most knowledgeable people in the world on any subject, he probably wouldn't listen to them anyway.
Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is one of the Democratic presidential contenders who favor this kind of buy-in, often called the public option. They view it as a more gradual, politically pragmatic alternative to the Medicare-for-all proposal championed by Senator Bernie Sanders, which would abolish private health insurance altogether.

This sort of mandate is not the most efficient way to reduce carbon emissions, as economists like to point out. It requires regulators to choose reasonable benchmarks for different companies — or to set a uniform one that all must meet. Carbon pricing, if aggressive enough, encourages bigger reductions from companies that can cut their emissions more cheaply.

I think Medicare for all is the right solution.
Then there are all the other ways that the wealthy influence policy, without getting involved in elections — through media, lobbying and philanthropy. Each channel is legitimate and most efforts to restrict them would create more problems than they solved. What Mr. Sanders calls the billionaire class will not lose its influence even after all the court decisions back to 1976 have been reversed.
And I came here to talk with you all about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And the very short version of this story is I went around Washington talking to people about how, do not in this crisis, simply outlaw the practices that were bad, that were used on the mortgages, that are used on credit cards, because they'll be like fence posts on the prairie with nothing strong in between. And it'll take the banks and Wall Street about three minutes to figure out how to run around them by redescribing their product or slightly reinventing their product. I think you've got to have an agency that when Wall Street moves, the agency can move. That's how financial crises — it's the only way we're going to make this work.
Look what Frances Perkins got accomplished, first in Albany, but then when she went down to Washington. So here's a woman, she goes to Albany at a time when women don't even have the vote and gets herself appointed the head of a fire commission. And by the way, every time you see one of those lit-up fire exit signs, thank Frances Perkins, O.K.? But she not only does that, she then immediately expands it into labor law and workers and worker safety and worker protection overall. As you know, she then goes down to Washington, becomes the first woman cabinet official, and look at what she gets done in a short period of time. Social security, minimum wage, right to join a union, end of child labor, the weekend, my personal favorite [LAUGHTER], that Saturdays and Sundays are not treated like Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. But think about it that way. So we start with the corruption. That's what Perkins started with. She started by outing the corruption.
there's a decent case to be made that many Democratic elected officials are indeed representing their working- and middle-class constituents by taking moderately liberal positions on most economic issues.
His remarks about Mr. Sanders on Wednesday amounted to some of his most sustained criticism of his rival to date, part of an energetic performance in which Mr. Biden was by turns punchy — when discussing politics — and emotional, such as when he discussed grief or cancer.
This interview was conducted by the editorial board of The New York Times, which will announce its Democratic primary endorsement on Jan. 19.
Mara Gay: Actually, that's a perfect point for me to just ask you a question that's related. My family is from Michigan, and U.A.W. workers. One of the last things that they really love, many of them, is their health care. So I guess my question is, is both a practical one and a political one, which is why not try and expand health care access without actually taking away programs that people already like? Is there a way to do that? Is there even a way to get to what you're talking about without talking about it in such dogmatic political terms, and how do you — this is I guess the most important part of the question, I think, is how do you make the pitch to a U.A.W. worker that what you can offer is actually better than what they already have?
Marc Benioff, the billionaire founder of Salesforce, is leading a group of companies buying piles of personal protective equipment for hospitals.

JI: Let me try to frame it a different way. What do you say to critics who would argue that it will take so much political capital just to enact the first portion of this plan, the aggressive public option that you've laid out, that it would be essentially impossible to then segue to a Medicare for all? You'll spend so much capital getting that first part that it seems — people have said it seems like a pipe dream to say we're going to have this aggressive public option, and then we're going to have Medicare for all three years later.
One good thing is that the bill's stimulus, flawed as it is, still might give the economy a further short-term boost and undo more of the Great Recession's damage. Another good thing is the child tax credit increase that Rubio and Lee did win, which is much too modest but still a step toward the family policy the United States needs. A third good thing is the bill's willingness to raise taxes on the not-quite-rich upper-middle class, a constituency whose influence is often bad for the country and whose liberal drift and blue-state concentration has left Democrats leery of any confrontation.
In years past, Obamacare was the stuff of Republican attack ads. No more.
During a 10-day break for the Supreme Court in April 2012, several justices left Washington to give lectures or take short vacations. But both John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy remained in Washington, and Roberts used the time to try to win over Kennedy on Obamacare.
Therefore, one of my priorities as chair will be to try to understand how policies will impact all in our country as we strive to ensure the economy works for everyone. Cecilia Rouse, President Biden's pick to lead the White House Council of Economic Advisers, testified to the Senate Banking Committee on how she would lead a recovery in the wake of the pandemic. Credit Credit... Kriston Jae Bethel for The New York Times Cecilia Rouse, a Princeton University economist who is President Biden's pick to lead the White House Council of Economic Advisers, told a Senate committee this morning that Congress must take action to shore up an economic recovery that has left many Americans behind. As deeply distressing as this pandemic and economic fallout have been, she said, it is also an opportunity to rebuild the economy better than it was before — making it work for everyone by increasing the availability of fulfilling jobs and leaving no one vulnerable to falling through the cracks. In a hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Ms. Rouse said that if confirmed, she will make it a priority for the council to gather more detailed data, in order to better see how economic policies are affecting nonwhite Americans in particular. Too often economists focus on average outcomes, instead of examining a range of outcomes, she said.
Community rating is also important for Obamacare's online insurance marketplaces. Now, people who want health insurance can go to one website and shop for plans, comparing benefits, deductibles and prices. They can choose a plan and sign up within hours.
Several members of the Trump family have come under fire for profiting from Donald Trump's administration in possible violation of the emoluments clause, including Ivanka Trump, who was paid more than $1 million from her ties to the Trump Organization last year. And former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter held a lucrative position on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. In late September, Ms. Warren was, in the words of one reporter, uncharacteristically flustered when asked about the Biden matter.
Margot, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
Well, after days of other Republicans expressing public discomfort with where the president was headed —
Medicare for All or Public Option?
Democrats, of course, also tend to oppose Republican presidents' policies and often try to obstruct them. But on the question of legislative compromise, there really has been a recent difference between the parties. (Which can be a difficult thing for us journalists to acknowledge: We're more comfortable portraying the parties as mirror images of each other.)
The Green New Deal obviously cannot wish away the costs of replacing dirty energy. Government subsidies for clean energy require tax dollars, and performance standards for utilities will almost certainly cause prices to rise. But as the experience in California, among other places, has shown, a switch to cleaner energy is not as expensive as many people fear. The price of solar and wind power has fallen sharply in recent years and will most likely fall further. The problem with the failed carbon-pricing schemes of recent years has not been the actual price increases they would inflict on families but the perceived price increases. Either a carbon tax or a Green New Deal would impose manageable costs, but those incurred by the Green New Deal are likely to be less visible.
At times, however, what looked like the right thing was, from Needham's vantage, in fact the wrong thing. In April 2011, for example, a bill dismantling part of Obamacare did clear the House and then the Senate, and was signed into law by President Obama without hesitation. It was a measure to eliminate the requirement that small companies submit 1099 forms for all transactions exceeding $600, which essentially served as a tax to help pay for the program and which Heritage Action had condemned as burdensome and onerous, guaranteed to generate paperwork and high accounting fees.
But what about the problems that sank the repeal effort in 2017? Surely Republicans have spent the past year rethinking their policy ideas, trying to come up with ways to undo the A.C.A. without inflicting enormous harm on ordinary Americans, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions. Right?
I happen to believe — and I know not everybody agrees with me — I believe that health care is a right of all people.
So I had this really interesting and instructive experience about a year ago. I went with Bernie Sanders to Toronto, and we went on a tour of the Canadian health care system. And I would say that Canada's system is the closest analog to what a lot of these politicians are proposing. And one thing that just really struck me about Canada is that people are all in on the values piece. There is just a real sense of kind of social solidarity around the idea that health care is a right, and everyone should have it in the country, and there shouldn't be any restrictions, and that it should be sort of radically fair. And that just struck me culturally as so different. And the thing that I couldn't untangle when I was in Canada is, do they have those values because they have that system, or do they have that system because they already had those values? And I think, you know, part of what will be interesting if Democrats, you know, retake power, and if they start moving us on this path towards something more like single-payer is, how hard will it be to shift those values? We see them. There definitely are people in the Democratic base who believe them deeply in their hearts, but I don't think that most Americans feel that health care is a fundamental right and that everyone should have it. And I don't know if that will change.
Mine was words and his was action -Trump about Bill Clinton.Lots to unpack, but Trump is accused of attempted rape https://t.co/7gNtGpJC76 — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
Nick Fox: What did you think of the standards in the Trans-Pacific deal?
Mr. Trump said Mr. Mueller was running an office rife with conflicts of interest and warned investigators against delving into matters too far afield from Russia. Mr. Trump never said he would order the Justice Department to fire Mr. Mueller, nor would he outline circumstances under which he might do so. But he left open the possibility as he expressed deep grievance over an investigation that has taken a political toll in the six months since he took office.
JI: So this is an incremental plan that you've talked about, right? So your first hundred days you have essentially two health care plans, right? You have one that — would enact ——
With Democrats making health care central to their 2020 campaigns, Mr. Trump has been facing pressure to propose his own health care overhaul. He has repeatedly promised to release one. The administration is backing legal action pressing to declare the entire health law unconstitutional, and if it wins in court, the result could be a wave of disruption as an estimated 20 million Americans lose health insurance, insurance consumer protections crumble, drug approval pathways disappear, and Medicare fraud statutes are weakened, among many other effects.
Whether a president can truly improve, or damage, an economy remains an open question. The greatest economic power might in fact remain in the hands of the Federal Reserve. Economists credit the Fed's policy of keeping interest rates at historic lows with helping to pump up the economy and bring unemployment down. At the same time, the Fed has been blamed for widening inequality, swelling the price of real estate and corporate profits, even as savers and retirees dependent on fixed-income assets have suffered.
KK: You seem to have avoided that approach for the most part. Can you just explain why?
I've already made the pitch, and I actually had several unions say that it's a really good approach. I don't remember if the U.A.W. was one of them.
The campaign declined to comment further.
A fair statement of the G.O.P.'s position would be this: We're sad that our chosen candidate expresses himself in an openly racist manner. But we still want our racist candidate to become America's next president. So we urge Donald Trump to keep his racist views to himself for now.
The roughly 60,000 members of the union's Local 226 rarely pay out of pocket for routine medical care. They can undergo surgery without receiving a hefty surprise bill months later. They can visit the same one-stop medical clinic for urgent care, vision, dental and the pharmacy. The clinic was a regular stop for many of the 2020 candidates.
And yet everyone still seems committed to holding this election?
Congress is debating repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, spurring concerns that more Americans may lose health coverage and become more vulnerable to medical debt. People with health insurance are less likely to have medical debt, but even those with health coverage have trouble paying medical bills on time, institute researchers noted.
No. Not — slightly is not the right term.
One could argue that it has already proved problematic for Senator Elizabeth Warren, who has been one of Medicare for all's top champions in this race, along with Senator Bernie Sanders, who has been touting the idea nationally since his 2016 presidential run. Under pressure to explain how she would pay for her proposal, in November Ms. Warren released a detailed accounting of where the estimated $20.5 trillion that her plan would cost over 10 years would come from.
Day 2 of the impeachment trial. Many senators became emotional after House impeachment managers presented previously unreleased security footage of the Capitol riot, showing how close some lawmakers came to encountering the attackers.
You know on part of this, I think part of the answer is current law enforcement. You correctly describe it, in harassing people, in trespassing. And we need to make sure at federal, state, and local levels that people who are seeking health care of any kind have access to that health care and are not denied that opportunity. I think our laws are there. I think the weakness is our failure to enforce. That's how I see now. If there are gaps in that, I'm certainly open to understanding them better, but that's how I see it.
But one piece of context has gone little noticed: The Republican bill would actually result in more people being uninsured than if Obamacare were simply repealed. Getting rid of the major coverage provisions and regulations of Obamacare would cost 23 million Americans their health insurance, according to another recent C.B.O. report. In other words, one million more Americans would have health insurance with a clean repeal than with the Republican replacement plan, according to C.B.O. estimates.
While Mr. Trump lorded over Twitter, important lessons for him lurked, unwatched, on YouTube.
Did you mean that when you said that stuff about Trump?
One of them is use march-in orders on prescription drugs. We can bring down the cost of EpiPens and insulin and other drugs, so that we save families literally hundreds of millions of dollars. It can be done without Mitch McConnell. The power is already there. You've just got to be willing to pick it up and use it. Nobody else has talked about picking it up and using it.
So the way I see this is all I can do is get out and tell you what I'll fight for, and I'll point out the difference between the two. I try not to get over my skis. No, I do. I've really tried hard not to be personally critical of other candidates. I got a little heated once, but once, and because I think this is the fundamental question. Do you think that this democracy, do you think that this economy, do you think this government is going to make it if all we're offering are little nibbles around the edges?
Democrats have also failed to build a strong bench of candidates. This year, Democrats did not even field a candidate in some districts. In others, the Democratic candidate seems too weak to create a competitive race. The Republican group that oversees its House campaigns recently chortled about the Democrats' embarrassing recruiting failures and primary losses for their chosen candidates.
Oh, I believe that we need Medicare for all.
I'm told by insiders that when Trump's long-shot campaign led to victory, he and Kushner became convinced not only that they'd tapped into something that everybody was missing about America, but that they'd tapped into something that everybody was missing about the two of them.
The past week's images from Australia have been nightmarish: walls of flame, blood-red skies, residents huddled on beaches as they try to escape the inferno. The bush fires have been so intense that they have generated fire tornadoes powerful enough to flip over heavy trucks.
Characterizations of Congress as a gerontocracy are often accompanied by complaints about the ruinous gluttony of the baby boom generation, which encompasses people from about Donald Trump's age down to mine, 54. We're rightly charged with befouling the environment, running up the debt and letting the American dream slip away from the middle class.
The era of the era of big government is over is over.
Republican senators have been able to dodge that question for months while the matter was in the House, but not any longer. And you can already see how uncomfortable it makes them by the way Senator Martha McSally literally ran away from and denounced a CNN reporter when he asked her if the Senate should consider new evidence as part of the impeachment trial. There is a reason McSally fled.

Critics of Senator Warren's student debt plan say it would unfairly benefit those on the path to becoming highly paid professionals.
I think if you're trying to understand those roots of the left and right and if you're trying to understand Burke and Paine that way, there are some great collections of the two of them. The challenge with Edmund Burke, who I think is just really essential to read for understanding modern conservatism in the West, is that he was a politician. He ran for office every two or three years, the entire time that he was writing everything that he wrote, so everything he wrote is directed to some dispute of the moment and requires a lot of context. But I think the collections of Burke's writings, put together, for example, by The Liberty Fund or put together in various readers — Yale Press has a great one — really do give you a sense of the nature of the arguments that he made. You should start by reading some of his speeches about America, which are really exceptionally interesting and profound and still tell us something about ourselves. And you should end up reading the Reflections on the Revolution in France, which was his deepest and fullest expression of his political views and is an extraordinarily powerful piece of writing.
It may, however, depend on whether Americans' incomes and living standards are consistently rising.
The mandate, which many Republicans criticize, was created to keep insurance affordable for those who are older or sick.
In fact, the Trump administration is already trying to take away those protections via the courts. It probably won't succeed. But it might, in which case an estimated 17 million Americans would lose their health coverage.
We're going to have that party who lost a bunch of seats on that in 2018 versus a party that we argue with each other about the best way to try to make sure that people get health care coverage, but at least we're trying to move in that direction. And this is a salient, personal, human fact. Your health care, your housing, getting your kids educated, getting your kids taken care of in child care. Every single one of those, I like where we are. I like where I am in this fight because I think it's the right fight to have and I think we must be in this fight. We cannot take a pass on this.
Texas did run a high-risk pool, established in the late 1990s, in which those denied in the individual market could seek coverage. But patients seeking coverage would face a one-year waiting period to sign up and premiums twice as high as those in the general insurance market. The Duke Health Justice Clinic estimates the plan had only 24,972 enrollees as of 2011, a small share of the 4.5 million Texas residents with pre-existing conditions.
Where can I get help choosing a health plan?
AK: Sure. I'm really interested in the student loan debt issue, but there's a concern that your plan to forgive student debt really tilts a lot of resources towards the wealthy. So only 2 percent of borrowers have more than $50,000 in debt. A third of all student debt is owned by people in the top income quartile, and most student debt goes to households with advanced degrees. So these are doctors and lawyers, and they've amassed a lot of debt, but they're also investing in their own educational capacity to pay off that debt. So I'm just wondering how you square that with a plan that goes about forgiving student debt?
This time around, the federal government is expected to spend $50 million on marketing and outreach efforts, to let people know that low-cost coverage is available, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which administers HealthCare.gov. The Trump administration had cut advertising for the marketplace by 90 percent.
And in the U.S., the death toll surpassed 10,000 people and congressional leaders began talks about a second economic relief package that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi predicted could cost more than $1 trillion.
I talk about Citizens United, although that one again is either going to take constitutional amendment or some change in the personnel at the Supreme Court to reslice that issue. But I think it is important to keep that one on the table. And I talk about it because when I close, I talk about why those three things are related to each other.
Now, that's only for collective bargaining agreements, but that's real money in the pockets of those union numbers. Secondly, what at least some of the unions liked about this is the unions never have to bargain on this one again, once you get all the way to Medicare for all, because their workers will have health care coverage. Which means they can bargain once again over wages and working conditions and keeping jobs here in the United States instead of having to go back to their members year after year after year and say: We just bargained. Great for you. Your salary will go up one half of 1 percent, and your deductible will only go up by another $2,000.
But it's just not the case that a minority party can force the majority party to do what it wants if only it summons enough righteous anger. It never has been. It's another version of the Green Lantern Theory of politics — that if you care enough and try hard enough, you can do anything.
The president did issue a call for bipartisan cooperation, and he invoked the heroism of World War II to celebrate a shared history. But on the issues that have rived Washington during Mr. Trump's turbulent presidency, he did not give an inch.
AK: O.K. No, I mean, it's not my critique. This is a critique on the left as well, you know, that going about forgiving student debt in this way puts a lot of money in households that are going to make a lot of money.
After the indictment was released, Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House, called for Mr. Acosta to resign. Attorney General William Barr recused himself from the case, saying his former law firm had represented Mr. Epstein.
A nationwide poll conducted by SurveyMonkey for The New York Times found that six in 10 Americans support a wealth tax. The slice of the electorate least likely to support it is Republican men with college degrees.
KK: It's a very bad idea for the children to ——
Exactly. A 2-cent wealth tax just means if you don't lift a finger, your fortune only grows at 4 percent, 6 percent, 8 percent. And yet how many people in this country who are so sophisticated and knowledgeable — right — say you could never get a wealth tax because the billionaires and millionaires won't let it happen? Well, what the hell? This is a democracy.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions said that it is a rare case for the Justice Department not to defend provisions of a law but added that he could not find any reasonable arguments to support their constitutionality.
In a democracy, how is it that they have so much political influence that one-tenth of 1 percent can say, I rather your kid have to deal with $50,000 in student loan debt, and I'd rather you never get a chance to get a child into day care, which means you either piece stuff together in crazy ways or quit your job. And I'd rather your public schools still have tiles falling out of the ceiling and textbooks that are 11 years old than that the top one-tenth of 1 percent has to pitch in 2 cents.
Watch a special endorsement episode of The Weekly This video excerpt has been edited by The Weekly.
United States troops have recently resumed counterterrorism operations in Syria, suggesting that President Trump intends to leave most of the 500 troops currently stationed there (many of them in combat). Mr. Trump has been inconsistent in his strategy on troops in Syria; Senator Warren has been firm in her stance that all combat troops should come home.
I have to say, you almost have to admire the sheer brazenness of the dishonesty here . For the bill Hawley touts is a fraud: It's full of loopholes allowing insurers to discriminate in ways that would end up making essential health care unaffordable for those who need it most. For example, while it would require that they offer insurance to, say, cancer patients, it would allow them to sell policies that don't cover cancer treatment — which would mean that policies that did cover such treatment would become prohibitively expensive.
They assume that congressional leaders have the ability to direct what in effect would be gigantic energy firms and gigantic investment houses without giving sweetheart deals to vested interests, without getting corrupted by this newfound power, without letting the whole thing get swallowed up by incompetence. (This is a Congress that can't pass a budget.)
Several candidates made pitches for the direction of the Democratic party. Representative Eric Swalwell of California directly went after Mr. Biden's age, and Mr. Sanders pivoted from a question about diversity in the party to reiterate his economic message.
SS: So you mean getting rid of the combat troops there now, or preclude sending any combat troops there in the future?
Medicare beneficiaries would face changes to medical care and possibly higher premiums.
No, my concerns are about what will happen if either man wins. Are they ready for the political trench warfare that would inevitably follow a Democratic victory?
If the next president were able to sign an ambitious version of the Green New Deal, it would not be nearly enough to solve the climate crisis. The problem is enormous and global. But most scientists believe that a large reduction in carbon emissions over the next few decades could greatly reduce the destruction — and a large reduction in emissions remains possible.
Hong Kong on Wednesday lifted a lockdown on a cluster of buildings after 11 hours, part of a new campaign to impose targeted restrictions on neighborhoods with coronavirus outbreaks. The lockdown in the densely populated, working-class Yau Ma Tei neighborhood is the second that the government has imposed during the pandemic. The first came into effect on Saturday amid concerns that the virus was spreading rapidly in tenement apartments. It was lifted about 48 hours later, after officials found 13 new infections among the roughly 7,000 residents they had tested. The Chinese territory's leader, Carrie Lam, called the operation a success and promised ambush-style lockdowns in the future. Officials said on Wednesday that they had discovered one infection during the second lockdown, out of about 300 residents tested.
BA: What is the right stance?
It was a scene that underscored a challenge facing the U.S. economy and one that may be the driving factor behind greater inequality: We're not only losing jobs to overseas competition, we're losing them to technology. Obama noted the robots, too. We just saw here those robots were pretty impressive, but also pointed to the direction the economy is going, he said.
Alex Kingsbury: The Trump administration has made an effort to get Europeans to pay more for their own defense as being part of NATO. Is that a goal that you support even if you don't support the way he's going about it? And how might you achieve those goals?
Can you see me? [LAUGHTER] Think I'm getting taller, and you guys are getting smaller.
Under Mr. Trump's new rule, however, such plans can last for 364 days and can be renewed for up to three years. That rule joins an earlier one that allowed businesses to join together to create association health plans that also evade the Affordable Care Act's strictures. In effect, these rules are creating a cheap form of junk coverage that does not have to meet the higher standards of Obamacare. This sort of splintering of the insurance markets is not allowed under the Affordable Care Act as Congress drafted it.
I've already made the pitch, and I actually had several unions say that it's a really good approach. I don't remember if the U.A.W. was one of them.
— opponent, and I was calling Trump a race-baiting, religious —
Senator Warren called for the House of Representatives to begin impeachment inquiry proceedings against Mr. Trump as early as April 2019.
CW: Can I ask about that?
Medicare is a uniquely popular government program. People really love it. It provides them with a lot of financial security. People pay taxes into the program, so they feel like it's an earned benefit. It's something that they deserve. But meanwhile, everyone else is in a health insurance program that is getting a little bit more rickety. There are some people who get really great insurance through their work, but there are a lot of other people who are sort of falling through the cracks — if they're between jobs, if they work for a company that doesn't provide insurance. The system for people in Medicare is that everyone gets it and they all get the same thing. The system for the rest of us is, it really depends on who you are, and who you work for, and what your financial situation is.
It's so good, and I think it's great because it's not a happy tale. And I think it really gets into that ambivalence that you feel as a child and helping think through some of the tougher parts of childhood. But it's been a big hit for both our kids. And it's definitely my favorite.
In response to Thursday's executive orders on health care, you report, lawmakers from both parties have urged the president to continue the payments, voicing concern over how ending the subsidies would affect their constituents. If only our president shared this concern. He clearly does not care how his actions (or tweets) affect anyone but himself.
Senator Warren's anti-corruption plan includes provisions to extend conflict-of-interest laws to the president and vice president, compel government to divest from privately owned assets and restrict the ability of lobbyists to be hired for government jobs. It takes aim in particular at many of the practices that the Trump family has used to profit from office, which The Times has editorialized against.
However, girtherism isn't the real issue here; as David Axelrod says, a waist is a terrible thing to mind. The point, instead, is that running veterans' health is a management, not medical, job — and Jackson has no managerial experience.
The insurance industry, which usually supports tight limits on insurance enrollments, is backing the extra enrollment period now. Around 15 million Americans are uninsured and eligible for marketplace coverage, according to a recent analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Most would qualify for some form of financial assistance if they bought such coverage — and about four million could sign up for a high-deductible plan that would cost them nothing in premiums.
There's another flaw in the bill, however, one that exposes it to serious legal challenge: It's racially discriminatory.
The logic here has been clear from the beginning. To ensure coverage of people with pre-existing conditions, you have to prohibit insurers from discriminating based on medical history. But that's not enough: To provide a decent risk pool, you also have to induce healthy people to sign up, preferably with both subsidies and a penalty for being uninsured. In other words, you need a system that is basically Obamacare.
That history still seemed fresh in 2010, when Palin backed another Republican, Joe Miller, a friend of Palin's husband and a Tea Party favorite, in his challenge to Lisa Murkowski in the Republican Senate primary. I think she's out for her own self-interest, Murkowski said of Palin on the evening of the election. To the surprise of many Alaskans, Miller won. Do you believe in miracles? Palin tweeted to her followers.
About 60 million people are covered under Medicare, the federal insurance program that covers people over 65 years old and people with disabilities. Even though the main aim of the A.C.A. was to overhaul the health insurance markets, the law touches virtually every part of Medicare, said Tricia Neuman, a senior vice president for the Kaiser Family Foundation, which did an analysis of the law's repeal. Overturning the law would be very disruptive, she said.
And no longer will this nation refuse the hand of justice to those who have given a lifetime of service and wisdom and labor to the progress of this progressive country. [MUSIC]
But Republicans still hate the idea of helping Americans get health care. So instead of releasing the kraken, they've brought on the termites. Rather than trying to eliminate Obamacare in one fell swoop, they're trying to undermine it with multiple acts of sabotage — while hoping voters won't realize who's responsible for rising premiums and falling coverage.
And you're saying you didn't get that vibe from Sgt. Crowley? I didn't get that vibe from him. When we were called into the Oval Office, I said to the president, Mr. President, we had a great conversation in the library. He said, Oh, it sounds like it's all settled. The actual beer summit was us doing small talk. And the reason Joe Biden was there is that the Cambridge police had insisted that because there were going to be two black guys at the table, they wanted two white guys at the table! They had sent somebody involved in the Cambridge police structure to be there. As we were walking out to the Rose Garden, somehow that guy got pushed to the side, and Joe Biden jumped in the line. That's what nobody ever figured out: Why is Biden at the table? He was there to be the second white guy.
Remember, Trump did not run for president as an orthodox conservative Republican. He embraced social programs and so-called entitlements, rejecting the party's boilerplate on government and the economy. I'm not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican, and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid, he said during the campaign. Elaborating on health care, he told CBS News that everybody's got to be covered, which he called an un-Republican thing to say. I am going to take care of everybody, he added. I don't care if it costs me votes or not.
I think he's a kook. I think he's crazy. I think he's unfit for office.
That said, the critics' disappointment stems from a profoundly decent instinct. They're worried about Dreamers being ripped from their lives in this country. I share the worry — and the anger at Republican leaders who refuse to solve this problem.
Polling has consistently shown Senator Warren to be in the top tier of candidates, but not the front of the pack. She trails Joe Biden — and Donald Trump — in key swing states.
I just lost my job with benefits, but my family still has some income.
Did you feel like in any way you had an audience in the White House?
It's hard to predict precisely who will choose what. The administration wrote in its rule proposals that it didn't anticipate either the short-term or association plans to be very popular, even as it lauded them as important alternatives to the current options under the health law. The new options may mostly attract people who are uninsured now, because they were priced out of the current market. Outside experts think the alternatives could siphon away a substantial percentage of healthy people from the Obamacare markets.
I'll defend the Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the Trump administration. That I can do all by myself.
You're asking the fundamental question about how you break them up. This was the question for Standard Oil. How did they break up Standard Oil? They ended up doing it actually by geography back in those days, but that's obviously a very different world from the world we live in right now.
And again, he really was stopped.
Notice that I said related to rather than caused by climate change. This is a distinction that has flummoxed many people over the years. Any individual weather event has multiple causes, which was one reason news reports used to avoid mentioning the possible role of climate change in natural disasters.
The recommendations make no mention of the Green New Deal, an ambitious plan that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and other supporters of Mr. Sanders have championed.
I'll defend the Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the Trump administration. That I can do all by myself.
Attorney General Jeff Sessions sent a letter to congressional leaders on Thursday notifying them that he would not defend the constitutionality of the individual mandate or the requirement for insurers to sell insurance to all applicants at standard rates — the guaranteed issue and community rating provisions.
I mean, one of the main ways we can kind of recognize this as a society and the importance of language for people who have worries about it is for cisgender people to start adopting this. I didn't think exactly that what I was advocating was to use language to change politics as much as language has to reflect how our culture and politics are changing. And the culture is changing, and we really have to match the language or at least turn out some wrinkles in the language in order to match how people feel and how the language reflects how they feel.
In a 6-to-3 decision, the justices ruled on Monday that gay and transgender people are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law. It was a stunning milestone in L.G.B.T.Q. progress. It was also a major slap at Trump, whose administration has gone perversely far out of its way not merely to halt advances during the Obama years but to turn back the clock.
Mr. Trump's rosy reassurances that trade wars are good, and easy to win have proved equally hollow. Farmers are not the only ones suffering. Manufacturers are paying higher prices. The instability is disrupting markets. Small wonder the latest Quinnipiac poll shows only 39 percent of Americans approve of the president's trade policies.
The number of people who have denounced Medicare for all as politically impractical continues to grow — the former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel called it a pipe dream in a recent Washington Post op-ed, in which he called on proponents to please explain to me exactly how we get that bill through the Senate?
Yeah. I mean, if you don't want to get re-elected, you're in the wrong business.
But he didn't get rid of it under Trump. Trump wanted to get rid of it, and he said no.
The American people would have to transition. Americans are more decentralized, diverse and individualistic than people in the nations with single-payer systems. They are more suspicious of centralized government and tend to dislike higher taxes.
KK: O.K., Kristen's going to kill me, but thank you so much for coming.
But the change in premiums would be significantly different, depending on age, because the Republican plan calls for charging more for older Americans than allowed under the current law.
Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement has created the most important vacancy on the Supreme Court in our lifetimes. Whoever fills Justice Kennedy's seat will join an evenly divided court with the ability to affect the laws of the United States and the rights of its citizens for generations. Enormously important issues hang in the balance: the right of workers to organize, the pernicious influence of dark money in politics, the right of Americans to marry who they love, the right to vote.
Pero eso era antes. Ahora, cinco meses después de haber dejado el cargo, Obama básicamente observa en silencio cómo su sucesor lanza un martillo contra distintos pilares de su legado. Ladrillo por ladrillo, el presidente Donald Trump está tratando de destruir lo que Obama construyó. ¿El tratado comercial? Cancelado. ¿El acuerdo climático? Olvídenlo. ¿Cuba? Un retroceso. ¿El seguro médico? Su destino todavía no está decidido, pero va a ser revocado si Trump logra navegar por las contracorrientes en el congreso.
JW: Senator, do you think that the House of Representatives is moving too quickly toward a vote on impeachment?
Donald Trump seems to have forgotten who he's running against. Donald, your opponent is HILLARY Clinton, not BILL Clinton. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
BS: Is it my imagination or are we hearing almost nothing about voter disenfranchisement in this campaign, when in fact we saw disenfranchisement actually tipped races in Florida and Georgia? And post-Obama, all kinds of disenfranchisement methods came online.
What this says to me is that if Republicans manage to hold on to Congress, they will make another all-out push to destroy the act — because they'll know that it's probably their last chance. Indeed, if they don't kill Obamacare soon, the next step will probably be an enhanced program that lets Americans of all ages buy into Medicare.
It is, of course, impossible to sum up a year — this one, more than most. It was grim and it was sobering and it was, at its heart, unbelievable. Any one of the major stories of the past 12 months would have riveted us. Any one of them felt like the story of a lifetime. The coronavirus pandemic. The killing of George Floyd and the protests and raw reckoning that followed. The wildfires that turned Western skies red with fury and razed whole towns. A deeply divisive presidential election and the bitter efforts to undo it.
All of them are supposed to be there for us, said JoAnn Johnson, 80, in an article on the front page of Sunday's Argus Leader in Sioux Falls, S.D., and we are lost in this.
The Justice Department did not challenge those provisions of the law. Indeed, it said, they can continue to operate without the individual mandate.
Maybe the question answers itself. (Speaking of election law, it was Justice Clarence Thomas who wrote in a separate opinion three years ago that he regarded the court's one person, one vote jurisprudence as lacking a sound basis.) Justice Samuel Alito? The new justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh? Shouldn't we assume that they care too? And if not, why not? As the clock ticks toward the 2020 census, just asking.
Ads that ran in the Los Angeles and San Diego media markets
To be fair, while Mr. Cohen's methods remain largely the same, his new show is framed differently, with less of an obvious emphasis on maneuvering high-profile victims into gotcha moments. (A segment with Sarah Palin, already well publicized, is not in the first episode, the only one Showtime provided to critics.) An introductory montage announces that four unique voices will reveal who is America, and while the echo of a news documentary unit is certainly meant to be parodic, Who Is America? doesn't always transcend the association. In place of the rough, anarchic glee of Ali G and Mr. Cohen's masterpiece, the feature film Borat, the humor in the new show has more of the studied, calculated texture common to the news-inflected late-night shows that have taken over topical comedy in his absence.
It's not totally clear that Texans who buy their own coverage are actually paying more, either. In Texas, 91 percent of Obamacare enrollees receive federal subsidies that lower the cost of their monthly premiums, and 59 percent get financial help that reduces their deductibles and co-payments.
Yeah, this is something I always want liberals to understand better about Mitch McConnell. He is not a unique, evil genius. He's simply somebody who correctly understands the incentives of the system that we have set up and that we allow to roll forward. And in a way, he's weaker than other Senate leaders. A lot of other Senate leaders, because of their feelings about the Senate, because of how they wanted to be remembered, they fought the incentives of our zero-sum electoral system. They fought against the currents that were happening in their time. And maybe they weren't entirely successful, but the thing McConnell does is capitulate to them. The thing McConnell does is say, OK, I am here to represent the Republican Party and to represent its interests. And so, obviously, my job is to maximize the Republican Party's power and strategic advantage under the rules to get the outcomes that I want. That isn't some crazy tactical insight. It's simply being unwilling to do what a lot of other leaders have done, which is show restraint because you're worried about where that path will lead. [MUSIC PLAYING] One of the things that I always try to tell people about the Senate — and because of your time there, I'd be curious to hear how much you think this is a viable way of explaining it.
And, in classic Trump fashion, he said: I've always won and I'm going to continue to win. And that's the way it is.
The House leadership aide said that repealing major provisions of the law was a priority for the first 100 days of the Trump administration. But, he said, the date that those provisions would actually disappear would be delayed, allowing a transition period as short as two years or as long as three or four years. During that time, Republicans plan to pass one or more replacement bills.
Biden's current mission is to make the world focus on his $1.9 trillion plan for a coronavirus comeback. It's currently in the House, where the Democratic majority is expected to pass it readily, once the poor bill makes its way through all the subcommittee chairs who want a little poke at it. But sometime in March it'll be in the hands of Senator Chuck Schumer, whose majority consists entirely of Kamala Harris breaking tie votes.
Matt Gaetz rallied against Liz Cheney in her own state. Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, has been campaigning to oust Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, from House G.O.P. leadership after she voted for former President Donald J. Trump's impeachment. Credit... Erin Scott/Reuters CHEYENNE, Wyo. — Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida took his campaign to remove Representative Liz Cheney from the House Republican leadership on the road on Thursday, telling several hundred people who gathered outside the Wyoming State Capitol that they were on the front lines of a battle against the party's entrenched interests. We can stop them, and it starts right here in Wyoming, Mr. Gaetz, a Republican, said to an enthusiastic, mostly maskless crowd where people waved signs and wore stickers that said Impeach Liz Cheney! One person waved a Confederate flag. And at least one came with an AR-15-style rifle slung over his shoulder. Supporters of former President Donald J. Trump have singled out Ms. Cheney, the third-ranking Republican in the House, for her vote to impeach the president earlier this month. Mr. Gaetz has been the most visible and vocal among them, declaring that he is waging a war for the soul of the Republican Party. Ms. Cheney's allies criticized Mr. Gaetz for holding the event in her home state, which they said was unnecessary and reckless, coming just three weeks after a mob of violent Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington to protest his electoral loss.
President Obama's health care battles foreshadow some of what Senator Warren might face in trying to institute her single-payer system. Mr. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in March 2010 after a protracted fight in Congress, and by November 2011 the Supreme Court had agreed to hear a case challenging its constitutionality.
But on the other hand, we have other diplomatic initiatives and it's really important that we're trying to work with this country, and they're important to us strategically for this reason and we have this ongoing negotiation in that political thing. Drag your heels, drag your heels, drag your heels, until the jobs have disappeared here. And then once you go forward, you've got to go forward through a different kind of court that's much slower.

But precisely because there are so many legitimate avenues of inquiry, Democrats must proceed with caution to avoid looking as though they're piling on in a punitive or grossly partisan manner. While many Democrats and not a few anti-Trump Republicans would doubtless be delighted to see the president subjected to daily investigative torture, House Democrats cannot afford to alienate the independents and swing voters needed to send him packing in 2020. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll shows that a plurality of independents already expect the new House majority to go overboard with its oversight, and even some Democratic lawmakers have expressed unease. Representative John Yarmuth of Kentucky, the new Budget Committee chairman, recently joked that Congress would have to build an air traffic control tower to keep track of all the subpoenas flying from here to the White House.
A 2-cent wealth tax, and now let's talk about what kind of change we could make. Two cents, and we can do universal child care. We can put $800 billion into our public schools. We can make a federal commitment for the first time in history to public education K-12, and we can do the same thing for college, and we can cancel student loan debt, and an enormous boost to our economy.
The problem is this skepticism often morphs into a formulaic approach that can itself become untethered from reality. Whatever the facts, many journalists and Washington experts revert to familiar storylines: Both sides are hypocritical. The parties care more about scoring partisan points than getting anything done. The extremists have taken over, and there are no moderates left.
They face, it is said, a terrible choice: On the one hand, they can put up token opposition knowing that Judge Kavanaugh is almost certain to be confirmed anyway, get the vote out of the way before the midterms and perhaps use the new associate justice as a whipping boy in campaign ads.
And don't get me started on the recently signed $716 billion defense budget for the 2019 fiscal year — a spending hike so dramatic, as defense analyst Lawrence Korb pointed out, that it means since Trump took office under two years ago, the defense budget will have grown by $133 billion, or 23 percent. And there's no major war going on.
Much more worrisome for those of us who think the country needs a blue wave in 2018 is the way Mr. Trump's strategy appears to be raising his job approval ratings and closing the enthusiasm gap with Democrats that has been a critical element in the handful of off-year elections since 2016. Any wave election worth its salt — like the 1974 Watergate cleansing, the 1994 Gingrich revolution or the 2010 Tea Party shellacking — is produced by the elevated energy and enthusiasm of one party and the demoralization and fracturing of the other.
Under the House bill, the government would provide tax credits to help people buy insurance. But, the budget office said, the average federal subsidy would be significantly lower under the House bill than under the Affordable Care Act — about 50 percent lower by 2026.

JI: But one of the premises for massive health care reform is that the Affordable Care Act is not working in a lot of ways, right? So you support Medicare for all presumably because you think the Affordable Care Act has a lot of holes in it, and we need to do something different, so you'll be defending that.
Yeah, and I just want to hammer this home for your listeners because it's so important. The Jim Crow era is a really good period to look at because you basically had two categories of legislation that encountered the legislative process very differently. You had civil rights, and you had everything else. Civil rights encountered the requirement to clear a supermajority threshold — at the time, it was two-thirds — in the Senate in order to pass. Everything else only had to clear a majority. Civil rights didn't pass. And I think it's really important — for 87 years, every single civil rights bill that came before Congress — and there were many, from the end of Reconstruction in 1877 to the first time a Southern filibuster was broken in 1964. Every single civil rights bill that came before the Senate was systematically forced to clear a supermajority threshold. And they were unable to do it. And so, they all failed. It's not like America wasn't ready to pass civil rights. I think one of the things that we sort of look back on with rose-colored glasses is the idea that maybe America wasn't quite ready until 1964. The filibuster played its cooling saucer role and waited until the country was ready for civil rights. That's not true. There were federal anti-lynching laws. There were federal anti-poll tax laws. And there were laws to end workplace discrimination that all had majority support in the House. They passed the House. They came to the Senate.
Sui-Lee Wee and Donald McNeil gave us the breaking news that researchers in China have identified a new virus that is behind a mysterious pneumonialike illness that has caused a panic in the central Chinese region. 'There's no evidence that the virus, a coronavirus, is readily spread by humans, and it has not been tied to any deaths,' they write. 'But health officials in China and internationally are watching it carefully, as it comes from the same region where the deadly SARS epidemic broke out in the early 2000s.'
It's that you don't get the tariff benefit. This is what it's really about. Where's the baseline? Right? And is the baseline one that says, across the board, you've got to give plenty of notice. You've got to work through, make sure you've got something that's achievable for countries we trade with. But this is not like trying to institute a trade war. This is not like saying we're mad at you and therefore we're going to impose all these tariffs on you, and doing it as Donald Trump has done by tweet.
The Michigan ballot initiative's goal was to make the 2016 law more ambitious. And the politics looked so favorable that the two largest utilities basically dropped their opposition. Months before Election Day, they pre-emptively agreed to increase their renewables share to 25 percent by 2030. It wasn't quite the 30 percent level in the initiative, but it avoided the risk of defeat and let activists focus elsewhere. The activists took the deal and canceled the initiative.

The conservatives' touchiness about the chief justice's reliability is easy enough to understand. It stems from his unexpected vote in 2012 to uphold the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate. The Washington Post columnist George Will, who had excellent access to the Supreme Court while his friend Antonin Scalia was alive, provided an early indication of trouble ahead in a column he published a month before the court issued the Obamacare decision. Mr. Will's target in the column, headlined Liberals Put the Squeeze to Justice Roberts, wasn't the media but rather Democratic politicians who were warning about damage that would befall the court if a five-member majority made up of Republican-appointed justices struck down President Barack Obama's prime legislative accomplishment. In die-hard conservative circles, Chief Justice Roberts is still regarded as a traitor, even though it is surpassingly difficult to think of other examples of apostasy aside from his votes in the two Obamacare decisions.
Editors at The Times also consulted dictionaries. And they had some prior experience with the matter, having approved the use of the L word once before in reference to Mr. Trump.
The Republicans' initial plan would have changed the structure of the 52-year-old program, switching from a system in which the federal government paid a share of every medical bill to one in which states would receive a flat fee each year for each person signed up for the program. The amendment would give states a second option: Instead of that per capita payment, they could get a lump sum payment for children and adults under 65 who don't have disabilities, along with more control over who can sign up and what benefits different kinds of Medicaid recipients could receive. This change will please conservatives in Congress, who hope to limit the growth of the program and increase state flexibility. Members of the Republican Study Committee and the House Freedom Caucus had asked for it.

NF: In the last month or so, your — I know you don't poll, but others do, and your poll numbers have gone down, and it seems to coincide with your major rollout of your health plan and the attacks you've gotten, basically painting you as extremist, going too far, both from Wall Street, from other candidates and elsewhere. And I'm wondering if that's because people are afraid of what you're proposing as much as others might like it?
I think Robert Bork narrowed the standards we use for antitrust and for breaking up big companies. Market dominance by itself, when you totally dominate a market, that is anti-competitive. Then the platforms — this new — you want to go to the new part. The platforms themselves create a new kind of problem that we haven't seen. We can only do this by analogy, which is what we always do in law, but think of it this way. There's Amazon that owns the marketplace where people go and buy toasters and sell toasters, but they also are scraping bits of information off every one of those purchases. When they decide that your toaster business is getting very profitable, and they might like to crowd in on that, they take all that information they took from you without your consent and they go into the 2.0 version of your toaster business and move you back to page seven on the search.

Now, Republican leaders are considering a legislative effort to roll back major provisions of the health law, but the plan they're considering would keep the current system in place for at least two and possibly three more years.
Senate leaders are now hastily trying to rewrite a sprawling tax bill — one that touches almost every part of the economy — and then pass it mere hours later. They need to do so because an independent Senate analysis late yesterday made clear what everyone already knew: The bill would add to the deficit enormously. In a normal legislative process, the Senate would have received that analysis long before taking any vote.
But the conservative firebrand lost a bid for minority leader to Representative Kevin McCarthy of California following the 2018 elections. Mr. Jordan's decision not to run was first reported by The Plain Dealer of Cleveland. No major candidate has formally entered Ohio's 2022 Senate race since Mr. Portman's Monday announcement that he would not seek a third term. But Republicans said to be weighing a bid include Josh Mandel, the former state treasurer who lost a 2012 race to Senator Sherrod Brown; Frank LaRose, Ohio's secretary of state; J.D. Vance, the Ohio-born author of Hillbilly Elegy; Jane Timken, the Ohio Republican Party chairwoman; and several members of Ohio's congressional delegation. Two other Ohio Republicans, Jon A. Husted, the state's lieutenant governor, and former Representative Pat Tiberi, have said they will not run for Senate. Ohio Democrats who have expressed interest in running for the Senate include Representative Tim Ryan, who was among the early field of candidates vying to unseat Mr. Trump in 2020; Mayor Nan Whaley of Dayton, who is also considering running for governor in 2022; and Dr. Amy Acton, the former director of the Ohio Department of Health, who received encouragement on Twitter from Connie Schultz, Mr. Brown's wife. Mr. Portman is one of three Republican senators who has said he will not seek re-election in 2022. Senators Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Richard M. Burr of North Carolina are also retiring, leaving the party to defend three seats in what are expected to be competitive states next year.
President Trump's promise to promote health insurance sales across state lines? Not in the American Health Care Act. Mr. Price's commitment to loosen burdensome benefit rules for private health plans in Obamacare? Also not in the bill. Mr. Ryan's favored policy of high-risk pools? Not there either. The goal of giving states more flexibility to run their Medicaid programs according to local conditions? Barely.

The testimonials could counter negative publicity generated by rising premiums, the withdrawal of major insurers like Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealth from many counties, and the collapse of insurance cooperatives in at least a dozen states.

LOS ANGELES — A big crowd showed up for the festive unveiling of President Barack Obama Boulevard here last weekend, at the intersection of hope and resistance, as one news outlet put it.

This year alone we have successfully lowered your health insurance premiums in the state of Tennessee by 26 percent, Mr. Trump said at a rally in Johnson City, Tenn., this past week. For the very first time under the Affordable Care Act, the premium for a benchmark federal exchange plan is projected to actually drop, said Mr. Azar, who is in charge of the federal insurance marketplace.
Well, you know, it obviously depends on the program, but I worry about — for example, increasing the dollar payment on Section 8 vouchers, it doesn't seem to increase the supply of housing.

Because we had a sense that the other work we all do, which is public policy work, just can't matter on the right until we do a better job of understanding what's gone wrong at the infrastructural level — political culture, the condition of Congress, the electoral system, these kinds of questions that seem like they are deeper than public policy and where there are just profound problems — some of them on the right, some of them in general — that make it difficult for us to have traditional policy debates. But I also think that if you stand aside from Trump for a minute, some of the differences that have emerged, really, in the last 10 years, but that have emerged with even greater force in the Trump era, do manifest themselves in some ways in policy differences and in a different level of willingness to engage in public action. Think about the $2,000 check debate, a small thing in some ways. But the pressure for more direct help to individuals came, in a lot of ways, from the Josh Hawley types on the right. The Democrats were for it. Ultimately, even Donald Trump was for it. But the argument for it on the right, the actual substantive argument, came exactly from that camp that inclines to think that, as George W. Bush once said and was endlessly attacked for saying, when people hurt, government's got to move. That's not the traditional conservative way of thinking.
But despite Mr. Trump's longstanding desire to unwind the signature legislative achievement of his predecessor, many parts of the Affordable Care Act remain in place. And the Trump administration is even enforcing some of its provisions more aggressively than President Barack Obama did — a reality that has enraged business groups and Republicans in Congress who still want the law officially repealed.

UnitedHealth, the industry bellwether, has reduced its exposure to what was its biggest problem in Obamacare: money-losing insurance that it sold in public exchanges to individuals, who often received government subsidies.
The importance of a grass-roots movement is there is one thing that beats fake news, and actually the data showed this, and that's somebody you know. It's somebody who actually talks to you. It's somebody who does the face to face. It's somebody who reaches out. It's somebody who knocks on your door. It's your neighbor. It's the person who talks to you in line at the grocery store. That's part of it. It's why you have to build — when I did inside/outside, it's also about the importance of building grass roots, building it from the ground up. It's why I made the decisions I made in running for president right from the beginning, which we can talk about in a minute. But for me, that's at the heart of it, and then there's a second part. I'll push first to get the anti-corruption bill through. I'll push to deliver on a meaningful anti-corruption deal. I think you can get a lot of people on board for that, Democrats and Republicans to push for it. I dare you to vote against it, right? That is a fight I will have, and it will be a fight.

On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he would remain in the job as long as that is appropriate after Mr. Trump criticized him for recusing himself in the Russia investigation.
But he redeemed much of that record with one action: He cast the crucial vote against G.O.P. attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act. That single nay saved health care for tens of millions of Americans, at least for a while.
Many of the legislators supporting Michigan's work requirements come from rural districts with high unemployment. Many of those districts are predominantly white. To protect their constituents, these legislators have included a safety valve in the bill: If you live in a county with a high unemployment rate (over 8.5 percent), you're exempt from the work requirements. The rationale? When there are no jobs to be had, it doesn't make sense to punish you for not working.
But experts say that tax credits for those earning more won't have a meaningful effect in reducing the number of uninsured because most high-earners are already insured anyway.

We've got what, two more months before the caucuses start, but this is the question in front of us as a country. How do we think about how to go forward? Is the message going to be business as usual after Donald Trump? It's just too damn hard to get anything done.

All these struggles have led activists to have second thoughts about carbon pricing. John Podesta, who helped direct climate policy in the Obama administration, told me that a new political strategy was necessary. The Green New Deal — a progressive wish list on the issue — includes neither a carbon tax nor a cap-and-trade system. Foreign Affairs recently ran an article with the headline Why Carbon Pricing Isn't Working, by Jeffrey Ball, a former energy reporter at The Wall Street Journal. Christiana Figueres, a Costa Rican who spent six years as the top United Nations climate official, told me: An economist would probably argue that the most efficient way to reduce greenhouse gases is to put a price on carbon. But efficient is not always what can be attained from a political perspective. I would rather move now on what we can do than wait for economists' perfection.
And so we saw a government that targeted teachers unions, that seized power on key boards, and really kind of had a wish list of conservative ideas nationally playing out in the state.
He also dismissed questions about the wisdom of Mr. Trump's plan to end financial aid to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras.

She famously has a plan for that and had a (lengthy) answer for nearly every question.
One such illusion is that increasing racial proximity by integrating schools and housing is a good way to break down racial animosities and paranoias. Porter cites one study from Chicago that demonstrates the reverse. It was only when project housing for blacks was torn down that the attitudes of nearby whites toward blacks actually improved. Empathy seems to increase with social distance.

Britain requires citizens flying home from 22 countries to quarantine at hotels. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:21 - 0:00 transcript Britain Cracks Down on International Travel Hoping to reduce the spread of the coronavirus variant, Britain announced on Wednesday it will require citizens arriving home from high-risk countries to quarantine in hotels for 10 days at their own expense. It is clear that there are still too many people coming in and out of our country each day. And today, I am announcing further action to strengthen the health measures that we already have at the border, but to reduce passenger flow. Firstly, the police have stepped up checks, and are carrying out more physical checks at addresses to ensure that people are complying with the self isolation rules. Second, we will continue to refuse entry to non-U.K. residents from Red List countries which are already subject to the U.K. travel ban. Third, as the prime minister has said, we will introduce a new managed isolation process in hotels for those who cannot be refused entry, including those arriving home from countries where we have already imposed international travel bans. We will increase police presence at ports and at airports. Finding those in breach of the stay-at-home regulations — anyone who does not have a valid reason for travel will be directed to return home or they will face a fine. These are crucial new measures to protect us all.
Sure, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's youth (she's 29) is crucial to the passion in her voice, the ambition of her ideas and her ability to rouse a contingent of young voters who too often go missing from politics.

Insurance markets stabilized after Mr. Trump tried to upend them. That does not necessarily mean that they are more stable because of his policies.
The Biden administration plans to reopen enrollment in many of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, both to help those who may have lost health insurance during the pandemic and to offer coverage to those who did not have any and now want it. The move will be announced on Thursday as part of an executive order describing administration policies on shoring up health insurance coverage, according to three people familiar with the details.

March 4, 2020, 1:58 a.m. ET March 4, 2020, 1:58 a.m. ET Nick Corasaniti and Lines to vote in Texas were horrific. Poll closures were probably a factor. AUSTIN — The lines at polling places across Texas have been horrific: Five hours after the polls were supposed to close, some people who got in line before the cutoff are still waiting to vote. As of 1 a.m. Eastern time, some polls were still open, but even the Texas secretary of state's office could not say how many. Only county-level officials could provide that information, the office said. There are 254 counties in Texas. Several factors are involved here, including the sheer length of some of Texas' ballots: As Michael Li, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice's Democracy Program, noted on Twitter, voters had to pick not just a presidential candidate, but also nominees for a slew of congressional, state and local races. But a major contributor is this simple fact: Texas officials have closed some 750 polling places since the Supreme Court overturned a key part of the Voting Rights Act in 2013. And most of those polling places — 542, to be specific — were in the 50 counties that gained the most black and Latino residents, according to an analysis by The Guardian.

In 1959, the Republican National Committee held an internal debate over whether the party should be driven by a distinct set of ideological values. At the inaugural meeting of the Committee on Program and Progress, which was tasked with designing the GOP agenda, the group invited the political scientist Robert Goldwin to make the case that it is neither possible nor desirable for a major political party to be guided by principles. Our modern cleavages give Goldwin's concerns a force that they would not have carried in 1959. With both parties including liberals and conservatives within their ranks, he said, those differences which would otherwise be the main campaign issues are settled by compromise within each party. He warned that our national unity would be weakened if the theoretical differences were sharpened.
Here are the changes made to the bill so far. And here is an easy way to see how it differs from Obamacare.
But we won't be, because this logic lacks the cultural imagination required to see that Trump's positions won't get a hearing with groups that might find them appealing otherwise, precisely because they're associated with, well, Donald Trump himself.
While some suggest a public option as a cure-all, shifting more responsibility from the private sector to the government does nothing to address the root of the problem. We would be better served to focus on promoting greater choice, transparency and value in our health care system for the benefit of all consumers.
Translation: Fine. No one will give us a border wall. We'll show you the meaning of chaos.
On the Republican side, Representative Jim Jordan's campaign office announced yesterday that he would not be running for the Ohio Senate seat in 2022. Senator Rob Portman said this week that he would not run for re-election, and Jordan, a staunch Trump ally, was widely seen as having the best shot at capturing the G.O.P. nomination.
Senator Warren's campaign ads pitch a 2-cent wealth tax to cover $700 billion in universal child care, $1.25 trillion in universal free college and student debt forgiveness, and more. But Senator Warren's tax would really be more than 2 cents on the dollar for the ultrarich, because you have to add the 2 cents to additional taxes she has promised on assets above $1 billion along with taxes on income and capital gains. Two University of California economists recently calculated that the Microsoft founder Bill Gates's net worth would be more than halved if Senator Warren's wealth tax in its original form had been enacted in 1982.
Mr. Trump isn't the first to mount a pressure campaign on NATO member states to increase their contributions. President Bush used a summit in Latvia in 2006 to urge other nations to raise their military spending, and President Obama echoed the plea at a 2014 conference in Brussels. Mr. Trump, though, has made spending levels a more central issue.
Right. I mean, I just want to say obviously I don't disagree with you about all of this being extremely stifling. I guess, to me, it's just the question of, do you try to expand the social definition of what women can do and what men can do? Or do you try to erase the idea that male and female has any inherent meaning? And I guess, you know, I know people for whom the idea of doing that seems utopian. And I guess, for me, it just — it doesn't speak to me. It's not something that I particularly aspire to, even though, obviously I don't want to live by the traditional limitations of femininity. And I don't want my kids to be subject to those. I mean, I've had the same experience as you both, to a certain extent. And I think that it's always a temptation, especially if you have one boy and one girl, or in Ross's case is two girls and one boy, to overinterpret a very small sample size.
Carlyle converted into a C corporation, the standard model for publicly traded companies. Private equity firms that have gone public have typically done so as partnerships, which saved on taxes but prevented them from being included in major stock indexes.
archived recording (tony evers) Hi there, folks. Governor Evers here.
It is undoubtedly difficult to differentiate Trump policies from the Trump persona, because the Trump persona dominates news coverage. But Republican candidates for Congress have to try. Tactically, that means being laser-focused on generating local news coverage of policy accomplishments, even when the national cable news fixates on the latest Trump outrage.
But I lost. I mean, the people have spoken. So, O.K., let's see how we can help this guy be a good president.
I think it's a good place to come to a close here, so let me move to our recommendation section and I'll start with this. If I want to understand where the Republican Party is going, who are some folks I should be reading?
KK: Well, so you're going to kill the filibuster?
While in West Virginia later on Monday, addressing the National Scout Jamboree, Mr. Trump teased the health and human services secretary, Tom Price, about whether he would be able to wrangle support from Ms. Capito and other Republicans. He better get them, Mr. Trump said, smiling at Mr. Price to indicate he was joking — or at least seemed to be. Otherwise, I'll say, 'Tom, you're fired.'
For one thing, Democrats haven't yet hit on a successful strategy for turning out voters in midterm elections. That hurts them in congressional and governor races, as well as in state legislatures, which in turn allows Republicans to control the gerrymandering process.
John McCain was always surrounded by an entourage. He was always surrounded by cameras. He was always surrounded by a sense that because John McCain was there, something momentous was happening. And Lindsey Graham, by virtue of residency in that orbit, was able to reap that also.
But I'm disturbed that so few of the Democratic candidates don't also talk about growing the pie, let alone celebrating American entrepreneurs and risk-takers. Where do they think jobs come from?
The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips. And here's our email: letters@nytimes.com.
Mr. Trump's decision nearly four years ago was a shock to the UNFPA, which had counted on the United States, a founding member, as a critical source of funding. Overnight, the agency lost nearly $70 million. Dr. Natalia Kanem, the fund's executive director, welcomed Mr. Biden's order, which she said would greatly help the agency's work not only in family planning but in other health services to struggling women and girls in poor countries. We now have the support of a very important member state, Dr. Kanem said in a phone interview, expressing gratitude that the Biden administration had embraced her agency's work around the world. Mr. Biden is also directing the Department of Health and Human Services to take immediate action, his administration said, to consider whether to rescind the so-called domestic gag rule — a regulation imposed by the Trump administration that prohibits family planning clinics that receive federal funding from counseling patients about abortion. Such a change would likely require the department to write new regulations, a process that could take months. The president's Obamacare directive will also instruct federal agencies to review policies — including waivers that allowed states to impose work requirements — that discourage participation in Medicaid, the public health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Enrollment in Medicaid has grown substantially during the coronavirus pandemic, in part because people who have lost jobs and their health insurance have turned to Medicaid for coverage. Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Abby Goodnough and
He said he would either seek the Trump administration's permission to impose a work requirement or seek a block grant — and, with it, leeway to create new rules — to cover those who newly qualified for Medicaid under the health law.
JI: But one of the premises for massive health care reform is that the Affordable Care Act is not working in a lot of ways, right? So you support Medicare for all presumably because you think the Affordable Care Act has a lot of holes in it, and we need to do something different, so you'll be defending that.
Yeah, I think that's certainly true. It's funny. It's something I talk about in my book, too. But one of the tensions of politics, particularly in this era, is that putting aside the actual argument of Party of Death, the stakes of politics often are life and death. I mean. I do a lot of work on health care politics. I think, if you don't pass universal health care bills people die. And I've talked about that in very explicit terms with Joe Lieberman, threatening to kill Obamacare. And there's this interesting tension, particularly as the parties become more different from each other between, how do you approach politics with the seriousness it deserves, right? I mean, things like climate change. There really are profound stakes here and at the same time, don't push people to a place where they feel they have to burn the Capitol down if they lose.
There we go. But the point is there are some things about tech that are special. I mean, that we're seeing for the first time. Ways that you can be anti-competitive that we hadn't seen before, just like that was true in the early 1900s about, you know — you had the oil supply, and you also owned all the gas stations and how that one worked. We broke that apart.
The law very clearly directs the secretary of health and human services to deposit certain amounts in the Treasury, Ms. Poling said. The fact that H.H.S.'s collections ultimately fell short of the projected amounts does not alter the meaning of the statute, she added.
So it may be interesting if he were in power. But as long as he is not in power, there just isn't much actual room for negotiation, whereas the people who might be more into the room for negotiation are folks like Romney and Collins and others who actually haven't moved that far on the underlying economics.
Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the secretary of health and human services, said the number of sign-ups was remarkable in view of headwinds created by premium increases for 2017 and by the uncertainty of the entire health law after Mr. Trump takes office on Jan. 20.
I mean, the most obvious reason is because it's just he or she is not inclusive. It does not precisely refer to everyone. A lot of people feel that they don't fit within that gender binary. And referring to them as they, it solves the kind of inadvertent misgendering problem. You know, some people say that it's a huge accommodation to make because it doesn't affect that many people. But I feel like we don't really know how many people this affects. And I think those numbers are increasing as people think about this more. It doesn't seem like a huge task for the rest of society to start thinking about language in a way that is more inclusive.
Boy, you all want power. God, I hope you never get it.
But I think that on the whole, the culture of the right has become much more hostile to the establishment. I think the right is overrepresented in American politics. It's underrepresented everywhere else in the institutions. But our attitude toward politics has also become anti-institutional. Even people who get elected to high office on the right tend to be sort of inherently anti-institutional in the way they approach their voters, and I think it's a problem. Look, I don't think conservatism can do its job in a free society in opposition to the institutions of that society. I think it can only function in defense of them. And a conservatism that becomes anti-institutional looks like a mob attacking the Capitol, which I don't think is where anybody wants to end up.
Idaho's new state-based health benefit plans will have to carry a disclaimer: The policy is not fully compliant with federal health insurance requirements.
BS: Right. You have a lot of people in this country who actually, if you asked them about Obamacare, they hate it. These are the same people who are being wounded by the constant diminution of medical care under the Trump administration. How do you convince those people? That's the issue, because he's talking about fake news and disbelief. We had the whole discussion about death committees.
It's that you don't get the tariff benefit. This is what it's really about. Where's the baseline? Right? And is the baseline one that says, across the board, you've got to give plenty of notice. You've got to work through, make sure you've got something that's achievable for countries we trade with. But this is not like trying to institute a trade war. This is not like saying we're mad at you and therefore we're going to impose all these tariffs on you, and doing it as Donald Trump has done by tweet.
BOZEMAN, Mont. — The only reason to be a Democrat running for statewide office in Montana is that, alas, you are one. Just keep in mind that there will be none of that heady, audacity-of-hope-type jazz. In this cold, conservative state, your mission is to persuade the skeptics east of the Rocky Mountain Front that you are a levelheaded, friendly, capitalist adult who won't be levitating the Pentagon — a task that has gotten considerably easier since the Republican establishment lost interest in basic empiricism.
Now senators are searching for changes to make the bill more politically palatable. But the notion of making those changes today and then speeding immediately to a vote is madness. There would be no time for experts to consider the consequences — to discover the sort of problems and unintended effects that last-minute changes are bound to create. By the time they did, the Senate would have passed it.
I'm David Leonhardt. And this is The Argument. This week, have we finally reached full Trumpification of the Republican Party?
And you may start out with modest increments and increase them over time, but there's no reason that we should be treating a country that is producing goods through prison labor or child labor or unsafe working standards or by polluting the earth, that we should treat a country that produces goods in that way the same way we're treating a country that produces goods with standards that are much closer to ours. We simply put our own businesses and our own workers at a competitive disadvantage, so we end up doing things like exporting pollution. Can't pollute here in the United States, but move this polluting industry. This way that you're going to paint dolls or produce chips, move it somewhere else where they have no environmental standards and then resell, and then sell those goods back in the United States.
In a year of controlling power in Washington, President Trump and Republicans in Congress have run up federal spending, approved deficit-swelling tax cuts and presided over a marked increase in policy uncertainty in the economy. They still talk about the importance of fiscal discipline, but they have yet to enforce it.

Prisoners at Guantánamo Bay will be offered vaccination, the Pentagon says. Troops and civilian residents at the U.S. naval base and military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, are already being vaccinated. Officials said shots would be offered to detainees as well. Credit... Alex Brandon/Associated Press WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has decided to offer coronavirus vaccines to detainees at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, possibly starting next week, according to a prosecutor in the case against five prisoners accused of conspiring in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The prosecutor, Clayton G. Trivett Jr., wrote to defense lawyers on Thursday that an official in the Pentagon has just signed a memo approving the delivery of the Covid-19 vaccine to the detainee population in Guantánamo. Medical workers at the U.S. naval base began vaccinating the 6,000 residents on Jan. 8, including the 1,500 troops assigned to the detention operation. But the Trump administration had declined to say whether prisoners would be vaccinated. The 40 detainees at the prison complex could start receiving the first of the two required doses of vaccineon a voluntary basis as soon as Monday, Mr. Trivett said. Under Pentagon policy, because the Food and Drug Administration has given only emergency-use authorization to the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, the recipient's consent is required to administer the shots. It is not known how many people at Guantánamo have been infected with the coronavirus. Early in the pandemic, the military reported two cases there, both believed to be sailors.
That is also the message of a lawsuit — the first of its kind — filed this month in federal court in Maryland. Brought by several plaintiffs including the cities of Chicago, Cincinnati and Columbus, the lawsuit recounts the relentless and unlawful campaign to sabotage and, ultimately, to nullify the Affordable Care Act. Taken individually, some of the Trump administration's actions may be defensible. Taken together, they amount to a derogation of his constitutional duties.
The longest previous shutdown came in 1995. At issue was a long-term budget backed by Republicans, who won control of both the House and the Senate halfway through Mr. Clinton's first term.
Rules and other guidance released Monday provide some ways out. People who live in a county where only one insurer offers Obamacare-compliant health plans now can get an exemption to the law's individual mandate penalties right away. (They'll go away for everyone next year under legislation passed as part of the tax overhaul.) The administration is allowing older plans that predated Obamacare and that don't follow all its rules to stick around another year. It's also allowing health plans to cover a slightly less robust set of benefits, although those changes are mostly marginal.
But I think that on the whole, the culture of the right has become much more hostile to the establishment. I think the right is overrepresented in American politics. It's underrepresented everywhere else in the institutions. But our attitude toward politics has also become anti-institutional. Even people who get elected to high office on the right tend to be sort of inherently anti-institutional in the way they approach their voters, and I think it's a problem.

The United Automobile Workers has nearly one million members. Along with the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Teachers, it has yet not taken a stance on Medicare for all.
First, as I said, I'm not talking about mere dubious claims. When Trump officials insisted that the 2017 tax cut would lead to a decade of miraculous growth, their claim made no sense in terms of the underlying economics, and it flew in the face of decades of evidence. But it was a prediction, not a statement of fact, and it's conceivable (barely) that Trump's people actually believed it.
argues that one of the best ways for the president to pay for ambitious policies and help honest taxpayers is to restore the funding the I.R.S. needs to effectively battle tax cheats. Enrique Krauze writes that Biden, in working with his Mexican counterpart President López Obrador, can promote a moderate approach that might be of great benefit to the U.S.-Mexico relationship and to Mexicans.
It will be an invitation to come, he said of decriminalization, going on to add that he and Barack sought to increase the total amount of immigration and stressing his support for asylum seekers.
Of 138 people tested in Hai Duong, 72 were positive for the virus, Health Minister Nguyen Thanh Long said, according to a recording of comments made at an urgent meeting on the sidelines of the Communist Party congress. All of those patients work at a local electronics factory, local news media reported. The first worker found to have contracted the virus is said to have had contact with a Vietnamese national who later traveled to Japan, where he tested positive for the variant that has spread in Britain. The other 10 cases appear to have originated with a worker at Van Don International Airport in Quang Ninh Province who was responsible for taking arriving passengers to quarantine.
With anxiety about the economy bubbling up on Wall Street and at campaign rallies around the country, the government reported on Friday that employers added 242,000 workers in February, a hefty increase that highlighted the labor market's steady gains.
You see, for all its sweeping ambition, the Green New Deal is arguably an exercise in pragmatism — in the proposition that the perfect is the enemy of the good.
In other words, they don't really have a plan to replace it.

So just make the brief case for us about why you think it's important for us to start using they on an everyday basis more often and he or she less often.
So last week was as close to a moment of total happiness as President Trump has had in a long time.
— who wanted to create a universal health care program.
It could do more to attack climate change. It could cut taxes for the middle class and poor while raising them on the rich. It could rebuild highways and invest in mass transit. It could fix the lingering problems with Obamacare. It could expand voting rights and workers' ability to join a labor union.
Slightly, slightly is not the right word — extremely passive-aggressive yet effective and terrifying figure.
This week, as Republican efforts to repeal the law known as Obamacare appeared all but dead, Mr. Brahin, a 58-year-old lawyer and self-described fiscal hawk, said his feelings had evolved.
So the way I see this is all I can do is get out and tell you what I'll fight for, and I'll point out the difference between the two. I try not to get over my skis. No, I do. I've really tried hard not to be personally critical of other candidates. I got a little heated once, but once, and because I think this is the fundamental question. Do you think that this democracy, do you think that this economy, do you think this government is going to make it if all we're offering are little nibbles around the edges?
Go deeper: The virtual shutdown of much of China's economy is hurting business around the world, including multinational firms, truck drivers and tour guides. All our planning has been turned upside down, said Michael Smerling, the owner of a company in the U.S. whose Chinese suppliers have been shut down.
Serge Schmemann: Let me ask you about the Middle East. In the October debate you said, I think we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. Did you mean nowhere in the Middle East? Do you think — for example, who should control the Persian Gulf, freedom of navigation, should we close down the air base in Qatar?
Those actions appear to have made a difference. Sign-ups for health plans in the states managed by the federal government are down slightly compared with last year. About 9.2 million Americans picked an Obamacare marketplace plan for this year, according to a government report released Friday. Last year, that number was 9.6 million.

I think it tells you that a lot of G.O.P. elected officials still have this sense that the bigoted strain in Trumpism can just sort of go away when Trump does.
Trumpcare has begun, not through legislation but through executive action.
But if your complaint is a labor complaint, that is, gee, here I am in America and I'm trying to compete against workers in a foreign country who are getting paid a dollar a day. What's your path? Well, first you've got to go to the U.S. government and persuade the U.S. government that they should go after this country, for which we know what has happened. U.S. government has repeatedly — and this is not just by — well, yeah, we get your point.
The Federal Reserve finally made its long-awaited move to cut interest rates. But stock investors, President Trump and even some Fed governors were left unhappy, Jeanna Smialek of the NYT reports.
Yeah. It is that sense of affirmation, the sense of rightness that Republicans enter into Evers's administration with, and it allows them to openly flout the typical means of political pressure that the governor tries to put on them around the election.
At the same time, you don't want to create some sort of narrative of historical inevitability of the return of bigotry and racism. Right? George W. Bush campaigned in almost all of the ways that liberals now miss about Republican politicians. Right? He went to mosques after 9/11. He pushed a huge program for fighting AIDS in Africa. His was a conservatism of some kind of racial outreach. So you have to ask the question, you know, well, what changed between 2000 and 2016? And I think the big answer is that George W. Bush's foreign policy was a failure. And then we had a huge financial crisis. And we have a host of socioeconomic problems in America that the Republican message wasn't addressing.
Perhaps the most consequential issues at stake in this Supreme Court vacancy are affordable health care and a woman's freedom to make the most sensitive medical decisions about her body. The views of President Trump's next court nominee on these issues could well determine whether the Senate approves or rejects them.
The C.B.O. estimates that after an initial rise in average premiums, there would be an overall decrease beginning in 2020. By 2026, average premiums would be about 10 percent lower than under the current law.
But only two hours after she introduced the bill, leaders of a more centrist group known as the New Democrat Coalition said Congress should initially focus on shoring up the Affordable Care Act, stabilizing insurance marketplaces and holding down prescription drug costs.
So what do officials do in response to this severe shortage of poll workers?
KK: But do you know of any specific evidence that immigrants drive down wages?
That it is about outcomes, that I've got an opportunity up here working with the president to get some outcomes that could be really good for the country and I think, from my point of view, good for the world.
Asked about Democrats' concerns about his impartiality, the chairman, Representative Devin Nunes of California, said, That sounds like their problem.
Cathleen Decker of The Los Angeles Times put it this way: In all the anger coming from liberal Dem groups today, she wrote that she had yet to see a scenario under which a longer shutdown would have resulted in a more positive outcome from their point of view.
People don't like their private insurance companies, they like their doctors and hospitals. Under our plan, people go to any doctor they want, any hospital they want. The quickest way you get there is create competition with the insurers. God bless the insurers if they want to compete.
What does this mean? Which one is real? Are they both? Is there a Jekyll to this Hyde? It was an exceedingly strange and feeble attempt to diminish the danger that this man poses, but in a way, if anyone could understand this duality, it would be Carson.
So let's spend at least a couple minutes on health care. There is a lawsuit that the Trump administration is supporting that says that Obamacare should just be invalidated. Conservative legal scholars, including ones who supported past challenges to Obamacare, have called the case absurd and shocking. And yet a Republican-appointed trial judge ruled with the Trump administration. I mean, I just find this really alarming.
The Federal Reserve finally made its long-awaited move to cut interest rates. But stock investors, President Trump and even some Fed governors were left unhappy, Jeanna Smialek of the NYT reports.
Right after an election when, in his construction, he would be re-elected, Republicans would hold the Senate, and they would take back control of the House. So that's not just a delay of game. That is setting a whole bunch of other conditions on what would need to happen to get there.
Senator Warren said in an interview with Vox's Ezra Klein that many other economic policies should be accomplished before the government starts sending out checks to every American, as Mr. Yang's Freedom Dividend proposes.
One such illusion is that increasing racial proximity by integrating schools and housing is a good way to break down racial animosities and paranoias. Porter cites one study from Chicago that demonstrates the reverse. It was only when project housing for blacks was torn down that the attitudes of nearby whites toward blacks actually improved. Empathy seems to increase with social distance.
Republicans have a taken different tack. Perhaps the clearest example is Obamacare, the final version of which received no Republican votes even though it included conservative ideas and Obama was eager to include more in exchange for Republican support. But top Republicans, led by Senator Mitch McConnell, thought that any support of the bill would strengthen Obama and weaken them.
Everybody gets a fair shake next week, and the Democrats who do well will be elevated to a whole new level on the Trump enemies list, assigned a dumb nickname and attacked in the rants our president thinks of as speeches.
I think you're overlooking the places where we're not divided. I have three brothers back in Oklahoma. One is a Democrat. Do the math, the other two are not. And yet, all three of my brothers and tens of millions of people around this country get furious over the fact that Amazon reports $11 billion in profits last year and paid zero in taxes. All three of my brothers understand that we have an America that works great for giant drug companies, just not for people trying to fill a prescription. Works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for people who are worried about climate change.
Well, I'm not sure I accept the premise of the question, that they actually tried what I was talking about. Look, our No. 1 leverage is everybody wants the American consumer. They want access to the American consumer. They want to be able to sell us all of their stuff because the American consumer is not only the engine of about 70 percent of our economy; it's a worldwide engine. So I think it's perfectly reasonable to say, if you want to be able to trade with United States on the best possible terms, then everybody needs to raise their standards just a little. Who wants to do that?
We have to get this right. This is no ordinary time, no ordinary Republican Party, no ordinary incumbent, and it will require an extraordinary Democratic machine to triumph.
I didn't buy health insurance this year, but I want coverage now.
That is, he writes, the right's best health care minds believe that markets and competition can deliver lower costs and better care, and they believe it even though there is no clear example of a modern health care system built along the lines that they desire.
But what it tries to do is kind of patch up the holes in the existing system. And one of the ways that it does that is by vastly expanding Medicaid, that program we talked about for poor people. A lot more people get coverage through Medicaid, and then the government helps people who don't get insurance through work with financial subsidies that allow them to buy their own insurance.
To offset the loss of federal cost-sharing payments, many insurers increased premiums this year. State officials in many states told them to load all the increase onto midlevel silver plans, because the federal government uses the cost of such plans as a benchmark in calculating premium subsidies. Those subsidies made insurance much more affordable, because they covered most or all of the premiums for many people this year.
I said there were going to be two parts to this. So I've done part one about the inside/outside theory of change, but the second part, that's why we've got to do this through grass roots movement. We cannot do this through television commercials. If winning the presidency, and I'll speak only to the Democratic side, is about who comes in, and oh, let's see, drops $37 million in one week on TV ads, and that's what it takes to win a Democratic primary, then we have a democracy that's just our TV ads versus their TV ads, and at that point, they're fake news. They claim ours is fake news, right? Everybody just gets farther and farther and farther into their corners.
Senate leaders are now hastily trying to rewrite a sprawling tax bill — one that touches almost every part of the economy — and then pass it mere hours later. They need to do so because an independent Senate analysis late yesterday made clear what everyone already knew: The bill would add to the deficit enormously. In a normal legislative process, the Senate would have received that analysis long before taking any vote.
Before Obamacare, many products could be called health insurance. Now, health plans are required to cover services like maternity care and treatment for drug addiction, and they can't cap how much they will pay in a given year. Many of the law's critics dislike its numerous coverage mandates, but the new rules have increased patients' access to services like mental health counseling, contraception and cancer screenings.

Right, I just want to cut in here to say that in the old welfare system it had a structure where, oftentimes, for somebody on welfare getting $1 in paid labor wages would cut a $1 in welfare earnings. So, it was a situation, I've spoken to Cathy Eaton, the researcher about this, where unless you could get a job in '96 that was — or '95 let's say before the reforms, that was above $8 an hour, which for many single parents was hard. It actually wasn't economically worth it to go back to work. That is not the structure of the child allowance, which if you can get a job that's about $200,000 a year, then you begin to lose some of the child allowance. But that's a very different kind of incentive structure.
Along the way, the Justice Department has trashed the duty to defend. That's not to be taken lightly. The duty is a close cousin to the president's constitutional duty to enforce the law. If the Justice Department really thinks that Obamacare is so blatantly unconstitutional that it can't be defended, that implies that the president is violating the Constitution whenever he applies it.
Presidential history also includes the social Darwinism of Theodore Roosevelt, the federal-government-segregating, Birth of a Nation-praising Woodrow Wilson — and the bigotry that came from the mouths of presidents who are generally seen as essential to racial progress. President Lyndon B. Johnson said nigger nearly as often as Ku Klux Klansmen did.
It'll be free for anybody who's under 18. It'll be free for a family of four making less than $50,000 a year, and it will have a small price for everyone else. This is the advantage to having already identified how you can pay for this.
I've already made the pitch, and I actually had several unions say that it's a really good approach. I don't remember if the U.A.W. was one of them.
There are a couple of places to start, but I think that a nice place to go first is one of Roger Scruton's books about conservatism. He wrote a couple of books, all of which are basically called conservatism, more or less. They're short. They're accessible. And Scruton, because he, himself, had traveled from the left to the right, really had a sense that the concerns that people on the left have about the right are serious concerns and needed to be spoken to in a serious way. And I think he does it wonderfully. He's a wonderful writer. Scruton is probably underappreciated in America. He's an English conservative. He just died last year. And there's a lot of work of his it's worth reading, but I think his several short books about conservatism are a great place to begin.
Todos los presidentes cambian de rumbo al llegar al cargo, especialmente cuando suceden a alguien de otro partido. Pero nunca se había visto a un presidente tan empeñado no solo en conducir al país en una dirección diferente sino en desmantelar activamente lo que se había establecido antes de su llegada. Ya sea por encono personal, por cálculo político, por desacuerdos ideológicos o por estar convencido de que el presidente anterior dañó al país, Trump ha dejado en claro que si algo lleva la marca de Obama, él no tardará en borrarlo del disco duro nacional.
Medicare beneficiaries would face changes to medical care and possibly higher premiums.
Both measures were made possible by a provision in the Affordable Care Act, and both would be effectively gutted if the administration's position prevailed in court.

Senator Warren's famous paper laying the groundwork for the creation of the C.F.P.B. opens with the sentence, It is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one-in-five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house and later says, Why are consumers safe when they purchase tangible products with cash, but when they sign up for routine financial products like mortgages and credit cards they are left at the mercy of their creditors?
In response, climate activists are realizing that they instead need to find policies that are popular enough to survive the inevitable attacks on them.
Now it's time for our weekly recommendation when we give you a suggestion meant to take your mind off of politics. Ross, it's your turn. What do you have for us?

So I figured I'd start with this.
Then, I think the next serious moment was actually in the New Deal.
The virtual meeting, which Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, the new C.D.C. director, attended along with other officials, was laden with scientific details, clearly an effort by the new administration to make good on the president's pledge to be more transparent than his predecessor about the administration's response. During the briefing, Dr. Walensky also pleaded with Congress for additional money, saying scientists really need to have access to those resources to do the amount of sequencing and surveillance that we need in order to detect things when they first start to emerge. One variant, which has surged in Britain and burdened its hospitals with cases, has been increasingly detected in the United States. Federal health officials have warned that the variant, which is more contagious, could become the dominant source of infection in the United States by March, and would likely lead to a wrenching surge in cases and deaths that would further overwhelm hospitals. Other variants spreading in South Africa and Brazil have also caused concern. I look at the data form the U.K. and how quickly it got really bad in terms of its contagiousness and how much it could cause a spike and I am really worried about that, said Dr. Ashish K. Jha, the dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, in an interview Tuesday. It's also widespread across the U.S. — 20 some odd states have already identified it. That is the big one that I worry about.
The time stamps are a catalog of the small hours: 1:14 a.m., 3:37 a.m., 4:12 a.m., 2:34 a.m. The emails are written and sent when a great many of us are in bed, dreaming, falling asleep or fallen asleep or trying to. Maybe we are cursing that late-afternoon cup of coffee, maybe beckoned to the bedroom of a panicky child, maybe just trying to calm a restive mind.
Presidential history also includes the social Darwinism of Theodore Roosevelt, the federal-government-segregating, Birth of a Nation-praising Woodrow Wilson — and the bigotry that came from the mouths of presidents who are generally seen as essential to racial progress. President Lyndon B. Johnson said nigger nearly as often as Ku Klux Klansmen did.
KK: Senator, I think we need to move on.
Mr. Trump released his short list of potential Supreme Court nominees in May 2016. In September 2016, he released a second list with several more women and people of color, following criticisms of the white and male bias in his first.
For now, passage of the budget resolution this week looks likely. The real fight is expected to come two to three weeks from now, when two House committees and two Senate committees produce legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act and must answer to Republicans who say a replacement measure must be ready at the same time.
AK: O.K. No, I mean, it's not my critique. This is a critique on the left as well, you know, that going about forgiving student debt in this way puts a lot of money in households that are going to make a lot of money.
Jay Powell disappointed the markets and Trump
In 2009, with unified Democratic Party control and a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, the Democratic Party failed even to include a public option in Obamacare, much less establish a health insurance program that would cover all uninsured Americans.
The case was originally brought by Republican state officials, who argued that changes to the Affordable Care Act made by Congress in 2017 rendered the law's requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance unconstitutional. The Trump administration sided with the state officials, arguing that the rest of the health care law could not survive without the requirement, sometimes called the individual mandate.
There we go. But the point is there are some things about tech that are special. I mean, that we're seeing for the first time. Ways that you can be anti-competitive that we hadn't seen before, just like that was true in the early 1900s about, you know — you had the oil supply, and you also owned all the gas stations and how that one worked. We broke that apart.
During the Obama administration, Republicans talked about changing this. Senator Mitch McConnell promised that he would pass a budget every year if and when Republicans gained a Senate majority. But in 2016 there was no budget resolution at all, which led us to the unusual situation we saw last year, where there were two budget resolutions, one to set up the failed Republican health care bill and another, later in the year, to set up tax reform.
I talk about Citizens United, although that one again is either going to take constitutional amendment or some change in the personnel at the Supreme Court to reslice that issue. But I think it is important to keep that one on the table. And I talk about it because when I close, I talk about why those three things are related to each other.
For Mr. Trump, anyone who stands between him and his objective becomes collateral damage. And pity those considered part of an unfriendly demographic, such as the people of Puerto Rico, whom the president dismisses as a tool of the Democratic Party and mistreats accordingly . As the Senate has worked this week to hash out a comprehensive disaster-relief package, Mr. Trump's contribution has been to fire off a series of obnoxious, dishonest tweets charging that  corrupt or incompetent  island officials have wasted epic levels of relief funding and are now hot for Democrats to give them more, taking dollars away from our Farmers and so many others. Disgraceful! A White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, subsequently appeared on TV with a spirited defense of his boss's broadside against that country.
Paradoxically, Mr. Trump reached the same conclusion as President Barack Obama for a completely different reason. Mr. Obama refused to allow partial expansion of Medicaid because he wanted states to go for the full expansion envisioned in the Affordable Care Act.
So in a way, you're reminding John McCain of his own example, but also appealing to the ego that John McCain obviously had in very, very high measure.
Democrats want to strengthen the social safety net; Republicans want to weaken it. But why?
His intent is to offer coverage not only to those who lost it during the pandemic, but also to those who did not have insurance and now want it, according to a senior administration official who previewed the new policy during a conference call Thursday morning. The so-called special enrollment period will run from Feb. 15 to May 15. The official said the reopening would be accompanied by the kind of robust patient outreach — including paid advertising, direct outreach to consumers and partnerships with community organizations and advocacy groups — that was abandoned by the Trump administration. Typically, Americans in the 36 states that rely on the federal marketplace can buy Obamacare insurance only during a six-week period in the fall, a restriction meant to encourage people to hold coverage even when they are healthy. The sign-up period for this year's coverage ended in mid-December, with enrollments only slightly higher than they were last year. But the Trump administration did little to advertise it. Once the coronavirus struck, Mr. Trump faced pressure to reopen enrollment for the millions of Americans losing their jobs, but he refused. Mr. Biden's actions take aim at a number of Mr. Trump's policies. In 2018, citing complaints about the price of Obamacare coverage, the Trump administration issued a rule that extended the length of less expensive short term policies from three months to up to three years.
But a platform that simply encourages the worst possible behavior from someone in your position is the platform that you should just not have anything to do with, and that has to be part of our response to this by helping us avoid those bad cases that make bad law. But we're also going to need to think about what good law looks like in this situation. The internet's not going away, and that's a good thing. Social media is not going away, and that's a good thing. We have to learn how to live with it more constructively, and we're at the very beginning, I think, of a long process toward doing that.
We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can't then we don't deserve to serve you, Mr. Zuckerberg wrote. I've been working to understand exactly what happened and how to make sure this doesn't happen again.
Who are you guys here to see?
And so the party organized itself around a different set of issues and also was much more explicitly coalitional, the Democrats were. They understood themselves as representing different factions that negotiated with each other and tried to enable one another to achieve important things. The Republican Party was a little bit more of a worldview party by the Reagan era and after, certainly. And so it at least understood itself as organized by these ideas, which certainly had their roots in Cold War thinking.
Since scolding member nations at the 2017 summit, Mr. Trump has followed up with strongly worded letters to NATO nations advising that if they don't increase their payments, it will be increasingly hard to justify why American soldiers continue to sacrifice their lives overseas.
Yeah, he would call it politics.
Several of the candidates who spoke earlier in the day would go on to deliver emotional appeals for combating gun violence in later statements, including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who said he had tried to reach Mr. O'Rourke.
I think Robert Bork narrowed the standards we use for antitrust and for breaking up big companies. Market dominance by itself, when you totally dominate a market, that is anti-competitive. Then the platforms — this new — you want to go to the new part. The platforms themselves create a new kind of problem that we haven't seen. We can only do this by analogy, which is what we always do in law, but think of it this way. There's Amazon that owns the marketplace where people go and buy toasters and sell toasters, but they also are scraping bits of information off every one of those purchases. When they decide that your toaster business is getting very profitable, and they might like to crowd in on that, they take all that information they took from you without your consent and they go into the 2.0 version of your toaster business and move you back to page seven on the search.
Well, it's not good for them and in a dozen different ways. Wages are part of it, but they are only part of it. It's about unsafe working conditions, for example. If you can hire somebody for cash and not meet current labor standards on safety, that someone needs a safety belt or needs training to go up high on a building, you not only put that person at risk, you reward employers who continue not to follow the law and to undermine safety standards for everyone.
If America is to survive the challenges of the modern world, we need to heal, we need to be inspired, and we need to revive the exceptional spirit that built America. Never before have we been so closely connected to each other, but more divided as a country.
WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans, who for seven years have promised a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, took a major step on Thursday toward that goal, unveiling a bill to make deep cuts in Medicaid and end the law's mandate that most Americans have health insurance.
As to how a President Jeb Bush would choose a justice, he said, The lesson learned is you pick someone with a proven, longstanding record, a history that you can point to.

KK: Yes, and even more practically, is it enough to get anything passed in Mitch McConnell's Senate?
You know, when I put together my anti-corruption plan, which is a big plan about the influence of money, I didn't put the provision in, but it was mostly because it's like so many things, I hadn't actually seen the implications of it. I think it's actually a very bad idea, and I would like to see it as part of an anti-corruption —

The push touched off intense debate inside the Trump administration.
Well, look, I'm going to start. I don't want Mitch McConnell, obviously.
President Obama's health care battles foreshadow some of what Senator Warren might face in trying to institute her single-payer system. Mr. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in March 2010 after a protracted fight in Congress, and by November 2011 the Supreme Court had agreed to hear a case challenging its constitutionality.

And I know it's tough between here and there. I was in a very tough primary back in 2012 and I wasn't in any primary at all in 2018, so those are my two electoral experiences.
You do what you can with 50 votes to offer people what's possible. And then when lots of people get experience with it and they say, I like this, this works for me, then we vote on it and everybody gets better off and gets to try it. I think that's what's going to happen on Medicare for all. In fact, I think that is the way that we can solve our health care problems.
As I said, the modern G.O.P. is perfectly willing to sell out America if that's what it takes to get tax cuts for the wealthy.
Tariffs are one of the tools. Economic agreements across countries, that many countries join together, and say, we're not going to let anyone import if they're using prison labor, for example, or if they're dumping dangerous chemicals into the water. There are lots of ways to do this, but we can't simply think of this as a tariff, no tariff protectionism barrier. It's not. It's about regulations. Look at the dang NAFTA 2.0, look at what we were negotiating for T.T.I.P. T.T.I.P. was about financial regulations, not about goods that were moving, in a sense, the old way that people think about, that you put a bunch of stuff on a barge and you ship it across the Atlantic Ocean. And we just need to tune into the fact we know what our advantage is and we need to use it, not to try to lock others out, but to try to encourage others to come in.
Right. So I've identified pay-fors, and I lay out that if you want, you can get into it, and you've got a three-year period to be able to do it at a deeply subsidized price or at no price at all.
Instead of wringing our hands about his tweets, let's start playing up his triumphs. That is the best way to minimize midterm damage. Democrats lost over 1,000 seats nationwide under Mr. Obama. While effective in engineering his own political fate, he gutted the hopes of Democrats for a decade. Republicans have to learn to do what Democrats failed to do: run campaigns as the governing party.
But whether you think that's the right goal or not, I think the effort to really create alternative institutions has not turned out to be easy or achievable for the moment.
The Republicans make clear that that is not what they're interested in.
The health care bill, whatever its merits, was not a budget, or a central component of anyone's conception of what a budget should be. But that's what the budget resolution was used for. And that is, in many ways, the problem: The budget process is not really about budgeting anymore.
Texas did run a high-risk pool, established in the late 1990s, in which those denied in the individual market could seek coverage. But patients seeking coverage would face a one-year waiting period to sign up and premiums twice as high as those in the general insurance market. The Duke Health Justice Clinic estimates the plan had only 24,972 enrollees as of 2011, a small share of the 4.5 million Texas residents with pre-existing conditions.
It wasn't a deluge of people, but we were pleased with the type of people we were drawing in, said Audrey Gasteier, chief of policy and strategy at the Massachusetts Health Connector. It ran a special enrollment period for nearly five months last year, and had 22,800 sign-ups as a result.
Senator Warren introduced the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act in August 2018, which includes provisions to block government officials from becoming lobbyists, bar federal judges from owning stocks and more, all to be overseen by a new Office of Public Integrity. Much of what's outlined in that bill made its way into Senator Warren's campaign plan to end Washington corruption.
1. The House vote on the health care bill was delayed amid a swirl of Republican deal making and White House wrangling, but the Senate passed a measure to dismantle landmark internet privacy protections.
So let me explain what the plan is. The plan is the employer has to keep paying in as the employer does right now. The one exception to that is if you have a collective bargaining agreement, and the employer is paying in more than whatever is the standard minimal that employers are paying in. That difference goes to the workers in cash.
For now, the coronavirus pandemic is an epic of sorrow, and has many mortal months still to run. But in the midst of our suffering, our grief for loved ones lost, our loneliness in social isolation, we have a chance to re-engineer our world.
I've got to say I loved it when Joe Biden described Donald Trump as the former guy.
How different is that from Trump's indecency? Let's be clear, Trump cheated on his wife, but his party's now cheating on their kids. You tell me who's worse.
CLINTON: Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq. I said it was a mistake. I've said that years ago. He has consistently denied what is...
Do they want to cover nearly as many as are covered under the A.C.A.? A few senators, like Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, say they do, but a majority from the party are not willing to spend the money that would be needed to do that. Or do they want to significantly reduce government spending and regulation of health care, leaving Americans to navigate the free market on their own? Conservatives like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina are arguing for that, but the rest of the congressional Republicans do not want to go down this treacherous path.
But look at the difference it makes if there are multiple Facebooks out there. If you can get to anybody's page regardless of who they go through, it becomes like the phone company, right? You can have any different brand of phone, but as long as I hit the same set of numbers, I will reach you. If you could do that through Facebook, then you've got competitors offering, hey, I tell you what. You come use my site, and I won't be sharing your personal data with anybody. I will offer better security than those other yahoos offer. I will offer you a 2-cent rebate for all of the advertising. I will offer you the option to click out of ads, or you'll only get one ad every minute. That's what competitive markets do.
Under Senator Warren's plan to pay for Medicare for all, a substantial chunk of funds would come from an employer contribution into the health care fund. Senator Sanders has not released a detailed plan explaining how he would pay for the system.
I know there are millions in the same boat, said Mr. Exum, who has been walking a mile or two a day to stay healthy during the pandemic. It's just really scary.
Ms. Warren was likely referring to reporting by Sarah Kliff in The Times in November chronicling a rise in hospitals' suing patients over overdue bills.
First, some context: The 260 million or so Americans who receive health insurance through their employer, Medicare or Medicaid (including through Obamacare's Medicaid expansion) are unaffected by the prices increases. The increases instead apply to the 10 million people who buy coverage on one of the private-insurance exchanges established by the law. Even among those 10 million, the vast majority receives government subsidies that will largely or partly cancel out the price increase.
I say national unity because many Americans are terrified and troubled by how bitterly divided, and therefore paralyzed, the country has become. There is an opening for a unifier.
Then we discuss pronouns. Instead of he and she, should we use the word they?
The importance of a grass-roots movement is there is one thing that beats fake news, and actually the data showed this, and that's somebody you know. It's somebody who actually talks to you. It's somebody who does the face to face. It's somebody who reaches out. It's somebody who knocks on your door. It's your neighbor. It's the person who talks to you in line at the grocery store. That's part of it. It's why you have to build — when I did inside/outside, it's also about the importance of building grass roots, building it from the ground up. It's why I made the decisions I made in running for president right from the beginning, which we can talk about in a minute. But for me, that's at the heart of it, and then there's a second part. I'll push first to get the anti-corruption bill through. I'll push to deliver on a meaningful anti-corruption deal. I think you can get a lot of people on board for that, Democrats and Republicans to push for it. I dare you to vote against it, right? That is a fight I will have, and it will be a fight.
The climate change task force, led by former Secretary of State John Kerry and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Democrat of New York, declared rising planet-warming emissions a nationwide emergency. It also directly tied the effort to reduce fossil fuels to a need to address racial injustices that have led low-income communities to bear a disproportionate level of air and water pollution.

So let me do the pitch, because I'll tell you exactly what the pitch is. That is the Affordable Care Act already requires employers to provide health care for their workers if they have more than 50 workers. I propose we just keep that in place, and that will yield about $9 trillion over the next 10 years. That's what they pay.
No, you don't have to support the president's tweet storms. But you do have to defend his policy accomplishments. If the election is only a personality contest — rather than about the president's policies — a historic defeat awaits.
You mentioned that there was a post-Reagan consensus for some time. And as somebody who covers domestic policy and politics primarily, I often think of the Reagan legacy in terms of tax cuts, in terms of deregulation, in terms of its domestic policy. But of course, Reagan was also defined by this fight against the Soviet Union. That ended. Then a couple years after Reagan, you have George W. Bush and the war on terror, and that has not actually ended, given our deployments to different places. But I think, as a conceptual framework for the Republican Party, it has ended. Donald Trump runs, in many ways, against a lot of that Bush legacy. How much of the split that is growing in the Republican Party actually reflects a party that used to be held together by external enemies? And here, I mean foreign enemies. And now it doesn't have that. To the extent it has anything like that, it is liberals domestically, but not that foreign threat that requires a kind of unity that the past presidents were able to lean on.
We cannot be silent about another threat to the emotional health of people. In addition to biological factors, psychological and environmental factors contribute to mental illness. The hatred, racism and sexism stoked in this election worsen mental illness and must not be ignored.
KK: We have some foreign policy questions for you.
Republican county chairs and folks in the state legislature say a couple things. The first is that their position hasn't changed. They thought the governor didn't have the power then, and they don't think he has the power now to change how the election is run. The other point is that they see Wisconsin, again, as a microcosm of the conservative fight that could happen largely, and what could be a new reality of how American elections are run in this pandemic era. And in that view, dramatically expanding the electorate in these ways are not something that Republicans are all that keen on. Because what they're worried about is an election in which people who may not have participated, or may not have come out, all of a sudden have the opportunity to do so and to cast a ballot. And that kind of changes the center of power within the state.
March 3, 2020, 11:58 p.m. ET March 3, 2020, 11:58 p.m. ET A setback for Jeff Sessions, who heads to a runoff in Alabama Senate race. MOBILE, Ala. — Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general who emerged from political exile and defied President Trump to run for the United States Senate in Alabama, suffered a setback on Tuesday in his fight to win back the seat he held for 20 years, falling well short of a majority and landing in a runoff election where he will compete with a Republican rival from a weakened position. Precincts across the state were still counting votes just before midnight. But Mr. Sessions was fending off a strong challenge from a political upstart, Tommy Tuberville, the former Auburn University football coach who clung closely to Mr. Trump in a relentlessly negative and personal campaign that turned the race into a contest of who was more loyal to the president. He will now face Mr. Sessions in a March 31 runoff. A third Republican, Bradley Byrne, a congressman from the Mobile area who tried to overcome his long association with the Republican Party establishment by also tethering himself to Mr. Trump, conceded defeat on Tuesday night.

Well, Farhad Manjoo, thank you so much for coming on The Argument. And we hope you will come back and join us again.
One thing I am struck by over the past however many days it's been, the banning of Trump from Twitter and Facebook really silenced him. There are other ways he could have gotten more attention. He could be calling into more shows. He could have, when he was still president, walked out in the briefing room. So there may be a part of him that is licking wounds, too. But he is quiet in a way that I think if he were still particularly on Twitter, he would not be. And so that worked. And at the same time, in part because it worked, you have to be a little unnerved by it. You have to be a little unnerved at that power being held by Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg. There's certainly a lot of fury on the right about that, certainly a lot of fury on the right about Parler and the way that was taken out of a lot of different kinds of web providers, from app stores to cloud hosting, given their moderation structure, because these places did not want to provide infrastructure for another insurrection to be planned. How do you think about that power of tech, on the one hand, to regulate access to what I think is best understood not as free speech, but a public square? And on the other hand, it has responsibilities as a company. It wants to keep people. It wants to keep staff.
At least 158 million people across the country are being urged not to go out in an effort to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
KK: But you have to admit, many of the things you're saying are the same pitch Obama gave us in 2008, and Obama, of course, got health care done, but with a lot of compromises and left a law that I think by everyone's estimation is flawed. So what's different in 2020 — excuse me, I don't know what year it is, 2019 — than it was in 2008?
Republican leaders have long argued that fixing federal funding for Medicaid would ultimately produce significant savings in the federal budget, and the C.B.O. estimates that changes to Medicaid would decrease direct spending by $880 billion over 10 years.
We're going to have that party who lost a bunch of seats on that in 2018 versus a party that we argue with each other about the best way to try to make sure that people get health care coverage, but at least we're trying to move in that direction. And this is a salient, personal, human fact. Your health care, your housing, getting your kids educated, getting your kids taken care of in child care. Every single one of those, I like where we are. I like where I am in this fight because I think it's the right fight to have and I think we must be in this fight. We cannot take a pass on this.
So I figured I'd start with this.
Senator Warren's Medicare for all would require $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over the next 10 years. She has promised the money won't come from raising taxes on the middle class and maintains that between defense cuts and a wealth tax, the costs would be covered. But of course, that would require Senate approval — and Senator McConnell has sworn it won't happen as long as I'm majority leader.
The city will provide low-interest loans of up to $100,000 to roughly 2,000 small businesses, according to the mayor's plan. But Mr. de Blasio has also warned that the city is facing major budget cuts and layoffs. He recently announced that the city's property tax revenues are projected to decline by $2.5 billion next year, driven by a drop in the value of office buildings and hotel properties that have emptied out during the pandemic. Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo have expressed optimism that President Biden, along with a Democratic-led Congress, will bring substantial assistance to the city. Mr. de Blasio also called for higher taxes on wealthy New Yorkers in his speech — a policy he has pushed for years, but that Mr. Cuomo has opposed. Mr. de Blasio noted that more than 100 billionaires in the state increased their net worth by billions of dollars during the pandemic and called again for a redistribution of wealth. There is clearly enough money in New York to invest in a fair and fast recovery — it's just in the wrong hands, he said.
I'm still like this: Still buying hardcover books with no discount, still daydreaming about what I'm going to spend my 401(k) on when I withdraw it early, because who are we kidding, I'm not trying to live to 65, are you nuts? I don't have any debt because I've never owned anything and I dropped out of college before my loans got unmanageable. I pay for everything in cash because I don't understand A.P.R.s. My credit file was so thin from so many years of living pretty much off the grid that when I finally got around to applying for a Discover card, Experian thought I might be dead.
KK: And then I think Brent is going to close us out.
Before the Affordable Care Act, in the district and in almost all states, people were locked into existing plans because of medical underwriting: insurers charging people higher rates for using medical care and rejecting people from coverage. Thanks to the health law, many D.C. customers switched to comparable plans and saved.
To look at your options, Healthcare.gov is a good first stop. Some states list insurance options on their websites, but the federal site will point you in the right direction.
If Facebook has way too much power.
Senate leaders are now hastily trying to rewrite a sprawling tax bill — one that touches almost every part of the economy — and then pass it mere hours later. They need to do so because an independent Senate analysis late yesterday made clear what everyone already knew: The bill would add to the deficit enormously. In a normal legislative process, the Senate would have received that analysis long before taking any vote.
The two Republican-appointed judges on the three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit — Jennifer Elrod (appointed by George W. Bush) and Kurt Engelhardt (appointed by President Trump) — seemed to have little patience for the arguments in defense of Obamacare presented by lawyers for the House of Representatives and a group of blue-leaning states. (The third judge on the panel, a Jimmy Carter appointee , remained quiet during the arguments.)
So I think that what we're seeing is not Trumpification completed but Trumpification in progress and escalating, so that when Trump said that a judge of Mexican-American heritage was not fit to hear a case that he was involved in, you heard Paul Ryan come out and say that it was the textbook definition of racism. And you heard much more, I think, strenuous and immediate condemnations. And so what we are accustomed to, the amount of racial invective that it takes to even break into the news cycle, keeps increasing. You know, I've been reading Tim Alberta's book American Carnage about the G.O.P. civil war that led to Trump. And there's something he quotes that kind of everybody quotes when they're describing the evolution of the modern Republican Party. It's a famous Lee Atwater quote from an interview in the '80s. But he says, You start out in 1954 by saying n-word, n-word, n-word. By 1968, you can't say n-word. That hurts you— backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights, and all that stuff, and you're getting so abstract. Now you're talking about cutting taxes. And all these things you're talking about are totally economic things. And a byproduct of them is blacks get hurt worse than whites.
Above all, McCain believed in American greatness — as a reality, not a slogan. He knew that the United States could play a unique role in the world, as a defender of freedom and human dignity. He also knew that the role was anything but assured. It required hard work, good choices, compromise and sacrifice.
Madison was alive, and at one point, he wrote to Calhoun and responded to his ideas. He wrote in response to Calhoun's ideas that this is not what he intended at all. But then he died, and he was the last of the framers to go. And so then, Calhoun sort of had the floor to himself to reinvent the idea of the Senate. And what you find about this — and I think an example that you raise as well — is that they're not doing this on behalf of a vulnerable minority. They are doing this on behalf of the wealthy, the powerful, and historically, throughout our history, often in pursuit of oppression of vulnerable people. For Calhoun, it was the maintenance of slavery. For senators in the Jim Crow era, it was the continued oppression of Black Americans in the reign of terror, known as Jim Crow. There was an instance in the 1940s, I believe, where there was a federal anti-poll tax bill on the floor, and you had a senator from Texas defeated on a filibuster and then tell the press immediately afterwards that the issue was not poll taxes, even though the state he represented, Texas, still had poll taxes on the book, but no, no, the issue was not Texas's continued maintenance of poll taxes, it was free speech. And so that is an out for the powerful and the oppressive to ignore the consequences of their actions and try to make this about something else.
We are potentially one or two days away from a vote on a bill that would reorganize one-sixth of the American economy, impacting tens of millions of American lives, and no one knows what it is, said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. It's sort of like Alice in Wonderland around here.
I like markets. I believe that capitalism can produce enormous value. But capitalism without rules is theft, and one of those rules should be progressive taxation. Everybody pays their fair share. And one of those rules should be you don't get to crush the opposition. That's not how markets work. And that's a battle we had at the end of the 1800s and into the early 1900s, and it's a battle we need to have again. The giants have grown and they exercise so much economic power, but they also exercise too much political power.
So it seems to me, there is some relationship here, some feedback loop between what is happening in the Republican Party, who is leading it, what it is espousing and then what is happening to it in its representation in these institutions. It actually seems to me that a lot of institutions would like to be sort of in the center or not that partisan or even, in some cases, particularly in business, center right have been pushed off of ground they would prefer to be holding and, at the same time, that push has made members of the right feel much more embattled and alone in the American social and power ecosystems.
O.K, we need to leave the discussion there. And we'll be right back with our second topic of the day. [MUSIC PLAYING] Our colleague, Farhad Manjoo, recently wrote a much-discussed column about pronouns and gender. In it, Farhad calls himself a stereotypical cisgender, middle-aged suburban dad. But Farhad doesn't want to be called he or him. Instead he or, more to the point, they prefers they and them. It's one way to make society less irredeemably obsessed with gender, Farhad wrote. There is a much larger debate here about degenderization, the push for a society less governed by gender. We're going to have that debate now, and we are thrilled that Farhad has joined us for it. Welcome to The Argument, Farhad.
At the White House, President Trump criticized congressional Republicans for inaction in an appearance with families that he said were harmed by the Affordable Care Act, above.
Some of the leading 2020 Democratic presidential candidates didn't help their cause in the June debates by taking a series of unpopular positions, such as banning private health insurance, providing insurance to the undocumented, and decriminalizing border entry. They're giving Trump and the Republicans plenty to work with.
Warren's three older brothers all went into the military. That was their chance to make it into the middle class, she told me. Warren went to college and became a teacher, until the school chose not to renew her contract rather than give her maternity leave. She then went to a public law school — for $450 per semester — and became a bankruptcy expert, early on at the University of Houston and ultimately at Harvard.
My view on that one is that really you can be the umpire in the baseball game or you can have a team in the baseball game, but you don't get to do both at the same time. So breaking the platform off from the competitive business, yeah, that would give a lot of small businesses a much more level playing field and ability to compete.
CW: Intends to use their influence in this election. And Mark Zuckerberg especially. You were tweeting about that and mentioning him.
BA: Would you reduce existing access in order to achieve that goal?
La respuesta es B. Y en caso de que alguien no se haya percatado de su gran corazón, Trump añadió que tampoco quería que las personas murieran en las aceras.
But then how do you read what happened at the beginning of the Senate session? So there's a 50/50 Senate split. Democrats are going to have the tie breaking vote because of Vice President Harris acting as the presiding officer. Mitch McConnell begins the session by filibustering the organizing resolution, literally the resolution to form the Senate. So he starts out by saying, I will let you do nothing. I will not even let you build a Senate. And Schumer doesn't give in to McConnell's demands, among which were a promise never to touch the filibuster. But Manchin and Sinema then have this choice to make. And there are two kind of obvious ways they could have gone to me. One is to say, we do not want to touch the filibuster. What we want to have is a bipartisan regular order process, where we work together with our beloved colleagues on the other side to get things done. But obviously, if you abuse it this way, and you will not even let us form an organizing resolution to create the Senate, we will have to do it. So please stop. Don't make us do this. Don't make us do this thing you don't want us to do. Or they could do what they actually did and give Mitch McConnell what he wanted and tell him, in no uncertain terms, they will never touch the filibuster.
In theory, this is fertile ground for a compromise, a chance for Trump to deliver the beautiful health care he promised during the campaign. He could give up his unpopular and divisive attempt to repeal Obamacare and take the moderate path of Medicare expansion. If Medicare for all is too much, there's also Medicare for most, which would allow consumers to buy into the program as an option on the exchanges. If he wants to aim directly for the center, he could urge Republican lawmakers in states like Alabama, Florida and South Carolina to adopt the Medicaid expansion and extend health insurance to their most disadvantaged residents.
Because for me, they all are about a central question and that's: Who's going to get opportunity in this country going forward? Will opportunity be reserved just for those born into privilege? Or will opportunity be something that we say as a country, we're willing to make some hard choices to invest, so that all of our kids get those opportunities?
The Republican plan, however, changes the way premium subsidies are calculated: they would be distributed by age, instead of income.
But Democrats and consumer groups denounced the proposed rules, saying they would make it more difficult for people to enroll and increase costs for some consumers.
At the Mission, voting was the last thing on the mind of Eduardo Duran, who was waving a flyer with a photo of his nephew Miguel, a crystal meth addict who has been missing since mid-February. No one had seen him, and he was told to stick the flyer on the wall, next to several other notices of missing people. He's not homeless, but he chooses to be on the streets, said Mr. Duran. We went to all the hospitals, police, the parks. Andy Bales, the chief executive officer of the Mission, had just sent an email to his staff, asking them to spread the word to all of our guests to vote. Share your voice, be part of it, is what he likes to say to the people living at the Mission. The homeless crisis here disproportionately affects black men, and many of the voters at the Mission said they were voting for Joseph R. Biden Jr., whose candidacy has focused on African-Americans. I'm most familiar with Joe Biden, said Patrick Wright, 50, who is African-American and recently got out of prison. He is living at the Mission while he tries to get his life back on track. Read more
Think of what that means. Do — you know that the top — just one quick — one number. I've resisted numbers while I'm in here. The 99 percent America pays 7.2 percent of your total income in taxes. Not total income. Total wealth. The top one-tenth of 1 percent, the part I want to hit with a 2-cent wealth tax, 3.2 percent. 3.2 percent. They have wealth managers who are managing these huge funds that are growing at what rate? Six percent a year, 8 percent a year, 10 percent a year?
Yet 18 states — all of them with Republican-controlled legislatures, governors or both — still haven't expanded Medicaid. Why?
BS: Right. You have a lot of people in this country who actually, if you asked them about Obamacare, they hate it. These are the same people who are being wounded by the constant diminution of medical care under the Trump administration. How do you convince those people? That's the issue, because he's talking about fake news and disbelief. We had the whole discussion about death committees.
He went on to instruct listeners to go on the offensive if journalists asked about the case. The people asking the questions — those are the racists, he said. I would go at 'em.
America regularly renegotiates its defense cost-sharing agreements with host countries. In November, Mr. Trump asked Japan to quadruple its payments for the American troop presence.
— who wanted to create a universal health care program.
SS: So you mean getting rid of the combat troops there now, or preclude sending any combat troops there in the future?
Once they learn that Medicare for all would eliminate private insurance and raise taxes, only 37 percent of Americans support it, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey. In 2010, Republicans scored an enormous electoral victory because voters feared that the government was taking over their health care, even though Obamacare really didn't. Now, under Medicare for all, it really would. This seems like an excellent way to re-elect Donald Trump.
Well, I think that it's the upside of polarization. I think that at the end of the day, they care about keeping the Senate majority. And they care about Biden being successful. Right now, I think there's this sense that by standing in defense of the filibuster, they're blocking things like Medicare for All or the Green New Deal or far-left priorities from passing. But it's going to quickly become clear that they're not blocking Medicare for All, they're blocking the basic tenets of the Biden agenda. And that is a much harder choice. And I don't think they're going to like being the ones who stand in the way. I mean, Mark Kelly, Kyrsten Sinema's fellow Arizona senator, is up for re-election again in 2022. And when push comes to shove and the choice is between getting things done and Mark Kelly having a better record to run on and hopefully get re-elected in 2022, or Kyrsten Sinema's stand for the filibuster, I don't think Sinema is going to tell Mark Kelly to take a hike and fend for himself with no accomplishments because she, for some reason, feels so strongly about the filibuster, that she's going to leave him hanging like that. So I do think peer pressure can be powerful and good in that way.
Evidence from states that tried something similar last spring suggests that the extra enrollment time could be an effective way to bring coverage to hard-to-reach populations: younger Americans, and those who have remained uninsured despite the health law's coverage expansion.
Well, I think part of it is how much you're willing to do two things: how much you are willing to push and how much you're willing to be creative about the various ways in which it's done. You know, we did the same thing in Asia with South Korea, with Japan, about which costs the South Koreans pick up and which costs the Americans pick up. The cost of moving, the cost of consolidating the land, the cost of maintaining security around the perimeter. There are a lot of different ways that we can do this, and I think we should be doing this much more in partnership. I think hectoring them and putting their leaders in an embarrassing position domestically, for each of them, do you cave in to the United States president who is trying to throw his weight around by picking up a bigger share of the defense budget? I don't think that's a way to further success in this area.
Five nights a week, Mr. Kenny sends an email to many editors and reporters in New York and all over the world that recaps the news and prepares the dayside for the day ahead. The subject line of the email reads: Late note. Save for the occasional holiday flourish, it opens in nearly identical fashion each night: Good morning, all.
Number of uninsured if the current health law is not repealed
Generally speaking, dark-money groups are politically active organizations, often nonprofit, that, under I.R.S. regulations, are not required to disclose the identities of their donors.
A lot of corporate leaders have risen to the moment, throwing their companies into the race to produce masks, hospital gowns and other critically needed equipment. That's been a plus — although we're still waiting for all those testing sites Walmart and CVS were going to be welcoming to their parking lots.
For now, passage of the budget resolution this week looks likely. The real fight is expected to come two to three weeks from now, when two House committees and two Senate committees produce legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act and must answer to Republicans who say a replacement measure must be ready at the same time.
The case could have major political implications because the results sought by the Republican states and the Trump administration would cause substantial disruptions. According to estimates from the Urban Institute, around 20 million more Americans would become uninsured because of the elimination of the law's coverage expansions and protections for Americans with pre-existing health conditions.
That's right, and Joe Biden was — maybe not by then, but certainly in the '80s, into the '90s. I'd put it this way. I think it is now the case that each party is divided internally over economic questions. Even the core question of the role of government, which I think would have been the essential dividing question between the Republicans and Democrats 20 years ago, is now a question that divides Republicans, where there is a rising group, which have been identified kind of as populists in recent years and in some ways that's right, who have a much greater openness to aggressive government action for certain purposes, who are much more open to government spending than Republicans have tended to be. In some ways, Donald Trump was one of these people, but I think they mostly attached this to him. But if you think about where Marco Rubio is now or Josh Hawley has been, they are very much at odds with traditional Republican views about spending and taxes and the role of government. And a fair amount of the energy among younger people on the right is on their side, on the side of these more populist conservatives. And in some ways, the same is true in the left, where there are traditional neo-liberal Democrats. Maybe nobody would call themselves that anymore but people with a traditional, kind of Clinton-era sense of what government should be about.

If that provision is dropped, a bill that has already elicited deep misgivings among moderate Republicans — and stiff resistance from Democrats, health care providers and patient advocacy groups — could also generate concern among abortion opponents, as well as conservative lawmakers.
New York City-born Boris Johnson, the former mayor of London, would be the ideal vice-presidential pick for Donald Trump. Both are bullies and both are boorish. Neither would have to walk away from the other one's comments. And they could share the same hair dye.

Trump yet again suggests he was against the Iraq War from the beginning. He thinks if you repeat a lie often enough, people believe it. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
In the waning days of this year's Affordable Care Act sign-up period, the Trump administration declared war on the health law, releasing an executive order that could weaken its requirements and yanking advertisements and outreach off the air.
Senate leaders are now hastily trying to rewrite a sprawling tax bill — one that touches almost every part of the economy — and then pass it mere hours later. They need to do so because an independent Senate analysis late yesterday made clear what everyone already knew: The bill would add to the deficit enormously. In a normal legislative process, the Senate would have received that analysis long before taking any vote.
JI: So this is an incremental plan that you've talked about, right? So your first hundred days you have essentially two health care plans, right? You have one that — would enact ——
Specifically, critics of Mr. Biden's plan to invest $1.7 trillion in order to achieve net-zero emissions before 2050 had complained that his platform included few details on how it would achieve that faraway goal. The recommendations set a number of specific near-term benchmarks that Democrats would promise to reach. They include moving all electric power off fossil fuels by 2035; achieving carbon-neutrality in all new buildings by 2030; and installing 500 million solar panels in the next five years.
The court had heard arguments on the law a month earlier, and Kennedy had already told the other justices he considered it unconstitutional. He wanted to strike it down. Roberts had a different view, wanting to invalidate some of the law and keep other parts. During their conversations that April, the two of them talked through the substantive issues that the case involved, like the law's health insurance mandate, the cost of insurance premiums and so on.
Yes. I do think that the Europeans need to bear a significant share of the cost of defense of Europe. I don't think that hectoring or embarrassing them is a way to get there. I think we get there by talking about the ways that work best for them on the ground, but I do think it's important. It's an important partnership, and it should be a partnership.
What would a Republican Party more in the mold of John McCain look like?
These changes were devised to make insurance more affordable for people who have found premiums out of reach. To get a sense of what you will need to pay, the Kaiser calculator may be helpful while the government sites update.
Senator Warren has laid out an ambitious timeline that would put children and families under Medicare for all in her first 100 days through a congressional maneuver, then fully roll out her system by her third year in office.
Mr. Trump, during a Times interview in which he made several misleading statements, said he would make the information available at some point.
There is, in fact, no problem so big or so complex that Mr. Trump has not boasted of his ability to fix it quickly and painlessly. Repealing and replacing Obamacare with a better, cheaper system? Easy. Returning domestic manufacturing to its heyday? Easy. Lowering gas prices? Ending the drug problem? Dealing with China? Easy, easy and easy. Restoring cultural and economic security by erecting a big, beautiful border wall that Mexico will pay for? Piece. Of. Cake.
When Senator Warren suggested that Vice President Biden is running in the wrong primary, he responded in a Medium post that called such attacks condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view.
I'm hoping through him that we can do some things in North Korea that maybe we couldn't have done otherwise.
The effort has its roots in a less focused campaign at the start of the Trump administration. Four years ago, during the transition, a Trump aide printed out the detailed checklist of Mr. Obama's campaign promises from the official White House website with the goal, never quite achieved, of reversing every single one.
On this not-so-happy anniversary, a Democratic super PAC is on the air with a television commercial reminding her constituents of a repeal vote that Republicans were once convinced would be a political winner. Ms. Tenney's Democratic challenger, Anthony Brindisi, a state assemblyman, said health care is consistently one of the top issues in a vast district that runs from Lake Ontario through Utica and Rome to the Pennsylvania border.
A nationwide poll conducted by SurveyMonkey for The New York Times found that six in 10 Americans support a wealth tax. The slice of the electorate least likely to support it is Republican men with college degrees.
When Senator Warren suggested that Vice President Biden is running in the wrong primary, he responded in a Medium post that called such attacks condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view.
Medicare for all is the hottest idea in the Democratic presidential race for overhauling the nation's health care system, and it is a phrase quite likely to be heard repeatedly at the first debates this week. But despite all the buzz, it turns out that the concept is dividing the 2020 field.
• Trump administration officials say the move, combined with extended restrictions on new green cards, could bar a half-million foreign workers from the U.S. in the rest of this year.

All right, when I get going on reconciliation, man, I'm hard to stop.
Several members of the Trump family have come under fire for profiting from Donald Trump's administration in possible violation of the emoluments clause, including Ivanka Trump, who was paid more than $1 million from her ties to the Trump Organization last year. And former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter held a lucrative position on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. In late September, Ms. Warren was, in the words of one reporter, uncharacteristically flustered when asked about the Biden matter.
When our congressmen took a party-line vote that would have canceled health insurance for thousands of Virginians, I knew I had to run.
Some of the Democratic candidates have been more forthright in their criticism of Hunter Biden's role at the Ukrainian gas concern; others have been cagier. Senator Cory Booker, when asked about the controversy, said I just don't think children of vice presidents, presidents, during the administration should be out there doing that. Senator Warren, on the other hand, has said: I don't know. I mean I'd have to go back and look at the details.
So why is Mr. Bloomberg spending nearly $10 million in the state?
What happens next is unclear. The two Republican appointees on the appeals court, which is based in New Orleans, seemed sympathetic to the lawsuit during arguments on Tuesday. But perhaps they will nonetheless rule against the challenge.
Five. Five percent. We are widening racial wealth gaps in this country right now. Opportunity is shrinking for our children, and people see this. It's 12 years later. It's 20 years later from a whole set of promises that this was going to get better, and it hasn't gotten better, but people watch at the same moment. They don't look around and see a country that's getting poor. Look out your window, right? They don't look around and say, God, America's really on a downslide. They look out and they say, America is doing great. G.D.P. keeps going up. The stock market keeps going up, unemployment is down, but my family is stretched to the breaking point. My debt load is bigger than ever, and I look over the edge and see where my children are headed. I don't even see my children able to replicate what I have. I don't see them able to buy my house. I don't see them having even the job stability I had. I see them carrying more debt at 19 than I carried at 35.
The rise of short-term policies that cover fewer benefits and charge higher prices to sick customers might pull some healthier customers out of the Obamacare markets. And the association plans, which, under the proposal, would be open to small businesses and self-employed sole proprietors, may also pull some healthier, younger customers from Obamacare plans.
That's why I have been on strike with 750 co-workers for more than two weeks. That's why the other day, co-workers and I were arrested after we sat down in Harvard Square, blocking traffic, in an act of civil disobedience. And that's why the medical school students, in their white coats, have been walking the picket line with us in solidarity.
We need to encourage people by giving them a helping hand, but not allowing it to become an indefinitely giving hand, Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, said in a news release. Now, in the midst of the strongest economy in a generation, we need everyone who can work, to work. The change is projected to end SNAP benefits for nearly 700,000 adults, saving $5 billion over five years — or less than a third of the $19 billion the government has spent so far on farmers affected by the trade war.

To say that someone has lied, an active verb, or has told a lie, a more passive, distancing noun, is to say that the person intended to deceive. In addition, Mr. Nunberg said, a certain moral opprobrium attaches to it, a reprehensibility of motive.
What's really driving up health care costs, and, consequently, health insurance premiums? Let's start with drug companies charging record-breaking prices and hospitals leveraging dominant market positions for higher rates.
Medicare goes away, it's a new Medicare system, Mr. Biden said. It may be as good, you may like it as well, it may or may not, but the transition of dropping 300 million people on a totally new plan, I think is a little risky at this point.
PART A. To claim this credit you must meet some requirements.
Why? Who do you think his constituency is? I know Mike Bloomberg socially. Every summer I go to a dinner on Martha's Vineyard with Mike Bloomberg. I've argued with him about policies that I didn't like. He is enormously intelligent and capable. When he was mayor, I watched him. He could wear it lightly. It's not like Jimmy Carter with the weight of the world on him. I think that he's tough, and I think he could take on the bully Donald Trump. Very few people can stand up to a bully. Mike's got some bully in him. I think he's good.
Ultimately, it helped end serfdom in parts of Europe. Because so many people died, labor became scarce, and workers had more sway with landowning lords. Many peasants could, for the first time, own land or move for opportunities.
Here it may be that John Roberts, Kennedy's likely successor as our First Archon, is better suited than his predecessor to the imperial task. We know that Roberts is more temperamentally cautious than Kennedy, more interested in limited rulings than in sweeping ones. We also know that he's both more friendly to religious conservatism (witness his Obergefell vote) and more willing to let social-democratic policymaking stand (witness his vote to save Obamacare).
I'm talking about disorder that comes from nation states fracturing under the pressure of these climate changes and spilling out masses of refugees, triggering populist, nationalist backlashes all across the West. I'm talking about disorder spread by a Russia that wants to keep the West in turmoil.

Heather McGhee's The Sum of Us. I was lucky to read an early copy. It's incredibly good. I think that it's a holistic look at the cost of racism in America, and it's incredibly thoughtful. She moves deftly from political science, sociology, to history, and it's just an incredible book. And I would highly recommend it.
Yeah, and this is one of the great innovations that originated with John Calhoun, the senator from South Carolina and sort of the spiritual godfather of the Confederacy. People had been experimenting with obstruction before Calhoun came along. And there's sort of a very robust discussion among historians about which exactly was the first filibuster. But what Calhoun did that makes him really the father of the modern filibuster, is that he fused obstruction with this lofty defense of minority rights and an invented idea of the minority's right to unlimited debate in the Senate. And just to level set on this, the framers did not intend the minority to have the right to unlimited debate in the Senate. They were very clear about this. I'm not an originalist, but I think it's important to establish this because this is where the conversation often goes. They implemented many rules and procedures that would allow a majority to end debate when it had become obstructionist and ceased to be about persuasion and just about blocking things. One of the major rules got taken off the rule books by mistake in 1806. No one noticed for decades, and then Calhoun in the 1830s realized that taking away this ability to end debate created the potential for unlimited debate. And so he started to say that this was what the Senate is about. And it's about the minority's ability to always speak as long as they wanted.
Senator Warren introduced the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act in August 2018, which includes provisions to block government officials from becoming lobbyists, bar federal judges from owning stocks and more, all to be overseen by a new Office of Public Integrity. Much of what's outlined in that bill made its way into Senator Warren's campaign plan to end Washington corruption.
Six months ago today, a big part of the Affordable Care Act kicked in.
You can almost feel Brill's exasperation emanating from the page, though it's not the fury of the stymied leftist but the frustration of the disappointed centrist. Nothing seems to inflame him more than partisan grandstanding interfering with his idea of sensible policy.
In the case of steel, here's what happened: First came the splashy announcement of big tariffs, ostensibly in the name of national security — infuriating U.S. allies, which are the main source of our steel imports. Then came what looks like a climb-down: The administration has exempted Canada, Mexico, the European Union and others from those tariffs.
I will also fight to knock back the influence of money, because I think every time we do that, that's what that anti-corruption bill is about. It's about calling out the big drug companies. It's about calling out the big insurance companies and just disrupting the fabulous patterns they have right now to get their way in Washington. In the first 100 days, I'll go to Congress and try to get what we can get on 50 votes. What we can get on 50 votes is to offer Medicare to everybody who's 50 or older.
But a degree worse, two degrees worse. I watch that, and I watch as one more player in the game gets even more deeply embedded in Washington and Washington decision making. One more player hires more lobbyists, spends more money on campaign contributions, puts more money into bought-and-paid-for experts and think tanks so that nothing will change. It's like you talk about hardening between right and left. That's not the hardening. The part that's happening is it's hardening between the top and the bottom.
It's both capped in terms of the number of dollars, and it's capped in terms of the income.
The case the justices will hear was brought by Republican state officials, who argued that when Congress in 2017 zeroed out the penalty for failing to obtain health insurance, lawmakers rendered the entire law unconstitutional. The Trump administration sided with the state officials, arguing that the rest of the health care law could not survive without a penalty for flouting the requirement that most Americans have health insurance, sometimes called the individual mandate.
I talk about rolling back every racist voter suppression law in America. We could do that at the federal level. I talk about outlawing political gerrymandering. We could do that at the federal level.
I've seen some of the folks at The Institute for Family Studies, as a moderately social conservative think tank, they've talked about that. But it seems to me it ought to get more attention left, right, and center. [MUSIC PLAYING]
But the other half, let's say you have a complaint because the trade agreement had said that some other country would permit unionization or would not use low-wage workers beyond a certain point. Do you get a path like that? A quick resolution? And by the way, I should point out: That quick resolution? There's no appeal from it. It is immediately enforceable against a government. So you can go straight against Canada for raising its environmental standards. You can go straight against a South American country for raising its standards to protect its children's health from smoking.
Mr. Mitchell bought a similar policy the same year from a broker who promised to find the best plan in Kansas at the best price. He was found to have invasive ductal carcinoma, a type of breast cancer, in early 2018. His doctor told him that he needed surgery, but the hospital where it was scheduled told him that he did not have insurance coverage.
Senator Warren has released one of the most robust housing plans in the 2020 field, including the creation of a Tenant Protection Bureau modeled after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The sky-high rates of homelessness across the country was a major focus of Times reporting last year — read it here.
And there's been a change in the climate of communications. Smartphones connected to the cloud are super-empowering good people to be reporters, photographers, filmmakers, innovators and entrepreneurs — with a global reach — and they're super-empowering bad guys to be cybercriminals and breakers with a global reach.
What book would you give a progressive right now to read about conservatism?
Before Obamacare, many products could be called health insurance. Now, health plans are required to cover services like maternity care and treatment for drug addiction, and they can't cap how much they will pay in a given year. Many of the law's critics dislike its numerous coverage mandates, but the new rules have increased patients' access to services like mental health counseling, contraception and cancer screenings.
Yet Ms. Verma, who frequently echoes Mr. Trump's attacks on the health law, also said on Twitter that Americans continue to experience skyrocketing premiums and limited choice under the law.
You know on part of this, I think part of the answer is current law enforcement. You correctly describe it, in harassing people, in trespassing. And we need to make sure at federal, state, and local levels that people who are seeking health care of any kind have access to that health care and are not denied that opportunity. I think our laws are there. I think the weakness is our failure to enforce. That's how I see now. If there are gaps in that, I'm certainly open to understanding them better, but that's how I see it.
At a news conference on Thursday, Ms. Pelosi expressed concern that the House's Republican leadership was comfortable assigning Ms. Greene to the education committee when she has mocked the killing of little children at Sandy Hook Elementary School, when she has mocked the killing of teenagers in high school at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. What could they be thinking — or is thinking too generous a word for what they might be doing? Ms. Pelosi said. It is absolutely appalling. Ms. Pelosi appeared to have been referring in part to a report last week from Media Matters for America, a liberal watchdog group, that said that Ms. Greene had commented approvingly on Facebook in 2018 to a user who asserted that the 2012 school shooting in Newtown in which a gunman killed 26 people, including 20 small children, was staged. That's all true, Ms. Greene replied, according to the report, though the post appears to have been deleted. Ms. Greene's penchant for conspiracy theories has created a conundrum for Republican leaders and has privately infuriated many of her colleagues in the rank and file, who are upset by many of her comments as well as the flood of negative press they have drawn. A spokesman for Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the minority leader, told Axios this week that newly surfaced Facebook posts written by Ms. Greene and reported by CNN, in which she discussed executing top Democratic politicians, including Ms. Pelosi, were deeply disturbing.
The provisions challenged in Citizens United and the earlier cases all dealt with the question, What makes an ad an election ad? Before 2002, the principle was that it had to have magic words like vote for. McCain-Feingold tried to establish that broadcast ads that mentioned a candidate 30 days before a primary or 60 days before an election would be considered campaign ads (electioneering communication). That's what brought Citizens United, the organization, and its movie attacking Hillary Clinton, to the attention of the Federal Election Commission in 2008.
Right. Which to be clear, you do have at least one senator saying just that and some congressmen saying just that.
A growing divide has emerged among unions over whether to support Medicare for all. Roughly 95 percent of union workers had health care access in 2019, while just 68 percent of nonunion workers did.
The case is being brought by a group of 20 Republican state attorneys general and the governors of Maine and Mississippi. They argue that the law is unconstitutional and should be struck down.
These are the fights we need to have. These are the fights we should be bringing forward. We don't bring those fights forward. We — oh, well, we could — around the edge a little bit. Then we're just going to be the ones who stood by while America became fundamentally a country that lost even a hope that all the kids would have opportunity. That we just extinguish that and say, Nope. Better be born into it, because that's the only way to make it in America. That's not the America I want to see.
That's largely because fewer employers would offer coverage with the repeal of the employer mandate, which required large employers to offer affordable health insurance.
The Trump administration also reduced advertising for the insurance signup period and made it harder for people to sign up for insurance later in the year, two factors that could have also depressed insurance enrollment. It's also possible that some who stopped buying their own insurance did so because they got a new job with health care benefits.
And there was Senator Joe Manchin, in a sky-blue shirt with the state's craggy outline on its crest, walking the route and greeting voters who brought up his favorite issue themselves.
She accused him of willful ignorance, day by day by day as he defended the policy.
It is more accurate to say 'repair Obamacare,' Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee and chairman of the Senate health committee, said this week. We can repair the individual market, and that is a good place to start.
My answer, as you might guess, is that they shouldn't, that they should seek incremental change on health care (Bring back the public option!) and focus their main efforts on other issues — that is, that Bernie Sanders is wrong about this and Hillary Clinton is right. But the main point is that we should think clearly about why health reform looks the way it does.
I've talked to a number of kids who have been stopped. I'm trying — was trying to understand how we change our policy so we can keep the city safe. The crime rate did go from 650 down to 300. We have to keep a lid on crime, but we cannot go and stop people indiscriminately, he said.
I don't — I'm not — I wouldn't count on that.
So we have a shrinking supply and a growing population, and that means tens of millions of people are paying more to get less. So how can you turn that around? And the answer is to make a bigger investment in housing supply directly. And that includes housing for middle-class families, for working-class families, for the working poor, for the poor, for seniors who want to age in place, for people with disabilities, for people who've been incarcerated. Expanding housing supply directly, but also using federal dollars to help encourage cities and small towns and rural areas to adopt housing practices, that will lower costs even further. I just think that's a more effective way to get real structural change.
CW: I'm just curious, do you think that Facebook could tip the scales in favor of a candidate? What did you mean by that specific power and is it something that an employee like Mark Zuckerberg is going to wield on his own or just the company's power in political influence?
I have not finished reading the report, but they look like they've laid out their ducks. The Trump administration evidently does not wish to put up a defense and call its own witnesses. In fact, it seems to be still in the process of trying to block witnesses from coming and block documents from exposure. Yeah. And look, I think they've got enough. And if they've got enough, it can't be that the House impeachment process is the tail that gets wagged by Donald Trump based on when he's willing to allow access to various witnesses or various documents. Not even Richard Nixon tried to stop people from testifying or tried to stop the House from getting access to documentation. So they've got what they've got. If it's enough, then go forward.
Mr. Trump is running for re-election this year, so his budget can be read as a policy blueprint for his second term if he wins. The budget leaves to the imagination just what that vision is. Unlike in previous years, when the health care budget laid out specific plans to repeal large sections of the Affordable Care Act and replace it, this year's proposal barely mentions President Barack Obama's signature health care law.
Clinton is right that we need leverage to get ceasefire in Syria. That has been Obama's problem. My column on it https://t.co/kPGV6dO0KP — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
Today that Grand Old Party has devolved into a personality cult surrounding a racist demagogue who incites a mob to chant about a Somali-American member of Congress: Send her back!
This year alone we have successfully lowered your health insurance premiums in the state of Tennessee by 26 percent, Mr. Trump said at a rally in Johnson City, Tenn., this past week. For the very first time under the Affordable Care Act, the premium for a benchmark federal exchange plan is projected to actually drop, said Mr. Azar, who is in charge of the federal insurance marketplace.
The way I think we get something done in Washington, it's the Frances Perkins story. It's not enough to organize on the outside and have the marches in the street. Before the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire, there had been dozens of marches, right? Lots of high profile. But the guys who ran the factories figured out it was a lot cheaper just to grease palms in Albany than it was to actually change their practices and put up adequate fire escapes and fire preventive measures. So just pushing from the outside, it's not enough to get it done. Just fighting it from the inside is not enough to get it done. But the one-two punch of pushing from the outside and leading it from the inside is where you see real difference.
But what can be done about it? Corey Robin says socialism – but as far as I can tell he really means social democracy: Denmark, not Venezuela. Government-mandated employee protections may restrict the ability of corporations to hire and fire, but they also shield workers from some very real forms of abuse. Unions do somewhat limit workers' options, but they also offer an important counterweight against corporate monopsony power.
KK: O.K., Kristen's going to kill me, but thank you so much for coming.
I mean, I don't think the Supreme Court is going to kill Obamacare.
This has produced some fiery clashes, as when, in the October debate, Ms. Klobuchar suggested that Ms. Warren didn't know the difference between a plan and a pipe dream. But more broadly, it is miring the Democrats in an unnecessary fight over a policy proposal that is divisive and that would require a political miracle to achieve without a progressive takeover of the Senate. And even then, it would most likely be difficult — remember how hard it was to pass Obamacare even with Democrats controlling both chambers?
Expanding the Medicare universe from 60 million to 300 million people, Mr. Biden said, would eliminate the health insurance program primarily used by older Americans.
No. I thought you were talking about undocumented workers.
The reason why Lindsey is not married is because he can't find anyone that loves him as much as he does. [LAUGHTER]
Yeah, I think that I think that is true. That's a good point. So first of all, let's say you have a poll question on x crazy thing. Millions and millions of people are gonna, just all the way down, believe that crazy thing. But then millions of other people, if I could maybe paraphrase what you're saying as, are signaling they're belonging to a tribe, one of whose marks is accepting x as a non-insane view, right, as a tolerable view. That's not a meaningless act and it's not a harmless act if the x in question genuinely is crazy.
Right, this bill is going to pass with, like, 51 votes or 52 votes because you get all the Democrats plus Romney. No, this is one of the biggest misconceptions about the filibuster. The misconception is the idea that it promotes bipartisanship, when, in fact, it does the opposite. Because it gives the party that's out of power the means, motive, and opportunity to block the party that's in power from getting anything done. And when the party that's in power doesn't get anything done, when voters see nothing but gridlock from Washington, they turn to the party that's out of power and try to put them back in office. And Republicans are well poised to take back majorities in both the House and Senate. All they need is a handful of seats to do so. So they have every rational political incentive to block Biden from achieving any victories. A program that, as you say, would cut child poverty massively would be a huge victory for Biden. The ability for Biden to pass it on a bipartisan basis would be a huge victory for his campaign promise to restore bipartisanship and unity. So Republicans collectively don't want to see President Biden standing at a signing ceremony with Mitt Romney, signing a bill that is going to massively slash child poverty because that's not good for their political interests and their desire to take back their majorities in the 2022 midterms.
I'm sorry. And who's fighting Mitch McConnell right now and from what platform?
I mean, I think, it's hard to deny that it has happened. You can certainly see that in the way Republicans have conducted recent elections and not just in the way that the Republican politicians have behaved, but the way the various factions of the party have responded to that. It's not as though you've got significant actors in the Republican Party who are demanding that Republicans run different kinds of campaigns that have more of a policy focus on it. And I think to a large extent, Republican voters are behind this. The Republican voters themselves have become post-policy. So, it's not as though Republican politicians are being punished for not running on policy agendas and then delivering on those agendas. If anything, they feel as though they're being rewarded for doing something different. Just look over the course of the last 30 years, right? So Republicans in 1994 run on a contract with America, which has granted quite a lot of slogans in there. But there is some policy substance to it. There is a felt need to say we have some ideas about what we want to do if we take power. And then in the Obama years, the opposition party is much, much less eager to run on that idea-based platform. There's a deliberate decision not to have an Obamacare replacement plan in the run up to the 2014 elections, for example.
Senator Warren published an op-ed in The Washington Post in 2015 attacking the investor-state dispute settlement clause in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which she argued would tilt the playing field in the United States further in favor of big multinational corporations.
Over several decades, it's become increasingly clear that how immigration debates are framed is important. One of the more subtle anti-immigration tactics — employed by the Trump, Kennedy and Johnson administrations, as well as some on the political left — is to suggest that reducing immigration could preserve more jobs for American workers and lead to higher wages, but economic research has consistently disputed the notion that limiting immigration would increase domestic employment or raise average wages. The prevailing view of economists is that immigration increases economic growth; while some workers might benefit from immigration restrictions, more would suffer.

WASHINGTON — Ever since Republicans got down to the business of repealing the Affordable Care Act, the Senate has been singled out as the likely problem. Any plan that could zoom through the House would hit roadblocks among Senate Republicans, many of whom have resisted a wholesale repeal of the health law without a robust replacement plan.

James Dao: Moving from Europe to Asia, if China were to send troops, massive numbers of troops into Hong Kong, and impose a violent crackdown there similar to Tiananmen Square in 1989, what would you do as president?

A recent op-ed in The Times argued that Carrie Lam's decision to characterize the Hong Kong protests as a riot echoed a moment in 1989 when The People's Daily, the newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, referred to a gathering of students in Tiananmen Square as turmoil. Protesters in Hong Kong demanded that the term riot be retracted.
Some of the Democratic candidates have been more forthright in their criticism of Hunter Biden's role at the Ukrainian gas concern; others have been cagier. Senator Cory Booker, when asked about the controversy, said I just don't think children of vice presidents, presidents, during the administration should be out there doing that. Senator Warren, on the other hand, has said: I don't know. I mean I'd have to go back and look at the details.
Democrats in the Senate yesterday selected Gary Peters, a moderate senator from Michigan who fended off a strong G.O.P. challenger last fall, to run their campaign arm in 2022.
Under Senator Warren's plan to pay for Medicare for all, a substantial chunk of funds would come from an employer contribution into the health care fund. Senator Sanders has not released a detailed plan explaining how he would pay for the system.
No. It's a process. This is an example.
Medicare for all has created deep divisions on the left, particularly over questions like: How much would it really cost? Is Senator Warren's plan for raising the money for it progressive enough? Is it politically prudent to debate the issue now?
Ted Cruz had a teachable moment in Iowa, although he himself will learn nothing from it. A voter told Mr. Cruz the story of his brother-in-law, a barber who had never been able to afford health insurance. He finally got insurance thanks to Obamacare — and discovered that it was too late. He had terminal cancer, and nothing could be done.
Simpler? Perhaps. But not fairer. The Obama subsidies and credits are tied to an individual's income — the lower the income, the larger the benefit.
Because while most people are playing nice right now managing this virus, the wreckage, pain and anger it will leave behind will require megadoses of solidarity and healing from the top.
The president feels compelled to have something specific to counter Medicare for all. Still, people close to Mr. Trump suggested that if he did release something within a month or two, it might not be a comprehensive plan but a series of smaller proposals that would potentially help, such as ideas for bringing down prescription drug costs, for giving states more flexibility on Medicaid expansion and for promoting more access in the marketplace.
I mean, you don't even know which way the wind is blowing with this guy.

Democrats could use budget reconciliation to speed up Biden's pandemic stimulus bill. The reconciliation process allows Congress to advance certain spending and tax bills on a simple majority vote. Credit... Oliver Contreras for The New York Times If President Biden wants to quickly enact his $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal over Republican opposition, Democrats have a powerful tool they could use to do it: a fast-track process known as budget reconciliation. With reconciliation, Democrats could muscle through the package — which would provide billions of dollars for vaccine deployment, another round of stimulus checks and an extension of unemployment benefits — on a simple majority vote, bypassing a messy filibuster fight that would require them to win over enough Republicans to reach a 60-vote threshold. While Mr. Biden has said he wants to abandon the partisan tactics of the past and forge compromises with Republicans, he has also proposed an ambitious plan that stands little chance of broad support from the party. And there is little time to maneuver it through both chambers before jobless benefits lapse in March. We want to work with our Republican colleagues to advance this legislation in a bipartisan way, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said at a news conference on Tuesday. But the work must move forward — preferably with our Republican colleagues, but without them if we must.
BS: Just to tie in with Charlie here, let's just take the prescription problem.
I'm sorry. And who's fighting Mitch McConnell right now and from what platform?
So let me push back on what your theory of change is, because the way the Affordable Care Act worked is we passed it, and then it was four years later when the benefits came in, and they kind of bumped into place, right? Look at it the other way around. What I propose is as many people can get into it as want to get into it, and then once they're in, try taking it away from them, because that's what the fight then shifts to. How did we end up hanging on to the Affordable Care Act when the Republicans had the House, the Senate and the White House? The answer was we ended up hanging on to it because enough people across this country said, You're not going to take this away from me.
But is that truly possible? And here's why I ask. Take a Josh Hawley because he's come up a couple of times in this conversation. Not my favorite politician in recent weeks, in particular. But here's a guy who what he is trying to do is create simultaneously a more policy populist profile than Donald Trump really did, take some of Trump's rhetoric and make it into to actual ideas, and at the same time, be as much or even more of a fighter against liberalism, against the establishment, against the forces arrayed against the right than Trump even was, in part because I think he's not able to be as naturally celebrity-oriented and outrageous, so he's got to do much better at getting into direct fights with people. And Josh Hawley cannot come together with a Biden administration over $1,400 checks, or whatever it might be, because to do so would be to violate the other side of his politics. If you're going to combine this kind of populism with this kind of anti-establishment, and particularly anti-liberal, anti-left, anti-Democratic-Party approach, where they're real villains who maybe even just stole the election, there's no room for compromise there. You have already ruled that kind of positive-sum negotiating out because to compromise with the Biden administration is such a breach of another part of your politics. It doesn't really matter what they think about checks or coronavirus relief or that the government should move when people hurt. You can't get over that first hump.
Medicare for All or Public Option?
Clearly, I think the federal administration and Congress are moving in one direction, said Brian Feldman, a Maryland state senator who leads the state health subcommittee and was the primary sponsor of mandate legislation there. And I think states like Maryland would like to move in a different direction.
Community rating is also important for Obamacare's online insurance marketplaces. Now, people who want health insurance can go to one website and shop for plans, comparing benefits, deductibles and prices. They can choose a plan and sign up within hours.
But maybe not in Michigan. Last month, the State Senate passed a bill that would require Medicaid beneficiaries to find work or else lose their coverage. The bill, now under consideration in the Michigan House, has come under fire for harming the poor and disabled, as well as for burdening struggling families with needless paperwork. More than 100,000 people may lose health instance if it passes.
And yet everyone still seems committed to holding this election?
So did I, and I think so did a lot of Republican candidates down the ballot preparing for 2020. There was always going to be tension in the Republican message about Democratic radicalism on health care, because if you are running in 2020 on the idea that Democrats are going to blow up the current system and replace it with European-style medicine, you're kind of implicitly defending the status quo system as it exists under Obamacare. It's an extraordinarily awkward position for Republicans to be in. Can you be opposed to Democratic proposals to make the health care system even more liberal, even more regulated or structured by the government, without essentially defending the system that Barack Obama put in place? We don't know how they're going to walk that line. We don't know to what extent they'll even try. But the president's current approach, which is to say that Democrats will do something drastic and bad to your health care, and I'm not quite going to tell you what I'm going to do yet, doesn't seem sustainable.
Peters said he hoped to draw on his experience in last year's campaign during what will be a challenging and complex election year. Any time a new president reaches the midterm elections, that president's party is likely to lose seats. But the Senate map is looking relatively favorable for Democrats again in 2022, and they have their sights set on possible seat pickups in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and North Carolina.

But Hal Heiner, Kentucky's Education and Workforce Development secretary, said during Mr. Bevin's news conference that there was an abundance of jobs available to Medicaid recipients, as well as resources to prepare them.
Whoever gets the Democratic nomination, she or he will run in part on proposals to increase government spending. And you know what that will mean: There will be demands that the candidate explain how all this will be paid for. Many of those demands will be made in bad faith, from people who never ask the same questions about tax cuts. But there are some real questions about the fiscal side of a progressive agenda.
WASHINGTON — Deep into the Senate's 68-page questionnaire of Judge Neil M. Gorsuch, the Supreme Court nominee was asked to describe how he had come to President Trump's attention.
Several candidates referenced personal challenges as a way to discuss their policies. On health care, Mr. Biden mentioned a tragic accident in his family, and Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado brought up his own cancer diagnosis as he argued to build on the Affordable Care Act.
If it is sold like any other product, people with pre-existing or chronic conditions will be turned down or will not be able to afford it. If exceptions are made, insurance companies will struggle to make a profit. None of the ideas being trotted out for the replace portion of the repeal and replace have much effect on the basic problem. This is not to say Obamacare is great; it isn't. As one example, the penalty for not buying insurance was much too low. However, the idea of repealing before knowing exactly what will replace it is a recipe for chaos for everyone involved.

I'm talking about a whole bunch of parents across a wide range of ZIP codes and income categories who are struggling. I'm talking about the 36 million Americans last year who didn't have prescriptions filled because they simply couldn't afford it. Or the 35 million Americans who didn't go have a lump checked out at the doctor, or some other medical condition, because they were afraid they couldn't afford the — and these are people, most of them, many of them, with insurance, right? Couldn't afford the co-pay, couldn't afford the deductible. I think people are feeling this in their lives right now. And what is the spark, which is what I hear your question to be?

The administration set the amount to be contributed by each insurance company, but the total collections fell short of the amounts specified in the law. So the administration allocated almost all the money to insurers, resulting in the deposit of no amounts in the Treasury, the accountability office said.
When I was a girl, you had a better than 50/50 chance of doing better than your parents. Today, that seems to be slipping under a 1-in-10 chance.

And sure, a few people roll the dice and make it big and we should celebrate that, but it's like this fundamental question of who we're going to be as a country. And yeah, I do fight for a lot of things. I fight for a big vision, but if we don't start there, if we start by compromising, if we start by saying, Hey, everybody line up. We're going to knock 2 cents off your student loan debt, who's showing up for that?

Economic agreements across countries, that many countries join together, and say, we're not going to let anyone import if they're using prison labor, for example, or if they're dumping dangerous chemicals into the water. There are lots of ways to do this, but we can't simply think of this as a tariff, no tariff protectionism barrier. It's not. It's about regulations. Look at the dang NAFTA 2.0, look at what we were negotiating for T.T.I.P. T.T.I.P. was about financial regulations, not about goods that were moving, in a sense, the old way that people think about, that you put a bunch of stuff on a barge and you ship it across the Atlantic Ocean. And we just need to tune into the fact we know what our advantage is and we need to use it, not to try to lock others out, but to try to encourage others to come in.
The relative ease with which Salesforce acquired so much protective gear stands in sharp contrast to the often chaotic government efforts. While states have had to compete against each other for scarce supplies and the strategic national stockpile of protective gear is depleted, Mr. Benioff and his team simply called up their business partners in China and started writing checks.
When even a bipartisan agreement on immigration reform, focused on employment-based green cards, died on the Senate floor in September, it demonstrated just how difficult it has become to get any immigration reform legislation through Congress.
By contrast, the department said, the Supreme Court held that the individual mandate was closely intertwined with the requirement for insurers to offer coverage to all consumers at the same basic prices, regardless of their health status.

Why should it only take a simple majority to do tax cuts for the rich but it takes a supermajority to address the integrity of our elections? Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, told me. That makes no sense. Access to the ballot shouldn't have a higher hurdle than helping the rich get richer. But in today's Senate, it does. The same is true for gun control or immigration reform.
But it's to work with nations and say, you want access to the American consumer, you've got to start raising your standards in a meaningful way. And here's where the long-term goals are, here's where you are, here's what constitutes moving toward those. And I think that's where a lot of folks would like to go, and frankly we should be working with other nations on helping, not just those who lag way behind, but those who have good standards to be using the same kind of approach to trade. The idea that trade is just about tariffs is just old 20th century. Trade today in the 21st century is about regulation. It's about who's going to have to meet what regulatory standards.
MC: Not everybody likes Medicare for all, where you do away with private health care. Not everybody is going to appreciate if you've suggested that the candidate that they happen to back now is in the wrong primary. I'm just saying these things will come back as you have to win voters in swing states, things like that.
Yay! Is that on the mic?
archived recording 1 The Trump Justice Department just announced a major reversal on Obamacare. archived recording 2 Today, he called the Affordable Care Act horrible and is mounting a push to kill it off. archived recording 3 Fresh off his Mueller investigation victory, some of his biggest supporters are questioning the timing. archived recording 4 Here you have a huge messaging win for the president and the White House with this Mueller summary. Why now? Why do this? archived recording 5 Why now, maybe even why at all?
But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes. That's why we have the great migration. But she wanted to look good for the election. So they're going in.
Yeah, I think, of course, there's a lot of truth to that. And I would say Hawley is his own separate example because of his behavior in the last month, which I have had a lot to say about it and I think has been horrible and indefensible. In some ways, Hawley has been a populist longer than a lot of the people who discovered populism in the Trump era. You can find Hawley writing, even in National Affairs 10 years ago, in ways that suggested a different attitude about the role of government, about public policy. What you also find in Hawley is something that's very important to understand about populist politics, I think, which is that there's a distinction made by political scientists between a politics of who rules and a politics of the direction of policy. Both of these are part of the political life of any democracy. People care about who's in power. Do they look like me? Do they speak for me? That's very important. And people care about, what is the government doing, and do I agree with it? Populist politics often will incline to be a politics of who rules, of we should be in charge and they have too much power. And we and the they can be defined in various ways, some of them uglier than others, more dangerous and sinister than others. I think there is an inherent tendency in a populist political culture to think in terms of who rules.
Former vice president Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Kamala Harris of California spoke the most during Thursday night's Democratic presidential debate. It was the second debate of the week after 10 other candidates opened the 2020 campaign on Wednesday.
Setting aside the politics of the upheaval, the mechanics are not obvious, and could cause policymakers enormous headaches. Here are some provisions that would be particularly hard to make disappear or untangle from the health system.
Then he began backing proposals that would eviscerate the Affordable Care Act and severely damage the other programs.
The Trumpian call to duty, however, is a particularly bold — even counterintuitive — choice for a president whose core message has always been that he can save anxious Americans from having to make tough choices, to adapt to economic changes or to face scary cultural shifts. His pledge to Make America Great Again has never been about helping move the nation into the future, but about easing it back into a more comforting past. In his capacity as Strong Leader, he has vowed to take care of everything, and it is all going to be so easy.
That said, the critics' disappointment stems from a profoundly decent instinct. They're worried about Dreamers being ripped from their lives in this country. I share the worry — and the anger at Republican leaders who refuse to solve this problem.
As Donald Trump entered the second year in office, he seemed determined to destabilize his administration's fragile status quo. He pushed out a cluster of advisers, replacing them with people he liked watching on TV. He forged ahead on his long-promised policy of trade war. He decided to take the starring, summit-organizing role in his own North Korean brinksmanship. And he stepped up — well, or just continued, it's hard to make quantitative judgments — his rhetorical war against the Robert Mueller investigation.
Last year, Senator Warren introduced a bill called the No First Use Act, which would declare that the United States would never be the first to use a nuclear weapon. Opponents say it could drive arms races in smaller countries that depend on America for protection.
During the conversation, the two disagreed over Medicare for all and Mr. Biden defended the option of private insurance. But he also outlined his own plans for health care, nodded at more ideas to come and raised proposals like providing for the option to have home care paid for and elder care paid for, not as part of Medicare, as just a basic right.
Polling has consistently shown Senator Warren to be in the top tier of candidates, but not the front of the pack. She trails Joe Biden — and Donald Trump — in key swing states.
This is our chance to turn that one around.
The candidates in the second debate spent more time discussing civil rights and spent less time on jobs and the economy.
Yet none of those went as viral as a 26-minute video called Plandemic, a slickly produced narration that wrongly claimed a shadowy cabal of elites was using the virus and a potential vaccine to profit and gain power. The video featured a discredited scientist, Judy Mikovits, who said her research about the harm from vaccines had been buried.
Wait. No. Is that true? In what sense?
It will be an overthrow of all the norms, values, rules and institutions that we cherish, that made us who we are and that have united us in this common project called the United States of America.

But the bill highlights Democrats' split over health policy going into the 2020 elections.
We're anticipating Kentuckians by and large are going to be extremely confused and worried about what they're going to face and whether or not they'll continue to have coverage, Ms. Beauregard said. They'll be looking to advocates and enrollment assisters and their providers for answers, and at this point we don't have any.
But what can be done about it? Corey Robin says socialism – but as far as I can tell he really means social democracy: Denmark, not Venezuela. Government-mandated employee protections may restrict the ability of corporations to hire and fire, but they also shield workers from some very real forms of abuse. Unions do somewhat limit workers' options, but they also offer an important counterweight against corporate monopsony power.
Well, I think part of it is how much you're willing to do two things: how much you are willing to push and how much you're willing to be creative about the various ways in which it's done. You know, we did the same thing in Asia with South Korea, with Japan, about which costs the South Koreans pick up and which costs the Americans pick up. The cost of moving, the cost of consolidating the land, the cost of maintaining security around the perimeter. There are a lot of different ways that we can do this, and I think we should be doing this much more in partnership. I think hectoring them and putting their leaders in an embarrassing position domestically, for each of them, do you cave in to the United States president who is trying to throw his weight around by picking up a bigger share of the defense budget? I don't think that's a way to further success in this area.
This isn't about how it turned out, Ms. Warren said to Mr. Bloomberg. This is about what it was designed to do to begin with. It targeted communities of color. It targeted black and brown men from the beginning. And if you want to issue a real apology, then the apology has to start with the intent of the plan as it was put together.
They don't, and they kind of never have, not a consensus plan that's supported by a broad cross-section of the party and voters. And that's why when the president came out with this position through the Justice Department and then suggested that Republicans in Congress ought to come up with something great, the backlash from Republicans at the highest levels of the congressional party was swift and severe. The view among congressional Republicans was that this was just sort of a total fantasy coming from the president. The idea that they would not only come up with a plan and come up with a plan that would be popular and meet the standards that the president has laid out in rally after rally, but that they would do it within a year and then run on it in 2020 just seemed like it was cut from whole cloth.
It was the right bill then, he said. Unlike voting to give exemptions to the gun manufacturers, never a right vote under any circumstances. Being against the Brady bill was never right under any circumstances. It was right at the time.
Adivinen. Después de que Donald Trump dijo que, después de todo, no apoyaba un programa de salud pública también afirmó que no quería…
By now everyone who follows the news has a sense of how badly the Trump administration and its allies botched and continue to botch the medical side of the Covid-19 pandemic. Weeks of denial and the failure to implement remotely adequate testing allowed the virus to spread almost unchecked.
Seriously, a lot of people both in this administration and in Congress simply feel no empathy for the poor. Some of that lack of empathy surely reflects racial animus. But while the war on the poor will disproportionately hurt minority groups, it will also hurt a lot of low-income whites — in fact, it will surely end up hurting a lot of people who voted for Trump. Will they notice?
And people across the state are starting to say, well, if we can't leave our houses, how are we supposed to vote?
It is not surprising that Warren has jumped out to an early lead in the ideas primary. The main theme in her life, both professional and personal, has been economic opportunity. Her father was a carpet salesman at Montgomery Ward in Oklahoma City in the 1960s, until he had a heart attack. He had to switch to lower-paying work as a janitor, and her mother got a minimum-wage job, answering phones at Sears.
Speaker Nancy Pelosi condemned House Republican leaders on Thursday after they named Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to serve on the Education and Labor Committee. Ms. Greene supported the QAnon movement and other conspiracies. Credit Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Thursday rebuked House Republican leaders for naming Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene to serve on the Education and Labor Committee, despite Ms. Greene's previous false claims that deadly school shootings in Parkland, Fla., and Newtown, Conn., were staged. Ms. Greene, a first-term congresswoman from Georgia with a history of supporting the pro-Trump QAnon movement, wrote on Facebook in 2018 that she agreed with one of her followers that the Parkland massacre that killed 17 students was a false flag event, a term used by conspiracy theorists to describe an act committed by one group — usually the government — for which another group is blamed. In a video posted on YouTube in 2020 by her campaign, Ms. Greene followed and harassed David Hogg, a Parkland survivor who was visiting Capitol Hill to lobby for gun safety measures. In the video, Ms. Greene demanded that he explain why he was using kids to advance his cause, shouted that she was licensed to carry a firearm, and called him a coward. Republican leaders announced this week that Ms. Greene would serve on the House's education panel.
For many Americans, the Affordable part of the Affordable Care Act has seemed like an empty promise, as premiums, deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs continue to be an extraordinary burden on millions of households.
KK: But you have to admit, many of the things you're saying are the same pitch Obama gave us in 2008, and Obama, of course, got health care done, but with a lot of compromises and left a law that I think by everyone's estimation is flawed. So what's different in 2020 — excuse me, I don't know what year it is, 2019 — than it was in 2008?
Yet not all is lost on the issue for Republicans. Many Democrats, by rushing toward a single-payer Medicare for All plan, are being pulled along by ideological yearnings instead of practical realities. Medicare for All would upend all current public and private insurance arrangements, including employer coverage for about 180 million people. Further, even the sponsors admit these plans would require significant middle-class tax increases.
Because of changes to the minimum benefit packages, some lawmakers raised concerns that insurance would not cover mental health and maternity services in every state. An amendment added $15 billion in additional funding to states was designed to help fill any resulting gaps.
My view on that one is that really you can be the umpire in the baseball game or you can have a team in the baseball game, but you don't get to do both at the same time. So breaking the platform off from the competitive business, yeah, that would give a lot of small businesses a much more level playing field and ability to compete.
Here's what Mr. Trump said last week:
I guess I can see President Trump's argument there. It feels kind of legitimate. Wouldn't it be smart for Republicans heading into the next presidential election, 2020, to recognize that there are things that voters like about the Affordable Care Act? But in order for it to be a benefit for the Republicans and not the Democrats, they need to convince voters that the Democratic plan is a bad one and that Republicans will give them a better one.
KK: Throughout America, many jobs that were once held by American union members have been replaced and are now held by undocumented immigrants. Does that drive down wages in the United States?
There was the time this month when Taylor Swift announced she would air her City of Lover concert on television. The time that the cast of The Office reunited for an 18-minute-long Zoom wedding. And the time last month that the Pentagon posted three videos that showed unexplained aerial phenomena.
To some extent, they understood what they were doing, that their insurance was a result of Obamacare, and that Trump vowed to repeal it. They voted for him anyway, because they liked other things about him and because they figured he wouldn't really get rid of their insurance. If anything, they hoped he would fix the parts they didn't like, just as he promised.
MC: O.K., so we mark that one off, so we don't have to do immigration reform for this to work.
Many of the people we see are destitute, Ms. Carmichael said. But they fall into the gap, and there is little we can do to help them.
Sadly, all governors are not created equal. Ron DeSantis of Florida was still dithering about a shelter-in-place order when the state was hovering around 7,000 coronavirus cases. DeSantis said he'd make the call if the White House told him to, and Trump, even on Tuesday, was saying that it was up to DeSantis. On Wednesday DeSantis finally gave the order, but history is going to remember him as the guy who didn't see any point in banning partygoers from the beach during spring break.
So why revive the Obamacare debate? Why set yourself up for Trump Defunds Special Olympics headlines? The answer is that there are effectively two Trump presidencies. One offers something like what the president promised on the campaign trail — a break with Paul Ryan's green-eyeshade approach to entitlement reform, a more moderate tack on health care, an indifference to Obama-era conservative orthodoxies on fiscal and monetary policy.
And I came here to talk with you all about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And the very short version of this story is I went around Washington talking to people about how, do not in this crisis, simply outlaw the practices that were bad, that were used on the mortgages, that are used on credit cards, because they'll be like fence posts on the prairie with nothing strong in between. And it'll take the banks and Wall Street about three minutes to figure out how to run around them by redescribing their product or slightly reinventing their product. I think you've got to have an agency that when Wall Street moves, the agency can move. That's how financial crises — it's the only way we're going to make this work.
MG: Sorry. You think it has — go ahead. I'll let you finish.
On the other hand, some ask, should they pull out all the stops to delay a vote, gambling that such a move would end up being a wash with voters, and hoping that if they get lucky and take back the Senate, they can block Judge Kavanaugh's ascension, as the Republicans did with Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland?
We have so little time together, and yet our system forces us to waste it with bills and bureaucracy, he told the committee in his opening statement, noting that the fast progress of his disease had impressed upon him the urgency of reform. That is why I am here today, urging you to build a more rational, fair, efficient and effective system.
But we're only now starting to get a sense of the Republican Party's cruelty toward the economic victims of the coronavirus. In the face of what amounts to a vast natural disaster, you might have expected conservatives to break, at least temporarily, with their traditional opposition to helping fellow citizens in need. But no; they're as determined as ever to punish the poor and unlucky.
What happens next is unclear. The two Republican appointees on the appeals court, which is based in New Orleans, seemed sympathetic to the lawsuit during arguments on Tuesday. But perhaps they will nonetheless rule against the challenge.
I'm Ezra Klein, and this is The Ezra Klein Show. So whether you're a new listener of the show or an old listener of the show, something you're probably catching on to is that a lot of the way I think about legislative politics is about the Senate. A project of this show is to try to get you and everyone else to care about Senate rules. Because no matter what it is you care about — a minimum wage, a Green New Deal, gun control, democracy reform — whether or not bills can pass the Senate is the debate upstream of that question. So many of our policy debates, we have and we fight them out and we care about them, and nobody ever seems to realize that they're moot because nothing passes the Senate. Obviously, the key reason nothing passes the Senate is the mutation of the filibuster into a 60-vote supermajority threshold for basically everything — not literally everything, but basically everything. And this is one of those places where you really need to convince people something has changed. Because we've had a filibuster for a long time. As you're going to hear in this episode, it used to be technically stronger. It used to be unbreakable. But it wasn't used very often. And so I want to begin with this statistic. From 1917 to 1970, the Senate took 49 votes to break filibusters — 49. Those are cloture votes. That is fewer than one each year.
Clinton says she had her name on 400 pieces of legislation as a Senator. Yes, but only three bills she sponsored actually passed. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
A five-day shutdown in November was followed by the record-breaker — 21 days — starting in mid-December. That conflagration helped pave the way for the 2013 shutdown over President Barack Obama's health care law.
I think having people here who are working under the table is both bad for American workers and bad for the American economy. One of the reasons I propose to create a pathway to citizenship for everyone who's here to stay, a pathway that is fair and achievable, is to stop the problem of two-tier hiring: those who are hired in the legal system and then those who are hired outside the legal system. People who are undocumented have no protection and are frequently subject to wage theft, to unsafe working conditions, and that's not good for anyone. It's not good for American workers. It's not good for the American economy.
More than one-third of Medicare beneficiaries are covered by private insurers, in what is known as the Medicare Advantage program. Many of the remaining beneficiaries have private insurance coverage, through Medigap and Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage or their former employers, to help offset the health care costs not covered by Medicare Parts A and B, which amount to almost half of the overall cost of their care. In fact, 44 percent of Medicare dollars goes through private insurance plans and a majority of Medicare beneficiaries must interact with private insurers.
Many of us stayed in dead-end jobs for years just to keep our health insurance.
You can't cut $1 trillion from these programs and protect the most vulnerable, she said.
In 2001, George W. Bush's tax cut was supported by 12 Democrats in the Senate and 28 in the House. His education bill also received significant Democratic support, as did multiple virus relief bills during Donald Trump's presidency. Some Democrats saw these bills as opportunities to win policy concessions.

In the years since the bill's failure, the story has repeated itself elsewhere. In Australia, a Labor Party-led government put in place a carbon tax in 2012, only to be swept from office the next year by conservatives who ran on an ax the tax platform. In France, to quell the yellow-vest protests, President Emmanuel Macron's government withdrew its gas-tax increase late last year. In the United States, voters in Washington — a blue state — rejected a ballot initiative last year that would have created a carbon tax, by a vote of 57 percent to 43 percent. And in places that have imposed a price on carbon, like the European Union, California and some other states, it tends to be too low to be effective.
The proposal would do two things: make upper-middle-income Americans newly eligible for premium subsidies on Obamacare marketplaces, and increase the financial help that already goes to lower-income enrollees. Taken together, some experts expect these changes to drive more sign-ups for Healthcare.gov plans after they fell in the Trump era.
There are two big problems with market-based policies today.
The House leadership aide said that lowering the cost of insurance was a much better way to encourage people to opt in.
And the only question for Snowe, Collins, Grassley, and those folks would be if they wanted to get a piece of the credit for it and if they wanted to help shape the policy to move it in their direction. They still could have decided no, but the bill would have passed. It would have passed faster. And the policy design would have been much more effective. We wouldn't have had to jerry rig it all these different ways that we did that made the benefits take longer to kick in, harder to execute, and all these things that ended up making a worse bill because we had to get 60 votes. The other thing that I would say to the central idea that bipartisanship is necessary to create lasting policy is that it just has never proven to be true. The Senate was a majority vote institution for the vast majority of its existence, all the way up until, arguably, the '70s and the '80s, when things started to more routinely face the filibuster in the 60-vote threshold. So if you think that that's a requirement, then you would have to discount any piece of legislation that you think was a good piece of legislation that passed over those previous 200 plus years. Medicare was not required to get a supermajority. It passed on a majority vote basis. It never had to clear a supermajority threshold. It never faced a filibuster.
And so candidates here held more than 20 events today, under the ever-present shadow of the 2016 primary.
The United Automobile Workers has nearly one million members. Along with the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Teachers, it has yet not taken a stance on Medicare for all.
But it's to work with nations and say, you want access to the American consumer, you've got to start raising your standards in a meaningful way. And here's where the long-term goals are, here's where you are, here's what constitutes moving toward those. And I think that's where a lot of folks would like to go, and frankly we should be working with other nations on helping, not just those who lag way behind, but those who have good standards to be using the same kind of approach to trade. The idea that trade is just about tariffs is just old 20th century. Trade today in the 21st century is about regulation. It's about who's going to have to meet what regulatory standards.
KK: Senator, I think we need to move on.
And the potential benefits are large, as real-world examples attest. Other countries, especially Germany and China, have rapidly expanded their clean-energy production through public subsidies. The United States could do the same. When Washington has invested in nascent industries in the past, the return has been fantastic. The successes have easily paid for the failures. The internet, the pharmaceutical industry and fracking (its environmental impacts aside) are among many examples. In addition to research funding, a Green New Deal could also expand performance standards to sectors beyond utilities, like transportation.
O.K., it's not news that politicians make misleading claims, some more than others. According to a running tally kept by Daniel Dale of The Toronto Star, as of Monday morning, Donald Trump had said 4,682 false things as president.
People buying those plans may face some unpleasant surprises. The plans are likely to require applicants to fill out detailed health histories, and to exclude those with prior illnesses. They also are likely to exclude or limit services — like addiction treatment, maternity care or prescription drugs — that all Obamacare plans require. Association plan buyers have tended to have problems with fraud. And some short-term plans have a history of declining to pay for serious illnesses after the fact.
Part two is again, we should be working more with our allies. Donald Trump seems to think somehow that we are stronger alone and I think that's fundamentally wrong. If you want to bring economic pressure on China, if you want to bring diplomatic pressure on China, it makes a lot more sense to do that if we're doing it with our allies, if we're doing it in conjunction with others. And I think that provides potentially much better protection for Hong Kong. The idea that this is going to be a direct military conflict between China and the United States, that would be deeply destabilizing to the entire world. So I want to see us use our diplomatic tools. I want to see us use our economic tools, and I want to see us leverage everything that we want to do by working much more tightly in conjunction with our allies. We just haven't been doing that. None of the above.
So the reason you're hearing a lot about it is, it's an end run around the filibuster and a way to avoid having to pass things with 60 votes in the Senate, which I think personally is how we should do most things in the Senate. But the reason you're hearing about reconciliation is that it is sort of one of the few ways you can avoid the filibuster without going nuclear and getting rid of the filibuster altogether. It's a process that was invented in the 1970s and was meant to apply only to the budget and things directly related to the budget. This was when the Senate decided to start passing budgets on a regular basis. The size of the government was growing. It was also an attempt, when it was created, to take back power from the executive branch and have the Congress play a leading role in setting spending priorities for the country. In order to prioritize budget-related work, it created a special fast track procedure that allowed anything that was consistent with its rules to go down this fast track. And on that fast track, there is no filibuster. It's majority votes from beginning to end. There's no point at which it has to clear a supermajority threshold. And there's no point at which opponents of the procedure can block the reconciliation package indefinitely. So Democrats are trying to use this procedure to pass Biden's COVID relief package.
It'll be free for anybody who's under 18. It'll be free for a family of four making less than $50,000 a year, and it will have a small price for everyone else. This is the advantage to having already identified how you can pay for this.
The process is subject to strict rules that limit what can be included.

Nowhere has this been truer than with health care, where the administration has reversed direction multiple times.
The chief sponsor of the bill, Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, said it would cure a deep sickness within our for-profit system of health care.
So the way I see this is all I can do is get out and tell you what I'll fight for, and I'll point out the difference between the two. I try not to get over my skis. No, I do. I've really tried hard not to be personally critical of other candidates. I got a little heated once, but once, and because I think this is the fundamental question. Do you think that this democracy, do you think that this economy, do you think this government is going to make it if all we're offering are little nibbles around the edges?
It made health insurance more comprehensive.
Which would put us in kind of a familiar situation of having considered a big government-run health care system and saying, no, thanks.
The Justice Department's response may be even more audacious. In a court filing, the department refused to defend the statute — a rarity — and expressed its support for a ruling in the states' favor. Most shockingly, the Justice Department accepted part of the states' argument that other key parts of the A.C.A. must fall with the mandate. Specifically, the department argues that two key insurance reforms — the requirements that insurers must accept everyone regardless of health condition at relatively equal rates — must go down with the ship.

WASHINGTON — Paul Ryan, the House speaker, is by all accounts a man of integrity and intelligence. When it came to the failed attempt by House Republicans to scrap President Obama's legacy health care law and replace it with something that better reflected their conservative values, Mr. Ryan did as well as could be expected given the sharp divisions within his party's ranks. But it may be time for him to quit his post as speaker. It is a position for which, thus far, he has proved remarkably unsuited and in which he has allowed the House to suffer a series of humiliations.
news clip (donald trump) As far as I'm concerned, if you hate our country, if you're not happy here, you can leave.
Just over a week after Plandemic was released, it had been viewed more than eight million times on YouTube, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, and had generated countless other posts.
Even in Northern cities, blacks were often denied opportunities for upward mobility. For example, in 1944 white transit workers in Philadelphia went on strike — disrupting war production — to protest the promotion of a handful of black workers.
Why does Trump want to leave this court case hanging? Partly because his side would probably lose. As I said, the lawsuit is ludicrous, although, given the partisanship of Republican-appointed judges, it might prevail anyway.
MG: Sorry. You think it has — go ahead. I'll let you finish.
writes that if the president wants to follow through on pro-union campaign promises, there are many pro-labor things Mr. Biden can do even without Congress. Chye-Ching Huang argues that one of the best ways for the president to pay for ambitious policies and help honest taxpayers is to restore the funding the I.R.S. needs to effectively battle tax cheats.

Manu Brabo/Getty Images The European Union has been besieged by problems since it approved its first coronavirus vaccine in December and rushed to begin a vast immunization campaign, but now its woes have snowballed into a full-blown crisis. With the pain of supply shortages being felt across Europe, Spain on Wednesday became the first E.U. country to partly suspend immunizations for lack of doses. It announced that it would suspend the vaccination program in Madrid for two weeks, and warned that Catalonia may follow suit. Tomorrow our fridges will be empty, said Josep Maria Argimon, a regional health official in Catalonia, referring to the dwindling supplies of vaccine. Tensions were also raised by an escalating dispute with AstraZeneca over the drugmaker's announcement that it would slash deliveries of its vaccine by 60 percent because of production shortfalls. When the European Union approved its first vaccine, made by Pfizer and BioNTech, in December, it was already weeks behind rich nations like the United States and Britain. While it is flush with cash, influence and negotiating heft, the bloc of 27 nations has found itself behind not just the U.S. and Britain, but also other countries like Israel, Canada and the United Arab Emirates. Across the world, many countries, particularly poorer ones, are struggling to secure any vaccine at all. Last week, the E.U.

But Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington said on Twitter that while some upcoming potentially volatile events would require extra security, she would not accept fencing and additional troops as a long-term fixture in DC. When the time is right, the fencing around the White House and U.S. Capitol, just like the plywood we've seen on our businesses for too long, will be taken down, she tweeted. Earlier this week, Ms. Pittman apologized to Congress for the security failures on Jan. 6 and attested that her department knew of a strong potential for violence but failed to take the necessary precautions. On Thursday, officers stopped a man trying to gain access at a security checkpoint near the Capitol, according to Capitol Police. The officers told the man, later identified by the Metropolitan Police Department as Donald Barr, 51 of Macomb Township, Mich., that he could not enter, but he tried to bypass them. He then actively resisted arrest, the Capitol Police said in a statement. He has been charged with felony destruction of property and two counts of assaulting a police officer, among other charges. A day earlier, Capitol Police arrested a 71-year-old man, later identified by the Metropolitan Police Department as Dennis Westover, for possession of unregistered ammunition and unlawful possession of a firearm. An officer approached him after he exited his car and began walking, asking if he had a gun inside the vehicle, according to a Capitol Police statement on Thursday.

The brief version is: The Supreme Court ruled in 2012 that the health law was legal even though it overreached in requiring people to buy health insurance, because that requirement — known as the mandate — wasn't really a requirement. People could choose not to have insurance and instead pay a fee, which meant that the mandate was more akin to a tax on the uninsured. Congress clearly has the right to impose taxes.
The failure of those markets, they argued, was the reason Obamacare should be repealed.
So last week was as close to a moment of total happiness as President Trump has had in a long time.
Margot: But the president wasn't talking about little tweaks. I feel that he recommended at least two pretty substantial policy changes. The idea of offering more subsidies to buy health insurance has been talked about before, but certainly not by the Obama administration. His essay seems like a real acknowledgment that health insurance still isn't affordable enough for some people. We've talked before about hearing from higher-income people who still can't afford health insurance. Between premiums and deductibles, some people are spending more than 25 percent of their incomes on care, according to an Urban Institute report.
As it stands, all of this is obviously unlikely. It's also striking to see how far the president is from the center of American politics. The most expansive Democratic proposals for strengthening the social safety net are far closer to the political mainstream than the great majority of Trump's actions as president. And he shows no sign of changing course. Trump is still committed to his base, still obsessed with mobilizing his strongest supporters. This may get big crowds in friendly territory, but it might not be enough to win a second term in 2020.

In 2012, Massachusetts Democrats, worried about a tough fight against Republican Senator Scott Brown, coalesced around Ms. Warren, knocking her only primary challenger, an immigration attorney, Marisa DeFranco, off the ballot. Winning in November is more important to Democrats than standing behind one woman who wanted to challenge another one for the right to run for U.S. Senate, Boston Globe columnist Joan Vennochi wrote at the time. Whether Ms. Warren could beat Mr. Brown, the incumbent, was more of a tossup, though by late summer 2012 most polls had her ahead.
JI: But one of the premises for massive health care reform is that the Affordable Care Act is not working in a lot of ways, right? So you support Medicare for all presumably because you think the Affordable Care Act has a lot of holes in it, and we need to do something different, so you'll be defending that.
The whole episode fits a Trump administration pattern. In describing his behavior with lobbyists, Mulvaney did something outrageous and worthy of attention. And yet he also managed to divert attention from policies doing real damage to Americans.
I like markets. I believe that capitalism can produce enormous value. But capitalism without rules is theft, and one of those rules should be progressive taxation. Everybody pays their fair share. And one of those rules should be you don't get to crush the opposition. That's not how markets work. And that's a battle we had at the end of the 1800s and into the early 1900s, and it's a battle we need to have again. The giants have grown and they exercise so much economic power, but they also exercise too much political power.
Privately, feel free to enjoy normal liberal thoughts like that Al Sharpton makes a lot of sense. Publicly, assume that everyone you talk to is a Republican or an independent unless you are chatting with the Butterfly Herbs cashier ringing up your bulk Korean ginseng or you happen to bump into Jeff from Pearl Jam. If anyone asks, your favorite artist is the Great Falls cowboy painter Charlie Russell, though nobody will, because it goes without saying.
As for those who actively defy the president, the goal is not simply to punish them for a single transgression but to discourage them from future rebellions. Deliver a painful enough lesson, and everyone will fall into line .
I don't know. I almost think that the opposite thing is probably true — that it's really hard to imagine it being possible to pass something that would be so earth-shattering, that would make so many changes to our health care system, to our tax code, to the way that health care is delivered if we don't have buy-in. And so I think that a real challenge for politicians around this issue is really going to be winning hearts and minds and trying to convince people that this vision of how the health care system should work is worth the disruption. The people who really believe in it really believe in it, but there are a lot of people that they will have to persuade.
The new fund will invest in female entrepreneurs at a crucial time, Ms. Abramson said: Venture investments in start-ups founded by women accounted for just 4.3 percent of all deals in the first quarter, down from 7 percent a year ago, according to Pitchbook.
And to me, a good example of that is Florida. I mean, Ron DeSantis, who's the current governor of Florida, ran a campaign last year that were it not for Donald Trump, I think, would have stood out for how racialized and, I would argue, racist it was. And Ron DeSantis is now the governor of Florida who's doing all kinds of things like trying to take voting rights away from African-American former felons. Ross, I take your point that this is not full Trumpification, but I do worry that it's moving in that direction.
Actually, I don't do polls. I haven't looked at them, so I don't know, but I'll tell you this. I'm out there fighting for those votes every single day. I've been to 29 states and Puerto Rico. I will keep doing this. I've been to blue states and red states, and talked about how we build a future. I think that's what we've got to do. We've got what, two more months before the caucuses start, but this is the question in front of us as a country. How do we think about how to go forward? Is the message going to be business as usual after Donald Trump? It's just too damn hard to get anything done. Therefore, we're just going to just kind of nibble at that problem of all the folks who can't get child care and teachers who are working three jobs?
So Trump is no Nixon. And the country he's trying to dominate — his favorite word — is very different, too.

After the endorsement interview, Senator Warren reached out to Mr. Warzel to clarify her response on 20th century antitrust. In that follow-up interview, she said: Antitrust law is a very valuable tool and breaking them up would have important effects but what I realized after I left in the room is that I was pulled in a different direction but I never finished to say that antitrust law is important but not the only tool we need. I don't believe that markets alone are going to fix all the problems we're facing on the tech side. Particularly the issues around privacy and the values that come from aggregation on platforms and how that value would be distributed. I don't believe only antitrust works but I do believe its a powerful tool we should be using in dealing with Big Tech.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi — who celebrated her 79th birthday on Tuesday — had already planned to move to change the conversation with the unveiling of the Democrats' own health care plan on Tuesday. The Democrats' bill aims to lower health insurance premiums, strengthen protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions and ban the sale of what Democrats call junk insurance.

Along similar lines, Rhodes and Schaffner found in their 2017 paper that:
I think we need to get our combat troops out. I don't think that combat is advancing the interests of the United States in the Middle East, and it's time to end combat operations. Of course we'll have a continuing presence in the Middle East. We have interests in the Middle East with our allies. We have interests in the Middle East and keeping shipping lanes open, and we will continue to have a presence there, but I don't think combat troops are how we best advance that presence.
MC: So as you're out there trying to convince people to join you on this mission, at certain times, and certainly in the debates it's come up that people who do not embrace your path lack the political courage or will, or they're scared, as you've said, to embrace big change. Now, certainly this will appeal to a lot of Democratic voters, but there are also a lot of more moderate swing voters, Democratic voters who will be put off by the idea that just because they don't embrace your particular policies, they somehow are not courageous or that they're wrong in their ideas. So how do you reach out to these people, because you can't win the nomination just with the progressive base. You've got to kind of convince these people who are nervous about the big ideas. For instance, Medicare for all that you're pitching is not a overwhelmingly popular idea.

• A group of financiers has teamed up with scientists to create a Manhattan Project for Covid-19, The Wall Street Journal reports, and their recommendations have gained traction at the White House.
This is an important space, I think. I think of you as an institutional thinker, and so I'd like to talk about this from the perspective of Republican Party institutions. And I don't just mean here the party structure itself and its primary rolls, but also mean allied media publications and ecosystems and interest groups. And there used to be this idea that Democrats fall in love and Republicans fall in line. And the idea was that it was a Democratic Party that was chaotic, that was unpredictable in who it would nominate, that was unpredictable in whether or not it would listen to its own governing or organizing institutions. It didn't have coherence because there's all these different groups coming together. And now, Democrats have become — not without exception, but in general — a much more predictable party. They tend to nominate the next in line — Joe Biden, and before Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton. And its Republicans where this anti-institutional force has, it seems to me, overwhelmed the institutions. When I look at the difference between the two parties, it is not that the Democratic coalition and the liberal base does not have conspiracy-minded people in it or people who take a very black-and-white view of the world. But the institutions are still quite moderating. The Democratic Party has some influence over its primaries, as we saw in the Democratic primary, when there was that rush of endorsements that ended up pushing Joe Biden over the edge.
When you're spending that much money unopposed, you're doing two things, Mr. Goldstein said. You're getting the general advantage, yes, but it's also allowing you to play everywhere, which is an advantage for delegate math.
Single-payer advocates point out that the United States is the only advanced nation without universal health care, which is true. Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland have achieved universal coverage and affordable health care with, essentially, more comprehensive and generous forms of Obamacare that require people to buy insurance, tightly regulate insurers and provide subsidies to the poor and middle class.

Yeah, I mean, as a former communications guy, I think there's always wiggle room. And they were sort of saying, we won't get rid of the filibuster, we won't eliminate the filibuster. Maybe I'm being — maybe this is wishful thinking on my part, but I see plenty of wiggle room to reforming the filibuster, changing, restoring all these different sorts of things. But I think probably what they're thinking is, they were essentially restating their positions as they've been in the past. And any sort of movement on their parts would have been read as a massive signal that the filibuster was on its way out. And so, I personally wish they'd been a little more forward leaning. But I do think that probably what they wanted to do was just maintain their position. It's sort of like when Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, was asked about it recently. She just stated, the president's position hasn't changed President Biden could be making a very ardent, aggressive defense of the filibuster if he really wanted to keep it. But he's not. He's leaving his position where it is because the minute you sense any movement on Biden's part, the floodgates are going to open. And I think the same is true of Manchin and Sinema. Ultimately, they may currently be thinking that they are going to stand in defense of the filibuster, and they're going to find a way to forge bipartisanship.
He was asked, is John McCain a hero? And Donald Trump said, no, he's not. I like people who weren't captured.

Well, I would add he also got a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
So let me push back on what your theory of change is, because the way the Affordable Care Act worked is we passed it, and then it was four years later when the benefits came in, and they kind of bumped into place, right? Look at it the other way around. What I propose is as many people can get into it as want to get into it, and then once they're in, try taking it away from them, because that's what the fight then shifts to. How did we end up hanging on to the Affordable Care Act when the Republicans had the House, the Senate and the White House? The answer was we ended up hanging on to it because enough people across this country said, You're not going to take this away from me.

As the nation confronts the coronavirus crisis, the presidential candidates are facing a new challenge to their pursuit of the Democratic nomination: how to connect with voters during the height of the presidential primary campaign — from a safe distance. Both Mr. Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders, his chief rival in the primaries, have had to pull back from large-scale events this week and allow their staff members to work from home.
First, with the former governor of Texas on the ticket, even a bozo like Donald Trump would be unlikely to lose the state.

The changes will last only for two years. But for some, they will be considerable: The Congressional Budget Office estimated that a 64-year-old earning $58,000 would see monthly payments decline from $1,075 under current law to $412 because the federal government would take up much of the cost. The rescue plan also includes rich new incentives to entice the few holdout states — including Texas, Georgia and Florida — to finally expand Medicaid to those with too much money to qualify for the federal health program for the poor, but too little to afford private coverage.
Each dot below is a television ad from a Democratic presidential candidate that ran a week before Super Tuesday. Maps show all ads airing in 15-minute increments. Locations are based on media market areas. States in white will hold elections on Super Tuesday.
A look into some of these ad buys gave an indication of how Mr. Bloomberg might amass delegates, even while losing some states, to be competitive. Because the Democratic primary features proportional delegate allotments, often by congressional district, a candidate who comes in third or fourth over all in a state, but has an exceptionally strong showing in a certain area, can still amass a significant delegate count.
NF: How do you deal with the fact that while people might want big change, they're also afraid of it?
A result is that Congress hasn't completed the entire budget process, with all the spending bills, on time in more than 20 years. Many years, it has not passed any budget resolution at all. This is perhaps the most basic responsibility of the legislative branch, yet for decades, Congress has repeatedly come up short.
When a former engineer revealed a pattern of sexual harassment at Uber last year, Travis Kalanick, then the company's chief executive, said he would immediately open an investigation.

JI: I want to just pivot very quickly to health care. It seemed like a good moment. With respect to what you will fight for, can you talk a little bit about Medicare for all and where it ranks in terms of your priorities, and then to kind of sort of reiterate the question, how do you convince people who are wary of massive health care overhaul yet again that that's the right approach to that problem basically?
It's interesting. So when candidates like Bernie Sanders say Medicare for all, potentially, he's actually trying to change the American culture to the point where Medicare for all could actually work. In other words, when he or anyone says Medicare for all, they're actually calling for the cultural change required for the U.S. to get excited and adopt Medicare for all.

I mean, the cost savings doesn't come in on the first day, but you sign the papers that need to be done, so you reduce costs on the first day. The second is to give people the opportunity to be in Medicare if they want, anyone who's 50 or older, and expand the coverage for Medicare. It's to offer Medicare for all complete health care coverage to everyone else who wants it.

Now, that's only for collective bargaining agreements, but that's real money in the pockets of those union numbers. Secondly, what at least some of the unions liked about this is the unions never have to bargain on this one again, once you get all the way to Medicare for all, because their workers will have health care coverage. Which means they can bargain once again over wages and working conditions and keeping jobs here in the United States instead of having to go back to their members year after year after year and say: We just bargained. Great for you. Your salary will go up one half of 1 percent, and your deductible will only go up by another $2,000.

My view on that one is that really you can be the umpire in the baseball game or you can have a team in the baseball game, but you don't get to do both at the same time.

Even before the Trump-focused blame game started, Chief Justice Roberts was well on his way to becoming the political right's favorite punching bag. In a rambling speech on the Senate floor last month, Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee, defended the Republican refusal to move forward with President Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to fill the Supreme Court's vacant seat. Playing off an observation the chief justice had made shortly before Justice Antonin Scalia's unexpected death, to the effect that the Senate confirmation process had become unfortunately divisive and political, Senator Grassley said it was the Roberts court itself that was political. Physician, heal thyself, he said, and then offered this observation:
After the Kavanaugh hearings, I think the question that everybody has on some low level about what happened to Graham is now the question we're all openly asking — what happened to Lindsey Graham? So did you actually pose that question?
Oh, absolutely. And if the concern among folks like Mick Mulvaney is that walking away from the fight looks like surrender, the view from a lot of Republicans on the Hill is they've already lost. They can talk about how they lost, or they can talk about other stuff, and the president is choosing to talk about defeat.
In his speech, Nordhaus explained that people use too much dirty energy because they don't have to pay the true costs it imposes on the world: pollution-related health problems in the short term and climate change in the long term. Economists refer to these costs as externalities, because they are not naturally part of the market system. We have a climate problem, Nordhaus said, because markets fail, and fail badly, in the energy sector. The only solution, he argued, was for governments to raise the price of emissions.

Well, the Souter choice was unfortunate, Mr. Bush said, speaking on CNN's State of the Union. He wandered off into the liberal camp for sure.
But not everywhere. Several states are considering whether to adopt their own versions of the individual mandate, Obamacare's rule that people who can afford insurance should pay a fine if they don't obtain it. A few are looking to tighten rules for short-term health plans. Some states are investing heavily on Obamacare outreach and marketing, even as the federal government cuts back.
Medicare for all builds on the idea that everyone should have access to affordable health insurance, but it kind of turbo-charges that idea. Medicare for all says everyone gets the same health care.
Well, why would you say that? Because it's very tempting to see this story as an anomaly, right, in that the governor of Wisconsin waited a very long time to try to postpone the state's primary — perhaps too long — and the state legislature is this hyper-partisan, conservative, activist body that is trying to use its power for political advantage. So all those factors would seem to make Wisconsin a bit of an outlier.

President Trump's lawyers and aides are scouring the backgrounds of investigators hired by the special counsel Robert Mueller, looking for conflicts of interest, people with knowledge of the effort said.
AK: Sure. I'm really interested in the student loan debt issue, but there's a concern that your plan to forgive student debt really tilts a lot of resources towards the wealthy. So only 2 percent of borrowers have more than $50,000 in debt. A third of all student debt is owned by people in the top income quartile, and most student debt goes to households with advanced degrees. So these are doctors and lawyers, and they've amassed a lot of debt, but they're also investing in their own educational capacity to pay off that debt. So I'm just wondering how you square that with a plan that goes about forgiving student debt?
Mr. Trump, for his part, has at times sought to use the uncertainty to his advantage. Last month, after his most ardent supporters had attacked the worst-case death estimates for weeks as evidence of hysteria, Mr. Trump began calling attention to the two million figure — as a benchmark against which to judge his handling of the crisis.
The poor will only be better off if it leads to policy change in an aggressive way, he said.
Some years ago, Tucker Carlson mounts the stage at CPAC and says, conservatives need their own New York Times. They need a place that goes out and does that reporting and is not completely bought into the movement's incentives. And if they think The New York Times is more liberal, they need to create something that is like it but conservative. And he goes on to create The Daily Caller, which I would say is not at all that kind of operation, and then he becomes, I think, a pretty scary form of right-wing nationalism now on Fox News prime time. I'd say there are similar things in the movement against liberal academia. I could understand constructing alternative institutions. But in the effort to construct them, they seem to have created things that are very, very movement oriented and have very little defense against the movement's incentives, whereas a lot of these institutions that do lean liberal, in terms of the personnel, they also have contrasting and crosscutting incentives. They don't want to be seen as too closely allied with the Democratic Party. They want to be understood as independent. They sometimes bend over backwards to criticize Democrats to show they're independent. So why do you think there's been that different institutional construction path?
The number of people who have denounced Medicare for all as politically impractical continues to grow — the former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel called it a pipe dream in a recent Washington Post op-ed, in which he called on proponents to please explain to me exactly how we get that bill through the Senate?

When the moderator asked who would abolish private health insurance in favor of a government-run plan, only Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Ms. Harris raised their hands. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York explained that she supports Mr. Sanders' Medicare for all bill, but that it will have a transition period for people to actively buy-in.
Good afternoon, everyone. The House of Representatives will soon begin voting on the American Health Care Act, the Republican plan to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. This vote is shaping up to be an extraordinary moment in President Trump's young tenure and a true nail-biter on the floor of the House. Speaker Paul D. Ryan went to the White House earlier in the day to tell Mr. Trump that, because of a wave of Republican defections, the bill did not have the votes to pass. But the president has insisted that he wants to have lawmakers on the record through a vote.
Ms. Harris turned to face Mr. Biden as she brought up the Obama administration's deportation policy.
But Sanders isn't making a selective case, arguing that Obama should have been more aggressive on some fronts. He's arguing for a maximalist agenda on all fronts: complete elimination of private health insurance and a vast expansion of government programs that would require major tax increases on the middle class as well as the wealthy.
Who should replace Justice Antonin Scalia is the political question du jour.
I will also fight to knock back the influence of money, because I think every time we do that, that's what that anti-corruption bill is about. It's about calling out the big drug companies. It's about calling out the big insurance companies and just disrupting the fabulous patterns they have right now to get their way in Washington. In the first 100 days, I'll go to Congress and try to get what we can get on 50 votes. What we can get on 50 votes is to offer Medicare to everybody who's 50 or older.
I'm naturally a really quiet person, but if I sit and do nothing and they take it away, how can I live with that? asked Kim Nelson, 54, a Republican second-grade teacher who buys coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace and was recently treated for breast cancer. She has been calling and writing her congresswoman.
A federal appeals court panel will hear arguments today on whether a federal judge in Texas was right to strike down the Affordable Care Act. The case, which could end up at the Supreme Court, threatens insurance protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions.
I did not come to Washington to hurt people, said Senator Shelley Moore Capito, above, a Republican from West Virginia. I cannot vote to repeal Obamacare without a replacement plan that addresses my concerns and the needs of West Virginians.
That Congress can fail to pass a budget with so little consequence — if anything, it boosted Republicans, by giving them two opportunities to try major partisan legislation — shows what a cynical charade the process has become. The eventual budget resolutions that were passed reveal how disconnected the process has become from actual budgetary considerations. The Republican resolution a year ago was what's known as a shell budget — essentially just a set of instructions that would have allowed the health care bill to be passed with a simple majority vote.
What book would you give a conservative to read about democratic socialism?

But it's not going to be real change because so long as the lobbyists are writing it, so long as they're the ones who are in the ears of the folks in the House and the Senate, we're just going to keep making little, tiny changes, and I just don't think we can keep doing that.
Being relevant to Donald Trump, being in his orbit, helps me influence the things that I think are good for our country. And then —
But the expensive Los Angeles media market includes Orange County, the former Republican stronghold that saw four of its six congressional districts flip from Republican to Democrat in 2018, turning the entire county blue.
Well, Mr. Trump's base strategy is producing precisely that kind of enthusiasm gap in the polls I am conducting for Democracy Corps and its partners, the Women's Voices Women Vote Action Fund and the American Federation of Teachers. Mr. Trump's strategy is to continue to build support with the Tea Party supporters and evangelicals who make up a plurality of those who identify as Republicans, but they are by no means the whole of the party. And Mr. Trump shows as much interest in winning over those less enthusiastic Republicans as he does in winning independents and Democrats — which is to say, not much.
And I think right now, the push should be not to expand because that's the issue that's on the table.
His intent is to offer coverage not only to those who lost it during the pandemic, but also to those who did not have insurance and now want it, according to a senior administration official who previewed the new policy during a conference call Thursday morning. The so-called special enrollment period will run from Feb. 15 to May 15. The official said the reopening would be accompanied by the kind of robust patient outreach — including paid advertising, direct outreach to consumers and partnerships with community organizations and advocacy groups — that was abandoned by the Trump administration. Typically, Americans in the 36 states that rely on the federal marketplace can buy Obamacare insurance only during a six-week period in the fall, a restriction meant to encourage people to hold coverage even when they are healthy. The sign-up period for this year's coverage ended in mid-December, with enrollments only slightly higher than they were last year. But the Trump administration did little to advertise it. Once the coronavirus struck, Mr. Trump faced pressure to reopen enrollment for the millions of Americans losing their jobs, but he refused. Mr. Biden's actions take aim at a number of Mr. Trump's policies. In 2018, citing complaints about the price of Obamacare coverage, the Trump administration issued a rule that extended the length of less expensive short term policies from three months to up to three years.

Five. Five percent. We are widening racial wealth gaps in this country right now. Opportunity is shrinking for our children, and people see this. It's 12 years later. It's 20 years later from a whole set of promises that this was going to get better, and it hasn't gotten better, but people watch at the same moment. They don't look around and see a country that's getting poor. Look out your window, right? They don't look around and say, God, America's really on a downslide. They look out and they say, America is doing great. G.D.P. keeps going up. The stock market keeps going up, unemployment is down, but my family is stretched to the breaking point. My debt load is bigger than ever, and I look over the edge and see where my children are headed. I don't even see my children able to replicate what I have. I don't see them able to buy my house. I don't see them having even the job stability I had. I see them carrying more debt at 19 than I carried at 35.
Democrats want to strengthen the social safety net; Republicans want to weaken it. But why?
# #6 Obamacare taxes New change Most Obamacare taxes phase out this year. Previously Obamacare taxes would have phased out in 2018. Who's happy with this change Tax cutters
Some lobbyists have tacitly accepted the likelihood that major provisions of the health law will be repealed, setting their sights instead on shaping its replacement. They fear that if they come out strongly in opposition to repealing the law, they will lose their seats at the table as congressional Republicans and the Trump administration negotiate a replacement.
If your monthly income is low enough to qualify for Medicaid but you expect your annual income to be higher than the above income thresholds, you could also choose to buy an Obamacare marketplace plan, probably with substantial subsidies. See below.
All of this is true. But the main reason that Democrats — including many centrist Democrats — are moving away from market-based programs is not that they have had a change of heart. It's that they are coming to terms with political reality.
I would say that the one difference between a case like this and something like the Charlottesville case is that Trump's foils here are genuinely unpopular figures to the extent that they're well known. That could make this a case where he gets away with more bigotry because it's seen as a choice between Trump's bigotry and Ilhan Omar's far-left politics. But I think, in general, we have a very clear track record that when Trump is seen to be explicitly race-baiting, lots and lots of voters who might be otherwise inclined to support him don't like it.
Yes, and he had the high risk tolerance necessary to sort of run the experiment because the conventional wisdom at the time was that the minority party would be punished by voters if they offered nothing but relentless obstruction, instead of cooperation. And when Obama came into office, he was riding a 67 percent approval rating, the highest since JFK. Democrats had made massive gains in the House and Senate for two straight cycles, 2006 and 2008. And the general conventional wisdom was that Republicans, if they wanted to avoid extinction as a party, should cooperate with this massively popular president and his giant majorities in the House and Senate. So it took a real bold insight and then a willingness to carry it out on McConnell's part to sort of defy all of the conventional wisdom and say, no, we are going to oppose him at every turn. The 2010 midterms, which ended up being a disaster for Democrats, if you looked at them in 2009, it was not clear that Republicans were going to do well in those midterms. A lot of the Senate races were in states Obama won. And so it took sharp insight on McConnell's part and the willingness to take the punishment from the punditocracy to carry out the strategy and deny Obama cooperation in every way.
To say that someone has lied, an active verb, or has told a lie, a more passive, distancing noun, is to say that the person intended to deceive. In addition, Mr. Nunberg said, a certain moral opprobrium attaches to it, a reprehensibility of motive.
So whenever people are being paid outside the legal system, it undercuts protection for everyone and gives an advantage to the employers who move outside the legal system. You know, look, it's part of the same basic principle. Everybody should follow the same set of rules. And if our labor standards are there's a $15-an-hour minimum wage, then everybody should pay it. If the labor standards are that you don't get to put somebody up working in an elevator shaft who has no training, then every employer should have to follow that. And any time an employer can get the work done by not following the rules, that employer gets an unfair advantage, and that unfair advantage undercuts the strength of everybody who follows the rules, undercuts the economy, undercuts workers.
In 2016 they disliked Hillary Clinton and were willing to give Trump a chance, telling themselves, How bad could it be — and hey, anyway, we have the Constitution to protect us. Then they witnessed just how bad it could be and that the Constitution in Trump's hands could not protect us. Democrats running in swing districts in 2018 also kept it simple, focusing on Trump's attempts to destroy Obamacare and coverage of pre-existing medical conditions.
A 2-cent wealth tax, and now let's talk about what kind of change we could make. Two cents, and we can do universal child care. We can put $800 billion into our public schools.

Republican congressional leaders are trying to put together a plan that could pass muster with the Trump team and also win approval in the Senate under fast-track procedures that would neutralize the threat of a Democratic filibuster.
Typically, Americans without a special circumstance can buy Obamacare insurance only during a six-week period in the fall, a restriction meant to encourage people to hold coverage even when they are healthy.

I will say, so in the second part of your argument about the importance of gender pronouns for people who feel that it very strongly represents them, I think that that universalizing they could well be used as a way to kind of — I heard from people in comments, for example, that they felt that this could lead to something like a erasure for them. And I think that is a danger. I mean, the way that I — the thing that I come back to though is that when people use they, they are very consciously using it as a neutral pronoun. And I don't think that — I think that there would be instances where you might have it used in this trolly way. But that happens with all language. The more pernicious thing you notice all the time is people deliberately misgendering others — and then kind of inadvertently because you don't know or you don't know how to say it. And for those things, I think they takes care of it. You know, one thing I worried about in writing this, and I think it was one of the main criticisms from the left and especially for trans and non-binary people, is that what I was doing here was a kind of appropriation of what they need to do, me doing it from a position of privilege, and that I'm a cisgender man and don't really have a need for this pronoun.
After Super Tuesday, states that are scheduled to vote start postponing and sometimes outright canceling their scheduled primaries.
The law also made other changes, like cutting the amount the federal government paid hospitals and other providers as well as private Medicare Advantage plans. Undoing the cuts could increase the program's overall costs by hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Ms. Neuman. Premiums for as many as 55 million people under the program could go up as a result.

So I'm just going to read the section of the Federalist Papers — and this is from Federalist 22 — just because I love the quote so much. The necessity of unanimity in public bodies or of something approaching towards it — so a supermajority requirement — has been founded upon a supposition that it would contribute to security. But its real operation is to embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of the government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority. They really did look at this, and they really did reject it. And the point you made here — and frankly, the point they make there — I think is very important and very subtle. And it is one of the things that has actually changed in the way people thought about this over the course of my time in Washington. And I will immodestly say I've tried very hard to get people to change the way they thought about this. Which is when I came to Washington, the dominant view was bipartisanship is something the minority wants, and the majority has to be incentivized to offer them. That the problem in governing is that if the majority is power, they will lock the minority out. They will never let them in. And so, you really need to construct your rules, such as the majority has a reason to work with the minority.
At a time of high drug prices and its heaviest political expenditures in years, the pharmaceutical industry has directed substantial resources through AAN and other such groups that hide the identity of their donors and have few if any limits on fund-raising.
Bret: I wonder about that. Coronavirus rates are also rising steeply in California, which had a lockdown about as severe as New York's. And fatality rates are so far holding steady or rising only slightly even in states like Texas and Florida that have seen infection rates soar over the last month.
Humana's move could be a harbinger of things to come, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University who studies the health insurance market and who has warned that the lack of clarity from Congress and the Trump administration could result an exodus by insurers.

And it was very effective. They took over a lot of seats in the House that had previously been held by Republicans. But I think the exact message that they drew from this is a little bit mixed. I think a lot of them felt, oh, people really just want me to protect what they already have — that we have a very good message in protecting the Affordable Care Act. But some of these Democrats who won running on health care felt like this is a reason to go forward, to push further than the Affordable Care Act because the electorate really responds to this issue. And I think you can really see this now as the 2020 presidential field is starting to heat up. Senator Sanders, obviously, continues to support it. Cory Booker, the senator from New Jersey, is in favor of the Sanders proposal. Elizabeth Warren was a co-sponsor of Senator Sanders' bill in the last Congress. But it is not universal among Democratic candidates. We saw Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic senator from Minnesota, who said, this is too aspirational. It's too pie in the sky. We need to focus on more incremental changes that are more politically possible. They all want to make some increase for the role of government — try to have there be more health care available for more people, to make it more affordable. But there is this range from little technocratic fixes to let's do single-payer.
I've seen some of the folks at The Institute for Family Studies, as a moderately social conservative think tank, they've talked about that. But it seems to me it ought to get more attention left, right, and center. [MUSIC PLAYING]

The showdown is on the extreme end of tensions playing out this election year in a number of Republican-controlled states that have resisted expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Following Maine's lead, advocacy groups in Idaho, Nebraska and Utah have gathered enough signatures to get Medicaid expansion measures on their state ballots this November, although Nebraska's have yet to be certified. Already, two prominent Republicans there, a state senator and former state senator, havechallenged the effort in court.
Biden plans to reopen Obamacare exchanges in many states. President Biden spoke about his plans for the Affordable Care Act in November. Credit... Amr Alfiky/The New York Times The Biden administration plans to reopen enrollment in many of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, both to help those who may have lost health insurance during the pandemic and to offer coverage to those who did not have any and now want it. The move will be announced on Thursday as part of an executive order describing administration policies on shoring up health insurance coverage, according to three people familiar with the details. The so-called special enrollment period is intended to help people who have lost coverage in the past year, but it will be open to those who want health insurance for any reason, in the 36 states that use Healthcare.gov. The decision was reported earlier by The Washington Post. Typically, Americans without a special circumstance can buy Obamacare insurance only during a six-week period in the fall, a restriction meant to encourage people to hold coverage even when they are healthy. The sign-up period for this year's coverage ended in mid-December, with enrollments only slightly higher than they were last year. But the Trump administration did little to advertise it.

O.K. But he also, by doing so, he elevated these four members of Congress to really be symbols of the Democratic Party. And he kept the discussion to be about race. And what it reminded me of was this quote from Steve Bannon where Steve Bannon says, and I'm going to read it, The Democrats, the longer they talk about identity politics, I got them. I want them to talk about racism every day. So it sounds like you both disagree with that.
That bill would also have eliminated federal insurance subsidies, ended federal spending for the expansion of Medicaid, and barred federal payments to Planned Parenthood clinics.
A growing divide has emerged among unions over whether to support Medicare for all. Roughly 95 percent of union workers had health care access in 2019, while just 68 percent of nonunion workers did.
Most of the arrangements remained a secret until Tuesday, when details first appeared in an account released by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stephanie Clifford, the actress who was paid $130,000 to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Mr. Trump and is now suing to be released from the agreement. The New York Times confirmed many of Mr. Avenatti's disclosures through a review of financial records.
Second, a more McCain-like Republican Party would understand that racism is both immoral and, in the long term, politically ruinous. McCain had a multiracial family — the kind that is increasingly America's future. Rather than scapegoat immigrants, he took risks to pass immigration reform. After Charlottesville, he declared, White supremacists aren't patriots, they're traitors.
His chief task in the days ahead, though, may be ensuring that Republican colleagues facing re-election next year, including Senators Roy Blunt of Missouri and Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, run again rather than retire.
Previous presidents have appealed to Americans' patriotism in wartime. In peacetime, President Kennedy's 1961 inaugural entreaty — Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country. — inspired an entire generation.
A recent analysis from the Wesleyan Media Project showed that health care was the most common subject of televised campaign advertisements by Democrats in both the House and the Senate. This is the uniform issue across a lot of the states, and then these candidates will talk about things that are particular to their constituents, said Lauren Passalacqua, the communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

No, it's not fine. I really want to say that this is really — I am upset about this, and I want everybody else to be upset about it. And I need to come up with a new name for budget reconciliation, so people don't tune me out when I talk about it. But let me give an example from the bill that I want to talk about. So Biden's big rescue package is going through budget reconciliation. It's going through budget reconciliation because it cannot get 10 Republican votes in the Senate. And so you are already seeing things get carved out of it that are important. So you can pass a big expansion of the Child Tax Credit in reconciliation. You can do $1,400 checks in reconciliation. But something that is obviously important and very cheap for the government and an efficient thing we could do would be emergency paid leave, making sure that people, when they are sick, can stay home without it being a terrible economic hardship on their family. And that could get taken out of the bill because it doesn't fit reconciliation. It looks like the same thing will happen probably to the $15 minimum wage. And obviously, Senator Bernie Sanders is trying to keep that from happening. But I would be surprised if he is successful in that. You worked in the Senate. You worked for Harry Reid. You were his deputy chief of staff. Did it feel crazy to do things this way?
Legal experts across ideologies criticized that decision. The Trump administration , which has long waged war against President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement, has more or less embraced the lower court's ruling.
Was conciliatory thinking along the lines of racists aren't ready for that in your head in 2009 when you were dealing with the incident with the Cambridge police? Oh, yeah. President Obama made an innocent comment that the arrest was stupid, which it was. Then all of a sudden all these racists are beating up on him. My whole attitude was channeled through the desire to protect our first black president. But there was another motivation. I thought that it would be hubristic and dishonest if I compared what happened to me to what happens to black people in the inner city. I thought, If I didn't have the protections of class and status —
Senator Warren introduced the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act in August 2018, which includes provisions to block government officials from becoming lobbyists, bar federal judges from owning stocks and more, all to be overseen by a new Office of Public Integrity. Much of what's outlined in that bill made its way into Senator Warren's campaign plan to end Washington corruption.
Right now there are two big progressive ideas out there: the Green New Deal on climate change and Medicare for all on health reform. Both would move U.S. policy significantly to the left. Each is sponsored by a self-proclaimed socialist: the Green New Deal by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Medicare for all by Bernie Sanders. (Of course, neither of them is a socialist in the traditional sense.) Both ideas horrify not just conservatives but also many self-proclaimed centrists.
AK: But the Obama administration tried, past presidents have tried — how would you do it?
Would a President Jeb Bush have signed a strong executive order on religious liberty, or would a President Marco Rubio have started construction of a wall? Would President John Kasich have had the intestinal fortitude to execute such a huge reorganization of the Environmental Protection Agency, dismantling the liberal bureaucracy that with its deeply embedded biases harms our economy? Would President Mitt Romney have pushed through such a major tax overhaul? No way. What makes Mr. Trump different is that he just doesn't care what the bed-wetting caucus says about his policies.
Michael Conway, who served as counsel for the house Judiciary Committee during the Nixon impeachment inquiry, said President Nixon also tried to deny the investigators access to key materials, but Mr. Trump has gone a step further. Mr. Conway said, Nixon was equally resistant to turning materials over and documents, but he did allow people to testify.
Here's what I told John. He's president, and I've seen you, once the election was over, embrace people.
What makes this lack of energy especially striking is that the American Rescue Plan doesn't just spend a lot of money. It also embodies some big changes in the philosophy of public policy, a turn away from the conservative ideology that has dominated U.S. politics for four decades.
But it's to work with nations and say, you want access to the American consumer, you've got to start raising your standards in a meaningful way. And here's where the long-term goals are, here's where you are, here's what constitutes moving toward those. And I think that's where a lot of folks would like to go, and frankly we should be working with other nations on helping, not just those who lag way behind, but those who have good standards to be using the same kind of approach to trade. The idea that trade is just about tariffs is just old 20th century. Trade today in the 21st century is about regulation. It's about who's going to have to meet what regulatory standards.
KK: But does it drive down wages for American workers?
Look at the example. He said, I will take your money to lie about other candidates. What does that mean for our democracy? Not even meet the minimal standard that TV ads run, right?
Senator Warren has argued that the sheer size of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon pose a real threat to innovation and competition in the technology industry. Mr. Yang has argued that her diagnosis is 100 percent correct but that her solution isn't fully effective because competition doesn't solve all of the problems.
KK: You seem to have avoided that approach for the most part. Can you just explain why?
And then there's a cap on it, as I remember. It's something like basically after four children, it stops.

No, it's fine. It's just that look out there. People's financial circumstances have gotten worse. The amount of student loan debt has been going up at a rate of $100 billion a year. Oh, here's one. Just saw some data not long ago out of the Department of Education. Go take a look 20 years out on people who borrowed student loan debt. Ninety-four percent of whites have paid off their student loan debt. Want to guess what the percentage is for African-Americans is?
The problem as I see it in the housing market, just picking that one, is we have a supply problem. The two big providers of housing from half a century ago just aren't there. So the developer that built the two-bedroom, one-bath house, garage converted to hold my three brothers for their bedroom, that developer is building McMansions today. And I'm not mad at him. That's where the profits are. And the federal government, as you know, now under current federal law, can't expand federal housing. It can only do replacement when it's taking it off the market. And if it takes it off the market and it doesn't replace it, then it shrinks even more. Housing deteriorates like anything else.
So, of course, McConnell spent enormous amounts of energy whipping Republicans to deny Obama bipartisan cooperation on Obamacare. So it wasn't just sort of a fact of life he was observing that he had failed to get a single Republican vote. It was something McConnell deployed every tool in his arsenal to do. And I detailed that in the book.
AK: Sure. I'm really interested in the student loan debt issue, but there's a concern that your plan to forgive student debt really tilts a lot of resources towards the wealthy. So only 2 percent of borrowers have more than $50,000 in debt. A third of all student debt is owned by people in the top income quartile, and most student debt goes to households with advanced degrees. So these are doctors and lawyers, and they've amassed a lot of debt, but they're also investing in their own educational capacity to pay off that debt. So I'm just wondering how you square that with a plan that goes about forgiving student debt?
No, but look. All right, so what do you want to do? You want just give up? Say, Aw, gee, Mitch McConnell ….  Let's go get the begging bowl and say give me a crumb or two, and I will say thank you. That's what it means now to be a Democrat to the party in opposition.
But Mr. Trump doubled down while talking to reporters in the Oval Office. He predicted that the Texas decision would be upheld by the appeals court, then go to the Supreme Court.
I went to Washington. I came here to New York to talk to people about the idea for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and I heard two things over and over and over. Part one, that's a great idea. It would actually make a real difference. That would be structural change, or as I now say, big structural change, in financial services. And part two, don't even try, because you'll be up against the big banks. You'll be up against Wall Street. You'll be up against all of the Republicans. You'll be up against half the Democrats. You'll never get it done. But we did get it done.
We got strong as a country through democracy and capitalism. We got rich as a country through trade. We got smart and powerful as a country through immigration. We got fair as a country through Social Security, Medicare and Obamacare. They all lead to vastly more winners than losers. This is no time to lose confidence in what got us here. If you're running for president and are not for all these things, you're wrong — and I hope you lose.
While not all health coverage was capped, most companies had some sort of limit in place in 2009. A 2017 Brookings analysis estimated that 109 million people would face lifetime limits on their coverage without the health law, with some companies saying they would cover no more than $1 million in medical bills per employee. The vast majority of people never hit those limits, but some who did were forced into bankruptcy or went without treatment.
Do you like him on a superficial, like, we golf together, we have a little rapport level?
He would die for this country. I love him to death.
The Justice Department said that the protections for people with pre-existing conditions were inseparable from the individual mandate and must also be struck down.
Actually, I've done 175 stump speeches and I've talked about it in every one of them. You all haven't covered it. I talk about three things that I think we need to do ——
# #5 Tax credits New change Most people buying their own insurance get a flat tax credit based on age, but the Senate might increase funding for Americans between 50 and 64. Previously Most people buying their own insurance got a flat tax credit based on age. Who's happy with this change Moderates, particularly those from rural districts
Something that you write about in the book that I thought was such a smart point is that in this era, a very effective move is taking something like, say, the anti-lynching bill that has 70 plus percent support, and saying the issue here is not lynching and what you think of lynching. The issue here is my right to be heard. It's a right to unlimited debate. It's the deliberation that makes our country great. And I think you see this still in all kinds of issues, where people say they don't want to debate the issue. They want debate free speech, right? The issue is not whether or not a bunch of senators and the president tried to whip up an insurrectionary mob against the Capitol. The issue is whether or not Josh Hawley is going to get to publish his book with Simon and Schuster or Regnery. Could you talk a bit about that way in which the filibuster is used to take the focus off of the issue and onto this question of debate?
It has made many Americans more financially secure.
Astead, where does this political dysfunction that you're describing in Wisconsin, where does that start?
But then something weird happened. [MUSIC]
Tying is an arrangement where to buy one product, a consumer also has to buy a different product from a separate market. An example the F.T.C. offers is a drugmaker that required all consumers buying its medicine for schizophrenia to also buy its blood-monitoring service. The Supreme Court has treated the practice as illegal in the past, but more recently lower courts have permitted it under the more flexible rule of reason.
This was a missed opportunity. We reinforced a narrative that's bad for us as a nation. It came across weak.
WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Thursday proposed sweeping new rules that could make it easier for small businesses to band together and create health insurance plans that would be exempt from many of the consumer protections mandated by the Affordable Care Act.
You can almost feel Brill's exasperation emanating from the page, though it's not the fury of the stymied leftist but the frustration of the disappointed centrist. Nothing seems to inflame him more than partisan grandstanding interfering with his idea of sensible policy.
If Facebook has way too much power.
archived recording Wisconsin's Republican-controlled legislature passed a series of bills late Wednesday night that would limit the powers of incoming Democratic governor Tony Evers.
And that's what I admired the most about you. If you could go to Vietnam and forgive them, anybody could. If you could work with Obama, anybody could. And I want to stay in this guy's orbit.
BS: Well, you had your fire.
The 25-year-old Karlie Kloss publicly broke from the Trump clan when she tweeted a picture of herself voting for Hillary Clinton. Then she showed up at the women's march the day after the inauguration. Josh, 32, who thought about giving a TV interview about his differences with his brother but changed his mind, was spotted with her. But he also went to the White House on his own and Instagrammed a picture of himself with Jared, standing beneath the portrait of J.F.K.
Maybe his only chance, because Democrats now control the House. There is really no shot for Republicans to pass a bill repealing the Affordable Care Act. So if they're going to take it down, they're going to take it down in the courts.
Bloomberg just has bad connotations that come along with him, Leah Garwood said as she waited in line with her husband on Sunday in Las Vegas for roughly 45 minutes to vote for a different billionaire, Tom Steyer of California. It's just at the back of my mind. It makes me uncomfortable, uneasy.
And yet developing the postindustrial economy — while addressing issues such as inequality, greenhouse emissions and the condition of public schools — will require optimism. Pessimists think in terms of rear-guard actions to turn back the clock. Optimists understand that where the nation has faults, it's time to roll up our sleeves and get to work.
One parallel Senator Warren has used in her plans for breaking up Facebook is the government's antitrust case against Microsoft in 1998, which Senator Richard Blumenthal and Tim Wu wrote in The Times made Microsoft a gentler giant.
Why should it only take a simple majority to do tax cuts for the rich but it takes a supermajority to address the integrity of our elections? Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon, told me. That makes no sense. Access to the ballot shouldn't have a higher hurdle than helping the rich get richer. But in today's Senate, it does. The same is true for gun control or immigration reform.
Now, control of the White House and a slim majority in Congress mean the first real prospect of significantly strengthening Obamacare since it became law in 2010. President-elect Biden's inclusion of policies to shore up the health law in his first major legislative package has raised those hopes further.
The degree of disruption these policies will cause remains unclear. But they are likely to work together. The individual mandate is believed to have pushed some healthy, reluctant shoppers to buy insurance, and they may no longer feel the nudge when it goes away.
The tension between incremental and transformative change has been a feature of the 2020 campaign. Mr. Obama, for instance, weighed in to say that the typical American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system, an implicit critique of Senator Warren's and Senator Sanders's campaigns.
KK: We have some foreign policy questions for you.
But this year's budget will serve as a blueprint for Mr. Trump's priorities if he wins a second term. And some of the proposals can be achieved without the approval of Congress.
Michael Conway, who served as counsel for the house Judiciary Committee during the Nixon impeachment inquiry, said President Nixon also tried to deny the investigators access to key materials, but Mr. Trump has gone a step further. Mr. Conway said, Nixon was equally resistant to turning materials over and documents, but he did allow people to testify.
I am an American expat who has been living in Germany for many years and have intimate knowledge of and experience with its health care system. Jamie Daw's essay is not representative of the realities, pitfalls and serious systemic problems that exist in the German system and do not reflect the fact that most of the population is getting substandard care. Indeed, the German system is just as bad as the American system, just with a different set of failures that need to be addressed.
Age Under Obamacare Under new plan 21 years old $5,100 $1,450 40 years old $6,500 $2,400 64 years old $15,300 $14,600
No, but I think this is important.
Both measures were made possible by a provision in the Affordable Care Act, and both would be effectively gutted if the administration's position prevailed in court.
The plan might be better described as zombification. It is not at all clear that Republicans can easily time the expiration date of the Obamacare markets. Insurance experts say the resulting zombie market — not dead, but not alive either — would suffer from many of the maladies of the existing system, and quite a few more. The result on the books might look like the status quo, but millions of Americans could lose their insurance and others could pay much higher prices to keep their coverage.
Mr. Sanders identifies as a democratic socialist, and Mr. Biden was asked on the CNN program if he would support a socialist at the top of the ticket.
BA: So you'd put tariffs on existing foreign imports?
If the current lower court ruling from Texas is ultimately upheld, the case could have major consequences throughout the health care system. Estimates from the Urban Institute suggest that around 20 million more Americans would become uninsured. And a wide range of federal health policies, including consumer protections, payment reforms, drug approval processes and fraud penalties, would have to be unwound.
Last year, Senator Warren introduced a bill called the No First Use Act, which would declare that the United States would never be the first to use a nuclear weapon. Opponents say it could drive arms races in smaller countries that depend on America for protection.
Donald Trump won the Electoral College (though not the popular vote) on the strength of overwhelming support from working-class whites, who feel left behind by a changing economy and society. And they're about to get their reward — the same reward that, throughout Mr. Trump's career, has come to everyone who trusted his good intentions. Think Trump University.
The Kaiser Family Foundation's Health Care Tracking Poll has found a decline in public support for Medicare for all since the start of the year. Now roughly 51 percent of American adults are in favor of a single-payer system and 47 percent are opposed, whereas earlier this year 57 percent backed it and 37 percent were opposed.
These policies have moved forward easily and with little opposition. The health care industry has generally supported the changes because private health plans typically pay higher prices to doctors and hospitals. Democrats who support expanding public coverage generally describe these changes as low-hanging fruit — the changes they could accomplish quickly to expand coverage.
I mean, I feel like I see in my children a response to society in sort of everything they do. I mean, they're incredibly molded by their friends, by what they hear in school, by us parents. And my worry is not for them at their age right now. As I said, they're eight and six. It's like how they think about gender and the role of gender, and how they think about, especially, their preferences and their interests, how those are shaped by society at large. At an early age, they're being pushed in these directions that I don't know accurately reflects how they would live in another kind of society. This is all just a little bit academic though. Because changing pronouns or just my writing a column about changing pronouns isn't going to effect any of this. But it's the larger backdrop to my feeling that the importance that we put on gender and the kind of almost invisible role in our day-to-day lives that gender plays on what we do is just too high. And much of my desire in writing this or in talking about pronouns is to just point out how stifling some of this can be.
About one-quarter of American workers — 37.7 million people in total — are estimated to be at high risk of serious illness from coronavirus, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation study published this week.
Yet the steady flow of right-wing commentary mocking concerns about the Supreme Court's legitimacy (and I readily admit to having added my voice to those concerns) leaves me with this thought: What about the other justices? Why is it assumed on the right that Chief Justice Roberts is the only conservative on the court who has its welfare in view and who worries about the loss of public confidence if the justices come to be seen as mere politicians in robes?
Every issue in my district is impacted by this, said Representative Elise Stefanik, a Republican who represents much of New York's vast North Country. This is going to be an economic issue, it's going to be a higher ed issue, it's going to be a border issue.
In the last week, House Republicans have unveiled a set of changes to the American Health Care Act , the plan they propose to replace Obamacare. We've highlighted recent additions in green, and drawn a line through the rule replaced.
And yet, the fight goes on. Many observers have noted that the Democratic debates — especially the first ones, which felt like a rolling seminar on medical insurance policy — have devoted a disproportionate amount of time to the candidates slashing at each other over who has the political courage — or naïveté — to go big on health care.
The guy is president of the United States. This stuff is coming at him at Mach 2 and 3. He feels completely under siege from the Mueller stuff. And he is trying to navigate all the things that come with being Donald Trump. But there is a side to him that — I'm pulling for him now. Does that make sense?
This change, alone, would slash child poverty by an estimated 40 percent. But this change isn't alone. The American Rescue Plan also triples the value of the earned-income tax credit for low-income workers without children, providing a benefit of roughly $1,500 to more than 17 million Americans and fixing a tax code that, as it stands, punishes childless workers in low-wage jobs.
We have more filibusters than ever and less compromise than ever, more party-line votes than ever. We have more filibusters than ever and more moments of divided government. As Francis Lee has noted, this has actually been the most competitive era in American government ever, and we have less cooperation than ever. The parties are bitterly divided. And I think that my argument, which really traces back to something you were saying, is that politics is healthier when it is about what we do. Because then at least electorates can say, well, we elected the Republicans, and they did this tax bill or they got rid of Obamacare, which they promised to do, but I didn't like that because my sister had health insurance through Obamacare, and I didn't realize she was going to have health insurance anymore. So I'm going to vote for the Democrats. Or you can elect the Democrats, and they pass a Green New Deal or Medicare For All or whatever it might be, and maybe you like that or maybe you don't. But what we're in now, we're actually just endlessly caught in the bickering phase. We are caught in unpleasant, angry political negotiations that mostly don't go anywhere. And so politics becomes less about what we do than, as you put it, who rules. I feel like if your view on this was right, politics would look better right now, and these various blockages we have would encourage compromise.
But something surprising is happening here. Despite deep uncertainty about the law's future, Utah recorded one of the biggest increases of any state in residents who signed up for coverage under the act this year. Now, the state is seeing a surprising burst of activism against repealing the law — including from Republicans.
We have trouble discerning who has decision-making authority, said Julie Mix McPeak, the Tennessee insurance commissioner and president-elect of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which represents state officials. We reached out to the Department of Health and Human Services. They referred us to the Office of Management and Budget, which referred us to the Department of Justice. We reached out to the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs.
Trump ha dicho que los pobres podrían recibir cuidados quizá a través de programas como el Medicare. Eso es tener corazón.
There would be no private insurance. Everyone would get their insurance directly from the government.
This tumult is happening as the administration prepares for the fourth annual open enrollment period under President Obama's heath law, which is scheduled to start on Nov. 1, a week before Election Day. Most Americans still get their insurance through their employers or government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and veterans health care.
It's 5 percent of the pay for. Give me a break. No, we have passed it, and actually ——
Encourage insurance companies in wobbly markets?
As its central feature, the Constitution mandates a deliberate separation between the legislative and administrative, or executive, branches of government. This is not a matter of architecture, a quirk of structural whim. The separation is intended to ensure that no single person or branch of government will amass an excess of power and that the citizenry will retain a firm grip on the government's policy-making process. If the Congress cedes its independence, the entire constitutional framework, which depends on a system of checks and balances, is compromised.
Well, I think it actually makes sense to go all the way back and think about the origin of Medicare. [MUSIC] This is actually an idea that has been kicking around in progressive politics for a very long time. It had a brief moment in the Progressive Era in 1910.
And given the dynamics of Congress, this is perhaps his best chance?
I don't know what happened to the Lindsey Graham that I knew, because he hasn't been showing up lately.
Mamadi Doumbouya for The New York Times Talk Henry Louis Gates Jr. on What Really Happened at Obama's 'Beer Summit'
But some Republicans are sticking to the old anti-Obamacare script. In Missouri, Ms. McCaskill's expected opponent, Josh Hawley, the state attorney general, talks about health care frequently. I talk about Obamacare and just the broken health care system, he said, noting that the rising cost of health insurance is one of several factors eroding middle-class security.
Re The Asian-American Age (column, Sept. 2):
So why isn't Biden pursuing a two-step strategy — first pouring himself into a bipartisan deal and then following up with a Democratic bill that fills in the pieces he thinks were missing? Why does he instead seem to be leaning toward a single bill that would need only Democratic support to pass?
So far, Mr. Trump's secretary for health and human services, Tom Price, has taken every opportunity to gloat about the health law's setbacks, even as he is administering its programs.
Third, McCain believed in democracy and its vital, fragile institutions. He accepted his two haunting presidential defeats honorably. He has reportedly chosen the victors in those campaigns — Obama and George W. Bush — to deliver eulogies at his funeral. Most significantly, McCain fought for campaign-finance laws to reduce the influence of plutocrats.
But the downsides of performance standards are often exaggerated. Most Americans are surely happy to pay a small amount more for their homes, for instance, if their children no longer have to ingest lead paint. And the initial skepticism about California's plan appears to have been misplaced. Critics predicted that the state wouldn't be able to meet its goal without hurting its economy. They were wrong: The state met its goal four years early, by 2016. The costs to consumers were modest and hard to notice. John Podesta told me he considered California's approach a model for future federal action.
Ms. Hurd has had no such peace of mind. A burst appendix would likely cost at least her individual deductible of $6,300.
MC: So as you're out there trying to convince people to join you on this mission, at certain times, and certainly in the debates it's come up that people who do not embrace your path lack the political courage or will, or they're scared, as you've said, to embrace big change. Now, certainly this will appeal to a lot of Democratic voters, but there are also a lot of more moderate swing voters, Democratic voters who will be put off by the idea that just because they don't embrace your particular policies, they somehow are not courageous or that they're wrong in their ideas. So how do you reach out to these people, because you can't win the nomination just with the progressive base. You've got to kind of convince these people who are nervous about the big ideas. For instance, Medicare for all that you're pitching is not a overwhelmingly popular idea.
Vietnam reports 82 cases, its first local transmissions in nearly two months. A street in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Thursday. The country reported 82 cases on Thursday, mostly in the northern province of Hai Duong. Credit... Luong Thai Linh/EPA, via Shutterstock Vietnam reported 82 coronavirus infections on Thursday, the first cases of local transmission in nearly two months, and the government said that some may be connected to the new variant that has been spreading rapidly in Britain. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has called on the two northern provinces where the cases were reported to close their borders to prevent people from leaving, the state-run news media reported on Thursday. Vietnam has been relatively successful in containing the virus. Before the latest outbreak in the northern provinces, Hai Duong and Quang Ninh, the country had reported only about 1,550 cases and 35 deaths. The new cases arrived at an inconvenient time. Officials from the governing Communist Party are meeting this week in Hanoi, the capital, to select their next leaders, an event that takes place once every five years. And people across the country are preparing to celebrate the Lunar New Year, Vietnam's biggest holiday. Vietnam's largest outbreak occurred in July in the central city of Danang, sickening hundreds and causing all 35 of the country's reported deaths before it was contained. Health officials initially reported two new cases Thursday morning. But the number rose to 82 by the afternoon, after health workers began tracing and isolating the first patients' contacts.

NF: How do you deal with the fact that while people might want big change, they're also afraid of it?
I disagreed with them. So for example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership had a robust investor state dispute resolution mechanism, which multiple of our trade treaties have had for decades now. And I just think that's fundamentally wrong. It's a two-tier system that says, in effect, we'll make a bunch of promises in a trade deal on the environment, on use of prison labor, child labor and on anything else, and then we'll give two entirely different enforcement mechanisms.
As Dr. Fauci spoke, educators at the meeting posted comments — many reflecting frustration and anxiety. They complained that many states had not prioritized teachers for vaccination and said students were not able to effectively stay masked throughout the school day. Several called for job actions. Teachers need to participate in a national strike to protect kids, communities, and teachers, one wrote. Dr. Fauci appeared alongside two powerful teachers union presidents: Randi Weingarten of the American Federation of Teachers and Becky Pringle of the National Education Association. The event took place as some local unions across the country, most notably in Chicago, continue to resist efforts to reopen schools, arguing that doing so before widespread teacher vaccination would risk lives. Ms. Weingarten has staked out a somewhat more moderate position, arguing that schools can operate safely before teachers are vaccinated by using strategies such as surveillance testing for the virus and updating ventilation systems. She has also asked for teachers with health concerns, or who live with family members with compromised immune systems, to be allowed to continue to work remotely.
Under Mr. Ryan's leadership, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, in the midst of conducting hearings looking into possible wrongdoing by the president or his advisers, briefed the president on the progress and findings of the investigation. The chairman, Devin Nunes, facing ethics complaints over his conduct, has temporarily stepped down, with Mr. Ryan's approval. But the speaker was under an obligation to have immediately removed Mr. Nunes from his chairmanship in order to assert the House's independence from the White House. Instead, for days — because he, too, apparently sees himself as one of Donald Trump's assistants — Mr. Ryan continued to back Mr. Nunes.
KK: Lauren, I wanted to make sure we got to you.
So the way I see this is all I can do is get out and tell you what I'll fight for, and I'll point out the difference between the two. I try not to get over my skis. No, I do. I've really tried hard not to be personally critical of other candidates. I got a little heated once, but once, and because I think this is the fundamental question. Do you think that this democracy, do you think that this economy, do you think this government is going to make it if all we're offering are little nibbles around the edges?
Thank God for New Yorkers that we have his tenacity, his toughness, his competence and his experience because he knows how to push back, said Maggie Moran, Mr. Cuomo's campaign manager.
Characterizations of Congress as a gerontocracy are often accompanied by complaints about the ruinous gluttony of the baby boom generation, which encompasses people from about Donald Trump's age down to mine, 54. We're rightly charged with befouling the environment, running up the debt and letting the American dream slip away from the middle class.
Right, and there's also an income cap where it starts phasing out if you're a single filer making more than $200,000, or a married filer making more than $400,000. Which is to say it covers nearly everybody in it. It's a flat benefit. Would replace the existing child credit and would replace some other programs like, temporary assistance for needy families, which is the main program that used to be called welfare. But it's a much smaller program than it used to be with a much smaller caseload. And he'd also get rid altogether of the tax deduction for state and local taxes that you can apply on your federal tax return. So this would all be, at least in theory, I mean, some of it has to be scored a little bit more. But in theory it's supposed to be deficit neutral, not to increase the deficit. And this is a policy that would have a number of potential advantages. One would be that it would very sharply decrease child poverty, which is something that the existing child credit does but this would do even more. It simplifies government supports for children by folding a bunch of existing things into this new child allowance.
This interview has been edited and condensed from two conversations.
It drives me crazy. But this gets to something, and I want to talk a little bit about solutions here. So one of the things you will hear people come up with very quickly in this debate is, well, in the past, in order to filibuster, you really did have to hold the floor for long periods of time. We had to sit there and read from the phone book and bring your lunch and get tired and pass things off to other senators. So all we need to do to fix this is to restore the debate dimension of the filibuster. Now people just tell the leader's office they're going to filibuster, and the leader doesn't bring anything up. What we need to do is make them hold the floor. That's not the approach you would go for a solution here. Tell me why that wouldn't fix it.
The answer has a lot to do with history: For decades, congressional Republicans have opposed — almost unanimously — any top priority of an incoming Democratic president. Biden and his aides believe they will be playing Charlie Brown to a Republican Lucy if they imagine this time will be different.
The fact is, however, that most of our people cannot afford to pay for the care they need.
Still, the core idea in the Green New Deal is one shared by the left and the establishment center-left. (Remember that Markey, who is hardly a socialist, also had his name on the Obama-era cap-and-trade bill.) Even Nordhaus says, I laud the spirit of the Green New Deal. The idea also happens to be popular with the public, polls show. Most voters support clean energy and, after four decades of slow-growing living standards, also support federal action to create good jobs.
Private companies step in to source protective gear
You mentioned college: I went back and read Loose Canons, and there's a line in there in which you say that college students are too old to form but not too old to challenge. How does a line like that resonate today, when challenging students can seem like such a fraught proposition? Political correctness is heinous if it comes from a person on the left or the right or a person of color or a white person. Let's take a hot-button issue. I wrote the introduction to the 50th-anniversary edition of Albert Murray's The Omni-Americans, and there was this paragraph I wrote last summer that I saw when I was cleaning out my Word files on my iPad. In it I said, Only people not familiar with this history of slavery or Ta-Nehisi Coates's recent work would wonder if there was an economic disadvantage to African Americans subsequent to the Civil War because of slavery and then because of the rollbacks of Reconstruction. I said, However, reasonable people could disagree about reparations. But, I continued, there are few people today who have the courage to stand up within the community and say, 'I genuinely think reparations is a mistake.' Now I'm not saying that's my position. But I'm saying you will find nobody black standing up and criticizing reparations — it's very rare — because they're afraid that students are going to boycott them or that they'll be called an Uncle Tom. That's not right.
With Reagan, it was launching his 1980 campaign on fairgrounds near where the Klan murdered three civil rights activists.
I mean, the most obvious reason is because it's just he or she is not inclusive. It does not precisely refer to everyone. A lot of people feel that they don't fit within that gender binary. And referring to them as they, it solves the kind of inadvertent misgendering problem. You know, some people say that it's a huge accommodation to make because it doesn't affect that many people. But I feel like we don't really know how many people this affects. And I think those numbers are increasing as people think about this more. It doesn't seem like a huge task for the rest of society to start thinking about language in a way that is more inclusive.

Then, for a few key months in 2008, previously solicitous media outlets began running hostile stories about him. A common theme was Mr. McCain's angry outbursts. Typical of the genre was a story at Alternet describing Mr. McCain as someone who should never be near the red button and another in The Washington Post, McCain: A Question of Temperament. The Post story was filled with quotes like this one from former Senator Bob Smith, a New Hampshire Republican: His temper would place this country at risk in international affairs, and the world perhaps in danger. In my mind, it should disqualify him. The Boston Globe brought out Senator Thad Cochran, who said that the thought of a McCain presidency, sent a cold chill down my spine.
And what explains that? What's happening in Wisconsin?
All the likely Democratic presidential nominees are on board with expanding coverage, but they disagree on the path forward. Some favor allowing people to buy into the existing Medicare system. Others support the idea of Medicare for all, but disagree on whether it would be a comprehensive single-payer system and what role private insurance would play. The focus on expanding access has left little room for discussion of the frustrations embedded in the current system.
He made the move, made the money and made his mark on New York's skyline, but he never quite made it into the inner sanctum of New York high society.

WASHINGTON — A year ago Friday, Representative Claudia Tenney of New York stood among dozens of enthusiastic colleagues in the Rose Garden to celebrate passage of a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. When President Trump made his way onstage, Ms. Tenney clapped and smiled.

Senator Warren's campaign ads pitch a 2-cent wealth tax to cover $700 billion in universal child care, $1.25 trillion in universal free college and student debt forgiveness, and more. But Senator Warren's tax would really be more than 2 cents on the dollar for the ultrarich, because you have to add the 2 cents to additional taxes she has promised on assets above $1 billion along with taxes on income and capital gains. Two University of California economists recently calculated that the Microsoft founder Bill Gates's net worth would be more than halved if Senator Warren's wealth tax in its original form had been enacted in 1982.

In a year of controlling power in Washington, President Trump and Republicans in Congress have run up federal spending, approved deficit-swelling tax cuts and presided over a marked increase in policy uncertainty in the economy. They still talk about the importance of fiscal discipline, but they have yet to enforce it.
But a degree worse, two degrees worse. I watch that, and I watch as one more player in the game gets even more deeply embedded in Washington and Washington decision making. One more player hires more lobbyists, spends more money on campaign contributions, puts more money into bought-and-paid-for experts and think tanks so that nothing will change. It's like you talk about hardening between right and left. That's not the hardening. The part that's happening is it's hardening between the top and the bottom.
The Affordable Care Act has survived numerous court battles and repeal efforts, but a new case is threatening the law's future once again. A federal judge in Fort Worth, Tex., will hear arguments Wednesday on whether to grant a preliminary injunction that would suspend the health law until the case is decided. He has also indicated that he might go straight to ruling on the merits of the case.
With roughly $410 million, Michael R. Bloomberg bought omnipresence. Whether that translates to votes is a premise that faces its first test on Super Tuesday, when more than one-third of all delegates are up for grabs. It will be the first time Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, is competing in a primary; he opted to skip the first four nominating contests.
We take it on by deciding we're going to take it on. We pass it through Congress, and then we set it up for the states to be able to vote on it.
Did you mean that when you said that stuff about Trump?
The savings would have been substantially larger, but Republicans would also eliminate about $600 billion in taxes imposed under the Affordable Care Act, including taxes on investment income, prescription drugs and indoor tanning.
President Trump's lawyers and aides are scouring the backgrounds of investigators hired by the special counsel Robert Mueller, looking for conflicts of interest, people with knowledge of the effort said.
Hungary 's medicine authority has approved the coronavirus vaccine developed by the Chinese company Sinopharm. This means that in addition to Pfizer, Moderna, Sputnik and AstraZeneca, we can also count on Sinopharm, said Dr. Cecilia Muller, the country's chief medical officer. We trust that these vaccines will be readily available in large quantities and the immunization process will be completed in larger numbers in less time. The country's foreign minister later announced that it had purchased five million doses of the vaccine. Regarding the options, Prime Minister Viktor Orban expressed enthusiasm for the Chinese vaccine on Friday. I will wait for the Chinese vaccine, he said. I trust that one the most.
McCain's final message for his country was a warning: Our greatness is in peril.
But by Washington standards, that is a pittance. Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry lobbying group, set aside $150 million in 2009 to support the law's passage.
The plan might be better described as zombification. It is not at all clear that Republicans can easily time the expiration date of the Obamacare markets. Insurance experts say the resulting zombie market — not dead, but not alive either — would suffer from many of the maladies of the existing system, and quite a few more. The result on the books might look like the status quo, but millions of Americans could lose their insurance and others could pay much higher prices to keep their coverage.
So let me explain what the plan is. The plan is the employer has to keep paying in as the employer does right now. The one exception to that is if you have a collective bargaining agreement, and the employer is paying in more than whatever is the standard minimal that employers are paying in. That difference goes to the workers in cash.
I'm sorry. And who's fighting Mitch McConnell right now and from what platform?
Because we had a sense that the other work we all do, which is public policy work, just can't matter on the right until we do a better job of understanding what's gone wrong at the infrastructural level — political culture, the condition of Congress, the electoral system, these kinds of questions that seem like they are deeper than public policy and where there are just profound problems — some of them on the right, some of them in general — that make it difficult for us to have traditional policy debates. But I also think that if you stand aside from Trump for a minute, some of the differences that have emerged, really, in the last 10 years, but that have emerged with even greater force in the Trump era, do manifest themselves in some ways in policy differences and in a different level of willingness to engage in public action. Think about the $2,000 check debate, a small thing in some ways. But the pressure for more direct help to individuals came, in a lot of ways, from the Josh Hawley types on the right. The Democrats were for it. Ultimately, even Donald Trump was for it. But the argument for it on the right, the actual substantive argument, came exactly from that camp that inclines to think that, as George W. Bush once said and was endlessly attacked for saying, when people hurt, government's got to move. That's not the traditional conservative way of thinking.
The Affordable Care Act established so-called risk corridors meant to help insurance companies cope with the risks they took when they decided to participate in the law's marketplaces without knowing who would sign up for coverage. Under the program, the federal government would limit insurance companies' gains and losses on insurance sold in the marketplaces from 2014 through 2016.
So if the overall case counts continue to decline, she said, I think it's more likely that we will see the deaths start to come down. Even with the recent new-case declines, the daily pandemic statistics in the U.S. remain troubling. On Tuesday, the country logged 151,616 new cases, and 4,205 deaths — close to the peak of 4,406 on Jan. 12. As of Tuesday, the seven-day average for new reported deaths stood at 3,341. Overall, more than 25 million people have tested positive in the country, and more than 425,000 people have died, since the pandemic began. The U.S. saw significant spikes in new reported cases after Thanksgiving and during the December holidays, most likely the result of increased travel and social gatherings. Now, experts like Dr. Nuzzo are concerned that cases will be driven up again by the new and more infectious variants of the virus that are circulating. President Biden said this week that his administration would soon reach deals to purchase 200 million additional vaccine doses, which he said could allow 300 million Americans to be fully vaccinated by the end of the summer. But experts worry that the new variants could cause significant damage in the meantime.
What is the reaction from Republicans in Congress?
Senator Warren's campaign ads pitch a 2-cent wealth tax to cover $700 billion in universal child care, $1.25 trillion in universal free college and student debt forgiveness, and more. But Senator Warren's tax would really be more than 2 cents on the dollar for the ultrarich, because you have to add the 2 cents to additional taxes she has promised on assets above $1 billion along with taxes on income and capital gains. Two University of California economists recently calculated that the Microsoft founder Bill Gates's net worth would be more than halved if Senator Warren's wealth tax in its original form had been enacted in 1982.
So we're now going to take Mosul. And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Oh, yeah, they're making — I mean, they are outsmarting — look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision. But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq. You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it. You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.
There's no arguing that popular storytelling and factual scholarship can be combined in useful ways. What I'm curious about is your opinion on the limits, if there are any, of that combination. It's an excellent question. It took a long time for black scholars and filmmakers to feel comfortable representing black historical figures in three dimensions. Take Harriet Tubman. Students think Harriet Tubman was basically leading a train of slaves out of Grand Central Station. But I think the number she saved was closer to 70 — which was a lot, by the way. Or: The myth that our ancestors were kidnapped by your ancestors, David, is just untrue. The fantasy is that my 10th-great-grandmother and -grandfather were out on a picnic and some white people jumped out of the bushes and they ended up on a plantation in Virginia. That's not how it happened. But one of the things that I've dedicated my career to is showing that black people are just as complex, positively and negatively, as anybody else. For years, the mythos that undergirded black history was that the slaves were the victims of European dominance. But really it was the Europeans who were selling guns to African kings, who engaged in wars against other Africans in order to defeat them and then sell the victims to Europeans. I remember once I was asked to consult on a project about Martin Luther King. I said, You can't do hagiography anymore. King was complicated. He had affairs and doubts.
KK: Throughout America, many jobs that were once held by American union members have been replaced and are now held by undocumented immigrants. Does that drive down wages in the United States?
Murkowski landed in the Senate essentially by fiat: In 2002, her father, Frank Murkowski, then a senator, was elected governor of Alaska and had to choose a successor. He publicly considered an up-and-coming mayor from Wasilla, Sarah Palin, then rejected her. Instead, he appointed his daughter Lisa, who had been a state legislator for all of four years. The blatant act of nepotism dogged Frank Murkowski, who went on in 2006 to face Palin in a primary challenge for governor, which she easily won.
Here again, the anonymous-Republicans equate a bigger defense budget and more weapons with strategy and strength. Thus, by definition, if Trump increased defense spending, he did something right. Did I miss the series of congressional hearings with independent military experts that addressed the question: What are the new (and old) threats we're facing today, and how will these new and vastly expensive weapons systems enable us to better address them?
I'm not sure what I'd say. I think, in some ways, Bob Putnam's book The Upswing, which was just published last year, offers a picture of early progressivism that was eye-opening, in some respects that was a little fuller than what I had focused on before, and that I think is worth reading for anybody on the right or the left. I think that's probably the latest book I've read that's really changed my mind about something. It changed my mind about the nature of the case that the early progressives were making and changed for the better, in some ways.
archived recording (tony evers) I just want to make sure people understand the complexity of our spring general election. It's not a primary election. It's only a primary election for the presidential candidates.
The era of searching is over. Zucker has found a story to ride, the biggest story we could ever imagine, he says. And as it turns out, the only thing better than having Donald Trump on your network is having him attack it. Far from hurting CNN, Trump's war against it has amounted to a form of product placement — earned media, you could say — giving its anchors and correspondents starring roles in the ongoing political drama, turning them into camera-ready warriors for the First Amendment. Zucker has not shied away from the conflict, which has been reassuring, even inspiring, to his staff. I hate to sound like a fanboy, but he's the best boss I've ever had, Tapper, a former senior White House correspondent at ABC News, told me. It has also been good for business. Last year, CNN's average daytime audience was up more than 50 percent, and its prime-time audience 70 percent. The network earned nearly $1 billion; it was the most profitable year in CNN's history. Ratings are up again this year, which is expected to be more profitable still. And CNN's newfound relevance may not be fully monetized until a few years from now, when its parent company, Turner Broadcasting System, renegotiates subscription fees with a variety of cable providers.
KK: I guess do you understand why I keep harping on this? I don't mean to ——
But in the last few years, the years of Obama's Caesarism and Trump's caudillo act and Congress's utter uselessness, I've developed a limited sympathy for Kennedy's imperial approach. If he contributed to our republic's deformation he did not act alone, and what he delivered was, in some sense, what both the political class and the public increasingly desire from their government: not republican deliberation but quasi-monarchical action.
Since that failure, some progressives have wondered if Obama and other party leaders could have passed the bill if only they had tried harder. The answer is unknowable, but I think the evidence suggests that the bill died for more fundamental reasons. Spending federal money to prevent a depression is popular. So are cracking down on Wall Street and expanding health insurance. Raising the price of energy is not.
I'm David Leonhardt. And this is The Argument. This week, have we finally reached full Trumpification of the Republican Party?

The law has also played an important role in keeping care affordable for the 160 million Americans who get coverage from an employer, including by requiring those plans to cover the children of beneficiaries until age 26.
Senator Warren's anti-corruption plan includes provisions to extend conflict-of-interest laws to the president and vice president, compel government to divest from privately owned assets and restrict the ability of lobbyists to be hired for government jobs. It takes aim in particular at many of the practices that the Trump family has used to profit from office, which The Times has editorialized against.
Civis Analytics, a Democratic polling and data firm, has developed a detailed model to determine which Americans are likely to vote in this election. In collaboration with Enroll America, they have also developed estimates about precisely who got the new health insurance.
Now, before it was called Obamacare, it was called Hillarycare, as some of you might remember, Mrs. Clinton said at a town-hall-style event in Clinton, Iowa, on Saturday, the second time in recent days she has used the line.
I would say that the one difference between a case like this and something like the Charlottesville case is that Trump's foils here are genuinely unpopular figures to the extent that they're well known. That could make this a case where he gets away with more bigotry because it's seen as a choice between Trump's bigotry and Ilhan Omar's far-left politics. But I think, in general, we have a very clear track record that when Trump is seen to be explicitly race-baiting, lots and lots of voters who might be otherwise inclined to support him don't like it.

It's that you don't get the tariff benefit. This is what it's really about. Where's the baseline? Right? And is the baseline one that says, across the board, you've got to give plenty of notice. You've got to work through, make sure you've got something that's achievable for countries we trade with. But this is not like trying to institute a trade war. This is not like saying we're mad at you and therefore we're going to impose all these tariffs on you, and doing it as Donald Trump has done by tweet.
After apparently seizing the state broadcaster, ZBC, two uniformed officers said in a short, predawn announcement that the situation in our country has moved to another level.
Re Trump Declarations Seen as Threat to Rule of Law (front page, June 4):
Obamacare has helped 20 million people gain access to insurance, and it appears to have helped slow the growth in health care costs. But even former President Barack Obama has said that there is still work to be done. The United States spends much more on medical care than other rich countries, like Britain, Australia and the Netherlands, according to a recent Commonwealth Fund report, yet its citizens live shorter lives and suffer from more illnesses and injuries than people in other industrialized nations.
Under the plan discussed this week, Republicans said, repeal will be on a fast track. They hope to move forward in January or February with a budget blueprint using so-called reconciliation instructions, which would allow parts of the health care law to be dismembered with a simple majority vote, denying Senate Democrats the chance to filibuster. They would follow up with legislation similar to a bill vetoed in January, which would have repealed the tax penalties for people who go without insurance and the penalties for larger employers who fail to offer coverage.
KK: O.K., Kristen's going to kill me, but thank you so much for coming.
Since entering the Democratic race in November, former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg has outspent almost all of his opponents in TV advertisements, spending over $100 million in just the first month.
Health Care. Universal medical coverage, whether expanding Obamacare with a public option or some form of Medicare for all, is going to happen. It's had majority support for some time. The pandemic has just sped up the timetable. One poll found that 41 percent of adults are now more likely than they were before the pandemic to support a government-run care system covering all Americans.
Against the advice of public health officials and the wishes of its own governor, Wisconsin will hold its democratic primary today in the middle of a pandemic. Astead Herndon on how that happened. It's Tuesday, April 7.
The desire to crush those who displease him is a defining characteristic of this president. When challenged, his impulse is to lash out — preferably with personal, degrading insults. This has been on most vivid display with the myriad investigations into sketchy presidential behavior, but it also has been a hallmark of Mr. Trump's approach to key policy issues. Border security, health care, trade — you name the debate, Mr. Trump's answer is to stake out his position, vowing pain and regret for those who do not embrace it.
And I know it's tough between here and there. I was in a very tough primary back in 2012 and I wasn't in any primary at all in 2018, so those are my two electoral experiences.
The political theory behind this maximalism is an assertion that a bold populist program would transform the electoral landscape, winning over white working-class voters and bringing a surge of new voters, all of this on a scale sufficient both to win a smashing victory in November and to intimidate centrist members of Congress into accepting radical proposals.
CW: Andrew Yang said in one of the debates that you're applying a 20th-century framework to antitrust when it comes to Big Tech. Why is he wrong on that, and what makes your proposal to break up Big Tech adequate for the unprecedented profits of Silicon Valley?
Mr. Trump released his short list of potential Supreme Court nominees in May 2016. In September 2016, he released a second list with several more women and people of color, following criticisms of the white and male bias in his first.
Right. I mean, I just want to say obviously I don't disagree with you about all of this being extremely stifling. I guess, to me, it's just the question of, do you try to expand the social definition of what women can do and what men can do? Or do you try to erase the idea that male and female has any inherent meaning? And I guess, you know, I know people for whom the idea of doing that seems utopian. And I guess, for me, it just — it doesn't speak to me. It's not something that I particularly aspire to, even though, obviously I don't want to live by the traditional limitations of femininity. And I don't want my kids to be subject to those. I mean, I've had the same experience as you both, to a certain extent. And I think that it's always a temptation, especially if you have one boy and one girl, or in Ross's case is two girls and one boy, to overinterpret a very small sample size.
But some Republicans are sticking to the old anti-Obamacare script. In Missouri, Ms. McCaskill's expected opponent, Josh Hawley, the state attorney general, talks about health care frequently. I talk about Obamacare and just the broken health care system, he said, noting that the rising cost of health insurance is one of several factors eroding middle-class security.

The Justice Department brief did not go so far, but it said that Judge Reed O'Connor should void both the mandate and the protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions, while leaving in place the expansion of Medicaid in more than 30 states.
Two months ago, as you know, we were facing serious problems. The country was dying by inches.
So what has Schultz done to deserve his Two Minutes Hate? His political views bear about as much resemblance to those of a typical conservative as an olive does to a grape. He supports Obamacare, denounced the Trump administration's decision to leave the Paris Climate Accord, and promised to hire 10,000 refugees globally in response to the 2017 travel ban. He was raised in a Brooklyn housing project and was the first person in his family to go to college. His billions were fairly earned offering products and services people want.
La respuesta es B. Y en caso de que alguien no se haya percatado de su gran corazón, Trump añadió que tampoco quería que las personas murieran en las aceras.
And conservative writers including Philip Klein of the Washington Examiner and the Cato Institute's Michael Cannon have criticized the lawsuit. The headline on Klein's piece is: I hate Obamacare, but Texas judge's decision on its unconstitutionality is an assault on the rule of law.
I will also fight to knock back the influence of money, because I think every time we do that, that's what that anti-corruption bill is about. It's about calling out the big drug companies. It's about calling out the big insurance companies and just disrupting the fabulous patterns they have right now to get their way in Washington. In the first 100 days, I'll go to Congress and try to get what we can get on 50 votes. What we can get on 50 votes is to offer Medicare to everybody who's 50 or older.
The ruling was the second big defeat this week for President Trump on a top-priority item on his health care agenda as he has sought to use the courts to obliterate his predecessor's signature achievement. Another judge on Wednesday blocked Medicaid work requirements in Arkansas and Kentucky.
I said to him: The president has come under attack. Racism's coming out of the floor. I'm sure you're a decent person. I forgive you. Let's move on. He goes, That would be the best thing that could happen. I said, Maybe we could find a way to lecture about it. He laughed and said, Anything I can do to get off the beat. I realized he was funny. I think that gay people have a sense of who's homophobic. I think that Jewish people have a sense of who's anti-Semitic. I definitely think black people — I could walk out there and tell you, That [expletive] is a racist.
But perhaps it made those who tore apart families, who whipped insubordinates until they passed out, who sold children and cotton bales as similar commodities feel better to know that the monstrous crime of their daily enterprise could be a blessed act.

Actually, even if you leave aside the substance, this is bizarre. Do you really think that the fraction of the Republican primary electorate that selected Trump cares what New York Times columnists, me in particular, have to say — that they would have been warned off if only I had been nicer to establishment Republicans? That doesn't even rise to the level of a joke.
archived recording The race was almost too close to call. But overnight, Democrat Tony Evers narrowly beat out G.O.P. incumbent Scott Walker, denying him a third term.
The Democrats who wrote the Affordable Care Act helped pay the costs of expanding insurance coverage by imposing a variety of taxes. The Republican plan would eliminate taxes on health insurance, prescription drugs, tanning salons and investment income, among others. The original bill would have left the taxes in place until next year. The first amendment would make them disappear faster.
If you believe in abortion rights, and tragically, you do, follow the lead of the state's senior senator, Jon Tester, a Democrat and third-generation farmer from Big Sandy. Frame the issue as the rugged individualism of a woman's right to make her own health care decisions, preferably while seated on a tractor. All Democratic officials in the Central and Mountain time zones surely envy the rural romance of Mr. Tester, whose three missing fingers, mangled in a meat grinder on the family farm, are the Montana electoral equivalent of being a Kennedy. A good rule for politicians still shackled with all 10 fingers is to trust Senator Tester's instincts on everything but haircuts. He understands that a westward conscience (and a passing interest in re-election) sometimes compels a Montana Democrat to question coastal leftist groupthink — just ask Bernie Sanders about Max Baucus, but not if there are ladies present.

Depreciation is a gift to tycoons. They buy real estate because it will appreciate–then claim a tax break for nonexistent depreciation. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
But economists on the left and the right argue that to really rein in health costs, Congress should scale back or eliminate the tax exclusion on what employers pay toward employees' health insurance premiums. Under current law, those premiums are not subject to the payroll or income taxes that are taken out of employees' wages, an arrangement that vastly benefits middle- and upper-income people.

On Sunday, the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, went on television to rub Democrats' noses in the growing border tumult and defend the president's closure threat. We hate to say we told you so, he said. We need border security, and we're going to do the best we can with what we have.
The Democrats are not very good at winning local and statewide elections in many places. As a Democratic officeholder recently said to me: The other side is better than us at the local level.
But maybe not in Michigan. Last month, the State Senate passed a bill that would require Medicaid beneficiaries to find work or else lose their coverage. The bill, now under consideration in the Michigan House, has come under fire for harming the poor and disabled, as well as for burdening struggling families with needless paperwork. More than 100,000 people may lose health instance if it passes.

My primary consultant is myself, Donald Trump said back in March when asked whom he turns to for foreign policy advice. This turns out to be his approach to pretty much everything.
UnitedHealth, the industry bellwether, has reduced its exposure to what was its biggest problem in Obamacare: money-losing insurance that it sold in public exchanges to individuals, who often received government subsidies.
Jared and Ivanka seem torn about whether to keep crossing the rapids or turn back to shore. And as someone in their camp says: It's not like they could leave and all of a sudden you have this quiet life. Look at Don Jr. At this point, being a Trump is less a good brand than a bad state of mind. Besides, as their ally says, with Ivanka's trip to the Olympics in South Korea and her success helping Republicans increase the child tax credit, she feels she's actually found her groove.
Under the reinsurance program, the government was supposed to collect $12 billion in 2014, but actual collections totaled $9.7 billion. Courts have held that when funds fall short of expectations, a federal agency should try to achieve the original statutory scheme as much as possible.
Yeah, it leads to poor policy design. You get these Rube Goldberg policies that were created a certain way, not because they're the most efficient way to deliver benefits to the American people at the highest impact for the lowest cost, but they're designed the way they are to comply with these restrictive and, rather, obscure rules. So you can feel the institution sort of reaching for the ability to pass things on a majority rule basis. And instead of going directly at the filibuster, they're taking this detour through reconciliation that maybe it's fine as a stopgap, I guess. But it's going to lead to extremely poor policy design that's not just sort of abstract in why it's bad. These are things that will cause benefits to be delivered less efficiently. They will open them up to legal challenges and ultimately, have the potential to undermine a lot of the good that is passed through this process.
But also to complement the robust action we have consistently taken at the border. And while these new measures are being operationalized, I would just like to remind anyone seeking to enter our country to comply with the rules. Hoping to reduce the spread of the coronavirus variant, Britain announced on Wednesday it will require citizens arriving home from high-risk countries to quarantine in hotels for 10 days at their own expense. Credit Credit... Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images Swamped by a fast-spreading coronavirus variant and desperate to keep other mutations out of the country, Britain tightened its international travel restrictions on Wednesday. British citizens arriving from any of 22 high-risk countries will now be required to quarantine in hotels for 10 days at their own expense. The new policy edges Britain closer to the strict hotel quarantines imposed by Australia and several Asian countries. But it falls short of a blanket requirement, drawing criticism that it will not seal off the country from dangerous new variants, even as it inflicts more harm on the already wounded travel and aviation industries. There are still too many people coming in and out of our country every day, Priti Patel, the home secretary, said in Parliament as she announced the new measures, which are also intended to deter Britons from going abroad. People should not be traveling without a valid reason, she said, and going on holiday is not a valid reason.

About 10 million Americans lost their homes to foreclosure sales between 2006 and 2014, the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis.
Right after an election when, in his construction, he would be re-elected, Republicans would hold the Senate, and they would take back control of the House. So that's not just a delay of game. That is setting a whole bunch of other conditions on what would need to happen to get there.
So the effect is that the promises that are put into trade agreements like T.P.P., they may all look the same on paper, but man, they are nowhere close to each other in terms of what happens with enforcement. Multinational corporations are given the opportunity basically to opt out of laws they don't like, where protections that are supposed to be written for our workers, for the worldwide environment, for human rights standards, just get left by the curb.
WASHINGTON — Denouncing the profit motive in health care, more than 100 House Democrats rallied on Wednesday around a bill to replace most private health insurance with a national single-payer system, Medicare for all.
The cost of prescription drugs is another big problem for people with or without coverage. The average price of brand-name medicines jumped 164 percent from 2008 to 2015, according to Express Scripts. And 24 percent of Americans find it very or somewhat difficult to afford prescription drugs, according to a 2015 Kaiser Family Foundation survey.
Americans shouldn't be punished by its failure to provide choices, she said, referring to the Affordable Care Act. Until the law changes, we won't stand idly by as Americans suffer.
Republicans have not settled on the details or the timing of their replacement plan. The House speaker, Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, portrays repeal of the law not as an ideological crusade, but as a form of urgently needed relief.
Obamacare has helped 20 million people gain access to insurance, and it appears to have helped slow the growth in health care costs. But even former President Barack Obama has said that there is still work to be done. The United States spends much more on medical care than other rich countries, like Britain, Australia and the Netherlands, according to a recent Commonwealth Fund report, yet its citizens live shorter lives and suffer from more illnesses and injuries than people in other industrialized nations.
It's true that some Republican lawmakers have cobbled together proposals of varying degrees of specificity over the year: During his 2016 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida sketched out a mostly forgotten health care plan that would have set up a broad-based system of refundable tax credits intended to subsidize the purchase of insurance in hopes of helping people buy coverage. And during the 2017 Obamacare repeal effort, Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy offered a plan to give states far more flexibility, eliminating many of Obamacare's provisions at the national level while essentially turning the program into a block grant to the states.
There's also a time to look to, a period of institution-building at the end of the 19th century, early 20th century in America, where actually, people started universities because they were unhappy with Harvard and Yale. And those universities, fairly quickly, became elite universities. Johns Hopkins, University of Chicago, Stanford, Duke all came around in that era and for those reasons. But it wouldn't be an easy thing to start a research university where you would actually want your own kids to go. It's just very hard to do. And so I think conservatives have found that rather than create alternative institutions, they've created kind of critical institutions. They've created institutions that exist to attack the left's institutions. And there's an audience for that, but that's not really mainstream work. That's not a place to just get your news when you just want news. And so I think the effort to create genuinely alternative institutions generally hasn't worked. Now, I say that with some bias because I don't think that's the right approach. I think the right should want to have a presence in mainstream institutions, that it is more important that there be a diversity of views at Princeton than that there be an alternative university, which ultimately would fight with Princeton for elite students. I think it's just both more practical and more important that the institutions of elite formation have greater diversity to them.
There was not an audience —

Here are some key questions the candidates were asked, where they found common ground and where they disagreed.
A history of health problems, even relatively minor ones like allergies or acne, could mean trouble buying one of these plans. Some plans won't cover any care related to such a condition, even one not previously diagnosed. Other plans charge people with prior health problems a higher price or just deny them outright.
He compared deaths from the novel coronavirus to deaths from other causes — influenza and car crashes — suggesting that the scale of those preventable deaths means economic restrictions may not be appropriate to prevent the spread of the virus.
Ultimately, however, Obama said the lessons of his time in office are being misunderstood in the election campaigns. If you look at the platforms, the economic platforms of the current Republican candidates for president, they don't simply defy logic and any known economic theories, they are fantasy, Obama said. Slashing taxes particularly for those at the very top, dismantling regulatory regimes that protect our air and our environment and then projecting that this is going to lead to 5 percent or 7 percent growth, and claiming that they'll do all this while balancing the budget. Nobody would even, with the most rudimentary knowledge of economics, think that any of those things are plausible.
Not if you have a pre-existing medical condition and are relying on Obamacare to guarantee your treatment if you change health insurers. In case you missed it, in all the tumult Trump has churned up lately, his Justice Department quietly indicated last week that it would not defend major parts of the Affordable Care Act that pro-Trump forces, having failed to kill it in Congress, are now trying to kill through lower courts. And this includes the requirement that insurance companies guarantee access to coverage without bias against people with pre-existing medical conditions.
Roger Severino, the director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, the unit responsible for the rule, said in an interview Friday that the move was equivalent to housekeeping, and that the federal government was updating our books to reflect the legal reality that sex discrimination language does not explicitly refer to the legal status of transgender people.
Democrats said the rush to repeal was the height of legislative irresponsibility and would endanger the health of millions.
But we know the opposite is true: Congress kept the guaranteed-issue and community-rating provisions even after it chose to deprive the mandate of any force or effect in the tax bill.

So even though with the Affordable Care Act we didn't end up with government-run health care, we end up with more government in our health care, which it sounds like is beginning to change people's perception of what the government's role should be when it comes to medicine.
But increasing all the services that help connect people with coverage may take time. Biden administration officials may find themselves hamstrung by the lack of pre-existing networks of outreach workers. State officials say such networks were crucial to getting the word out during their extra sign-up periods.
Under Senator Warren's plan to pay for Medicare for all, a substantial chunk of funds would come from an employer contribution into the health care fund. Senator Sanders has not released a detailed plan explaining how he would pay for the system.
The goal of halting the spread of H.I.V. by 2030 is realistic and achievable if we increase testing, treatment and prevention, Mr. Schmid said.

For those of us who feared disaster from this presidency but saw the first year as a period when Trump was relatively constrained, his I'm in charge here! pivot was a worrying phenomenon. But it's the nature of the Trump era to confound all expectations, so naturally what followed the Cohn-Tillerson-McMaster exits and the tariff announcements and the stock market wobbles was … the most politically successful six weeks of Trump's presidency to date.

My favorite book of all time is Double Indemnity by James Cain. It's a noir classic, and I'm sort of obsessed with noir. It's short. It packs a massive wallop. And I read it a lot.
No. This is on budget reconciliation.
Much responsibility lies with voters, who must not allow themselves to be hypnotized by a compelling biography. Mr. McCain was out of step with his Republican constituents on virtually every major issue of the past generation, including Obamacare, immigration and foreign policy, where Mr. McCain had long supported military intervention around the globe — a policy that has cost our nation dearly.
Jamie Daw argues we can transition from Obamacare to Germany's universal health care system far more easily than we can persuade — whom? — to accept single payer. Poll after poll shows Americans long for a single-payer plan. But we cannot ignore the differences between a country that accepts limits on profiteering and one that celebrates any and all legal means of turning any opportunity into a buck.
Times columnist David Brooks noted in The Road to Character that Ms. Perkins discovered her calling to service and organizing after witnessing the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist fire. The analogy to something like the student loan debt crisis or child care, of course, isn't perfect — the debt crisis, for instance, has been slow burning as tuition rates have risen far above the inflation rate since the 1970s.
The ruling by the G.A.O. does not directly affect a separate program with a similar purpose that was meant to limit the financial losses of insurance companies under the Affordable Care Act. But it could complicate efforts by the administration to negotiate a settlement with various insurance companies that have sued the government, saying they received much less money than they were promised under this program.
spoken with numerous state party officials and congressional campaigners who have traced the leftward lurch of the presidential candidates to the small donor problem. The tyranny of the small donor cannot be underestimated.
The other day the Trump administration announced a new trade deal with South Korea. It also announced that President Trump was nominating the White House physician to head the Department of Veterans Affairs. What do these announcements have in common?
Oklahoma's Republican leadership had opposed Medicaid expansion and initially offered more limited alternatives. Gov. Kevin Stitt outlined a program in January in which new low-income enrollees would pay modest premiums and be required to work to gain coverage.
That sort of thinking — about both general principles and the specific policy components necessary to make them a reality — is exactly what the Republican Party lacks, and what it desperately needs.
I like markets. I believe that capitalism can produce enormous value. But capitalism without rules is theft, and one of those rules should be progressive taxation. Everybody pays their fair share. And one of those rules should be you don't get to crush the opposition. That's not how markets work. And that's a battle we had at the end of the 1800s and into the early 1900s, and it's a battle we need to have again. The giants have grown and they exercise so much economic power, but they also exercise too much political power.
The conventional route could be faster — but would most likely result in a smaller bill.
And I think that that's something that we have to think about and face as a cold hard fact of our time, and do away with this hope that any leaders at this point are going to rise above their structural incentives and take sort of a West Wing approach to uniting the country, and drill down on what needs to be done here to produce results to make the government function. And I think I would argue that that is restoring majority rule. I mean, one thing that I have lost sleep thinking about is, what would have happened if it had only taken a majority to confirm Supreme Court justices in 2016 when Garland's nomination came up? At the time, Reid's nuclear option in 2013 left the 60-vote threshold in place for Supreme Court justices. So when Garland came up, Republicans had 53 votes, and Democrats had 47 seats in the Senate. So all McConnell had to do to block Garland was prevent 13 Republicans from breaking ranks. That's a lot easier to do than preventing three Republicans from breaking ranks. I'm not totally sure that he would have made the snap decision to try to block that nominee if he had had to keep three Republicans from breaking away. That's much harder to do.
Mr. McCain's campaign has also established a new website hitting his Republican primary opponent Kelli Ward, a former state legislator, for various provocative statements and actions, leaving Mr. McCain punching in two directions. The primary election is not until Aug. 30, and Mr. McCain's decision to start attacking Ms. Kirkpatrick shows he is not willing to risk her getting a free pass until then.
Wow. And what's the reaction to Sanders's proposal?
KK: Lauren, I wanted to make sure we got to you.
Fourteen states (as well as American Samoa and Democrats Abroad) are voting today. Polls begin closing at 7 p.m. Eastern, and the first call of the night will probably be Vermont, for its home-state candidate, Senator Bernie Sanders.
Insurance markets are collapsing, Mr. Ryan said this week. Premiums are soaring. Patients' choices are dwindling.

Along similar lines, Rhodes and Schaffner found in their 2017 paper that:
Trump's cavalier attitude toward conflicts of interest is manifest in Kushner, who was reportedly talking about government business with the Chinese ambassador even as his family's company sought Chinese investment for that skyscraper.
Bret: I honestly don't believe that Kavanaugh will vote to overturn Roe v. Wade. Democrats said the same thing about Anthony Kennedy when Ronald Reagan nominated him in 1987, yet he ended up being one of the justices (along with the Republican appointees David Souter and Sandra Day O'Connor) who reaffirmed the central holdings of Roe in the Casey decision. I'm confident Kavanaugh will respect 45 years of abortion precedent even if he's more traditionally conservative on other issues.
In response to a question from Mr. Barkan, Mr. Biden would not commit to doubling the budget for the National Institutes of Health, saying that he would significantly increase the budget and would also ensure we spend another $50 billion on biomedical research over the next several years.
I believe the epic in which we're engaged is worth the time and effort of all of us.
Cleared of collusion and flush with victory, President Trump is a man unleashed, ready to tackle everything that's evaded him over the last two years. His first target is health care. We're going to get rid of Obamacare, Trump said at a rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Thursday. And I said the other day, the Republican Party will become the party of great health care. It's good. It's important.

Capital punishment in Brunei: Adultery and gay sex are punishable with death by stoning under Islamic laws that went into effect today in Brunei, a sultanate of about 430,000 people on the island of Borneo.
When Senator Warren suggested that Vice President Biden is running in the wrong primary, he responded in a Medium post that called such attacks condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view.
Furthermore, a fundamental component of rates is the age of enrollees: Older people use more care than younger people, and that is reflected in rates. D.C. Health Link works hard to make sure that we have a good age mix. Our largest enrollment (37 percent) is 26-to-34-year-olds. This helps keep rates down.

Biden Jr. has won the Texas primary, giving the former vice president a victory in the second-biggest delegate prize of Super Tuesday — Texas has 228 — as he aims to hold off a looming advantage from Bernie Sanders. Mr. Biden got a bounce on Monday night from an endorsement from Beto O'Rourke, who remains a local political folk hero following his narrow 2018 Senate loss to Ted Cruz. Along with Mr. O'Rourke, Mr. Biden heralded late endorsements from several of the state's members of Congress, along with Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, who joined him for celebratory events in Dallas on Monday.

One thing that really drives a lot of my thinking about how politics should work is that there is a question of how the public is supposed to hold leaders accountable and then how politics is supposed to change over time, right? How do people change their views? Why would you maybe move from one party to the other? What would make politics fluid, such it would have accountability? And you've read my book on this, Why We're Polarized, and you know I think that we're pretty locked in place for a bunch of different reasons. So in many ways, I'm, I think, quite on the pessimistic side of this argument. But when you talk about the narrow majorities, one thing that, I think, keeps those narrow majorities in place is that there is very little reason, over time, to change your opinion, unless you are a political junkie, right? So if you're reading everything and you're checking in on everything Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley and Elizabeth Warren and so on are doing, then you've got a lot of information about what people on different sides think, and you can see where you fall. But most people aren't like that. Most people are pretty disengaged. Politics is unpleasant. People don't like conflict. They've got other stuff going on in their lives. It is not a crazy thing to not want to be following every twist and turn of Congress.
Supporting the option were Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services; Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services; and Andrew Bremberg, the director of the Domestic Policy Council at the White House.
In 2017, not long after Trump's victory, NextGen America, Steyer's climate-advocacy group, went looking for ways to make progress at the state level. With Trump in the White House, it was clear that the federal government would be moving in the wrong direction on environmental policy. NextGen officials decided to choose a few states where success might make a difference and send a political signal. We wanted to try to get some wins that weren't in very liberal, very Democratic places, said Jamison Foser, a senior adviser at NextGen. They ultimately settled on three states, none reliably blue: Arizona, Michigan and Nevada.
AK: Sure. I'm really interested in the student loan debt issue, but there's a concern that your plan to forgive student debt really tilts a lot of resources towards the wealthy. So only 2 percent of borrowers have more than $50,000 in debt. A third of all student debt is owned by people in the top income quartile, and most student debt goes to households with advanced degrees. So these are doctors and lawyers, and they've amassed a lot of debt, but they're also investing in their own educational capacity to pay off that debt. So I'm just wondering how you square that with a plan that goes about forgiving student debt?
I mean, you don't even know which way the wind is blowing with this guy.
You do what you can with 50 votes to offer people what's possible. And then when lots of people get experience with it and they say, I like this, this works for me, then we vote on it and everybody gets better off and gets to try it. I think that's what's going to happen on Medicare for all. In fact, I think that is the way that we can solve our health care problems.
Once upon a time there was a program called Aid to Families With Dependent Children — the program people usually had in mind when they talked about welfare. It was originally intended to support white widows while they raised their children, and it was effectively denied to both Black and unwed mothers. Over time, however, these restrictions were eroded, and the program rapidly expanded from the early 1960s to the early 1970s.
And guess what? Despite breathless coverage of the daily outrage generator in the White House, the economy is improving. The tax cuts will, and in fact already are, spurring growth, freeing capital for investment, creating jobs and returning overseas profits to our shores. There is a message to sell. So sell it.
KK: It's a very bad idea for the children to ——
Lauren Kelley: Sure. I wanted to ask about reproductive rights.
A 2018 Gallup poll found that a record-high 75 percent of Americans say immigration is a positive, including majorities of all parties. Yet immigration reform has become a wedge issue in Congress, with the government brought to a shutdown multiple times over issues like the treatment of Dreamers and the funding for Mr. Trump's border wall.
No. This is on budget reconciliation.
They say that in order to go through reconciliation, policies have to have sort of a primary impact that is budgetary. It's like an organization passing a primary purpose test. You can't have a procedure or a policy that is sort of ancillary in its budgetary effects or sort of indirect. For instance, something like DC statehood, its advocates could sort of argue that there is some budgetary impact to statehood. And I'm sure that that's true. But it would never pass muster because it's very clear that the primary impact of creating a new state is not a budgetary impact. And so, it limits what can go through reconciliation to issues that have big impacts on revenues, spending, and that sort of thing.
We would like to get to a point where we have what we call universal access, where everybody is able to access coverage to some degree or another, the aide said. Over the past six years, if you look at the experience we've had with the A.C.A. rollout, chasing coverage doesn't necessarily yield great outcomes. You can have people going into an exchange, finding out that their pediatrician is no longer available to them.
JW: You think if they vote in the next two weeks that that will be a sufficient amount of time and what they've done, what they ——
As a result, candidates find themselves caught in an arms race: trying to raise enough money to compete, in contributions of $2,700 or less (far more than any middle-class family can spare), often facing opponents funding their own campaigns or incumbents with established fund-raising machines or outside money. There's a natural pressure to find a way out of that trap, using whatever technique your lawyers and consultants cook up. That's why every politician who has support from large donors now has a supportive super PAC.
Well, that's a beautiful, broad question. I mean, a party is always a coalition, and the Republican Party is more self-consciously a coalition than it used to be. Republicans, for most of my lifetime, were able to think of themselves as a party unified by a set of views — broadly conservative, kind of Reaganite views. But I think it has always been true that the party is actually more coalitional than that. That there is a conservative segment of its electorate, and there is a populist segment of its electorate. There's a more business-oriented and libertarian segment. And the differences between those have become much clearer over time and especially have become much clearer in the crucible of the last few years under Trump. And I think the party emerges from Trumpism much more self-consciously coalitional and really facing the question, the struggle of how now to define itself, how to find voters and expand its electorate, how to keep its base engaged — really fundamental questions that the party has to take up really fundamentally. It's allowed itself, to much too great a degree, to become a cult of personality around Donald Trump. And now Trump gets pulled out of the political arena, we hope — I hope, anyway. And the question for the party is, without that, what are we about? I think there's a conservative answer to that. There's going to be a populist answer to that. There's inevitably going to be a libertarian or business answer to that.
Why does Trump want to leave this court case hanging? Partly because his side would probably lose. As I said, the lawsuit is ludicrous, although, given the partisanship of Republican-appointed judges, it might prevail anyway.

New York severely undercounted virus deaths in nursing homes, a report says. Emergency medical technicians lifting a man after moving him from a nursing home into an ambulance in Brooklyn. Credit... Lucas Jackson/Reuters An investigation by the New York State attorney general has concluded that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's administration undercounted coronavirus-related deaths at nursing homes by as much as 50 percent. The count of deaths in state nursing homes has been a source of controversy for Mr. Cuomo and state Health Department officials, who have been sensitive to any suggestion that decisions made at the outset of the pandemic may have caused some of those deaths, which the state puts at more than 8,700. They have also been accused of obscuring a more accurate estimate of nursing home deaths, because the state only counted deaths at the actual facilities, rather than including deaths of residents who were transferred to a hospital and died there. In the 76-page report released on Thursday by the attorney general, Letitia James, a survey of nursing homes found consistent discrepancies between deaths reported to the attorney general's investigators and those reported to and officially released by the Health Department. In one instance, an unnamed facility reported to the Health Department that it had 11 confirmed and presumed deaths on site through early August. The attorney general's survey of that same facility, however, found 40 deaths, including 27 at the home and 13 in hospitals.
However, to repeat something I've said a few times in the Trump era, when the venting is done it's important to acknowledge that it could be worse. The bill is badly designed but it does some good things, including some things that could be done only in the teeth of Democratic opposition. Its flaws are significant but also manageable, and they aren't going to tip America into the dystopian nightmare invoked by a certain kind of liberal Twitter hysteric this past week. And as is often the case with flawed proposals, the failings offer useful signposts to the opposition: The partial defeat of reform conservatism leaves good ideas lying around to be picked up, and Republican overreach creates opportunities for the Democrats to pursue them.
Biotech stocks promptly fell nearly 3 percent on Wednesday. They recovered slightly on Thursday and Friday, but the comments remained a warning blow for an industry that had rallied in the weeks after the election, on the assumption that Mr. Trump and a Republican Congress would be friendly to the nation's drug makers. Suddenly, it looked as if pharmaceutical companies might join Carrier, Ford and Boeing as targets of Mr. Trump's ire.
I am convinced that more Americans are worried about the country's cohesion and its institutions being ripped apart by Trump than Trump realizes. It's a key reason his approval rankings remain largely flat while our stock markets soar. I also believe that the Trump team has overestimated how easy it will be for it to just keep hiding the most important evidence and witnesses now that the impeachment trial has begun and many Americans are tuning in to this issue for the first time.
The 2010 law stipulates that some of the money shall be deposited into the general fund of the Treasury of the United States and may not be used for the program to provide financial assistance to insurance companies.
While I wholeheartedly agree with Michelle Goldberg's argument that it would be nothing short of poetic justice for President Trump to lose re-election in 2020 to a female Democrat, I worry that she is too optimistic about a female Democrat's chances in a general election, even if she can get through the competitive Democratic primary.

That at the moment, people thought might have really changed the momentum of this thing.
The subsidies people get for insurance in the Obamacare marketplace are calculated at the beginning of the year, based on estimated income for that year. But if you bought insurance and your income changes, you can go back to the marketplace and adjust. You may need to provide documents proving the income change, like a termination letter or a recent paycheck.
It's a scary thing to go back and know you have low immunity, she said in mid-May, after two days back at her job. But when it all boils down to it, I don't think Covid-19 is going away any time soon. I don't think you can hide from it. You've got to trust God and go back.
Readers discuss the challenges the G.O.P. will face with its promise to replace Obamacare.
Supporters of the bill, under which health care would be available to all Americans without premiums, co-payments, deductibles or similar charges, did not say how much it would cost or how they would pay for it. They said their proposal could save huge sums by cutting administrative costs and the bill-paying bureaucracy that works for insurance companies and health care providers. And Ms. Jayapal mentioned the possibility of levying a wealth tax on the wealthiest Americans.
That sort of glibness, in turn, is likely to give already-ascendant Democratic ideas a boost. The party's enthusiasm for Medicare for All has flourished recently in part because it exists in a vacuum, with little if any substantive competition from the right. There are serious practical and political impediments to making a transition to single payer, from the enormous increase in federal spending and the tax increases it would almost certainly entail to the disruption that would be caused by the elimination of current private health insurance coverage for millions of Americans.
AK: O.K. No, I mean, it's not my critique. This is a critique on the left as well, you know, that going about forgiving student debt in this way puts a lot of money in households that are going to make a lot of money.
I think it includes anti-competitiveness and unfair trade practices. I think we need to resuscitate the old tying concept that we use.
Furthermore, we could reduce those disincentives by making programs more generous, not less — providing more aid to the near-poor rather than less aid to the poor. Somehow, conservatives never seem to consider that option.

Those losses have cumulatively swelled to more than $1 billion, Ms. Skolnick said, but because they have been segregated in the company's accounting, and because the company has been leaving those markets, investors have been able to easily assess the company's value entirely separately from the problems it's had with the exchanges, she said. Other managed care companies have made similar provisions.
And that leaves the G.O.P. very, very frustrated.
WASHINGTON — One of the thorniest debates in American politics is over health care. Now add a pandemic.

With Democrats making health care central to their 2020 campaigns, Mr. Trump has been facing pressure to propose his own health care overhaul. He has repeatedly promised to release one. The administration is backing legal action pressing to declare the entire health law unconstitutional, and if it wins in court, the result could be a wave of disruption as an estimated 20 million Americans lose health insurance, insurance consumer protections crumble, drug approval pathways disappear, and Medicare fraud statutes are weakened, among many other effects.
Well, I would add he also got a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

And I'm wondering if that's because people are afraid of what you're proposing as much as others might like it?

WASHINGTON — The Trump administration's decision to ask a federal appeals court to invalidate the Affordable Care Act has given House Democrats a new opening to pursue what they see as a winning political strategy: moving past talk of impeachment to put kitchen-table issues like health care front and center.
KK: Yes, I am, undocumented immigrants, excuse me.
In their ardor to undermine and abolish the Affordable Care Act, Republicans in Congress are causing inestimable damage. Specifically, they are damaging the United States' reputation for reliability among private companies looking to do business with the government.
Senator Warren said in an interview with Vox's Ezra Klein that many other economic policies should be accomplished before the government starts sending out checks to every American, as Mr. Yang's Freedom Dividend proposes.

Well, I never get to argue with anybody who wants to create a House filibuster. This is going to be wonderful. It makes my skin crawl. It's great. So let me push on that, a couple of things. One, we would not be a pure majoritarian political structure no matter what you did with the filibuster. We have more veto-generating political institutions than any other advanced democracy, and it's not even all that close. We have the Supreme Court. We have divided government, oftentimes, across the different branches. We have power distributed across the different branches. We have a system that was designed to be hard to do things in before the filibuster was ever a gleam in anybody's eye. As you know, of course, it was not a founding father idea, the filibuster, and they did not want a supermajority requirement in Congress. They thought about that and rejected it. So that's one thing. I always want to push that majoritarian thing to the side. And of course, we still have a Bill of Rights and all kinds of protections for individuals and minorities. That said, I think that one way of framing what you're saying here as a model is that a system in which you require more accommodation to get things done is going to be a system that encourages accommodation, compromise, understanding between the parties. And what I would say in response is, well, look around. We have more filibusters than ever and more polarized politics than ever.
Do you remember the Bush boom? Probably not. Anyway, the administration of George W. Bush began its tenure with a recession, followed by an extended jobless recovery. By the summer of 2003, however, the economy began adding jobs again. The pace of job creation wasn't anything special by historical standards, but conservatives insisted that the job gains after that trough represented a huge triumph, a vindication of the Bush tax cuts.
But as Republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of Congress for their more partisan goals, Democrats are preparing roadblocks. The party's brutal election-year wounds have been salted by evidence of Russian election interference, Mr. Trump's hard-line cabinet picks and his taunting Twitter posts. (On Saturday, he offered New Year's wishes to all, including those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do.)
And they immediately initiate emergency legislation, going straight to the Wisconsin Supreme Court, saying that the governor does not have the right to do this.

Some experts say the United States is now in a race between the vaccine and the new variants. If the virus is not replicating, they say, it cannot mutate. Mr. Biden has vowed to get 100 million shots in the arms of the American people, by his 100th day in office, a plan that some say is not ambitious enough. On Monday, the drug makers Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech reported that their vaccines were effective against variants discovered in Britain and South Africa. But they are slightly less protective against the variant in South Africa, which may be more adept at dodging antibodies in the bloodstream. On Wednesday, Mr. Zients said that the Department of Health and Human Services would use the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, a law passed in 2005 that gives the health secretary emergency powers, to allow retired doctors and nurses to administer vaccines and give doctors and nurses the right to vaccinate people across state lines. And he said the president's 100 million-shot commitment does not depend on Congress passing legislation. But he ticked off a list of other priorities that require Congress to act: In order to get all Americans vaccinated, we need Congress to provide funds for vaccination. We still do too little testing in this country. We need to ramp up testing significantly. We need Congress to fund more testing in order to reopen schools and businesses and take care of people in congregate settings. Furthermore, believe it or not, we still have shortages of P.P.E.
PART A. To claim this credit you must meet some requirements.
But let me finish my point. If you fight on ground where I think you've got lots of bipartisan support and you lead a damn fight — and then — just — if you can deliver a 2-cent wealth tax, which has wide popularity, when I get to sign the piece of paper that cancels student loan debt for 43 million Americans, that's Democrats and Republicans. I think at that moment, the world starts to shift. I think at that moment, a whole generation of people who have only seen the government as debt collector starts to shift. Will we get 100 percent of the folks on board? No. But will we get a lot more? Will we begin to talk about a democracy that doesn't just work increasingly for a thinner and thinner slice of the top, or will we start to talk about a democracy that works for all of us? That 2-cent wealth tax is about child care. It's about things that touch people's lives. It's about universal pre-K for 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds. It's about a $50 billion investment in historically black colleges and universities, tuition-free. Technical school, two-year college, four-year college. You just deliver on something that matters to people. Now they've got a stake in democracy. It feels like it pays off, that it's not just marching in the street over and over and over, and the next day you wake up and it's a little bit worse than it was today.
It does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their health care costs, the four wrote in a joint statement.
Obamacare is, however, what engineers would call a kludge: a somewhat awkward, clumsy device with lots of moving parts. This makes it more expensive than it should be, and will probably always cause a significant number of people to fall through the cracks.
Unfortunately, Vice President Biden, you're just simply inaccurate in what you're describing. The cost of doing nothing is far too expensive. I'm going to go back to Vice President Biden. You do nothing to hold the insurance companies to task for what they have been doing to American families. Kamala Harris said she's not trying to restructure society— She put over 1,500 people in jail for marijuana violations and then laughed about it when she was asked if she ever smoked marijuana. She had a police department when she was there that in fact was abusing people's rights. You want to compare records, and frankly, I'm shocked that you do— It looks like one of us has learned the lessons of the past, and one of us hasn't. Mr. Vice President, there's a saying in my community: You're dipping into the Kool-Aid and you don't even know the flavor. Mr. Vice President, you didn't answer my question. What did you mean when you said, when a woman works outside the home, it's resulting in 'the deterioration of family'? Mr. Vice President, you want to be president of the United States, you need to be able to answer the tough questions. I guarantee you, if you're debating Donald Trump, he's not going to let you off the hook. I love your affection for me. You spent a lot of time with me. And I don't know what math you do in New York. I don't know what math you do anywhere, California.
Or three. I mean, how do you want to count it? [LAUGHTER] One is to reduce the cost for families on the first day. I mean, the cost savings doesn't come in on the first day, but you sign the papers that need to be done, so you reduce costs on the first day. The second is to give people the opportunity to be in Medicare if they want, anyone who's 50 or older, and expand the coverage for Medicare. It's to offer Medicare for all complete health care coverage to everyone else who wants it.
But that's not even close to all there is. The states also argue that if the individual mandate is unconstitutional, the rest of the A.C.A. must fall, too. They audaciously claim that the mandate is too central to the act for the rest of it — including provisions as disparate as requiring restaurant owners to post calorie counts and expanding drug coverage under Medicare — to operate without it.
The lawsuit claims Health Insurance Innovations spent millions of dollars funding Simple Health and was intimately involved in the scripts its brokers used to sell these policies. Customers were told that they were getting a P.P.O. plan, a traditional policy that allows individuals to go to the doctor or hospital of their choice. Many of the websites that consumers visited implied the policies being offered were from brand-name insurers.

And I think a strengthening of Congress is required for a strengthening of that capacity, but that requires these supermajority institutions. So I would create a filibuster in the House before I would get rid of the one in the Senate, and it's not because my party's not in power right now. I had this view and made this argument when Republicans were in power and even pretty comfortably had majorities in both houses. I think it is very important that our system requires some cross-partisan accommodation, frustrating as it is for those of us who have policy ambitions. I think that the contribution of that to the health of our political culture is absolutely essential, especially now.
Murkowski, whom Palin had tried to cast as part of the entrenched establishment, suddenly became the underdog, a shift that galvanized her campaign. Her team passed out plastic bracelets that said, fill it in, write it in, with the correct spelling of her name. Murkowski defeated Miller, with the help of traditional Democratic constituencies like women and Alaska Natives. It was an unusual coalition for a Republican, said Mark Begich, at the time Alaska's other senator and a Democrat.
Hmm. It looks as if we're getting ripped off. Members of Congress seem to underperform compared to members of Parliament in Poland and across the democratic world.
But I tell you, that's a lot of money. This idea is a bunch of malarkey, what we're talking about here. ... that puts working people first. Protester: Fire Pantaleo! Thank you, Mayor de Blasio. The— Fire Pantaleo! Fire Pantaleo! Protester: Three million deportations! Please be respectful. Please be respectful in the crowd. I think that folks are making a mistake by not pursuing impeachment. I just want to make sure whatever we do doesn't end up with an acquittal by Mitch McConnell in the Senate, which it surely would. And then President Trump would be running saying that he had been acquitted by the United States Congress. When we look back in history at what happened when a president of the United States started acting more like an authoritarian leader than the leader of the free world, the question is, what will we have done? And I believe the Congress should do its job. We have a predator living in the White House. We can no longer allow a white nationalist to be in the White House. The first thing that I'm going to do when I'm president is I'm going to Clorox the Oval Office. Adios to Donald Trump.

Such a change would shake the entire health care system, which makes up a fifth of the United States economy, as hospitals, doctors, nursing homes and pharmaceutical companies would have to adapt to a new set of rules. Most Americans would have a new insurer — the federal government — and many would find the health insurance stocks in their retirement portfolios much less valuable.
Senator Warren has argued that the sheer size of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon pose a real threat to innovation and competition in the technology industry.

Poor, older adults would face the largest crunch: The magnitude of their tax credits shrinks, even as a separate provision in the bill allows insurers to charge older people substantially higher prices than are allowed under the Affordable Care Act.

The authorities have demanded that people visiting rural areas during the holiday spend two weeks in quarantine and pay for their own coronavirus tests. Many migrants, who endure grueling jobs for meager wages in big cities, say those restrictions make it impossible to travel. The rollout of the rules has drawn widespread criticism in China, with many people calling the approach unfair to migrant workers, who have long been treated as second-class citizens under China's strict household registration system. The workers have been among the most deeply affected by the pandemic, as the authorities have carried out scattered lockdowns to fight the virus and employers have reduced hours and pay. In a regular year, hundreds of millions of people travel by plane, train and car to be with their families for the Lunar New Year.

Providing health coverage to the uninsured was Obamacare's principal goal, and on that measure, it has succeeded. The gain of 20 million insured, based on an Obama administration estimate last year, is probably now even higher.
In other words, Republicans' insistence that they have a superior alternative to Obamacare is a zombie lie — a claim that should be dead after having been proved false again and again, but it is still shambling along, eating people's brains.

Josh, routinely described by mentors as respectful, has built a technology investment firm called Thrive that is worth billions. His crown jewel, a health insurance company called Oscar, was structured around Obamacare — the main thing Trump has been trying to explode.
You know on part of this, I think part of the answer is current law enforcement. You correctly describe it, in harassing people, in trespassing. And we need to make sure at federal, state, and local levels that people who are seeking health care of any kind have access to that health care and are not denied that opportunity. I think our laws are there. I think the weakness is our failure to enforce. That's how I see now. If there are gaps in that, I'm certainly open to understanding them better, but that's how I see it.
Those actions appear to have made a difference. Sign-ups for health plans in the states managed by the federal government are down slightly compared with last year. About 9.2 million Americans picked an Obamacare marketplace plan for this year, according to a government report released Friday. Last year, that number was 9.6 million.
Carbon pricing's recent losing streak arguably began in the United States during the first two years of Obama's presidency, in 2009 and 2010. Those years were the most successful period for progressive legislation since Lyndon B. Johnson's Great Society. Obama signed a huge federal stimulus bill, toughened Wall Street regulation and extended health insurance to some 20 million people. The one major piece of Democratic legislation that failed was the climate bill, which was sponsored in the House of Representatives by Henry Waxman of California and Ed Markey of Massachusetts.

The deputy head of Madrid's regional government, Ignacio Aguado, told a news conference that priority needed to be given to administering second doses of the vaccine, particularly to frontline health care workers and residents of nursing homes. Mr. Aguado urged the central government of Spain to urgently demand extra supplies from the European Union. Separately, the regional government of the northeastern region of Catalonia, also warned on Wednesday that a supply shortage was affecting its rollout program. Tomorrow our fridges will be empty, one regional health official, Josep Maria Argimon, said.

Because these corporations, they don't have any loyalty to a country, they just have loyalty to their own bottom line. And they play this all around the world.

You mentioned that there was a post-Reagan consensus for some time. And as somebody who covers domestic policy and politics primarily, I often think of the Reagan legacy in terms of tax cuts, in terms of deregulation, in terms of its domestic policy. But of course, Reagan was also defined by this fight against the Soviet Union. That ended. Then a couple years after Reagan, you have George W. Bush and the war on terror, and that has not actually ended, given our deployments to different places. But I think, as a conceptual framework for the Republican Party, it has ended. Donald Trump runs, in many ways, against a lot of that Bush legacy. How much of the split that is growing in the Republican Party actually reflects a party that used to be held together by external enemies? And here, I mean foreign enemies. And now it doesn't have that. To the extent it has anything like that, it is liberals domestically, but not that foreign threat that requires a kind of unity that the past presidents were able to lean on.
Any attack on the A.C.A. must start with the recognition that at least 23 million Americans (the Obama White House estimate) and perhaps more than 26 million (some private experts) have been added to the health care rolls. As shown below, this has driven the percentage of Americans without insurance down to 9 percent, by a considerable margin the lowest in history.
In their brief seeking Supreme Court review, two insurance companies said they had been the victims of a bait-and-switch of staggering dimensions in which the government has paid insurers $12 billion less than what was promised.

A 2-cent wealth tax, and now let's talk about what kind of change we could make. Two cents, and we can do universal child care. We can put $800 billion into our public schools. We can make a federal commitment for the first time in history to public education K-12, and we can do the same thing for college, and we can cancel student loan debt, and an enormous boost to our economy.

I mean, one way I think about it is it's almost certainly the case that there are real differences between boys and girls and men and women that extend beyond the ones that you can see. And yet it also seems to me likely that we've exaggerated how big those differences are. And, Farhad, I think that's part of your point, that, Ross, your point about there being real differences can be true, but it can also be the case that they're not nearly as big as we think.

And do you know if McCain essentially blessed this or said, I understand, Lindsey?
Yes. I just think it's got this — no one has to say there is a conflict of interest, and I'm not trying to talk about anyone's individual circumstances, but I think one of the things we have to deal with in public life is the appearance of conflict of interest. You know, that's supposed to be the guiding principle, for example, for judges. It's not whether or not there is a conflict of interest, it's whether or not people in the public could reasonably be concerned that it were, because it's important that you believe that judges are acting independently and not influenced because they're going to get money or someone in their family is going to get money. And so that's where I think the analogy is the closest, and whether you make it a rule of ethics or whether do you actually just make it part of the law, I think is a fair question, but I get why we should push in that direction.
Biden's pick for top economist testifies in the Senate. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:08 - 0:00 transcript Cecilia Rouse Testifies to the Senate Cecilia Rouse, President Biden's pick to lead the White House Council of Economic Advisers, testified to the Senate Banking Committee on how she would lead a recovery in the wake of the pandemic. Today, our country is living through the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of families have had their lives turned upside down. The economic security they've worked so hard to build eroded almost overnight by the economic impact of the pandemic. Far too many have slipped through our safety net into hardship and hopelessness, and structural inequities that have always existed within our economy have not just been exposed, but exacerbated — their impact more devastating than ever before. As important as it is for the C.E.A. to interpret and translate data and academic research, it is also vital that we utilize the right data. Too often, economists focus on average outcomes instead of examining a range of outcomes. As a result, our analyses tell us about average economic growth and the middle of the distribution. But as our economy grows more and more unequal, that analysis fails to capture the experience of the many people who are left behind, particularly people of color.

Margot: I think the public option seems like a weird match with the market structure of the Affordable Care Act. Imagine this scenario: The public option can get every doctor and hospital to accept Medicare prices, and it's able to achieve really low administrative costs. In that case, it's an insurance plan with a lot of structural advantages over the competition. The existing insurance companies, mostly, are already losing money in this market, and several of them are already leaving or going under. Why would they stick around longer if they can't get many customers, and they can't make money on the ones they keep? In another version, the public option doesn't have any special advantages, and is just another insurance plan in the marketplace. In that case, do you think the government will do a better job of running an insurance company than the insurance industry? We're learning that this is a hard business. I guess, in that case, it would operate as another choice.
Robert Bork was President Ronald Reagan's failed Supreme Court nominee in 1987. He wrote extensively on antitrust legislation and redefined it from a focus on helping small businesses to promoting economic efficiency, according to Barak Orbach, professor of law at the University of Arizona.
Until that point, most agencies could continue to operate even if funding bills hadn't been passed, with the understanding that money would eventually be approved.
So the effect is that the promises that are put into trade agreements like T.P.P., they may all look the same on paper, but man, they are nowhere close to each other in terms of what happens with enforcement. Multinational corporations are given the opportunity basically to opt out of laws they don't like, where protections that are supposed to be written for our workers, for the worldwide environment, for human rights standards, just get left by the curb.
Her theory of political change has been shaped by two experiences — one failure and one success. As a professor in the 1990s, she served on a federal bankruptcy commission and fought against legal changes that favored banks over borrowers. The fight went on for a decade, and Warren's side lost. The defeat left her believing that a technocratic legislative debate — the inside game, as she calls it — almost always favors industry lobbyists.

The Trump administration's goal is not only to weaken the Affordable Care Act but also to trick the public into thinking, as opponents of the law like to say, that Obamacare is collapsing under its own weight. Let's be clear: If the Affordable Care Act collapses, it is because the president demolished it.
Yet here was Ms. Pelosi herself, escorting a supporter of Medicare for all, Ady Barkan, to the House Rules Committee meeting. Mr. Barkan, who has long advocated health care expansion, has the degenerative neural disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and used a computer to help him speak. He proved a powerful presence.
During the 2008 campaign, Barack Obama had assured Mr. Biden that he would be consulted on every major decision. But many on the new president's team were still Biden-skeptical, and Mr. Obama was not sure the meandering former senator had the discipline to be an effective governing partner, people close to both men said.
In a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times, the president also accused James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director he fired in May, of trying to leverage a dossier of compromising material to keep his job. Mr. Trump criticized both the acting F.B.I. director who has been filling in since Mr. Comey's dismissal and the deputy attorney general who recommended it. And he took on Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel now leading the investigation into Russian meddling in last year's election.

Now senators are searching for changes to make the bill more politically palatable. But the notion of making those changes today and then speeding immediately to a vote is madness. There would be no time for experts to consider the consequences — to discover the sort of problems and unintended effects that last-minute changes are bound to create. By the time they did, the Senate would have passed it.
After an illness or an injury, many Americans who enroll in these G.O.P. junk health coverage plans will end up being hit by crushing medical bills, finding that they have been paying for coverage that doesn't cover much at all, said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader.
The breadth of Mr. Bloomberg's broadcast campaign is numbing. The roughly $410 million on television ads alone — $370 million spent, and another $41 million reserved through Super Tuesday — is more than Hillary Clinton and President Trump spent on television ads during their entire 2016 presidential campaigns, primary and general elections combined, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. And Mr. Bloomberg, who entered the race in November, did it in four months.

No, it's fine. It's just that look out there. People's financial circumstances have gotten worse. The amount of student loan debt has been going up at a rate of $100 billion a year. Oh, here's one. Just saw some data not long ago out of the Department of Education. Go take a look 20 years out on people who borrowed student loan debt. Ninety-four percent of whites have paid off their student loan debt. Want to guess what the percentage is for African-Americans is?
The defeat of Senator Luther Strange, Republican of Alabama, in a primary election on Tuesday night appears to have ushered in a season of savage nomination fights and activist-led attacks on party leaders, especially on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. Despite enjoying the strong backing of President Trump, Mr. Strange lost by a wide margin to Roy Moore, a firebrand religious activist and former judge, who denounced Mr. Strange as a puppet of the Senate leader.
KK: Well, one more personal question for you. Who has broken your heart?
But I want to linger on that word opportunism, because if you look at the chronology, one view — and perhaps it's the most cynical view — is that Lindsey Graham, in the name of relevance, attached himself to the biggest star in Republican politics for a very long time, and that was Senator John McCain. And then when Senator John McCain declines and ultimately dies, Lindsey Graham looks for the next biggest star to attach himself to, and that happens to be Donald Trump. And so despite the fact that these two men disdain each other and represent very different sides of the Republican Party, the constant is Lindsey Graham seeking out the star.
LK: But I wanted to ask about an aspect of it that I think gets relatively little attention.
Do you like him on a superficial, like, we golf together, we have a little rapport level?
He was asked, is John McCain a hero? And Donald Trump said, no, he's not. I like people who weren't captured.
But here's the thing: Protecting coverage for pre-existing conditions is overwhelmingly popular, commanding majority support even among Republicans. And McCaskill has been hammering Hawley over his role in that lawsuit.
Whether it was the border wall, which he insisted would be built; abortion, where he tried to fan conservative anger over comments made by Virginia's governor; or the investigations of his presidential campaign's ties to Russia, which he dismissed as ridiculous and partisan, Mr. Trump chose to appeal to his political base rather than trying to build bridges to Democrats.

The case argues that changes made to the Affordable Care Act in 2017 make its requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance unconstitutional — and that the provision is so essential to the health care law that the rest of it should be invalidated as well.

Bret: Just promise we'll still be friends when he's gone.
Donald Trump then, at a campaign event, decided to —
Part two is again, we should be working more with our allies. Donald Trump seems to think somehow that we are stronger alone and I think that's fundamentally wrong. If you want to bring economic pressure on China, if you want to bring diplomatic pressure on China, it makes a lot more sense to do that if we're doing it with our allies, if we're doing it in conjunction with others. And I think that provides potentially much better protection for Hong Kong. The idea that this is going to be a direct military conflict between China and the United States, that would be deeply destabilizing to the entire world. So I want to see us use our diplomatic tools. I want to see us use our economic tools, and I want to see us leverage everything that we want to do by working much more tightly in conjunction with our allies. We just haven't been doing that. None of the above.
Unlike an administration functioning during normal times, the Biden team can't simply add people to a meeting at the last minute, or run someone into the building. It couldn't be more different in feel and temperament from the opening weeks of the Trump administration, when the Oval Office was often compared to Grand Central Terminal. Former President Donald J. Trump's office served as a bustling focal point of all West Wing activity as aides wandered in and out and then simply hung about, once it was clear that there was no formal structure for meetings or policymaking, and that for Mr. Trump, out of sight was out of mind. All West Wing staff members are still tested daily even though a growing number of administration officials are getting vaccinated. There are also fewer people working in the building, and those who are there rarely leave the campus for lunch. There have been awkward moments in hallways, when staff members don't recognize each other because everyone is required to wear an N95 mask and many have opted to double-mask, officials said. The measures are in place because of a realization that while it may be impossible to prevent the coronavirus from entering the White House complex entirely, it is possible to reduce the risk of widespread infection if someone on the president's team gets sick. The rules have been put in place by Anne Filipic, the director of management and administration, and Jeff Wexler, the White House director of Covid-19 operations.

Honestly, I'm really content to let Michelle play the reactionary in this conversation and just sort of sit back and listen. But, no, Farhad, I wanted to just challenge you a little bit on what you said about your feeling of disappointment in your children's adoption of gender roles. We have three kids, and our oldest two kids are girls. They're eight and six. And until my son was born, we had a very female-oriented domestic space in the sense that most of the books and toys and clothes and everything else were girl clothes— not in sort of a hyper-gendered way but in a sort of stereotypically gendered way. And I tried to interest my girls in Wiffle ball and various things, and they tended to be more interested in fairy tales and dolls and so on. And then my son was born. And so his experience of his childhood was of femininity as a norm. I mean, I read to him the girl books that I read to my daughters. And to the extent that it's possible, I think he had, at the very least, a sort of gender-neutral entry into consciousness. And when he was about two and a half, one of my girls brought home a book about Blackbeard the pirate. And he, entirely unbidden, picked it up and immediately became obsessed with it to the point where he would wear a pirate hat to school every day.
Republican lawmakers cite rising premiums as a main reason for repealing the Affordable Care Act.
There was little new in Mr. Trump's performance. He did not offer a governing vision or even an updated policy focus for a second term. His 76-minute speech was the usual brew of aggrandizement, aggrievement and demonization of political foes. He vilified Democrats as ruthless, unhinged monsters dedicated to the rise of radical socialism and the destruction of the American dream. He whined about his persecution by the fake news and the deep-state rogues who perpetrated the Russia witch hunt. He devoted so much time to attacking Crooked Hillary that it seemed as though a confused aide might have accidentally loaded one of his 2016 speeches into the teleprompters.
We take it on by deciding we're going to take it on. We pass it through Congress, and then we set it up for the states to be able to vote on it.
Essentially, we are getting rid of Obamacare, Mr. Trump said, reminding a cheering crowd that the individual mandate that required most people to have health insurance or pay a penalty was scrapped as part of the Republican tax bill he signed into law last year. Some people would say, essentially, we have gotten rid of it.
I'm talking about disorder that comes from nation states fracturing under the pressure of these climate changes and spilling out masses of refugees, triggering populist, nationalist backlashes all across the West. I'm talking about disorder spread by a Russia that wants to keep the West in turmoil.
We are at another watershed moment that could result in national suicide and the end to everything we Americans hold dear. As the damage and outrages pile up, it's important to remember that Ms. Collins and Ms. Murkowski are enabling them with their affiliation, even when they dissent. They could halt the whole charade, and alter the course of history, with a press release.

When told that former Vice President Biden criticized her health care plans, Senator Warren answered with a critique of moderate Democrats: Democrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies. She also suggested Mr. Biden is running in the wrong primary.
I mean, he doesn't have a whole group of old friends.
They failed multiple attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and its popularity got higher than ever. And there was kind of this boost among Democratic activists over health care — that they started to really care about the issue, and get organized, and get angry.
The 2013 shutdown lasted for 16 days and ended amid dire warnings from the Treasury Department that it was about to run out of money. Having failed in their bid to defund Obamacare, Republicans leaders eventually worked with their Democratic counterparts on a plan to reopen the government and raise the debt ceiling.
Senator Warren has laid out an ambitious timeline that would put children and families under Medicare for all in her first 100 days through a congressional maneuver, then fully roll out her system by her third year in office.
Nepal on Wednesday began the first phase of a nationwide vaccination campaign for health care workers and other frontline personnel, including cleaners, security guards, and ambulance and hearse drivers. Nepal is one of several countries in South and Southeast Asia to have received donated doses from India of Covishield, a vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. But the Covishield shipment to Nepal was for one million doses, and the government has not yet explained how it plans to execute its plan of vaccinating 72 percent of its 30 million people.

And my sense is that under normal circumstances, the White House almost reflexively defends laws put on the books by Congress.
As long as health insurance companies donate to politicians, we can't hope for a government that eliminates their profits. Without getting rid of for-profit health insurance, we cannot get the obscene expense of treating illness in this country down to manageable levels. In spite of Dr. Daw's optimism, we cannot transition from profitability to a system based on the values associated with compassion as long as health insurance companies continue to stand between us and the care we need to thrive.
And this goes to this question, can you force policy on the Republican Party, on a Republican base, that is not primarily worried about the things policy wonks worry about? Like I noticed at CPAC this year, the big conservative conference, its theme is uncanceled America. Right, and say what you will, about your ideas of cancel culture or not cancel culture. Its theme is not health care, the economy, coronavirus, climate change. Like all of these things where I could come up with a bunch of policy ideas, even from the right, to do something about them. It seems cancellation — there's a lot of Republican energy around the 1619 Project at The New York Times — is that where the energy is and what happens if the energy is on things that really don't have policy solutions?
And finally, a recommendation. And it may be a cliche, but greatness is good. [MUSIC PLAYING] This week, President Trump used a racist trope to criticize four women of color in Congress — Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, and Rashida Tlaib. Trump told them to, quote, go back and help fix the totally broken and crime-infested places from which they came. Then the president doubled down on the sentiment.
Your opponent was famously anti-abortion and against Obamacare. Was your victory an embrace of your progressive agenda, or is this a case of a kind of out-of-step Democrat just losing?
By joining together, the Labor Department said, employers may reduce administrative costs through economies of scale, strengthen their bargaining position to obtain more favorable deals, enhance their ability to self-insure and offer a wider array of insurance options.
In October, Senator Warren's campaign bought ads that read: Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election. The campaign was intended as a critique of Facebook's decision not to fact-check or remove political ads. (Updated) Facebook did not remove from the social network the ad falsely endorsing Mr. Trump.
As the chart below shows, lower income Americans of all ages and older ones in middle income brackets would receive materially less in government support under the Republican proposal than they are currently getting through Obamacare.
And I came here to talk with you all about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And the very short version of this story is I went around Washington talking to people about how, do not in this crisis, simply outlaw the practices that were bad, that were used on the mortgages, that are used on credit cards, because they'll be like fence posts on the prairie with nothing strong in between. And it'll take the banks and Wall Street about three minutes to figure out how to run around them by redescribing their product or slightly reinventing their product. I think you've got to have an agency that when Wall Street moves, the agency can move. That's how financial crises — it's the only way we're going to make this work.

In one fight over scarce vaccines, it's Britain versus the European Union. A patient receiving an injection of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine on Tuesday in Brighton, Britain. Credit... Ben Stansall/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images For months, wealthy countries have been clearing the world's shelves of coronavirus vaccines, leaving poorer nations with little hope of exiting the pandemic in 2021. But a fresh skirmish this week has pitted the rich against the rich — Britain versus the European Union — in the scramble for vials, opening an unabashedly nationalist competition that could poison relations and set back collective efforts to end the pandemic. The European Union, stung by its slow progress on vaccinations, threatened this week to tighten rules on the shipment of Belgian-made shots to Britain. British lawmakers, in turn, have accused their European counterparts of a blackmail campaign that could embitter relations for a generation. And poorer countries, already at the back of the line for vaccines, could face even longer waits if the intense squabbling among rich countries drives up prices for everyone else. At the core of the problem are production delays at separate factories in Belgium that make the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the one developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. With a new and more contagious coronavirus variant fueling a surge of cases in several European countries, those delays have undermined efforts to get shots into millions of people's arms, ratcheting up the global competition. But the manufacturing of vaccines is only part of the problem.

I mean, one way I think about it is it's almost certainly the case that there are real differences between boys and girls and men and women that extend beyond the ones that you can see. And yet it also seems to me likely that we've exaggerated how big those differences are. And, Farhad, I think that's part of your point, that, Ross, your point about there being real differences can be true, but it can also be the case that they're not nearly as big as we think.
There is, unfortunately, no evidence to support this political theory; in particular, the promised surge in young voters failed to materialize on Super Tuesday. So Sandersism is looking more than a bit like Green Lanternism — a belief that political miracles can be achieved by sheer force of will.

But as the Republican negotiators announced Wednesday evening that they had reached a tentative agreement — which the House approved early Thursday in a 239-171 vote — Democrats lashed out. They said the proposal was layered with numerous unrelated provisions that they would never accept, including an effort to restrict government financing of Planned Parenthood, the women's health organization.
There was not an audience —
With the tools we have today, he said, we can do much better.
I have usually agreed with that view and I think it was a very common one through the Trump presidency. But I do think one of the things that, probably the final year of the Trump presidency, some of what we saw on COVID then obviously what we saw during and after the election, I think, really calls it into question this idea that, well, people are just saying stuff. Donald Trump is just saying stuff. Republicans are just saying stuff and when push comes to shove they're not going to act. When what I think we've seen is that it is a totally plausible mechanism of how people cognitively work to say, yes people might embrace an idea only half seriously. They embrace it as a statement of identity and expression of group solidarity. But once you have cognitively put yourself there, then once you get pushed, it's not a far step to actually acting on that idea. Once you've opened yourself to it. So, which is to say, I think it has often been posited, there's some kind of tension between maybe half seriously embracing a somewhat ridiculous idea and then really believing it. But I actually think it's worth at least considering that that's more of a process that the fact that you don't need to take it too seriously to say yes to the pollster gets you in the door on something nutty. And once you're in the door then it's easier to actually become part of the party.
Yes. I do think that the Europeans need to bear a significant share of the cost of defense of Europe. I don't think that hectoring or embarrassing them is a way to get there. I think we get there by talking about the ways that work best for them on the ground, but I do think it's important. It's an important partnership, and it should be a partnership.
The analysis is part of a wide-ranging set of surveys initiated by the C.D.C. to estimate how far the virus has spread. It found, for instance, that in South Florida as of April 10, under 2 percent of people had been exposed to the virus. (The proportion is likely to be much higher now, given the surge of infections in the state.) The C.D.C. estimated that 117,400 people in that region had been infected — about 11 times the reported number of 10,500 cases.

Their recent conversations have become a critical quest to find common ground and measure whether they have moved beyond their policy disputes of the past 20 years. Mr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, is a political moderate, a former vice president and a deal-maker who believes in the bipartisan promise of Washington. Ms. Warren is a liberal from Massachusetts, a former Harvard Law School professor as likely to throw a bomb as to shake a hand in Congress, who has clashed with Mr. Biden on issues ranging from bankruptcy law to the future of Obamacare.
The first is that most Republican politicians aren't interested. They oppose almost any ambitious government policy, market-based or otherwise. Today's Republican Party is adamantly opposed to fighting climate change, expanding health insurance or to reducing income inequality.
when the D.N.C. made accumulating small donors a centerpiece to debate eligibility among two dozen potential candidates, that's when the unintended consequence kicked in. Small donors are often more motivated, more activist, more engaged, more ideological. In short, more leftist. They're less likely to send in five bucks to a candidate who says, I'm going to preserve Obamacare, maintain private insurance, and add a public option so anyone who wants to can join Medicare — even though that's where most Americans and most Democrats are.
The rule is clearly an end-run around the A.C.A., said the judge, John D. Bates, of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia.

As the proposal itself notes, millions of people might sign up for association plans, which could be made available to people who currently get insurance through a small business policy or buy it for themselves on the individual insurance market, as well as many people who currently lack health insurance.

This is a critical step forward, the first step toward bringing relief from this failed law, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said.
Here's what Mr. Trump said last week:
White House press aides did not immediately respond to a request for comment. And one official, who asked for anonymity to speak about the meetings, insisted that Mr. Mulvaney had simply been convening people with various views so that the president could make his own decision. But Mr. Mulvaney was described as leading the charge to back the suit, in an account of the two meetings that was described by a half-dozen people with knowledge of what took place.
Ms. Warren was likely referring to reporting by Sarah Kliff in The Times in November chronicling a rise in hospitals' suing patients over overdue bills.
Republicans are in a bind. They've been promising to repeal Obamacare for seven years, and having won control of the White House and Congress, they had to try to deliver. But while their bitter denunciations of the Affordable Care Act may have depressed its approval numbers, they didn't make replacing it any easier.
Finally there's immigration. Trump has made draconian border policies the centerpiece of his administration, at the cost of alienating much of the public. He is trapped in a bubble, unable to see the facts: that a large majority of Americans support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, oppose a wall along the southern border and disapprove of how the federal government has treated migrants attempting to cross into the United States. Most Americans, likewise, would allow refugees from Central American countries to continue to seek asylum.
What a wonderful segue to something I wanted to speak to you about. So I wrote a piece, it came out in Sunday Review a week or two ago now, that is all about this question of how do you reorient politics around a politics, as you put it, of what we do. And my argument, and this was framed in the structure of advice to the Democratic Party, was that they need to get rid of the filibuster, which makes it so they can't pass really any of their agenda through the Senate, or very little of it, anyway, and just begin legislating. Do things that help people fast. Try to put things out where people can see what you did and judge you based on what you did. My underlying argument here being that the filibuster plus the weird structural imbalances in our electoral system plus the system's other veto points, divided government, checks and balances, which are all supposed to be there and will continue to be there, it's created such a slow-moving form of government that symbolic politics can take over, quite often, because so little legislation happens outside the context of true emergencies, like right after, say, coronavirus hits or the financial crisis in 2008 and 2009. What do you think of that argument?
The other offers a continuation of the Tea Party's insistence on spending cuts and Obamacare repeal, and appropriately its present leader is a former Tea Party congressman — Mick Mulvaney, the Zelig of the administration, whose zeal is apparently the main reason that the Obamacare lawsuit now has administration support.

Pregnant women receive conflicting advice on vaccines. The world's leading health organizations are giving conflicting advice regarding vaccinations for pregnant women. Credit... Callaghan O'Hare/Reuters Pregnant women looking for guidance on Covid-19 vaccines are facing confusion of the sort that has dogged the pandemic from the start: The world's leading public health organizations — the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization — are offering contradictory advice. The C.D.C. 's advisory committee urged pregnant women to consult with their doctors before rolling up their sleeves — a decision applauded by several women's health organizations because it kept decision-making in the hands of the expecting mothers. But the W.H.O. is recommending that pregnant women not receive the vaccines, unless they are at high risk from Covid-19 because of work exposures or chronic conditions. It issued guidance on the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday, stirring uncertainty among women and doctors on social media. (Earlier this month, it had published similar guidance on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.) Several experts expressed dismay at the W.H.O. 's stance, saying the risks to pregnant women from Covid were far greater than any theoretical harm from the vaccines. There are no documented risks to the fetus, there's no theoretical risks, there's no risk in animal studies, from the vaccines, said Dr. Anne Lyerly, a bioethicist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

These programs tend to be more technocratic and complex than direct government programs. As a result, they also tend to be less popular with voters. Medicare is more popular than the Obamacare insurance exchanges. The basic idea of a Green New Deal — subsidizing clean energy — is more popular than a carbon tax. A higher minimum wage is more popular than an intricate series of tax credits for job retraining.
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled Monday that the federal government must live up to its promise to shield insurance companies from some of the risks they took in participating in the exchanges established by President Barack Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act.

Remember, Trump did not run for president as an orthodox conservative Republican. He embraced social programs and so-called entitlements, rejecting the party's boilerplate on government and the economy. I'm not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican, and I'm not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid, he said during the campaign. Elaborating on health care, he told CBS News that everybody's got to be covered, which he called an un-Republican thing to say. I am going to take care of everybody, he added. I don't care if it costs me votes or not.
Imagine if American health policy were established by the consensus of health economists. What would the system look like? A survey of nearly 200 Ph.D. health economists working in the United States provides some clues.
So I start with trying to understand the problem, what it means that tens of millions of people don't have prescriptions filled, don't go to the doctor. People with health insurance who are being sued by their hospitals for medical bills. I think of this as offering the most help to the greatest number of people as quickly as possible. So in terms of priorities, day one, there's a lot a president could do all by herself, and I'll do it.

The House vote would come after the Senate narrowly approved the same measure, a budget blueprint, early Thursday morning.

Maine Senator (and Congresswoman) Margaret Chase Smith, Ms. Collins' political foremother and idol, often broke ranks with her party — to defend, for instance, F.D.R.'s New Deal legislation from conservative attacks. On June 1, 1950, she became one of the first members of Congress to denounce the anti-Communist witch hunt of fellow Republican Senator Joe McCarthy. She began her Declaration of Conscience speech: I would like to speak briefly and simply about a serious national condition. It is a national feeling of fear and frustration that could result in national suicide and the end of everything that we Americans hold dear. She did not want to see the Republican Party ride to political victory on the Four Horsemen of Calumny — Fear, Ignorance, Bigotry and Smear.
A Medicare for All plan would in effect say to these people, We're going to take away your current plan, but trust us, the replacement will be better. And we're going to impose a bunch of new taxes to pay for all this, but trust us, it will be less than you and your employer currently pay in premiums.
In particular, there is a sense — a strictly limited sense, as I'll explain, but real nonetheless — in which the legislation, in addition to reviving the notion of government as the solution, not the problem, also ends the end of welfare as we know it.

Most of the arrangements remained a secret until Tuesday, when details first appeared in an account released by Michael Avenatti, the lawyer for Stephanie Clifford, the actress who was paid $130,000 to keep quiet about her alleged affair with Mr. Trump and is now suing to be released from the agreement. The New York Times confirmed many of Mr. Avenatti's disclosures through a review of financial records.

Such policies do not have to cover pre-existing conditions and can exclude common benefits like maternity care, mental health care or prescription drugs. The former administration also made it easier for small businesses to band together and offer plans that escape some of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Biden has asked federal agencies to re-examine these rules, which could take months to undo. Should the rules be overturned, patients who have such policies would be unable to renew them, which could leave them without insurance if they think coverage is too expensive. Mr. Biden campaigned on raising the subsidies for Obamacare plans to make them more affordable. Mr. Biden's executive actions on abortion put him in the center of the nation's long-running culture wars. Like his Democratic predecessors, Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, he will immediately rescind the global gag rule — often called the Mexico City Policy — which bars international nonprofit organizations that provide abortion counseling from using American tax dollars. The rule has been riding a philosophical seesaw for decades — in place when a Republican occupies the White House, and overturned when a Democrat moves in. Mr. Biden's revocation of the Mexico City Policy was part of an order that restored funding terminated by Mr. Trump to the United Nations Population Fund, known as UNFPA, the world's leading provider of family planning services, and a major resource for millions of women in more than 120 countries.
The Republican health care plan being considered by Congress will significantly increase the number of uninsured people, but save the federal government hundreds of billions of dollars, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office. Here are the key findings from the report.
One important aspect of health care that Jamie Daw does not mention is the education of medical providers. The cost of medical school in Germany is a tiny fraction of the cost in the United States. Medical schools can cost as much as $75,000 per year, or $300,000 in total, for tuition, fees and living expenses. During the additional four to eight years of internship, residency and fellowship, young doctors are barely paid enough to cover basic housing and living costs. Most are not only acquiring substantial debt but also forgoing about 10 years of earning and saving.

Honestly, I'm really content to let Michelle play the reactionary in this conversation and just sort of sit back and listen. But, no, Farhad, I wanted to just challenge you a little bit on what you said about your feeling of disappointment in your children's adoption of gender roles. We have three kids, and our oldest two kids are girls. They're eight and six. And until my son was born, we had a very female-oriented domestic space in the sense that most of the books and toys and clothes and everything else were girl clothes— not in sort of a hyper-gendered way but in a sort of stereotypically gendered way. And I tried to interest my girls in Wiffle ball and various things, and they tended to be more interested in fairy tales and dolls and so on. And then my son was born. And so his experience of his childhood was of femininity as a norm. I mean, I read to him the girl books that I read to my daughters. And to the extent that it's possible, I think he had, at the very least, a sort of gender-neutral entry into consciousness. And when he was about two and a half, one of my girls brought home a book about Blackbeard the pirate. And he, entirely unbidden, picked it up and immediately became obsessed with it to the point where he would wear a pirate hat to school every day.

That was the real grand bargain we needed. Instead, we had the 2008 economic meltdown, which set off more polarization, and way too much gridlock, given how much rethinking, reimagining and retooling we needed to do.

Get rid of immigrants, end trade with China or eliminate big banks and all will be fine. It's nonsense.

In fact, as Republicans moved closer to a vote, public support for Obamacare went up — 49 percent of those polled this month by the Kaiser Family Foundation had a favorable view of the law, up from 43 percent in December. Obamacare, though not without flaws, has done a world of good. The percentage of Americans who do not have health insurance has fallen to 9.1 percent, from 16.3 percent in 2010. A 2016 Kaiser study of people who gained insurance in California found that 77 percent of them said their health needs were being met very well or somewhat well. By comparison, only 49 percent of those people said their needs were being met three years earlier.

Who knows? I mean, we are so vague right now. I think when Bernie Sanders says Medicare for all, we know what he means because he talked about it in 2016 and he has a legislative proposal. I think with a lot of these other candidates, they are kind of latching onto a brand name that seems to be pretty popular with the public, that reminds them of Medicare, which a lot of people like. But we're not in the phase of the campaign yet where we have really specific proposals that tell us exactly what it is that they want to do.

Last April, it announced that in the face of mounting losses from individual policies sold in public exchanges under Obamacare, it would radically cut its participation in those markets. It disclosed in its annual report in January that in 2017 the company will participate in individual public exchanges in three states, a reduction from 34 states in 2016. It also said that it would shed more than $4 billion in revenue from them, in an effort to cut its losses.

Some lobbyists have tacitly accepted the likelihood that major provisions of the health law will be repealed, setting their sights instead on shaping its replacement. They fear that if they come out strongly in opposition to repealing the law, they will lose their seats at the table as congressional Republicans and the Trump administration negotiate a replacement.
Tariffs are one of the tools.

There are lots of ways to do this, but we can't simply think of this as a tariff, no tariff protectionism barrier. It's not. It's about regulations. Look at the dang NAFTA 2.0, look at what we were negotiating for T.T.I.P. T.T.I.P. was about financial regulations, not about goods that were moving, in a sense, the old way that people think about, that you put a bunch of stuff on a barge and you ship it across the Atlantic Ocean. And we just need to tune into the fact we know what our advantage is and we need to use it, not to try to lock others out, but to try to encourage others to come in.

People understand this is good for our economy. It's good for our worldwide security. If you're not willing to get out there and fight, nothing is going to change. And yeah, the fights have to be realistic. It's why I start everything with, Here's how I'm going to pay for it. You may not like how I did, but at least I laid it out there. You don't have any doubt, and I show you where every single nickel comes from because I want it to be realistic. I didn't start with free college. I started with a 2-cent wealth tax, because we can do a 2-cent wealth tax. I started with it and said, and here's how much revenue it produces. It produces a staggering amount of revenue, far more than raising income taxes, because that's what the wealth curve looks like.
And I think right now, the push should be not to expand because that's the issue that's on the table.
President Trump officially started his 2020 re-election campaign Tuesday night in Orlando, Fla. If the kickoff rally was any indication, Season 2 of this political reality show promises to be largely a rehash of Season 1 — except darker, whinier and even more divisive.
Unleashing free-market competition meant that many of us could not even get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions. When we were able to get it, premiums went up each year so that after a few years we'd be forced to start shopping for a new plan, usually with ridiculously high deductibles.
The degree of disruption these policies will cause remains unclear. But they are likely to work together. The individual mandate is believed to have pushed some healthy, reluctant shoppers to buy insurance, and they may no longer feel the nudge when it goes away.
The answer is not George M. Cohan, who wrote the ecstatically patriotic verses of The Yankee Doodle Boy for the 1904 musical Little Johnny Jones. He lifted the feather-and-cap lines from a song called, simply, Yankee Doodle, which was popularized by British troops during the Revolutionary War. And whoever composed these words — history is inconclusive — didn't intend a jesting, surreal tribute to the colonists. Quite the opposite. The song is an insult.
This country will pass a Medicare for all single-payer health care system. [CROWD CHEERING]
And he explained his own opposition to decriminalizing illegal border crossings, a view that contrasts with several of his more liberal opponents.
Kathleen Kingsbury: So we don't have very much time together. We all know your résumé and your bio, and many of us have met you in the past, so you don't mind if we just jump right into questions?
Alex Kingsbury: The Trump administration has made an effort to get Europeans to pay more for their own defense as being part of NATO. Is that a goal that you support even if you don't support the way he's going about it? And how might you achieve those goals?
CW: Andrew Yang said in one of the debates that you're applying a 20th-century framework to antitrust when it comes to Big Tech. Why is he wrong on that, and what makes your proposal to break up Big Tech adequate for the unprecedented profits of Silicon Valley?
Trump had a chance to apologize profusely and emotionally for his sex assault talk, and he didn't. I think that was a mistake. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
This is a profound enough point worth dwelling on for a moment. When a division exists inside a party, it gets addressed through suppression or compromise. Parties don't want to fight among themselves. But when a division exists between the parties, it gets addressed through conflict. Without the restraint of party unity, political disagreements escalate. An example here is health care: Democrats and Republicans spend billions of dollars in election ads emphasizing their disagreements on health care, because the debate motivates their supporters and, they hope, turns the public against their opponents. The upside of this is that important issues get aired and sometimes even resolved. The downside is that the divisions around them become deeper and angrier.
A majority of the American electorate — liberals, moderates and even some conservatives — want a greater government role in health care, a higher minimum wage, higher taxes on the rich and less punitive border policies. If Trump isn't going to move to the center, then their only choice should be the party that, no matter its nominee, backs each item on that list.
And he actually got a fair amount of Dodd-Frank. And — that he did, but ——
Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan opened her annual State of the State speech on Wednesday by pleading with lawmakers to find common ground in fighting the staggering effects of the coronavirus pandemic in the state. Based on the political environment this past year, you might think Republicans and Democrats in Lansing can't find common ground on much of anything, said Ms. Whitmer, a Democrat. She noted times when there had been bipartisan action in the Capitol. Let's tap into that same energy and end the pandemic, revitalize our economy and get our kids back in school. But Republicans were having none of it. Hours before Ms. Whitmer gave her speech, Republicans in the State Senate refused to approve 13 appointments she had proposed for slots in state government, such as the leader of the Children's Ombudsman Office, the Civil Rights Commission and members of agriculture boards. Republicans said they had rejected the appointments because Ms. Whitmer was not including them enough in decision-making surrounding restrictions on businesses to stop the spread of Covid-19. She has continued to circumvent the Legislature, said State Senator Aric Nesbitt, a Republican from Lawton. I understand it's not easy to compromise and try to work with 148 members of this Legislature. We have to use every tool available to compromise, and one of those tools is to not support her appointments.
LONDON — In a series of leaked diplomatic cables, Britain's ambassador to the United States, Kim Darroch, described President Trump as radiating insecurity and his administration as diplomatically clumsy and inept, a withering assessment that threatened to damage bilateral relations at a delicate moment for Britain.
Senator Warren said in March that she hopes to pass a constitutional amendment to protect every American's right to vote. She added, Every vote matters, and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.
And so when somebody — when I was first thinking about running for president, somebody said to me, Primaries are hard. You've never been in one and they're hard, because the people you think are going to be your friends turn out not to be your friends. And ——
So this would be an enormously expensive proposal. It is not necessarily expensive compared to all the ways that Americans pay for health care now. So right now, your employer, if you get employer based insurance, they pay something towards your insurance premium, you pay something towards your insurance premium. When you go to the hospital, maybe you pay a deductible. There are kind of all of these different pots that your health care dollars come from. What the Medicare for All plan would do is it would say, no one's going to pay into any of those streams — the federal government is going to pay for all the medical bills, but in order to pay that, they have to collect way more money in taxes. So various estimates say it would cost more than $30 trillion to administer something like the Sanders plan. That is a lot of money. And that is so much money that you can't just raise it by taxing the rich. You would really have to have very broad-based taxes that would reach across the income spectrum.
Senator Warren published an op-ed in The Washington Post in 2015 attacking the investor-state dispute settlement clause in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which she argued would tilt the playing field in the United States further in favor of big multinational corporations.
As House leaders struggled to negotiate with holdouts in the hopes of rescheduling the vote, Mr. Trump sent senior officials to the Capitol with a blunt message: He would agree to no additional changes, and Republicans must either support the bill or resign themselves to leaving President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement in place.
His plan is cheap because it has a high deductible — $6,900 a year. Worse, if his unemployment benefits expire before he finds a new job, and his income drops below the poverty line, he will lose his premium subsidies and will no longer be able to afford the plan. But because of a quirk in the law, he would not be eligible for Medicaid in that situation, because North Carolina has not expanded the program to cover many low-income men.
The goal of halting the spread of H.I.V. by 2030 is realistic and achievable if we increase testing, treatment and prevention, Mr. Schmid said.

He's misjudging Putin. I don't think he was prepared as well as he should have been.
But after weeks of loud protests, boisterous town hall meetings and scores of quieter meetings between members of Congress and health care professionals, patients, caregivers and hospital managers in their districts, it is becoming increasingly likely that a consensus in the House will be just as hard to reach.

So let's spend at least a couple minutes on health care. There is a lawsuit that the Trump administration is supporting that says that Obamacare should just be invalidated. Conservative legal scholars, including ones who supported past challenges to Obamacare, have called the case absurd and shocking. And yet a Republican-appointed trial judge ruled with the Trump administration. I mean, I just find this really alarming.
LONDON — In a series of leaked diplomatic cables, Britain's ambassador to the United States, Kim Darroch, described President Trump as radiating insecurity and his administration as diplomatically clumsy and inept, a withering assessment that threatened to damage bilateral relations at a delicate moment for Britain.
O.K.? And I have seen the billionaire go on TV and cry about it.
Relax. Everything political is interesting right now.
Instead of wringing our hands about his tweets, let's start playing up his triumphs. That is the best way to minimize midterm damage. Democrats lost over 1,000 seats nationwide under Mr. Obama. While effective in engineering his own political fate, he gutted the hopes of Democrats for a decade. Republicans have to learn to do what Democrats failed to do: run campaigns as the governing party.
A nationwide poll conducted by SurveyMonkey for The New York Times found that six in 10 Americans support a wealth tax. The slice of the electorate least likely to support it is Republican men with college degrees.
We had a fire, and the fire there was millions of people who lost their homes, but the fire by itself doesn't get it done. The fire by itself wasn't enough. You had to be ready with the big structural change and had to have somebody from the inside who would fight for it.
Well, it's not good for them and in a dozen different ways. Wages are part of it, but they are only part of it. It's about unsafe working conditions, for example. If you can hire somebody for cash and not meet current labor standards on safety, that someone needs a safety belt or needs training to go up high on a building, you not only put that person at risk, you reward employers who continue not to follow the law and to undermine safety standards for everyone.
This country will pass a Medicare for all single-payer health care system. [CROWD CHEERING]
It is hard, at least for me, to do justice to how sinister, in a way that sort of builds slowly, but she is such a monster. She does it not in a scenery-chewing way but in this very subtle, incisive way. I don't know. I'm very much looking forward to the final episode in which they've contrived to put her on trial as a mother. I think there's such a hunger at this point to see her unmasked. It'll be interesting to see if the show can give the people what they want.
Look for marijuana to take another big step into the American mainstream. Voters in five states — California, Nevada, Arizona, Maine and Massachusetts — will decide whether to make recreational marijuana legal; if they all pass, that means that recreational marijuana will be legal in nine states. And four other states — Montana, North Dakota, Arkansas and Florida — will decide whether to legalize the use of medical marijuana.
Some of the Democratic candidates have been more forthright in their criticism of Hunter Biden's role at the Ukrainian gas concern; others have been cagier. Senator Cory Booker, when asked about the controversy, said I just don't think children of vice presidents, presidents, during the administration should be out there doing that. Senator Warren, on the other hand, has said: I don't know. I mean I'd have to go back and look at the details.
Well, I would take the combat troops out of there now. I see no immediate reason we'd send combat troops into the region, but I'd get the combat troops that are there now out.
MC: I think we can agree that there are huge problems here. But to Katie's point, and then I'm going to throw it to Jesse. You have to be careful to balance the big promises with the over-promising, because then you risk the disillusionment, which I think we saw during the Obama administration. And back to kind of Katie's question about how you pay for a lot of these things. I mean comprehensive immigration for one, you can't do that through budget reconciliation.
He also moved to reinstitute coverage mandates that former President Donald Trump had undermined, including those for people with certain medical conditions. And he rolled back Trump-era restrictions on Medicaid and took steps to restore federal support to clinics that counsel patients on abortion.
The list is light on legislative achievements. Mr. Trump, who did not take the time to learn the levers of power, did not consistently engage with congressional leaders, beyond basking in their support or making last-minute demands to increase funding for his wall by threatening to scuttle big budget deals.
One thing that really drives a lot of my thinking about how politics should work is that there is a question of how the public is supposed to hold leaders accountable and then how politics is supposed to change over time, right? How do people change their views? Why would you maybe move from one party to the other? What would make politics fluid, such it would have accountability? And you've read my book on this, Why We're Polarized, and you know I think that we're pretty locked in place for a bunch of different reasons. So in many ways, I'm, I think, quite on the pessimistic side of this argument. But when you talk about the narrow majorities, one thing that, I think, keeps those narrow majorities in place is that there is very little reason, over time, to change your opinion, unless you are a political junkie, right? So if you're reading everything and you're checking in on everything Marco Rubio and Josh Hawley and Elizabeth Warren and so on are doing, then you've got a lot of information about what people on different sides think, and you can see where you fall. But most people aren't like that. Most people are pretty disengaged. Politics is unpleasant. People don't like conflict. They've got other stuff going on in their lives. It is not a crazy thing to not want to be following every twist and turn of Congress.
— it becomes clear that the coronavirus global health pandemic has really upended the race completely.
The stimulus package also subsidizes private health insurance premiums for newly unemployed workers. They typically have the opportunity to purchase their former employers' health benefits through a federal program called COBRA, which can often be prohibitively expensive because the employer is no longer paying a share of the worker's premium.
The past week's images from Australia have been nightmarish: walls of flame, blood-red skies, residents huddled on beaches as they try to escape the inferno. The bush fires have been so intense that they have generated fire tornadoes powerful enough to flip over heavy trucks.
Two Republican governors, John Kasich of Ohio and Rick Snyder of Michigan, have said that Congress ought to preserve parts of the law, like its expansion of Medicaid, which has improved care for the poor and reduced the heavy burden of charity care at hospitals. About 665,000 people in Ohio and 614,000 in Michigan gained coverage under Medicaid expansion as of December 2015, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Consistent with whatever is revealed. You can't do speed independently of facts, right? But if that's what we've got and it's enough information for a charge of impeachment, then I think they can go forward and I think they should.
March 4, 2020, 1:21 a.m. ET March 4, 2020, 1:21 a.m. ET Gina Ortiz Jones, Wendy Davis and Pete Sessions win primaries in Texas. Three familiar faces in Texas politics have gotten closer to securing representation in the House as part of the Texas delegation. Wendy Davis, who lost a high-profile governor's race in 2014, won the Democratic primary in the 21st District, where she will face Representative Chip Roy, a freshman G.O.P. incumbent. Along the border, Gina Ortiz Jones clinched the nomination to run for Texas' 23rd Congressional District, which is open. In 2018, she lost to Representative Will Hurd, the retiring incumbent, by less than 2,000 votes. Both women are part of the Red to Blue program run by the House Democratic campaign arm, which singles out candidates that the organization feels has some of the strongest chances of flipping districts in favor of the Democratic Party. For the Republicans, Pete Sessions, who was defeated in 2018 by Colin Allred, is now vying to return to Congress in a different district. On Wednesday night, he secured a spot in the runoff in the race to replace Representative Bill Flores, the retiring incumbent, who tapped another candidate as his chosen successor. Read more
No, I think it's right, and I think I took a similar approach to McConnell in my book, the chapter on this episode — I call it The Uniter — because what McConnell was essentially doing was uniting the two wings of his party. The judges was the one issue where the establishment wing of the Republican Party could reliably unite with the Tea Party base. And he had that insight. And it ended up being the glue that held those two sides together and led a lot of establishment Republicans to hold their nose and vote for Trump and potentially provide the margin of victory. In his book, Carl Hulse, The New York Times correspondent, argues that this was the decisive factor potentially. So no, I think it's absolutely correct. What's important to remember is that Republicans controlled the Senate Majority at the time. So one way to think about this is, what would we do as liberals if Chuck Schumer had been Majority Leader, and Donald Trump had nominated a Supreme Court justice? You can just imagine how the resistance base would have freaked out and told Schumer not to bring up Trump's Supreme Court nominee. So, expecting McConnell to have done differently is, in some ways, expecting him to defy the structural incentives that he's operating under.
This was locker room talk. I'm not proud of it. –Trump, denying that he talked about sexual assault, and minimizing it — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans, who for seven years have promised a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, took a major step on Thursday toward that goal, unveiling a bill to make deep cuts in Medicaid and end the law's mandate that most Americans have health insurance.
KK: But does it drive down wages for American workers?
The provisions challenged in Citizens United and the earlier cases all dealt with the question, What makes an ad an election ad? Before 2002, the principle was that it had to have magic words like vote for. McCain-Feingold tried to establish that broadcast ads that mentioned a candidate 30 days before a primary or 60 days before an election would be considered campaign ads (electioneering communication). That's what brought Citizens United, the organization, and its movie attacking Hillary Clinton, to the attention of the Federal Election Commission in 2008.
Strangely enough, in a year that yielded one blaring headline after the next, there is no single headline to encompass what we have just lived through. Instead, there are notes, sent late, and there are vivid photographs. Make of them what you will, for 2020 — the same shorthand for clear vision — had, at once, the sheer weight of history and the intimacy that reminds us of what it means to be alive.
But it seems like your case is not only about people who don't consider themselves gender binary. It's also for someone who says, I am a woman, or I am a man. You don't think it's necessary to have that part of their identity be front and center in a conversation constantly. Right?
And people across the state are starting to say, well, if we can't leave our houses, how are we supposed to vote?
But a second maneuver, an accounting one, helped its standing in financial markets immensely, said Sheryl Skolnick, director of United States equity research for Mizuho Securities. In November 2015, UnitedHealth made an adjustment on its balance sheet, setting aside an initial premium deficiency reserve of $200 million for expected losses in those marketplaces.
Here is another opportunity to claim the middle. The president could abandon his harsh immigration policies and adopt the measured, more humane approach favored by most of the public.
In June, Senator Warren released a plan focused on voter disenfranchisement and election security. The plan proposes, among other measures, improved voting equipment across the country and bans on voter purges.
Well, I think that's certainly true in part, but there's been another force, which I think has been a stronger force in driving these changes, which has come more from the left than from the right, it seems to me, which is a rising generation of employees in white-collar America, certainly in the media and cultural institutions, but also in corporate America, that I think, in some ways, because of the culture of the university, enter the world of work expecting their workplace to stand for what they stand for and expecting a company that's not in the business of anything political to express political views, to stand for a kind of political identity when things happen in the country that speaks to their core concerns. Often, these are well-motivated concerns about race, about justice, about other things. Sometimes, they're more radical social views. But whatever they are, you find young workers pressing companies to become more political and to do so on the left. And I think these CEOs, which I'm sure some of them would love to identify with Mitt Romney, I think most of them would love to just not be in the business of politics. Michael Jordan's old line that got him in so much trouble, that he doesn't talk about politics because Republicans buy sneakers, too, that's the logic of a lot of corporate America at the end of the day. And they just don't want to be in these fights.
Astead, why is it that Wisconsin has so quickly erupted into a really nasty partisan battle over something as seemingly basic as making sure people can vote safely in a primary election? I mean, that would seem to be in everyone's bipartisan interest to protect life, right? I mean, Democrats and Republicans will be casting ballots.
As many as 11 million Americans could find coverage under this proposal, the Labor Department said in issuing the proposed rules, which carry out an executive order signed by President Trump on Oct. 12. The public will have 60 days to comment on the proposal before the Trump administration adopts final rules with the force of law.
Among the increasingly concerned lawmakers are those who represent the 24 Republican congressional districts that Hillary Clinton won in the presidential election — roughly the edge Republicans hold over Democrats in the House — and another dozen in districts that President Barack Obama took in 2012 but President Trump won in November. If 25 conservative hard-liners oppose any robust replacement plan, and 30 swing-district House members demand a more generous plan, passage of a compromise bill will be in jeopardy.
THE CRITICISM As evidence that the Affordable Care Act marketplaces are failing, Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, points to some of the higher premium increases in 2017, as reported by the Obama administration: 58 percent in Alabama, 116 percent in Arizona, 69 percent in Oklahoma, 53 percent in Pennsylvania and 63 percent in Tennessee.

And as he often does, Mr. Biden expressed confidence that if he is the presidential nominee, he would help Democrats who are running in a wide range of competitive contests. He noted his efforts to do just that by campaigning in districts and states across the country in 2018, when his party recaptured the House of Representatives.

Poor, older adults would face the largest crunch: The magnitude of their tax credits shrinks, even as a separate provision in the bill allows insurers to charge older people substantially higher prices than are allowed under the Affordable Care Act.
A 2-cent wealth tax, and now let's talk about what kind of change we could make. Two cents, and we can do universal child care. We can put $800 billion into our public schools. We can make a federal commitment for the first time in history to public education K-12, and we can do the same thing for college, and we can cancel student loan debt, and an enormous boost to our economy.

And they both released these statements that were by the standards of these things, and you can always change your mind, you know, pretty hardcore. Sinema said she would not change her mind on the filibuster, on getting rid of it, under any circumstances. Joe Manchin went on Fox News — on Fox News — to tell people and then reiterated it to Mitch McConnell that he would never be the vote to get rid of the filibuster. They didn't leave themselves a lot of wiggle room. And so, as somebody who worked in the Senate — Sinema came after you left, but Manchin was there when you were there — what do you think was going on in their psychology or in their understanding of the political interests or needs at that moment?

When I was a girl, you had a better than 50/50 chance of doing better than your parents. Today, that seems to be slipping under a 1-in-10 chance. Opportunity is shifting away from not just the poor kids. It's shifting away from everybody who's not born into the top. And sure, a few people roll the dice and make it big and we should celebrate that, but it's like this fundamental question of who we're going to be as a country. And yeah, I do fight for a lot of things. I fight for a big vision, but if we don't start there, if we start by compromising, if we start by saying, Hey, everybody line up. We're going to knock 2 cents off your student loan debt, who's showing up for that?

In particular, Warren's latest proposal on child care – and the instant pushback from the usual suspects – has me thinking that we could use a rough typology of spending proposals, classified by how they might be paid for. Specifically, let me suggest that there are three broad categories of progressive expenditure: investment, benefits enhancement, and major system overhaul, which need to be thought about differently from a fiscal point of view.
He's obsessed with the weaponry of pirates, the pistols, the daggers, the swords. You know, this is just one example, but I think it's a familiar example to a lot of parents, that I don't think that my son was born into some sort of cultural prison of gender. I think that maleness and femaleness are biological realities that have strong cultural expressions that can vary from person to person. But I don't see how, looking at my son, it would help him, remotely, for me to be disappointed in his obsession with piracy, and now his obsession with knights, and his desire to wave swords, and all the rest. I think it's much healthier for me to concede the obvious and say, maleness is real. And what we want is to find a healthy and morally upright expression of maleness so that he thinks about himself as a man in ways that are protective and chivalrous rather than toxic and aggressive. And I think that's a cultural construct, but it's a cultural construct placed on top of a biological reality and a fundamental difference that, as Michelle says, persists in different forms in just about every human society. So I'm just curious: Why do you feel like your children are imprisoned rather than feeling like they're just finding cultural expressions for who they actually are?
A 2017 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that generic competition has weakened in recent decades, leading to higher prices for generics. EpiPen and insulin prices, in particular, have skyrocketed. Senator Warren's Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would authorize the government to manufacture active ingredients for medications or contract outside entities to manufacture generic drugs and lower prices. But Senator McConnell has railed against socialist price controls in the health care system.
The second and more significant factor is what Begala described as the unintended consequences of the obsession with small donors. Democrats legitimately want to break the stranglehold of big money, Begala wrote, but
And less than a minute later —
Health insurance is supposed to provide access to health care, but it is also a financial product, intended to protect people from catastrophic bills if they are sick or injured. It is still early to measure the health law's full impact, but several studies have found that low-income Americans have become less vulnerable to health-related financial shocks. Studies have found that fewer people struggled with medical bills or avoided medical care because of cost, and that medical debt and bills in collections have declined.
State and federal lawmakers are exploring ways to increase coverage and lower costs. For example, the Nevada Legislature passed a bill in June that would have allowed people who make too much money to qualify for Medicaid to buy into that program. The bill, which would have required a federal waiver, did not become law because Gov. Brian Sandoval, a Republican, vetoed it. But the idea has other backers. Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii said on Tuesday that he would introduce a bill that would explicitly allow states to let people buy into Medicaid.
And again, he really was stopped.
The exemplar remains the most powerful Montana Democrat in American history, Mike Mansfield. The longest-serving Senate majority leader, he quietly egged on his Republican counterpart, Everett Dirksen, to help pass the Great Society laws, including the Voting Rights Act of 1965 (back when, according to the 1960 census, the black population of Montana was 0.2 percent).
Part of the flip can be attributed to demographic changes in Southern California. But these largely suburban districts were also core to the suburban revolt against Mr. Trump that had begun as soon as he was elected, and brought in a wave of more moderate Democrats in states from California to New Jersey. Indeed, Representative Harley Rouda, who won in the 48th district, which is in Orange County, has endorsed Mr. Bloomberg.

Farhad, let's end here with some advice from you. I was talking about your column with my 15-year-old. And I was expressing some skepticism. I'm one of those grammarian prissies who feels anxious about the difference between the singular and the plural. And my 15-year-old said to me, yeah, but, Dad, language changes. And so for people who were intrigued by the argument that you're making, how would you encourage them to make the language they use in everyday life a little bit less gendered?
March 4, 2020, 1:15 a.m. ET March 4, 2020, 1:15 a.m. ET How the vote is shaping up in California. LOS ANGELES — California appeared poised to deliver a victory to Bernie Sanders Tuesday night, with Latinos and young people driving much of the support. With 415 pledged delegates, California is by far the biggest prize of Super Tuesday, and Mr. Sanders had been banking on a significant win there. Along with Mr. Sanders, both Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Michael R. Bloomberg seemed likely to receive delegates in the state, based on early returns. Mr. Bloomberg poured $66 million into television advertising there, far more than any other candidate. Mr. Sanders won more white and Asian-American voters but, reflecting a national trend, Mr. Biden won among black voters, according to exit polls. There was also a clear generational split, with Mr. Sanders winning decisively among voters under 49 but Mr. Biden winning handily with voters older than 50. Mr. Sanders appeared to win among voters at all education levels, according to exit polls. Read more

The largest group of people to be affected by the Republican plan would be those with Medicaid coverage. Most of the declines would start in 2020, when the changes to the program would take effect.
Mr. Trump's decision nearly four years ago was a shock to the UNFPA, which had counted on the United States, a founding member, as a critical source of funding. Overnight, the agency lost nearly $70 million. Dr. Natalia Kanem, the fund's executive director, welcomed Mr. Biden's order, which she said would greatly help the agency's work not only in family planning but in other health services to struggling women and girls in poor countries. We now have the support of a very important member state, Dr. Kanem said in a phone interview, expressing gratitude that the Biden administration had embraced her agency's work around the world. Mr. Biden is also directing the Department of Health and Human Services to take immediate action, his administration said, to consider whether to rescind the so-called domestic gag rule — a regulation imposed by the Trump administration that prohibits family planning clinics that receive federal funding from counseling patients about abortion. Such a change would likely require the department to write new regulations, a process that could take months. The president's Obamacare directive will also instruct federal agencies to review policies — including waivers that allowed states to impose work requirements — that discourage participation in Medicaid, the public health insurance program for the poor and disabled. Enrollment in Medicaid has grown substantially during the coronavirus pandemic, in part because people who have lost jobs and their health insurance have turned to Medicaid for coverage.

The 25-year-old Karlie Kloss publicly broke from the Trump clan when she tweeted a picture of herself voting for Hillary Clinton. Then she showed up at the women's march the day after the inauguration. Josh, 32, who thought about giving a TV interview about his differences with his brother but changed his mind, was spotted with her. But he also went to the White House on his own and Instagrammed a picture of himself with Jared, standing beneath the portrait of J.F.K.

Senator Warren has laid out an ambitious timeline that would put children and families under Medicare for all in her first 100 days through a congressional maneuver, then fully roll out her system by her third year in office.
O.K.? And I have seen the billionaire go on TV and cry about it.
At the White House, President Trump criticized congressional Republicans for inaction in an appearance with families that he said were harmed by the Affordable Care Act, above.
Well, look, I'm going to start. I don't want Mitch McConnell, obviously.
After months of ideological sparring, they seemed to have just one thing left to tell caucusgoers: If you want to beat President Trump, you had better pick me.
An expert on college affordability at the Urban Institute told The Times that Senator Warren's $50,000 debt clearance is too much. Setting the level at $10,000 instead would relieve debt for a third of all borrowers, according to their analysis.
But it's not clear that Mr. Trump cares. In his mind, this is not about helping constituents. It's about scoring political points and undoing Barack Obama's legacy. Let's hope that enough lawmakers do care about their constituents, and that they fight back.
The key political advantage is that performance standards focus voters on the end goal, rather than on the technocratic mechanism for achieving it. Carbon pricing puts attention on the mechanism, be it a dreaded tax or a byzantine cap-and-trade system. Mechanisms don't inspire people. Mechanisms are easy to caricature as big-government bureaucracy. Think about the debate over Obamacare: When the focus was on mechanisms — insurance mandates, insurance exchanges and the like — the law was not popular. When the focus shifted to basic principles — Do sick people deserve health insurance? — the law became much more so.

Mark Zuckerberg has held the line on Facebook's decision to allow political ads, even as Twitter banned them. The company's approach came under scrutiny after it said Mr. Trump's re-election campaign would be allowed to run an ad with false claims about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter. Mr. Zuckerberg said this is about free speech and not the profit motive.
Senator Warren, then a Harvard professor, first introduced the idea of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in a 2007 paper in the journal Democracy. President Obama assigned her to build the agency after the 2008 financial crisis.
The company cited an initial analysis of data about the type of customers who signed up for its plans this year, and it said that it saw no evidence that the market was improving but that it was seeing further signs of an unbalanced risk pool, as customers with expensive medical conditions continued to enroll as compared with healthy people.
When Senator Warren suggested that Vice President Biden is running in the wrong primary, he responded in a Medium post that called such attacks condescending to the millions of Democrats who have a different view.
Yeah, I do think that's true, and I'm sure it's a more complicated story than I can see and could get into. But I would say one important force that's played a role here, and you pointed to it, too, is the increasing capture of our core mainstream institutions by the left. The core institutions of American media, the Academy, culture are just explicitly and abjectly left-leaning institutions. That has meant that to resist the left is to resist these core institutions. And that, I think, has encouraged the kind of anti-institutional mindset that, in some ways, is always there. Populism is always anti-institutional, and there's always been a populist element of the right. But the American right, at its origins, was in the business of defending the institutions. Sometimes that meant defending the institutions from the people running them, which there's a certain irony to it, but it also made a certain amount of sense. Think about William F. Buckley's first book. He was just out of Yale, and he wrote a book called God and Man at Yale, which is basically an argument for saving the great universities from the professors. I think that when conservatives think about universities now, they're more inclined to say, to hell with them, and to think that there is no saving these institutions. We have to attack these institutions. Not everybody thinks this way, and there are people who try to resist these lines of thinking. I do, and I'm not alone.
Now, that's only for collective bargaining agreements, but that's real money in the pockets of those union numbers. Secondly, what at least some of the unions liked about this is the unions never have to bargain on this one again, once you get all the way to Medicare for all, because their workers will have health care coverage. Which means they can bargain once again over wages and working conditions and keeping jobs here in the United States instead of having to go back to their members year after year after year and say: We just bargained. Great for you. Your salary will go up one half of 1 percent, and your deductible will only go up by another $2,000.
End Citizens United, a group with more than four million members and half a million donors around the country, has voiced support for Senator Warren's proposed anti-corruption plans. The group has noted that both President Obama and President Trump won election in part by portraying themselves as tougher on opponents. Read more in The Times.
Thus, on Wednesday, the first message from the Irish president Michael D. Higgins to Biden contained a quotation from the poet John O'Donohue — Unfurl yourself into the grace of beginning.
I would even say that the American Rescue Plan compares favorably with the signature legislation of F.D.R.'s first 100 days, in that its $1.9 trillion price tag dwarfs the mere tens of billions (in inflation-adjusted dollars) spent by Congress during the earliest period of the New Deal. The challenge is very different — a Great Depression and its attendant unemployment and immiseration versus a health crisis and its economic impact — but the ambition is of similar scope.
One parallel Senator Warren has used in her plans for breaking up Facebook is the government's antitrust case against Microsoft in 1998, which Senator Richard Blumenthal and Tim Wu wrote in The Times made Microsoft a gentler giant.
The state would mail 3.3 million eligible voters a ballot, whether they requested it or not. And that represents a real change in how kind of the electoral process would work throughout the state.
Insurers are threatening to exit the Affordable Care Act's market unless the Trump administration and Congress can quickly clarify their intentions: Will they support the existing public marketplaces, encourage people to sign up and keep federal assistance flowing to insurers, or not?
But if your complaint is a labor complaint, that is, gee, here I am in America and I'm trying to compete against workers in a foreign country who are getting paid a dollar a day. What's your path? Well, first you've got to go to the U.S. government and persuade the U.S. government that they should go after this country, for which we know what has happened. U.S. government has repeatedly — and this is not just by — well, yeah, we get your point.
He was being one of the smart guys.

WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear a third major challenge to the Affordable Care Act, setting up likely arguments this fall in a case that could wipe out President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement.
Over several decades, it's become increasingly clear that how immigration debates are framed is important. One of the more subtle anti-immigration tactics — employed by the Trump, Kennedy and Johnson administrations, as well as some on the political left — is to suggest that reducing immigration could preserve more jobs for American workers and lead to higher wages, but economic research has consistently disputed the notion that limiting immigration would increase domestic employment or raise average wages. The prevailing view of economists is that immigration increases economic growth; while some workers might benefit from immigration restrictions, more would suffer.

Last week, the administration took several steps to deprive people of health insurance. In doing so, it has both a short-term goal (have the federal government do less to help vulnerable citizens) and a long-term goal (sabotage Obamacare, so that Congress can more easily repeal the law).
Tell me, are you really feeling more secure today?
Asked about the most important steps Mr. Biden could take to energize young progressive voters, Mr. Barkan replied that the presumptive nominee's biggest opportunity to excite young progressive voters is by selecting Elizabeth Warren to be his vice president.
The equivalent of a nuclear bomb fell on our country when the president said what he said this week, Representative Anna G. Eshoo, Democrat of California, said Wednesday as her House subcommittee began pushing through health care legislation. This is deadly serious.
Yeah. I think we need to bring our combat troops home.
In October, Senator Warren's campaign bought ads that read: Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election. The campaign was intended as a critique of Facebook's decision not to fact-check or remove political ads. (Updated) Facebook did not remove from the social network the ad falsely endorsing Mr. Trump.
China cancels Lunar New Year celebrations for millions of migrants. Hankou Station in Wuhan, China, last week. A year ago, the station was among the first places to be closed after the coronavirus outbreak. Credit... Roman Pilipey/EPA, via Shutterstock Every winter, Pang Qingguo, a fruit seller in northern China, makes the 800-mile trip to his ancestral home to celebrate the Lunar New Year, the biggest holiday of the year in China, with his family. The coronavirus ruined the festivities last year, stranding Mr. Pang in the northern city of Tangshan as many Chinese cities imposed lockdowns. Now, as China confronts a resurgence of the virus, the pandemic is set to spoil the holiday again, with the authorities announcing onerous quarantine and testing rules to dissuade migrant workers like Mr. Pang from traveling for the new year, which begins this year on Feb. 12. Mr. Pang, who describes his home in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang as the happiest place, is anguished by the rules. He has taken to social media in recent days to express frustration about his situation and post photographs of his 7-year-old daughter, whom he has not seen in more than a year. Society is so cruel, he wrote in one post. Many of China's roughly 300 million migrant workers face a similar reality as the government tries to avoid a surge in cases during what is typically the busiest travel season of the year.
One option that appears to have gained support among the public is a single-payer system, which proponents like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren call Medicare for All. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found in June that 53 percent of Americans favor such a system. This was up from 46 percent, according to an average of seven polls conducted in 2008 and 2009. But moving to a single-payer system from one dominated by employer-paid health coverage would be a big leap, and in any case the political climate is clearly not ready for it. Many Democratic voters as well as party leaders like Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer have been reluctant to embrace the idea, and, no surprise, most Republican voters and lawmakers oppose it.
A 2017 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that generic competition has weakened in recent decades, leading to higher prices for generics. EpiPen and insulin prices, in particular, have skyrocketed. Senator Warren's Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would authorize the government to manufacture active ingredients for medications or contract outside entities to manufacture generic drugs and lower prices. But Senator McConnell has railed against socialist price controls in the health care system.
KK: Throughout America, many jobs that were once held by American union members have been replaced and are now held by undocumented immigrants. Does that drive down wages in the United States?
I admit I have never quite understood the hatred Reagan had for Medicare, nor the hatred today's Republicans have for Obamacare (itself modeled on Romneycare, a Republican idea). Is it just that they cannot abide the idea that government sometimes — even if only as a last resort — does good things?
Who feels the Bern? [CROWD CHEERING] [MUSIC]
No. It's a process. This is an example.
And, in classic Trump fashion, he said: I've always won and I'm going to continue to win. And that's the way it is.
The idea of a single government health care system for all Americans has been treated with extreme caution by the Democratic leadership, which has stressed more modest improvements to the current health law. On Tuesday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office was pointing to the bills moving through the House Judiciary Committee that could lower the prices of prescription drugs.
Who brought this latest case and why?
Consistent with whatever is revealed. You can't do speed independently of facts, right? But if that's what we've got and it's enough information for a charge of impeachment, then I think they can go forward and I think they should.
But the Trump administration has joined the suit and a partisan Republican judge has indeed ruled that the A.C.A. as a whole should be struck down.
While President Trump promised insurance for everybody, the C.B.O. projects that if the Republican plan took effect today, 14 million more people would be uninsured next year, and by 2026, the number of uninsured would be about double what it is today.
Is American manufacturing in free fall, as Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump assert? Figures from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis show industrial output a tad below an all-time record level, while nearly double the output of the Reagan presidency, another supposed golden age. It's just that advancing technology allows more manufacturing with fewer workers — a change unrelated to foreign competition.
KK: So who would be your running mate?
You do see that in the debate you've had so far among policy wonks among, for example, my colleagues at the American Enterprise Institute, some of whom are for the Romney idea and some of whom are against it. Where there's an empirical question about, if you move from our current suite of policies to this policy, what effect does it have on people's incentive to work in various situations? And given this effect on people's incentives what effect would it actually have on work effort? Then there's this other question, which is, how much should we care about that? And particularly for social conservatives, if the question is not, should we scale back our participation in the paid labor force in order to spend more time on video games, but rather should we do that in order to spend more time raising children? Then we should look at it differently and we don't think of a reduction in labor, paid labor supply, as the end of the world or necessarily even a bad thing.
It means that during the time in which you possess political influence and power, you use it.
Tariffs are one of the tools. Economic agreements across countries, that many countries join together, and say, we're not going to let anyone import if they're using prison labor, for example, or if they're dumping dangerous chemicals into the water. There are lots of ways to do this, but we can't simply think of this as a tariff, no tariff protectionism barrier. It's not. It's about regulations. Look at the dang NAFTA 2.0, look at what we were negotiating for T.T.I.P. T.T.I.P. was about financial regulations, not about goods that were moving, in a sense, the old way that people think about, that you put a bunch of stuff on a barge and you ship it across the Atlantic Ocean. And we just need to tune into the fact we know what our advantage is and we need to use it, not to try to lock others out, but to try to encourage others to come in.
MG: The U.A.W. was not one of them.
I don't know individual employees there. What I know is the power of that place and how they're using it right now. Well —
It's one of the reasons that I pursued the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he said, bringing up the free-trade pact that, uniquely, has divided both parties, not because I'm not aware of all the failures of some past trade agreements and the disruptions to our economy that occurred as a consequence of globalization, but rather my assessment that most trends are irreversible given the nature of global supply chains, and so we better be out there shaping the rules in ways that allow for higher labor standards overseas, or try to export our environmental standards overseas so that we have more of a level playing field.
But the other half, let's say you have a complaint because the trade agreement had said that some other country would permit unionization or would not use low-wage workers beyond a certain point. Do you get a path like that? A quick resolution? And by the way, I should point out: That quick resolution? There's no appeal from it. It is immediately enforceable against a government. So you can go straight against Canada for raising its environmental standards. You can go straight against a South American country for raising its standards to protect its children's health from smoking.
In conversations with some unions, Senator Warren has dodged the question of how she would protect existing coverage. At a recent town hall with the Culinary Workers Union, for example, she said their health care is not supposed to change but sidestepped details.
Well, I would add he also got a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
Right. So I've identified pay-fors, and I lay out that if you want, you can get into it, and you've got a three-year period to be able to do it at a deeply subsidized price or at no price at all.
Health reform is the signature achievement of the Obama presidency. It was the biggest expansion of the social safety net since Medicare was established in the 1960s. It more or less achieves a goal — access to health insurance for all Americans — that progressives have been trying to reach for three generations. And it is already producing dramatic results, with the percentage of uninsured Americans falling to record lows.
Fifty years ago, Richard Nixon transformed this historic heartbeat of denial into an intoxicating political philosophy. His presidential candidacy appealed to George Wallace-type segregationists while also attracting Americans who refused to live near dangerous black residents, obstructed the desegregation of schools, resisted affirmative action policies, framed black mothers on welfare as undeserving, called the black family pathological and denigrated black culture — all those racists who refused to believe they were racist in 1968.
An expert on college affordability at the Urban Institute told The Times that Senator Warren's $50,000 debt clearance is too much. Setting the level at $10,000 instead would relieve debt for a third of all borrowers, according to their analysis.
Imagine how different our politics could be if even some Republicans — à la T.R. — occasionally took the side of the little guy against corporate behemoths. And even if you disagreed with McCain on as many issues as I did, imagine if the Republican Party ultimately came to resemble him more than Trump.
Own the center-left. Own the mainstream.
While President Obama himself didn't personally appear in court to defend the Affordable Care Act, the legal challenges hurled at the legislation demanded years of government and legal resources, not to mention public attention — so the legal dimension of the health care fight can't be discounted.
Minnesota has a few geographically large, Republican-leaning congressional districts in the northern part of the state. The northeastern Eighth Congressional District, for example, is served almost exclusively by the Duluth media market, and offers up five delegates.
His intent is to offer coverage not only to those who lost it during the pandemic, but also to those who did not have insurance and now want it, according to a senior administration official who previewed the new policy during a conference call Thursday morning. The so-called special enrollment period will run from Feb. 15 to May 15. The official said the reopening would be accompanied by the kind of robust patient outreach — including paid advertising, direct outreach to consumers and partnerships with community organizations and advocacy groups — that was abandoned by the Trump administration. Typically, Americans in the 36 states that rely on the federal marketplace can buy Obamacare insurance only during a six-week period in the fall, a restriction meant to encourage people to hold coverage even when they are healthy. The sign-up period for this year's coverage ended in mid-December, with enrollments only slightly higher than they were last year. But the Trump administration did little to advertise it. Once the coronavirus struck, Mr. Trump faced pressure to reopen enrollment for the millions of Americans losing their jobs, but he refused. Mr. Biden's actions take aim at a number of Mr. Trump's policies. In 2018, citing complaints about the price of Obamacare coverage, the Trump administration issued a rule that extended the length of less expensive short term policies from three months to up to three years.
The lawsuit quotes from the scripts being used by the brokers. What's the point of paying all that money every month if it's not going to cover the most important things, right??? the broker asks. This plan covers you from Day 1 …'
Re Don't Try to Fix Obamacare. Abolish It (Op-Ed, March 16):
Something I see your guests do on Finding Your Roots is framing their narratives as triumphant ones, and I'd say a similar form of exceptionalism shapes how a lot of Americans think of the country's past. In what way does our propensity for that kind of thinking inhibit our ability to fully reckon with subjects — like racism and slavery — that don't easily fit into a narrative of exceptionalism? Because that tension is obviously at the root of the conflict over, for example, the removal of Confederate monuments. I feel as if you and I are sitting here, we're having coffee, and we hear this noise, and these zombies come out of the floor, and the zombie is white supremacy. We thought these [expletive] were dead. I'm trying to use the popularity of Finding Your Roots to get these political messages in there without being a scold. I am trying to deconstruct notions of racial purity. There is no racial purity. We are all diverse. Showing diversity is important to me politically, and insofar as we can achieve that, our series has an educational value for the larger country, particularly at a time when we're at Redemption redux.
I like that distinction between critical and alternative institutions. I think that leads to this question of underrepresentation and where it comes from. So you were saying that there is a certain amount of reaction, as the right feels more of these institutions are captured by the left. And as somebody more on the left, one of the things that seems clear to me is that part of what is happening is that the right is losing some of these institutions as it becomes more right. If the past four years had been Mitt Romney's second term, I think there is a lot of corporate America that would have been very happy to be allied with Mitt Romney. It was Donald Trump they didn't like and who pushed them to make decisions and make statements and draw lines that they wouldn't otherwise have wanted to draw. I actually see this in the media, too. I don't there's any doubt that the media became more explicitly oppositional to the Donald-Trump-led Republican Party. But the Donald-Trump-led Republican Party, and specifically Donald Trump, pushed a lot of media organizations to places they did not want to go and were very uncomfortable going. I remember all of the debates among newspapers about when do you call something that the president keeps saying and is false a lie. When do you call something that is racist, racist? Because people didn't want to do that, but there was a real heightening of the contradictions.
After briefly trying to revive the push to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, President Trump agreed on Monday to put aside the idea until after the 2020 elections. Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, had told Trump firmly that Congress would not be willing to take up any such legislation before then.

At age 19, Senator Warren married her high school sweetheart, a computer engineer, Jim Warren. She gave up a full scholarship to George Washington University for the marriage, and they later split in part because he didn't support her career ambitions.
BS: What do you say about disenfranchisement? Forgive me for not knowing.
That was the real grand bargain we needed. Instead, we had the 2008 economic meltdown, which set off more polarization, and way too much gridlock, given how much rethinking, reimagining and retooling we needed to do. In this vortex a lot of the public got unmoored and disoriented, opening the way for populists with simple answers. Get rid of immigrants, end trade with China or eliminate big banks and all will be fine. It's nonsense.
This interview was conducted by the editorial board of The New York Times, which will announce its Democratic primary endorsement on Jan. 19.
Mr. Buttigieg said that a plan that offers Medicare for those who want it will be a natural glide path to the single payer environment. The quickest, fastest way to do it is build on Obamacare, to build on what we did. And secondly, to make sure that everyone does have an option. I feel very strongly that families ought to be able to have this choice. You can't eliminate private insurance for 180 million people, many who don't want to give it up.
WASHINGTON — President Biden's $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill will fulfill one of his central campaign promises, to fill the holes in the Affordable Care Act and make health insurance affordable for more than a million middle-class Americans who could not afford insurance under the original law.
But that it's a way in which you see the 60-vote threshold impeding bipartisanship. It seems plausible to me that there are bills out there that could get, let's call it 43 Democrats and nine Republicans, and in theory, pass, because that's a majority. But you can't pass a bill like that under a 60-vote threshold. So one of the very few actual glimmers of opportunity for bipartisanship here, a Republican comes up with a great bill, his own party is not going to let him pass that. And so Manchin and Sinema could work with Mitt Romney on this, but not in a filibuster world.
On June 4, an hour or so before Mr. Floyd's memorial service in Minneapolis, the former president called his brother, Philonise Floyd — a reprise of the calls he made to grieving families over his eight years in office.
I believe good transportation policy can play no less a role than making possible the American dream, Mr. Buttigieg said. But I also recognize that at their worst, misguided policies and missed opportunities in transportation can reinforce racial and economic inequality. Mr. Buttigieg's confirmation was described by a number of human rights groups as a symbolic moment for the L.G.B.T.Q. community. This confirmation breaks through a barrier that has existed for too long; where LGBTQ identity served as an impediment to nomination or confirmation at the highest level of government, Alphonso David, president of Human Rights Campaign, a group dedicated to advancing the interests of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, said in a statement. Let this important moment for our movement serve as a reminder to every L.G.B.T.Q. young person: you too can serve your country in any capacity you earn the qualifications to hold.
Major new programs are difficult to pass. The struggle to make them happen is almost always divisive. But if you fight that fight and win, then in addition to passing the program, you've also laid groundwork for future political victories. Despite being undermined by the Supreme Court, the Medicaid expansion has found a toehold in American politics, producing a powerful constituency for itself.
KK: But do you know of any specific evidence that immigrants drive down wages?
And I'm not saying that's a record of glory. Those filibusters were often aimed at civil rights bills — but fewer than one vote to break them each year. Since 2010, it has taken on average more than 80 votes each year to end filibusters — more than 80. This is not the Senate of the 20th century. Something completely different has happened. It has changed. It is not the Senate the founders wanted or built. It is the Senate they warned against. I reported on the Senate for a long time. And one of the fascinating things about talking to Republican and Democratic senators and Republican and Democratic staffers is nobody likes the place anymore. For all the people that work their whole lives to get there, they get there and they look around, and they're appalled. They may disagree on how to fix it and what is wrong, but they are appalled. Nobody thinks it works well. This is not a situation where it's only outside critics who recognize something is wrong. The most searing denunciations, they come from the insiders. They come from the staffers. They come from the members. One of those staffers is Adam Jentleson. He was deputy chief of staff to then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. He was high up enough in the institution to see how it really worked, but he was also young enough, new enough, to be free of the gauzy nostalgia for the days of yore.
Trump's overreliance on Kushner illustrates the extraordinary premium he places on loyalty. Kushner's status as a visionary is entirely disputable: His real-estate company was a birthright, not a start-up, and as an article by Charles Bagli in The Times this week demonstrated, one of Kushner's key acquisitions, the skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue, turned into an albatross. But he married Ivanka. He's family. And he chose the political ambitions of his father-in-law over his own previous reputation as a reasonably enlightened man.
But G.O.P. health care claims are special, in several ways. First, they're outright, clearly intentional lies — not dubious assertions or misstatements that could be attributed to ignorance or misunderstanding. Second, they're repetitive: Rather than making a wide variety of false claims, Republicans keep telling the same few lies, over and over. Third, they keep doing this even though the public long ago stopped believing anything they say on the subject.
So, I think that will be true. But let me argue it two ways. On the one hand, I think the generalized view among progressives correctly is that, Joe Biden, has shown himself in this iteration to be a much more progressive and ambitious president than anybody would have imagined, even two years ago, right? Not just 10 years ago, but two years ago. If you look at what's in the fiscal rescue bill, like that is a vast array of progressive parties, including, by the way $15 minimum wage. Even compared to where things were a couple of years ago, that's a pretty big victory for progressives. If you look at a lot of his appointments, particularly I would say his second tier appointments, have been very progressive. Huge, huge. We've talked a lot about the Romney child allowance, but the child allowance idea that Biden has in the bill and Senate Democrats are doing is as big or bigger, depending on how you want to think about it, than the Romney plan. So there's a lot in there and then that is supposed to be the first of a series of bills. The next one being a bigger reinvestment package in the economy. The question is how much of this can he do through Budget Reconciliation? And I mean, I've talked about this on the show before.

Further complicating the measure's prospects, insurance companies, which took a leading role in the health care fights of 1993-94 and 2009-10 but have been conspicuously quiet this year, released a blistering letter objecting to Republican plans to remake Medicaid and cut its funding.
Treatment for any injury incurred while the patient was intoxicated
This is an important space, I think. I think of you as an institutional thinker, and so I'd like to talk about this from the perspective of Republican Party institutions. And I don't just mean here the party structure itself and its primary rolls, but also mean allied media publications and ecosystems and interest groups. And there used to be this idea that Democrats fall in love and Republicans fall in line. And the idea was that it was a Democratic Party that was chaotic, that was unpredictable in who it would nominate, that was unpredictable in whether or not it would listen to its own governing or organizing institutions. It didn't have coherence because there's all these different groups coming together. And now, Democrats have become — not without exception, but in general — a much more predictable party. They tend to nominate the next in line — Joe Biden, and before Joe Biden, Hillary Clinton. And its Republicans where this anti-institutional force has, it seems to me, overwhelmed the institutions. When I look at the difference between the two parties, it is not that the Democratic coalition and the liberal base does not have conspiracy-minded people in it or people who take a very black-and-white view of the world. But the institutions are still quite moderating. The Democratic Party has some influence over its primaries, as we saw in the Democratic primary, when there was that rush of endorsements that ended up pushing Joe Biden over the edge.

It's a bird! It's a plane!
President Trump's lawyers and aides are scouring the backgrounds of investigators hired by the special counsel Robert Mueller, looking for conflicts of interest, people with knowledge of the effort said.
Democrats consider health care a winning issue, and they wanted the court to act quickly to keep the fate of the Affordable Care Act in the public eye during the presidential election. In the meantime, the law remains almost entirely intact but faces an uncertain future.
But more generally, a kind of frustration with the way that our institutions function and are led, and that points you to a political outlook that comes to be defined by frustration, a sense that people with power, people with privilege in American life routinely abuse that power for their own gain and advantage. They lie to the public. They look down on everybody else's way of life. And this is populism. There's a kind of left-wing populism. There's a kind of right-wing populism. It's always been an intensely powerful force in American political life.
To Needham, there was only one way to look at the matter. What's the point in having a conservative party if we're not going to fight a massive federal intervention in health care? he told me. It's one-sixth of our economy!
The thing I like about the president is that he has allowed me in that space. And after Kavanaugh, it's even been more.
If this were ever put into practice, there would have to be several new Pentagons built to house the hundreds of thousands of new social planners. The elite universities would have to be transformed into technocratic academies in which the children of the rich were trained so they could be dirigistes for the state.
That contrasts with how other tech chief executives have addressed crises at their firms.

Is it cultural power? Is it political information power? What does that really mean? Something like the process by which American politics came to get its arms around an industrializing economy at the end of the 19th century is going to be necessary for us to get our arms around the digital economy and the tech giants, and I think we're only at the very beginning of that process. It's reasonably clear that there's going to be interest in doing some of that on both the left and the right in different ways for different reasons, and I think that's good. It's necessary. It doesn't seem to me that a pure laissez-faire approach to this is going to work because the power involved is enormous power over, as you say, the public square. And there's no solution that I've seen that strikes me as a comfortable path forward, so far.
About 20 million people now have health insurance because of Obamacare, according to government estimates. But will they vote?
From the moment the result was announced, friends and supporters began texting Murkowski to urge her to run in the general election as a write-in candidate. Leadership told her not to do it, that she was going to jeopardize the seat and have a Democrat win, says Andrew Halcro, a former Republican state legislator and a friend who served with Murkowski. I think at that point, Lisa recognized, 'I don't have any friends.'  Murkowski decided to mount the write-in campaign.

The two rulings, one a rebuke to the Trump administration and the other a boon to Republicans, was consistent with Chief Justice Roberts's insistence that politics should play no role in judging. We don't work as Democrats or Republicans, he said in 2016.
We need to make sure that every American is able to get health care.
Yeah. It's just like, yeah, O.K. Nothing, from my point of view. If you know anything about me, it'd be odd for me not to do this.
Clinton says one thing she respects about Trump is his kids, and that they reflect well on him. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
The strange glitch exists because the law originally required all states to expand Medicaid, and thus did not set up a system of subsidies for the poorest Americans to buy private coverage. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that states could opt out of expanding Medicaid, but Congress, bitterly divided over the law, never fixed the glitch.
But a few questions caught her off guard: how to safeguard American nuclear weapons in Turkey; how to respond if China cracked down violently on protesters in Hong Kong; and what she was likely to fail at as president.

Mr. Obama has said that in a private meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia last fall, he confronted Mr. Putin about the hacking, and told him to cut it out, there were going to be serious consequences if he did not, but that he had been reluctant to say anything publicly that would be perceived as affecting the presidential election.
Senator Warren called for the House of Representatives to begin impeachment inquiry proceedings against Mr. Trump as early as April 2019.
But the real number in many parts of the United States is more than 10 times higher than the reported rate, according to data released Friday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The Kaiser Family Foundation's Health Care Tracking Poll has found a decline in public support for Medicare for all since the start of the year. Now roughly 51 percent of American adults are in favor of a single-payer system and 47 percent are opposed, whereas earlier this year 57 percent backed it and 37 percent were opposed.
KK: Throughout America, many jobs that were once held by American union members have been replaced and are now held by undocumented immigrants. Does that drive down wages in the United States?
I've spent 25 years as a journalist and have repeatedly seen the discomfort that journalists feel about proclaiming one political party to be more successful than the other on virtually any substantive issue. We journalists are much more comfortable holding up the imperfections of each and casting ourselves as the sophisticated skeptic.
Actually, I don't think of what I say that way. What I think of is the leadership possibilities that the candidates for president are offering. I don't know anybody who sits around and says, I want to make peace with corruption. I don't know where those people are in America who think it's O.K. that Amazon makes $11 billion and pays nothing in taxes. I haven't seen those people.

You knew immediately that when you started working there that you would get health insurance because this was a union hotel, Ms. Hernandez said. She knew what it was like to be a member of a union in Mexico, where she was part of the government workers' union.
There is some debate among Senate experts about exactly what sorts of insurance regulations will be allowed in a bill passed through the special budget procedure. Such bills, which cannot be filibustered and thus can pass with only 50 Senate votes (along with Vice President Mike Pence's tiebreaking vote), must adhere to the so-called Byrd rule.

We have to get this right. This is no ordinary time, no ordinary Republican Party, no ordinary incumbent, and it will require an extraordinary Democratic machine to triumph.
We take it on by deciding we're going to take it on. We pass it through Congress, and then we set it up for the states to be able to vote on it.
The possible costs of the Democratic candidates' commitment to decriminalization of border crossing are evident in a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll conducted July 15-17. It found that all voters oppose decriminalization by better than two to one, 66-27.
We can't afford to both treat his back issues and pay for insurance, she said one morning. She was crying, and it was time to go to work.
It is, of course, impossible to sum up a year — this one, more than most. It was grim and it was sobering and it was, at its heart, unbelievable. Any one of the major stories of the past 12 months would have riveted us. Any one of them felt like the story of a lifetime. The coronavirus pandemic. The killing of George Floyd and the protests and raw reckoning that followed. The wildfires that turned Western skies red with fury and razed whole towns. A deeply divisive presidential election and the bitter efforts to undo it.
Under a normal process, the case would take months, if not years, to reach the Supreme Court. But the Democratic states and the House, which intervened in the case to defend the health law, are asking the Supreme Court to review the Fifth Circuit's ruling immediately.
He's obsessed with the weaponry of pirates, the pistols, the daggers, the swords. You know, this is just one example, but I think it's a familiar example to a lot of parents, that I don't think that my son was born into some sort of cultural prison of gender. I think that maleness and femaleness are biological realities that have strong cultural expressions that can vary from person to person. But I don't see how, looking at my son, it would help him, remotely, for me to be disappointed in his obsession with piracy, and now his obsession with knights, and his desire to wave swords, and all the rest. I think it's much healthier for me to concede the obvious and say, maleness is real. And what we want is to find a healthy and morally upright expression of maleness so that he thinks about himself as a man in ways that are protective and chivalrous rather than toxic and aggressive. And I think that's a cultural construct, but it's a cultural construct placed on top of a biological reality and a fundamental difference that, as Michelle says, persists in different forms in just about every human society. So I'm just curious: Why do you feel like your children are imprisoned rather than feeling like they're just finding cultural expressions for who they actually are?
Trump's tax law, passed in 2017, reduced this fee on the uninsured to zero. In the current lawsuit, the plaintiffs have taken advantage of this change to argue that the mandate is now back to being a mandate rather than a tax — even if it's an irrelevant mandate, because ignoring it brings no penalty. As Cohn wrote, It doesn't take a fancypants law degree to see that the new scheme is, if anything, less intrusive than the old one — a point that the attorneys for California and the U.S. House [who were arguing against the Trump administration] made several times.
Not everyone shares the goal of expanded health coverage, and some of those newly insured bristle under an individual mandate to have insurance or pay a fine. Still, many of the newly insured could not have afforded insurance before the law passed or would have been shut out because of pre-existing health conditions.
But, Rhodes continued, the reality is more complicated than the Sanders claim that the party is dominated by corporate interests and is unresponsive to the demands of the working and middle classes.

But will any of these constituencies vote for Donald Trump? For Trump the rank misogynist, Trump the KKK-flirter, Trump the deport-the-Mexican-rapists candidate? If you read seven of Trump's positions to the median Hispanic voter, they might agree with five or six of them … but Trump's favorability/unfavorability ratings with Hispanics are 12/77. If you go back to last August, before the campaign began, Trump had a 20 percent favorable rating with African-Americans; by Republican standards that's not terrible. Six months of race-baiting later, he's winning 5 percent of the black vote against Hillary Clinton. And women … well, he's losing women, let's put it that way, on a scale that no Republican nominee ever has before.
And I came here to talk with you all about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And the very short version of this story is I went around Washington talking to people about how, do not in this crisis, simply outlaw the practices that were bad, that were used on the mortgages, that are used on credit cards, because they'll be like fence posts on the prairie with nothing strong in between. And it'll take the banks and Wall Street about three minutes to figure out how to run around them by redescribing their product or slightly reinventing their product. I think you've got to have an agency that when Wall Street moves, the agency can move. That's how financial crises — it's the only way we're going to make this work.

Mr. Klain suggested the grant had underwritten more safety measures. He also twice understated the size of the student settings in the schools, saying they were classes of about 11 or 12, and later, classrooms of 12 on average. What that study in Wisconsin from the C.D.C. showed, Mr. Klain said, was that 17 schools that got a sizable grant from a private foundation to put in the kinds of safety measures they needed — students in very small pods, classes of about 11 or 12, distanced, in a rural area — they could go to school safely. Asked by the CNN anchor, Erin Burnett, why teachers' unions were ignoring the scientific evidence in opposing reopening, Mr. Klain disagreed. I think what you're seeing is schools that haven't made the investments to keep the students safe, he said.
So let me explain what the plan is. The plan is the employer has to keep paying in as the employer does right now. The one exception to that is if you have a collective bargaining agreement, and the employer is paying in more than whatever is the standard minimal that employers are paying in. That difference goes to the workers in cash.
Howard Schultz of Starbucks fame told 60 Minutes on Sunday that he was seriously thinking about an independent bid for the presidency, and boy oh boy are liberals and progressives unhappy with the idea.

Hungary 's medicine authority has approved the coronavirus vaccine developed by the Chinese company Sinopharm. This means that in addition to Pfizer, Moderna, Sputnik and AstraZeneca, we can also count on Sinopharm, said Dr. Cecilia Muller, the country's chief medical officer. We trust that these vaccines will be readily available in large quantities and the immunization process will be completed in larger numbers in less time. The country's foreign minister later announced that it had purchased five million doses of the vaccine. Regarding the options, Prime Minister Viktor Orban expressed enthusiasm for the Chinese vaccine on Friday. I will wait for the Chinese vaccine, he said. I trust that one the most.

Senator Warren's plan on trade, released in July, would change American trade policy by pushing the country's trade partners to abide by higher labor and environmental standards. Under her plan, more representatives from labor, environmental and consumer groups would be involved in trade negotiations, and the process would be more transparent through public disclosure of draft agreements.
Ms. DiCola doesn't expect to need much health care this year — just a physical and a new pair of glasses, which Medicaid will cover, she said. Still, she added, You never know what could come up — my appendix could decide to burst tomorrow. In which case, Medicaid would cover the emergency room visit, surgery and hospital stay, a huge relief to Ms. DiCola, who became so anxious as Republicans in Congress tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act last summer that she felt physically ill.
Mr. Trump promoted the small-business health plans as a way to save people from the nightmare of Obamacare. He told small-business owners in June that you're going to save massive amounts of money and have much better health care.

Kate Losse, an early Facebook employee and Mr. Zuckerberg's former speechwriter, told the NYT: My guess is that what is giving Zuckerberg pause at this point is the question of how to acknowledge and explain this state of affairs while at the same time mitigating the concerns that will come from people finally understanding how this all worked.
What on earth makes Dr. Daw think that, with a snap of the fingers, this already existing market power will suddenly yield a better result? Private insurance companies add an extra layer of expense that is totally unnecessary. We can do better.
These tensions lasted well into the New Deal, the crowning years of America's enthusiasm for reform. New Dealers held on to progressive ideas while sloughing off some of the moralizing. Over time, though, their economic policies ushered in what the historian Alan Brinkley has described, in the title of a 1995 book, as The End of Reform. The New Deal, he wrote, grew from a complex tradition of progressive reform, then attached the word 'liberalism' to it, and set about transforming it. The new liberals ultimately pinned their hopes on economic growth and Keynesian tinkering, not the trickier task of actively redistributing wealth and power. Over the decades that followed, they would orient themselves increasingly toward civil and social rights rather than sweeping economic reform, a subtle but important shift.
An expert on college affordability at the Urban Institute told The Times that Senator Warren's $50,000 debt clearance is too much. Setting the level at $10,000 instead would relieve debt for a third of all borrowers, according to their analysis.
Trump's overreliance on Kushner illustrates the extraordinary premium he places on loyalty. Kushner's status as a visionary is entirely disputable: His real-estate company was a birthright, not a start-up, and as an article by Charles Bagli in The Times this week demonstrated, one of Kushner's key acquisitions, the skyscraper at 666 Fifth Avenue, turned into an albatross. But he married Ivanka. He's family. And he chose the political ambitions of his father-in-law over his own previous reputation as a reasonably enlightened man.
But let me finish my point. If you fight on ground where I think you've got lots of bipartisan support and you lead a damn fight — and then — just — if you can deliver a 2-cent wealth tax, which has wide popularity, when I get to sign the piece of paper that cancels student loan debt for 43 million Americans, that's Democrats and Republicans. I think at that moment, the world starts to shift. I think at that moment, a whole generation of people who have only seen the government as debt collector starts to shift. Will we get 100 percent of the folks on board? No. But will we get a lot more? Will we begin to talk about a democracy that doesn't just work increasingly for a thinner and thinner slice of the top, or will we start to talk about a democracy that works for all of us? That 2-cent wealth tax is about child care. It's about things that touch people's lives. It's about universal pre-K for 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds. It's about a $50 billion investment in historically black colleges and universities, tuition-free. Technical school, two-year college, four-year college. You just deliver on something that matters to people. Now they've got a stake in democracy. It feels like it pays off, that it's not just marching in the street over and over and over, and the next day you wake up and it's a little bit worse than it was today.
Instead, they're talking about freedom — which these days is the real refuge of scoundrels.
Projected cumulative change in deficit under the Republican plan
I know that as you sit here it looks like, wow, this woman wants to do a lot and it's hard. And the truth is, it is. I spent my whole life studying working families. Why they go broke, what's happening in America, why America's middle class is being hollowed out. Whole books written about this. And I watch every year two things as it gets worse and worse and worse. Not fire worse. That was 2008 and — everybody is ——
In practice, sending Roe v. Wade back to the states would claw back a constitutional freedom to abortion that all American women have had for over 40 years. There are at least 20 states poised to ban abortion immediately if the 1973 decision is overturned, and legislatures in Iowa, Mississippi and Louisiana have already passed strict anti-abortion laws that could trigger challenges to the decision.
Margot: But the president wasn't talking about little tweaks. I feel that he recommended at least two pretty substantial policy changes. The idea of offering more subsidies to buy health insurance has been talked about before, but certainly not by the Obama administration. His essay seems like a real acknowledgment that health insurance still isn't affordable enough for some people. We've talked before about hearing from higher-income people who still can't afford health insurance. Between premiums and deductibles, some people are spending more than 25 percent of their incomes on care, according to an Urban Institute report.
But on the other hand, we have other diplomatic initiatives and it's really important that we're trying to work with this country, and they're important to us strategically for this reason and we have this ongoing negotiation in that political thing. Drag your heels, drag your heels, drag your heels, until the jobs have disappeared here. And then once you go forward, you've got to go forward through a different kind of court that's much slower.
Mr. Trump is running for re-election this year, so his budget can be read as a policy blueprint for his second term if he wins. The budget leaves to the imagination just what that vision is. Unlike in previous years, when the health care budget laid out specific plans to repeal large sections of the Affordable Care Act and replace it, this year's proposal barely mentions President Barack Obama's signature health care law.
The number of people who have denounced Medicare for all as politically impractical continues to grow — the former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel called it a pipe dream in a recent Washington Post op-ed, in which he called on proponents to please explain to me exactly how we get that bill through the Senate?
And I don't think that's the right model.
If we're going to solve the issues of climate chaos, pass the torch. If we're going to solve the issue of student loan debt, pass the torch. If we're going to end gun violence for families who are fearful of sending their kids to school, pass the torch. We need a party that is diverse, but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interests who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country.
That's a nice one. I like that. So look, I think it's one of the things that, as a country, it's time for us to take it on.
If you are a giant multinational corporation and any regulation comes along that you don't like, the local country raises the minimum — we've actually seen this — raises its environmental standards, you get to sue them to get them to drop those standards. And who will your case be heard by? It'll be heard by a handful of corporate lawyers, who when they're not sitting on this arbitration panel are working for big law firms that are doing work for you or other multinational corporations like you. That's one set of how the path will run.
archived recording And just about an hour ago, the State Supreme Court issued its ruling, saying that indeed, the election will happen tomorrow.
The impulse to create a highly centralized superstate recurs throughout American history. There were people writing such grand master plans in the 1880s, the 1910s, the 1930s. They never work out. As Richard Weaver once put it, the problem with the next generation is that it hasn't read the minutes of the last meeting.
It's true that he would not be available to provide any advice or feedback to Mr. Trump. But, since Mr. Trump wouldn't listen to anyone except himself anyway, that would not be a significant drawback. And finally, his presence on the ticket could inspire alliteration in Mr. Trump's infantile rants, drawing in just enough educated voters to put him over the top.
For a time when the parties weren't that ideological, but as a story I tell in my book goes, the parties became ideological. Then they began using the rules differently. And now we're just caught in this mismatch era between a Senate that worked for the non-polarized parties of the 20th century, but simply doesn't work for the highly polarized parties of the 21st. And so, we all get our fainting couches every time a new norm is broken. But they're not doing anything weird. They're just acting exactly as you would expect them to act, given the ideological stakes of the era. Is that wrong in some important respect?

MC: And nobody does well at this question.
There are effectively three paths forward for the case. The Supreme Court could reject it, letting the lower courts continue their work. It could accept it, and grant the litigants' request for expedited review, setting up a ruling on the case this session. Or it could accept the case on its typical schedule, which would most likely mean oral arguments and a ruling in its session that begins in the fall. Four justices would need to agree to accept the case, but it would take a majority vote of five to speed up the case's consideration.
This is our chance to turn that one around.
Recent polling from Asian American Decisions shows that in 2018 Asian-Americans intend to vote Democratic by more than 2 to 1, overwhelmingly supporting taxing the wealthy, protecting Obamacare and increasing the minimum wage.
Regarding the Obamacare suit: I don't see the Supremes deciding to dismantle it. Chief Justice Roberts is settling nicely into the Anthony Kennedy role as the Court's swing vote. And he seems especially reluctant to turn the Court into an agent of sweeping social change, which explains his vote in the Louisiana abortion case. I think that's the essence of thoughtful conservative jurisprudence, centered around respect for precedent and incrementalism.
You see, for all its sweeping ambition, the Green New Deal is arguably an exercise in pragmatism — in the proposition that the perfect is the enemy of the good.

We are a long way off until the 2020 election, but I applaud the women who have thrown their hats into the ring now, as Americans need to get to know and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses and help choose the woman with the best chance of taking back the White House. The midterms in 2018 showed that women are on the move in American politics, and there is little doubt in my mind that the best woman will be our 46th president.
TRUMP: The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran.
Most Texans gaining coverage have done so through the health law's insurance marketplaces. The premiums in Texas have tended to be lower than those elsewhere in the country, but there have been some big increases in recent years. The monthly price of a midlevel individual market plan has increased to $462 this year, up from $359 in 2017.
Michelle Cottle: So here's a question about ——
Charlie Warzel: Senator, how do you first campaign in and then govern a country as polarized as the one that we're living in right now? Because this doesn't feel like a disagreement on a few policies. This is a situation where the cost of letting the other side wins seems almost too much to bear for the other side. And if you look at impeachment, you see politicians literally inventing alternate realities rather than compromise or disparage a party leader. How do you realistically navigate that and get things done? Because it doesn't feel like a divide that you can heal away.
Senator Warren's Medicare for all would require $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over the next 10 years. She has promised the money won't come from raising taxes on the middle class and maintains that between defense cuts and a wealth tax, the costs would be covered. But of course, that would require Senate approval — and Senator McConnell has sworn it won't happen as long as I'm majority leader.
After the endorsement interview, Senator Warren reached out to Mr. Warzel to clarify her response on 20th century antitrust. In that follow-up interview, she said: Antitrust law is a very valuable tool and breaking them up would have important effects but what I realized after I left in the room is that I was pulled in a different direction but I never finished to say that antitrust law is important but not the only tool we need. I don't believe that markets alone are going to fix all the problems we're facing on the tech side. Particularly the issues around privacy and the values that come from aggregation on platforms and how that value would be distributed. I don't believe only antitrust works but I do believe its a powerful tool we should be using in dealing with Big Tech.
BA: I appreciate that the toaster is still your preferred consumer appliance.
And there needs to be a set of internal arguments and fights and struggles for the character of the party. And my hope is that the side that thinks about how to use politics to advance good ideas and use government to help people live better lives is the side that wins.
Well, it's not good for them and in a dozen different ways. Wages are part of it, but they are only part of it. It's about unsafe working conditions, for example. If you can hire somebody for cash and not meet current labor standards on safety, that someone needs a safety belt or needs training to go up high on a building, you not only put that person at risk, you reward employers who continue not to follow the law and to undermine safety standards for everyone.
You're asking the fundamental question about how you break them up. This was the question for Standard Oil. How did they break up Standard Oil? They ended up doing it actually by geography back in those days, but that's obviously a very different world from the world we live in right now.
When the president's motorcade left Saft to head back to Air Force One, I noticed something unusual: The plant's parking lot was extremely small. It dawned on me that Obama's tour of the factory, filled with photo ops and handshakes, had included very little interaction with workers. Instead, he was shown machine after machine, mostly operated by computers. At one point, he was introduced to WALL-E, a robot named after the Pixar film that takes battery components from a tray. No employees necessary. This giant mecca of innovation, a physical marvel that if built several decades ago would have easily employed a few thousand people, employs only 300.
Under the House bill, the government would provide tax credits to help people buy insurance. But, the budget office said, the average federal subsidy would be significantly lower under the House bill than under the Affordable Care Act — about 50 percent lower by 2026.
Mr. Bloomberg is attempting to turn his ad campaign into delegates in several ways: through an inundation of expensive markets with a potentially responsive suburban population; with heavy spending in a state where he will clearly lose the topline battle but can still sneak some delegates; or by a simple domination of the airwaves.
And so the party organized itself around a different set of issues and also was much more explicitly coalitional, the Democrats were. They understood themselves as representing different factions that negotiated with each other and tried to enable one another to achieve important things. The Republican Party was a little bit more of a worldview party by the Reagan era and after, certainly. And so it at least understood itself as organized by these ideas, which certainly had their roots in Cold War thinking.
This has to be ripped out by its roots. This is government taking over the entire health insurance industry.
Trump's tax law, passed in 2017, reduced this fee on the uninsured to zero. In the current lawsuit, the plaintiffs have taken advantage of this change to argue that the mandate is now back to being a mandate rather than a tax — even if it's an irrelevant mandate, because ignoring it brings no penalty. As Cohn wrote, It doesn't take a fancypants law degree to see that the new scheme is, if anything, less intrusive than the old one — a point that the attorneys for California and the U.S. House [who were arguing against the Trump administration] made several times.
The lawsuit asks the court to strike down the administration's new rules and to enjoin the president from further sabotage. To prevail, the plaintiffs may have to overcome some procedural hurdles, including questions about whether the courts have the authority or the institutional competence to prevent violations of Article II's requirement that the president take care that the laws be faithfully executed — especially given the wide discretion that presidents traditionally have to implement the laws.
Kevin Roose and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT report:
Right. Instead of talking about what I had imagined Republicans would be talking about for the next couple of months and maybe even the next year, which is the Democratic fight over Medicare for all, the Democratic fight over whether private insurance should even exist — I had expected that that would be the consuming discussion in the political world and in the political campaigns to come when it came to health care.
But even if optimistic claims about Medicare for All are true, will people believe them? And even if most people do, if a significant minority of voters doesn't trust the promises of single-payer advocates, that could easily either doom Democrats in the general election or at least make it impossible to get their plan through Congress.

In all three, NextGen and its allies worked to put an initiative on the ballot that would require local utilities to use much more renewable energy, like solar and wind. The proposed increases were big: Every state would need to more than double the share of its renewable energy by 2030. This kind of requirement is known as a performance standard, and it has a long history of success in many fields, reducing house fires, medical errors, deaths in car accidents and the use of lead paint and asbestos.
I disagreed with them. So for example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership had a robust investor state dispute resolution mechanism, which multiple of our trade treaties have had for decades now. And I just think that's fundamentally wrong. It's a two-tier system that says, in effect, we'll make a bunch of promises in a trade deal on the environment, on use of prison labor, child labor and on anything else, and then we'll give two entirely different enforcement mechanisms.

McCain's final message for his country was a warning: Our greatness is in peril.
Health care has become a major point of contention between Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Sanders, who are fighting to come out ahead in the Feb. 1 caucuses. Mr. Sanders's plan would require over a trillion dollars a year paid for with a broad set of new taxes. His campaign says the plan would save middle-class families money on co-pays and deductibles despite the tax increase. Mrs. Clinton has hit Mr. Sanders for wanting to scrap President Obama's signature domestic achievement and raise taxes on the middle class. She has promised to improve on the Affordable Care Act.

And as I wrote last week, the economic good news of recent years — not as good as Trump claims, but the economy has indeed been strong — largely reflects the reality that after hobbling the economy with fiscal austerity under Barack Obama, Republicans have embraced runaway deficit spending under Trump.
While Kirkpatrick's proud of putting us at risk, John McCain is leading the fight to stop Obamacare, the female announcer says.

Even under the best circumstances, modeling how a pandemic will play out, like modeling the pace and impact of climate change, is an imperfect science. And there is indeed great uncertainty about what the death toll is now — and what it will be — given limited data about the new coronavirus and the different counting methods jurisdictions are using.
End Citizens United, a group with more than four million members and half a million donors around the country, has voiced support for Senator Warren's proposed anti-corruption plans. The group has noted that both President Obama and President Trump won election in part by portraying themselves as tougher on opponents. Read more in The Times.
Another angle: Many Asian-Americans say they have experienced growing racism in the form of verbal and physical attacks. President Trump, who has made repeated use of the phrase Chinese virus, said on Monday that they should not be blamed for the pandemic.
If you are a giant multinational corporation and any regulation comes along that you don't like, the local country raises the minimum — we've actually seen this — raises its environmental standards, you get to sue them to get them to drop those standards. And who will your case be heard by? It'll be heard by a handful of corporate lawyers, who when they're not sitting on this arbitration panel are working for big law firms that are doing work for you or other multinational corporations like you. That's one set of how the path will run.
In October, Senator Warren's campaign bought ads that read: Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election. The campaign was intended as a critique of Facebook's decision not to fact-check or remove political ads. (Updated) Facebook did not remove from the social network the ad falsely endorsing Mr. Trump.
Donald Trump has spent his whole life overselling an overinflated vision of himself and his success.
I say national unity because many Americans are terrified and troubled by how bitterly divided, and therefore paralyzed, the country has become. There is an opening for a unifier.
I think you should talk about the language and recognize the way that the language may not be inclusive for everyone. I mean, I never until recently made it a practice to ask people I interview, people I would mention in articles, about their gender and their pronouns. I feel like having that conversation is a good way to start. One of the ways we can talk about this is not as a replacement for traditional genders but as an addition. Offering they as a pronoun for you in addition to he or she, I think, is a kind of a way to avoid some of these problems. So most places, like airports and others, that have all-gender restrooms also have men and women restrooms. And that would be a relatively easy way to both offer it as an option and include it in the language without adding to this fear that were erasing people's identities.

Millions of voters are expected to go to the polls today, when about a third of the delegates in the Democratic presidential race will be allocated. Here are the latest updates.
Mr. Severino, who attained prominence as a social conservative before joining the Trump administration, said that health providers were still free to adopt their own gender identity policies, as were health insurers.
It has a really mixed perception. So I think that it really speaks to some people who respond to the moral case that he's making and to people who have really felt left behind by our current system, who are struggling with high health care costs or fighting with their insurance companies. So I think it really galvanized his campaign. It's a central theme. Obviously, he really outperforms everyone's expectations in the Democratic primary.
The administration is also hunting for consumers who can deliver testimonials advertising the benefits of coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Interested consumers could appear in television, radio, print and/or digital ads and on social media, the administration said in an appeal sent last week to health care advocates and insurance counselors.

Senator Warren said in March that she hopes to pass a constitutional amendment to protect every American's right to vote. She added, Every vote matters, and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.
The bill to end the shutdown, which funds government operations through Feb. 8 and also includes a six-year reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, did not move through budget reconciliation, the parliamentary procedure that circumvents filibusters in the Senate. That allowed Republican leaders to include the delays in the health insurance taxes without worrying about their fiscal cost, a move that drew few objections from Democrats.
We fall apart, particularly in the academy, when we succumb to or perpetuate that kind of intellectual bullying.

To calculate how many people would be uninsured under the Republican plan, the C.B.O., a nonpartisan agency of economists and statisticians, also had to estimate what would happen if the Affordable Care Act were not repealed.
The way I think we get something done in Washington, it's the Frances Perkins story. It's not enough to organize on the outside and have the marches in the street. Before the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire, there had been dozens of marches, right? Lots of high profile. But the guys who ran the factories figured out it was a lot cheaper just to grease palms in Albany than it was to actually change their practices and put up adequate fire escapes and fire preventive measures. So just pushing from the outside, it's not enough to get it done. Just fighting it from the inside is not enough to get it done. But the one-two punch of pushing from the outside and leading it from the inside is where you see real difference.
The number of people who have denounced Medicare for all as politically impractical continues to grow — the former White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel called it a pipe dream in a recent Washington Post op-ed, in which he called on proponents to please explain to me exactly how we get that bill through the Senate?
Given the Democratic advantage, many Republicans say they should not focus their energy on health care but instead emphasize immigration and other issues where they are stronger. But the president and his team counter that even if they cannot win on health care, it would be ridiculous to simply cede the territory if they could at least narrow the gap.
I'm not going to do names. That's enormously presumptuous.
When even a bipartisan agreement on immigration reform, focused on employment-based green cards, died on the Senate floor in September, it demonstrated just how difficult it has become to get any immigration reform legislation through Congress.
No, but I think this is important.
Senator Warren's anti-corruption plan includes provisions to extend conflict-of-interest laws to the president and vice president, compel government to divest from privately owned assets and restrict the ability of lobbyists to be hired for government jobs. It takes aim in particular at many of the practices that the Trump family has used to profit from office, which The Times has editorialized against.
Well, I have concerns. Not about electability, a topic about which nobody knows anything. Never mind what today's general election polls say: What will polling look like after the inevitable Republican smear campaign? The answer to this question depends, in turn, on whether news organizations will cooperate with those smears as gleefully as they did in 2016.
First, anyone expecting bipartisanship in dealing with the aftermath of the Mueller report — in particular, anyone suggesting that Democrats should wait for G.O.P. support before proceeding with investigations that might lead to impeachment — is being deluded. Trump is giving the Republican establishment what it wants, and it will stick with him no matter what.
With those kinds of problems, you might think that the stock market has looked with disfavor at UnitedHealth and its competitors, and that investors have been counting on Congress to repeal Obamacare and replace it within something more palatable for the insurers.

Or how about the parents of 12 million children who are struggling to find child care? And I'm not just talking about one narrow slice. I'm talking about a whole bunch of parents across a wide range of ZIP codes and income categories who are struggling. I'm talking about the 36 million Americans last year who didn't have prescriptions filled because they simply couldn't afford it. Or the 35 million Americans who didn't go have a lump checked out at the doctor, or some other medical condition, because they were afraid they couldn't afford the — and these are people, most of them, many of them, with insurance, right? Couldn't afford the co-pay, couldn't afford the deductible. I think people are feeling this in their lives right now. And what is the spark, which is what I hear your question to be? It's you show them a path out. It doesn't have to be this way. Can I just say, the first time I think I came to The New York Times was during the financial crisis.

That may work at the neighborhood butcher, but not in contracts and not in our advanced purchase agreements. Matina Stevis-Gridneff and
And then by the time you're in the Trump Administration, Republicans really only attempt two major pieces of legislation, and then call it a day when the health care replacement fails and the tax cut doesn't seem to yield any political returns. Republicans basically draw the lesson, Well, I guess it's a waste of time to do anything on policy. And so they campaign in 2018 saying, or rather not saying, Look, if you give us continued control of Congress and the White House, we're going to do a couple of things for you. And in 2020, Trump doesn't campaign on the basis of, here's what I'm going to do in my second term, and Republican senators and House members don't campaign on, give us back control the government so we can do x, y, and z. And look, I'm somebody whose been arguing for years that conservatives should have that kind of an agenda. But the Republicans are in decent political health without having done any of that kind of work. And so, I think that there is an inclination on their part to just keep doing it. But among the reasons why that is still worth pushing back on is that at some point, if you're involved in politics and interested in office, it's because you want to accomplish something.

Many of the websites that consumers visited implied the policies being offered were from brand-name insurers.
Yeah. I mean, if you don't want to get re-elected, you're in the wrong business.
The supposed reason was that he wanted to bring back U.S. manufacturing. If that were really his motivation, he failed: Amid a generally strong economy, we're experiencing a manufacturing recession, and estimates from the Federal Reserve suggest that Trump's tariffs, which have raised business costs, have actually reduced manufacturing employment.

Kevin Roose and Sheera Frenkel of the NYT report:
Mark Zuckerberg has held the line on Facebook's decision to allow political ads, even as Twitter banned them. The company's approach came under scrutiny after it said Mr. Trump's re-election campaign would be allowed to run an ad with false claims about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter. Mr. Zuckerberg said this is about free speech and not the profit motive.
Among those who are said to be influencing the discussion within the administration are Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services; Seema Verma, the head of the agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid; and Joe Grogan, the director of the White House Domestic Policy Council.
Under Senator Warren's plan to pay for Medicare for all, a substantial chunk of funds would come from an employer contribution into the health care fund. Senator Sanders has not released a detailed plan explaining how he would pay for the system.
Of course once again, the problem is at the top, where the president is claiming that 99 percent of coronavirus cases are totally harmless. Life with Trump keeps reminding me of that scene in Peter Pan where Tinker Bell is dying and the audience revives her by clapping to prove they all believe in fairies. Worried about a pandemic? Just keep saying everything's fine and magic will happen.
Nowhere has this been truer than with health care, where the administration has reversed direction multiple times.
The argument that Mulvaney and others make is that if the president is going to run for re-election as a guy who made promises and kept his promises, especially to conservative voters who still care a lot about getting rid of Obamacare, he has got to take every chance he has to go against it.

Representative Jim Jordan, a Trump loyalist, has decided not to run for an open Senate seat. While more than a half-dozen other Ohio Republicans are weighing Senate bids, none has the national profile of Representative Jim Jordan. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, who was former President Donald J. Trump's foremost defender in his House impeachment proceedings, has decided not to run for an open seat being vacated by the retirement of a fellow Republican, Senator Rob Portman, in 2022, an aide said Thursday. Mr. Jordan believes that at this time he is better suited to represent Ohioans in the House of Representatives, where, as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, he can advance an America first agenda, promote conservative values and hold big government accountable, Russell Dye, a spokesman for Mr. Jordan's congressional campaign, said. Mr. Jordan's high-profile defense of Mr. Trump made him widely considered to be the Republican with the best chance to win Ohio's 2022 Senate primary. While more than a half-dozen other Ohio Republicans are weighing Senate bids to replace Mr. Portman, none has the national profile or Trump bona fides of Mr. Jordan, who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom five days after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Mr. Jordan has long had ambitions to lead House Republicans and has hoped to become speaker if his party takes a majority in the chamber following the 2022 elections.

Concerns about the degree to which Mr. Epstein received lenient treatment thanks to his affluence and connections have been percolating since November, when an investigative series by a Miami Herald reporter, Julie Brown, revived interest in the case. Mr. Acosta does not come off well as the United States attorney who worked hand-in-glove with Mr. Epstein's legal team on the secret nonprosecution agreement that shielded him from federal charges, ended a related F.B.I. investigation and granted immunity to any co-conspirators. When a new indictment against Mr. Epstein was unsealed in a federal court in New York on Monday, the resulting outcry spurred the White House to push the labor secretary to hold a news conference Wednesday to defend himself.

Senator Warren's plan on trade, released in July, would change American trade policy by pushing the country's trade partners to abide by higher labor and environmental standards.

On Friday, the World Health Organization reviewed the details of its investigation into the origin of the coronavirus in China, and what it hopes to learn from the visit. Credit Credit... Hector Retamal/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images After months of delays, a team of World Health Organization scientists tracing the pandemic's origin began its field work on Friday in Wuhan, the Chinese city where the coronavirus was first detected. The W.H.O. said its team of 15 experts planned to visit hospitals, laboratories and a live animal market over the next several weeks in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, where the virus was detected in late 2019. As members start their field visits on Friday, they should receive the support, access and the data they need, the W.H.O. said on Twitter. All hypotheses are on the table as the team follows the science in their work to understand the origins of the #COVID19 virus. The Chinese government had repeatedly sought to delay the inquiry, apparently out of concern that the experts would draw attention to the government's early missteps in handling the outbreak. But it relented under mounting global pressure. The W.H.O. experts were first asked to undergo 14 days of quarantine in Wuhan, which ended on Thursday. They plan to speak with some of the first patients to show symptoms of Covid-19, as well as with medical workers and Chinese scientists, according to the W.H.O. Their fieldwork will include a visit the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, where some of the first cases were detected.
It's that you don't get the tariff benefit. This is what it's really about. Where's the baseline? Right? And is the baseline one that says, across the board, you've got to give plenty of notice. You've got to work through, make sure you've got something that's achievable for countries we trade with. But this is not like trying to institute a trade war. This is not like saying we're mad at you and therefore we're going to impose all these tariffs on you, and doing it as Donald Trump has done by tweet.
The Biden administration plans to reopen enrollment in many of the Affordable Care Act marketplaces, both to help those who may have lost health insurance during the pandemic and to offer coverage to those who did not have any and now want it. The move will be announced on Thursday as part of an executive order describing administration policies on shoring up health insurance coverage, according to three people familiar with the details.

Take the enactment of Obamacare. For Gilens, the final legislation reflects the failure of the Democratic Party to achieve progressive goals:
No, but look. All right, so what do you want to do? You want just give up? Say, Aw, gee, Mitch McConnell ….  Let's go get the begging bowl and say give me a crumb or two, and I will say thank you. That's what it means now to be a Democrat to the party in opposition.

The reality is that Cuomo is desperately trying to run against Donald Trump because he doesn't have the progressive credentials to run against me, she said on Thursday.
But Republicans still hate the idea of helping Americans get health care. So instead of releasing the kraken, they've brought on the termites. Rather than trying to eliminate Obamacare in one fell swoop, they're trying to undermine it with multiple acts of sabotage — while hoping voters won't realize who's responsible for rising premiums and falling coverage.
You almost got the restaurant analogy right, but not quite. The actual analogy is that patients are diners who are given a menu with no prices on it. You don't know the cost or value of what you're buying. Doctors know the more they order for you, the more money they make. You don't really care because you think your insurance company is going to pay for it.
After weeks of criticizing Bernie Sanders's plan for a single-payer Medicare for all health care system as budget busting and unrealistic, Hillary Clinton over the past few days has a new message for voters: Universal health care was her idea first.

The lawsuit asks the court to strike down the administration's new rules and to enjoin the president from further sabotage. To prevail, the plaintiffs may have to overcome some procedural hurdles, including questions about whether the courts have the authority or the institutional competence to prevent violations of Article II's requirement that the president take care that the laws be faithfully executed — especially given the wide discretion that presidents traditionally have to implement the laws.
The amendment makes other changes to Medicaid: It would prevent any additional states from expanding the program to cover more poor, childless adults. It would take away extra funding from states that cover adults over a certain income threshold.
To make regulation work, you have to back it up with incentives for healthy people to sign up, including subsidies that help lower-income families afford insurance. In other words, if you really want to make essential care available for pre-existing conditions while continuing to rely on private insurance companies, you need a system that looks a lot like … Obamacare. Indeed, New York premiums dropped in half when the A.C.A. went into effect.
I think that the Biden administration is benefiting from the refusal of Trump to go away and to let others let him go away. It seems to me that there's this disjunction between the expectations that a lot of Democrats, and particularly progressives, have of this presidency. And what seems to be likely, as an outcome, I think, are maybe beginning to see some of the letdown happen with the apparent sinking of the Neera Tanden nomination for OMB. But it seems to me that you're going to be six or seven months into this administration and they're going to be a lot of Democratic voters who are going to say, look, we've got the house, we've got the Senate, we've got the White House and there isn't a big minimum wage increase, there isn't any election reform, there isn't much in the way of a Green New Deal, probably, there isn't a public option on health care. Just keep going down the list. No Puerto Rican or D.C. statehood. And that the hopes have just really outstripped the capacity of the Biden Administration to deliver.
It's true that the coverage expansion was somewhat less than originally predicted, although the shortfall was much less than you may have heard. It's also true that after initially offering surprisingly cheap policies on the Obamacare exchanges, insurers found that the people signing up were sicker, on average, than they expected, leading to higher premiums. But as of last year, the markets appeared to have stabilized, with insurers generally profitable.

The reason I'm interested in this counterfactual — to your point, there are many things Donald Trump could have done differently. But many of them he didn't want to do differently. He didn't want to stop being a maniac on Twitter, he didn't want to stop giving his press conferences. But this is one where Donald Trump, certainly at times, wanted to do a bigger stimulus and it seemed like the Republican Party's incentives were aligned to do it. But they didn't. So why do you think they didn't? Why didn't Mitch McConnell and Trump come together on this one given their electoral interests?
So let me do both of these, because I think there are two answers. There are two pieces in this answer. One is, I think attacking the corruption in Washington brings a lot more people together than most folks recognize, and that it really does reach across party lines.
For me, everything is about alignment. You have to be in alignment with your district. That's the only reason you should run, and that's the only reason you should be elected. If you're in alignment with your district, it really doesn't matter what is happening nationally.
Even some strong advocates of carbon pricing have come to see this point. Nathaniel Keohane, the head of the climate program at the Environmental Defense Fund, which helped design the original cap-and-trade program for acid rain, puts it this way: If we're going to succeed on climate policy, it will be by giving people a vision of what's in it for them, a positive vision of how it matters for their life and their kids. Too often in the past, he said, climate activists failed to do that. We really led with, and let us ourselves be defined by, the policy mechanism rather than the outcome we were striving for. You need to be able to inspire people.
So Josh Jordan on Twitter summarized a bunch of recent polls looking at what percentage of Republicans believe the election was stolen from Donald Trump. USA Today Suffolk poll 73 percent, Gallup 83 percent, CNN 75, Monmouth 72 percent, Fox News, a low result, 68 percent. So, we're looking at somewhere between 2/3 to 4/5 of the Republican Party saying, the election was stolen from Donald Trump. That is a hell of a thing to believe. How do you understand that belief and how do you think it changes political incentives and strategies for people who want to lead that party going forward?
The budget also proposes creating an entirely new agency to police tobacco, moving that responsibility out of the Food and Drug Administration and into the Department of Health and Human Services.
The answer is that both are indicators of how Trump views his job. He doesn't seem to see actual policymaking as important; instead, he treats it all as an exercise in reality TV.
LK: And a growing concern during the Trump era about violence. And I'm just wondering how you would address that, if that is in fact something that's not going to go away once the Trump era ends, which I think is a safe assumption.
There is truly nothing — like actually nothing — I find more galling than hearing senators defend an effort to block or deprive actual racial or ethnic minorities of rights under the rubric of minority rights. Right? The important thing is the right of the Republican Party to block bills that would ensure that African-Americans in this country have the right to vote, that it is the important thing is that the right of the minority, the Senate Republican minority, to block a bill that would allow Black and Brown, and for that matter, white residents of Washington, DC to have full representation in Congress, it is so Orwellian. It's one of the places where I have a lot of trouble keeping my cool.
It did not, however, bridge a notable gap between the Biden and Sanders platforms. The task force called for decriminalizing marijuana and legalizing it at the federal level for medical use, but for letting the states decide whether to legalize it for recreational use. That is the position Mr. Biden held in the primary, in contrast to Mr. Sanders, who supports full legalization.
Even under the best circumstances, modeling how a pandemic will play out, like modeling the pace and impact of climate change, is an imperfect science. And there is indeed great uncertainty about what the death toll is now — and what it will be — given limited data about the new coronavirus and the different counting methods jurisdictions are using.
Mr. Trump does not sound like a man trying to stabilize the Affordable Care Act marketplace. He boasted on Thursday that he had mostly obliterated Obamacare. He said in June that he had essentially gutted the law. In July last year, he said his strategy was to let Obamacare implode. In October last year, he declared: Obamacare is finished. It's dead. It's gone.
At age 19, Senator Warren married her high school sweetheart, a computer engineer, Jim Warren. She gave up a full scholarship to George Washington University for the marriage, and they later split in part because he didn't support her career ambitions.
Eager to fuel this perception, Team Trump has been smearing Democrats as engaged in a campaign of presidential harassment. It's the president's signature move: attack anyone or anything that displeases him — the news media, the courts, the electoral process, insufficiently obsequious Republicans, his own Department of Justice, science — to undermine its legitimacy in the eyes of his base.
The Times columnist David Leonhardt wrote in September that despite long positioning herself as a champion for the working class, Senator Warren has had a record of struggling to win in working-class towns and blue-collar parts of Massachusetts.
I was against the war in Iraq. Yes, after the war became unpopular, Trump became against it from the beginning. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
The answer is not George M. Cohan, who wrote the ecstatically patriotic verses of The Yankee Doodle Boy for the 1904 musical Little Johnny Jones. He lifted the feather-and-cap lines from a song called, simply, Yankee Doodle, which was popularized by British troops during the Revolutionary War. And whoever composed these words — history is inconclusive — didn't intend a jesting, surreal tribute to the colonists. Quite the opposite. The song is an insult.
To the Editor: This is some of the nuttiest, ill-thought-out political rationalizing I have ever seen. According to this article, Republicans plan to strip out the mandate and tax penalties in Obamacare, leaving the remainder to deal with later.
JB: And you would bring them all home?
This scene is part of Joan Biskupic's new biography of Roberts, The Chief. The book contains a description of the justices's behind-the-scenes maneuverings on Obamacare that's more detailed than any other to appear so far.
He needs the help of the legislature. And so one of the measures he tries to do is call a special session of the legislature, and encourage them to delay the election and implement changes that would allow every person to be able to vote without going in person.
The Republican plan does not repeal the expansion but would reduce funding for enrollees who gained access to Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.
Amsterdam surpasses London as Europe's trading hub. Shares worth roughly 9.2 billion euros ($11.2 billion) were traded on Dutch markets last month, beating the €8.6 billion traded on London exchanges. That shift is a tangible sign of how financial markets are being remade after Brexit.
One of my favorite things that I've ever seen about the Senate — now a political science professor, but then I think he was a grad student — David Broockmann was doing archival research, and he sent me this little letter that Mike Manatos, who was Lyndon Johnson's Senate liaison, so his lead representative to the Senate, sent Johnson about Medicare after the '64 election. Manatos says that given what we've seen in terms of who does and does not support Medicare and given who lost and won seats in the election, that if everybody is there and present and accounted for and voting, Medicare will pass with 55 votes. And at that point, you needed a two-thirds majority to break a filibuster. So that wasn't anywhere near what you would need to break a filibuster. But they didn't expect there would be a filibuster. And so, as you say, by then, when the thing's passing, a bunch of other Republicans jump on board so it ends up having a pretty strong majority in its favor. But the idea that you would imagine passing something like Medicare and not worry about the filibuster. And by the way, it's not like there wasn't a filibuster in that time. The filibuster was being used constantly by the Southern bloc — and these were Southern Democrats — to block civil rights and anti-lynching laws. I mean, it has a horrifying history in this period. But it's just not used, really, on anything else.
CW: Intends to use their influence in this election. And Mark Zuckerberg especially. You were tweeting about that and mentioning him.
Asked if he would support the measure today, he said that times have changed — but that such a standard should not apply to Mr. Sanders's votes on guns.
1. President Trump doubled down on his surprise decision to try to scrap the entire Affordable Care Act. If the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out, we'll have a plan that is far better than Obamacare, he said.
14 million fewer people will be enrolled in Medicaid in 10 years.
As House leaders struggled to negotiate with holdouts in the hopes of rescheduling the vote, Mr. Trump sent senior officials to the Capitol with a blunt message: He would agree to no additional changes, and Republicans must either support the bill or resign themselves to leaving President Barack Obama's signature domestic achievement in place.
CHARLESTON — Joseph R. Biden Jr. came out swinging at one of his chief rivals, Bernie Sanders, at a televised town hall event on Wednesday, swiping at him over everything from his record on guns to the damage that he suggested Mr. Sanders would do to Democrats running in down-ballot races.
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia received on Wednesday his second shot of a vaccine made by the Chinese company Sinovac, a day after the country of 270 million people surpassed one million reported infections. Mr. Joko said that 250,000 health workers in Indonesia had already received their first shot. About 50,000 people are now being vaccinated each day, he said, adding that he hoped to raise that number to one million.
At the same time, you don't want to create some sort of narrative of historical inevitability of the return of bigotry and racism. Right? George W. Bush campaigned in almost all of the ways that liberals now miss about Republican politicians. Right? He went to mosques after 9/11. He pushed a huge program for fighting AIDS in Africa. His was a conservatism of some kind of racial outreach. So you have to ask the question, you know, well, what changed between 2000 and 2016? And I think the big answer is that George W. Bush's foreign policy was a failure. And then we had a huge financial crisis. And we have a host of socioeconomic problems in America that the Republican message wasn't addressing.
Yes. I mean, that's why I wrote the book because everything felt upside down and sideways, and nothing made sense. And reconciliation was crazy for the reasons we're talking about here. When things failed by the filibuster, these were bills that were being blocked in the name of unlimited debate, but then immediately pulled from the floor and not debated anymore. Nothing made sense. And when you ask around for why it is this way, you get very mealy mouthed answers about Senate tradition and the wisdom of the ages and the wisdom of delay and all these things. And meanwhile, you look around, and you see the country struggling to deal with these massive issues. And it's not struggling because it's hard to find solutions. The solutions, in a lot of cases, are right there. They often exist in legislative text. They've been road tested by experts. There's not really a lot of controversy over what the solution should be. It's just impossible to get them through the Senate. And it felt crazy. And it felt like you were living in some Kafkaesque world. And when you dig into the history, you find that this is just not the way it was supposed to be. We sort of backed into it for a series of weird reasons that were never conscious decisions to make it this way. And I think it's important for people to understand that it can be different. And it is not actually that hard to make it be different.
But on the other hand, we have other diplomatic initiatives and it's really important that we're trying to work with this country, and they're important to us strategically for this reason and we have this ongoing negotiation in that political thing. Drag your heels, drag your heels, drag your heels, until the jobs have disappeared here. And then once you go forward, you've got to go forward through a different kind of court that's much slower.
Mr. Obama has lately been in close contact with his first attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., sharing his outrage over the way the current attorney general, William P. Barr, personally inspected the phalanx of federal law enforcement officers who tear-gassed demonstrators to clear the path for Mr. Trump's walk to a photo op at a historic church near the White House.
I'm not going to do this. I'm just not. I'm not here to take on Joe Biden and what Joe Biden has done. I'm glad to talk to you about why I'm running for president, but not to attack him.
Meanwhile, we're racing toward the big Democratic presidential debates. People, are you ready? Some of you may be concerned that you don't know the names of all the candidates. Some of you who do know all the names may be concerned that means you have no life.
So the way I see this is I think the old left-right division, yeah, there's a lot of that. But I think there's a very different division in America, and that is an America that's working for a thinner and thinner slice at the top and not working for much of anyone else. And there are a lot of Democrats, a lot of independents and a lot of Republicans who see that.
But a second amendment, introduced Thursday, would restore one of the taxes for six years. Wages of more than $200,000 will still be subject to a 0.9 percent Medicare payroll tax until 2023, if the change is adopted.
Bloomberg just has bad connotations that come along with him, Leah Garwood said as she waited in line with her husband on Sunday in Las Vegas for roughly 45 minutes to vote for a different billionaire, Tom Steyer of California. It's just at the back of my mind. It makes me uncomfortable, uneasy.
The problem as I see it in the housing market, just picking that one, is we have a supply problem. The two big providers of housing from half a century ago just aren't there. So the developer that built the two-bedroom, one-bath house, garage converted to hold my three brothers for their bedroom, that developer is building McMansions today. And I'm not mad at him. That's where the profits are. And the federal government, as you know, now under current federal law, can't expand federal housing. It can only do replacement when it's taking it off the market. And if it takes it off the market and it doesn't replace it, then it shrinks even more. Housing deteriorates like anything else.
That, too, was an outrageous position. It flouted the Justice Department's duty to defend, a solemn duty, and one that goes to the heart of the rule of law. Without it, the sitting administration could pick which laws it wanted to defend in the courts and which it wanted to abandon. Laws could rise or fall based on nothing more than partisan disagreement. That's inconsistent with a constitutional system that assigns to Congress — not the president — the power to legislate.
AK: O.K. No, I mean, it's not my critique. This is a critique on the left as well, you know, that going about forgiving student debt in this way puts a lot of money in households that are going to make a lot of money.
Before she was a United States senator, Kamala Harris was the San Francisco district attorney and the California attorney general. Now, as a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president, Ms. Harris often says she is eager to prosecute the case against President Trump.
But some historians believe the closest comparison to this year, the last time the entire nation was consumed by a single issue, may be 1944, when the threat of Nazi Germany and imperial Japan fully mobilized American citizens behind the war effort.
If you already have Obamacare coverage, but you have received unemployment insurance any time this year, you now qualify for additional assistance. You should go back to the marketplace to make sure you are signed up for that extra benefit once it is set up.
The health care industry consists of a dense network of public-private partnerships. Even programs widely viewed as government insurance, like Medicare and Medicaid, depend on private hospitals, doctors and insurers.
No, my concerns are about what will happen if either man wins. Are they ready for the political trench warfare that would inevitably follow a Democratic victory?
The Trump administration formally declared its opposition to the entire Affordable Care Act on Wednesday, arguing in a federal appeals court filing that the signature Obama-era legislation was unconstitutional and should be struck down.
In Donald Trump's two-plus years as president, his approach to policymaking has often been defined by an unsavory stew of indecision, inaction, flip-flops and outright lies.
The numbers indicate that even in areas hit hard by the virus, the overwhelming majority of people have not yet been infected, Dr. Hensley said.
And no longer will this nation refuse the hand of justice to those who have given a lifetime of service and wisdom and labor to the progress of this progressive country. [MUSIC]
At a rally in 2008, McCain corrected a questioner who called Barack Obama untrustworthy and an Arab. No, ma'am, McCain told the crowd. He's a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.
Or three. I mean, how do you want to count it? [LAUGHTER] One is to reduce the cost for families on the first day. I mean, the cost savings doesn't come in on the first day, but you sign the papers that need to be done, so you reduce costs on the first day. The second is to give people the opportunity to be in Medicare if they want, anyone who's 50 or older, and expand the coverage for Medicare. It's to offer Medicare for all complete health care coverage to everyone else who wants it.
I'm sorry, but you can do it if you roll back the filibuster. I stood on the floor of the Senate when we had those votes.
AARP, the lobby for older Americans, is campaigning against the bill.
We had a fire, and the fire there was millions of people who lost their homes, but the fire by itself doesn't get it done. The fire by itself wasn't enough. You had to be ready with the big structural change and had to have somebody from the inside who would fight for it.
Do they want to cover nearly as many as are covered under the A.C.A.? A few senators, like Susan Collins of Maine and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, say they do, but a majority from the party are not willing to spend the money that would be needed to do that. Or do they want to significantly reduce government spending and regulation of health care, leaving Americans to navigate the free market on their own? Conservatives like Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina are arguing for that, but the rest of the congressional Republicans do not want to go down this treacherous path.
The Oxford team, which was in charge of the earliest trials of the vaccine, did not want to vaccinate older people until they had collected extensive safety data for younger participants, Pascal Soriot, the chief executive of AstraZeneca, said in an interview with La Repubblica, an Italian newspaper, this week. Other vaccine makers, Mr. Soriot said, decided to vaccinate older people in trials before they had accumulated as much safety data, allowing them to make stronger claims about efficacy in that age group. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration is waiting on data from a clinical trial that enrolled about 30,000 participants, mostly Americans, and that will include more older people. The results are expected in the coming weeks. AstraZeneca is expected to have sufficient safety data from that study to file for emergency use authorization from the F.D.A. around the first week of March.

Over several decades, it's become increasingly clear that how immigration debates are framed is important. One of the more subtle anti-immigration tactics — employed by the Trump, Kennedy and Johnson administrations, as well as some on the political left — is to suggest that reducing immigration could preserve more jobs for American workers and lead to higher wages, but economic research has consistently disputed the notion that limiting immigration would increase domestic employment or raise average wages. The prevailing view of economists is that immigration increases economic growth; while some workers might benefit from immigration restrictions, more would suffer.
Actually, I don't do polls. I haven't looked at them, so I don't know, but I'll tell you this. I'm out there fighting for those votes every single day. I've been to 29 states and Puerto Rico. I will keep doing this. I've been to blue states and red states, and talked about how we build a future. I think that's what we've got to do. We've got what, two more months before the caucuses start, but this is the question in front of us as a country. How do we think about how to go forward? Is the message going to be business as usual after Donald Trump? It's just too damn hard to get anything done. Therefore, we're just going to just kind of nibble at that problem of all the folks who can't get child care and teachers who are working three jobs?
Under Senator Warren's plan to pay for Medicare for all, a substantial chunk of funds would come from an employer contribution into the health care fund. Senator Sanders has not released a detailed plan explaining how he would pay for the system.
KK: Yes, I am, undocumented immigrants, excuse me.
Half the consulting class on our side has spent half of their careers, if not more, running opposition campaigns. They have had the tailwind of resentment and grievance fueling popular anger. Now they have to flip the script. They have to learn to highlight accomplishments like tax reform, job creation and regulatory relief.
Races like sheriffs and mayors and court judges. There's a particularly important Supreme Court race that's happening in the state. And both sides agreed that filling these roles was important for the continuance of state government.

The Green New Deal, as the name suggests, is essentially a program to create good jobs and simultaneously expand the use of clean energy, mostly through federal spending and performance standards. The resolution quickly became a symbol of the Democratic Party's insurgent progressives, attracting criticism from the right and the center. Some of the criticism was fair. The resolution is too vague to be rigorously analyzed; it's a statement of principles, not a detailed policy. In places, the Green New Deal puts more emphasis on left-wing priorities than on fighting climate change. It mentions repairing historic oppression yet omits nuclear power.
On Monday, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who tested positive for Covid-19 10 days ago, was moved into the intensive care unit of a London hospital after his condition worsened.
We're going to have that party who lost a bunch of seats on that in 2018 versus a party that we argue with each other about the best way to try to make sure that people get health care coverage, but at least we're trying to move in that direction. And this is a salient, personal, human fact. Your health care, your housing, getting your kids educated, getting your kids taken care of in child care. Every single one of those, I like where we are. I like where I am in this fight because I think it's the right fight to have and I think we must be in this fight. We cannot take a pass on this.
The request could further destabilize insurance markets as insurers are developing rates and deciding whether to participate in 2018.
NF: But it's also about the Medicare for all plan.
O.K.? And I have seen the billionaire go on TV and cry about it.
The point, however, is that politicians and pundits, especially on the right, constantly insist that presidential policies matter a lot. And Mr. Obama, in particular, has been attacked at every stage of his presidency for policies that his critics allege are job-killing — the former House speaker, John Boehner, once used the phrase seven times in less than 14 minutes. So the fact that the Obama job record is as good as it is tells you something about the validity of those attacks.
The case, California v. Texas, No. 19-840, was brought by Republican officials who said the law's mandate requiring health insurance coverage became unconstitutional after Congress in 2017 eliminated the penalty for failing to obtain coverage because it could no longer be justified as a tax.
In a democracy, how is it that they have so much political influence that one-tenth of 1 percent can say, I rather your kid have to deal with $50,000 in student loan debt, and I'd rather you never get a chance to get a child into day care, which means you either piece stuff together in crazy ways or quit your job. And I'd rather your public schools still have tiles falling out of the ceiling and textbooks that are 11 years old than that the top one-tenth of 1 percent has to pitch in 2 cents.
The notes recorded the deaths of so many, from Covid-19 and other illnesses and acts of violence. The emails document, frequently with just a few words, the work of firefighters and doctors and school cafeteria cooks — or, more often, the harrowing work they were about to face.
This is not how laws affecting the health of millions of people and an industry that accounts for about one-sixth of the American economy should be made. Yet, here we are. To senior Republicans like the health and human services secretary, Tom Price, this process is about getting to the lowest common denominator, not about improving health policy or providing people with better, more affordable medical care.
One by one, Democrats rose to voice their objections. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington said that Republicans were stealing health care from Americans. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said he was voting no because health care should not just be for the healthy and wealthy.
I think you're overlooking the places where we're not divided. I have three brothers back in Oklahoma. One is a Democrat. Do the math, the other two are not. And yet, all three of my brothers and tens of millions of people around this country get furious over the fact that Amazon reports $11 billion in profits last year and paid zero in taxes. All three of my brothers understand that we have an America that works great for giant drug companies, just not for people trying to fill a prescription. Works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for people who are worried about climate change.
And how does he dive back into that politically damaging fight?
Re Trump Declarations Seen as Threat to Rule of Law (front page, June 4):
UnitedHealth has bolstered its position, first by abandoning those profit-sapping exchanges wholesale. That move may have troubled the stock market, because it may seem to suggest that the company was giving up on what had been an important growth opportunity.
An expert on college affordability at the Urban Institute told The Times that Senator Warren's $50,000 debt clearance is too much. Setting the level at $10,000 instead would relieve debt for a third of all borrowers, according to their analysis.
Insurers in some states, including Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Tennessee and Texas, have said they intend to charge lower rates in 2019. Price increases this year were exceptionally large because insurers developed the rates in the spring of 2017 in a sea of uncertainty: Republicans in Congress were determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and no one could be sure what might replace it. Mr. Trump cut off a crucial source of income for insurers — cost-sharing subsidy payments — in October 2017, just as state officials were approving final rates for 2018.
Under Obamacare, Medicaid was available for Americans with low incomes whether they were employed or not. The Obama administration refused to allow work requirements, saying they were not consistent with the goals of Medicaid. Several Republican governors would like to give states the right to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients who have no young children and are not old or disabled. The Republicans' proposal would allow states to decide for themselves between the two systems.
To that end, Trump had directed the Justice Department on Monday to seek the invalidation of the entire law, backing a federal district judge in Texas who declared it unconstitutional late last year.
The reaction was even more intense in the Senate. Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, had planned to use the week to publicize his floor vote to force Democrats to take a stand on progressives' Green New Deal — an important party-building exercise for Republicans after Mr. Trump's decision to declare an emergency at the border sparked an insurrection in their ranks this month.
We don't have to speculate about how these systems would work in practice, because every advanced country except the U.S. has some form of universal coverage. Some, like Canada and Britain, use single-payer (in Britain the government also operates the hospitals and pays the doctors). Others, like Switzerland and the Netherlands, have a large role for private insurers.
House Speaker Paul D. Ryan and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, met last week with Mr. Price to hash out alternatives, and they have been in close contact with the relevant committee leaders and staff members to begin hammering out ideas that could come into relief at the end of the month, when Republicans have their annual policy retreat.
Times reporting from Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley found that Senator Warren's wealth tax plan has broad support, including from 77 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of Republicans, with the exception of one demographic: Republican men with college degrees.
In December, former Vice President Joe Biden said that he would consider choosing Senator Warren as his running mate and wondered whether she would choose him. The Senator, for her part, has suggested she might prefer a woman.
U.S. names envoy to Iran amid tensions with Tehran and criticism from conservatives. Robert Malley, seen with Secretary of State John Kerry in 2015. Mr. Malley has been tapped by President Biden to be his special envoy for Iran. Credit... Brian Snyder/Reuters President Biden has named Robert Malley, a veteran Middle East expert and former Obama administration official, to be his special envoy for Iran, despite charges from conservatives that Mr. Malley would offer too many concessions in trying to strike a new nuclear deal with Tehran. Two senior State Department officials said Mr. Malley would be responsible for persuading Tehran to rein in its nuclear program — and stop enriching uranium beyond limits imposed by a 2015 deal with world powers — and agree to new negotiations before the United States lifts its bruising economic sanctions against Iran. It is far from clear if the strategy, as directed by Mr. Biden, will succeed. Iran has repeatedly said it will not come back into compliance with the 2015 nuclear accord until the United States eases its sanctions, setting up a high-stakes contest over which side will blink first. Returning to the nuclear deal, which was negotiated by the Obama administration, was among Mr. Biden's campaign promises after President Donald J. Trump withdrew from it in 2018. Since then, Iran has steadily violated the agreement that had sought to limit its nuclear program, and last year, international inspectors concluded that it again had enough fuel to build a bomb.

It was a very pitched and partisan setting, obviously. I think the collateral damage there is what it did to his reputation across the aisle, which has not been repaired yet. But in a sense, that sort of played to some very, very strong suits that Lindsey Graham had, beginning with being something that was delightful to the president of the United States and his base.

Mark Zuckerberg has held the line on Facebook's decision to allow political ads, even as Twitter banned them.

Mr. Zuckerberg said this is about free speech and not the profit motive.
Inside the White House, strict rules aim to slow the spread of the coronavirus. President Biden swore in members of the White House staff remotely on Jan. 20. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Senior staff members in West Wing offices are prohibited from meeting together in an office for more than a total of 15 minutes in a day, according to a senior Biden administration official. No more than six people are allowed to gather in the Oval Office at a time, and a maximum of five staff members are allowed to meet together in the spacious office of the chief of staff, Ron Klain, the official said. That means that both the morning and afternoon senior staff meetings in the White House are conducted on video calls, even though many of the participants are working in offices near one another. In the Roosevelt Room, gatherings are limited to 10 people. And when staff members remove their masks to eat lunch at their desks, they are required to close their doors. Visitors are not allowed without approval, and West Wing staff members generally do not intermingle with the team working in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building across the street. As the new administration finds its footing, life in the West Wing has become incredibly disciplined, partly because of the way President Biden's team wants to work, but mostly because of the strict rules the administration has put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.

Single-payer advocates point out that the United States is the only advanced nation without universal health care, which is true. Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland have achieved universal coverage and affordable health care with, essentially, more comprehensive and generous forms of Obamacare that require people to buy insurance, tightly regulate insurers and provide subsidies to the poor and middle class.
WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that he never would have appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions had he known Mr. Sessions would recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation that has dogged his presidency, calling the decision very unfair to the president.
Medicare for all is the hottest idea in the Democratic presidential race for overhauling the nation's health care system, and it is a phrase quite likely to be heard repeatedly at the first debates this week. But despite all the buzz, it turns out that the concept is dividing the 2020 field.
In June, Senator Warren released a plan focused on voter disenfranchisement and election security. The plan proposes, among other measures, improved voting equipment across the country and bans on voter purges.
Also on Wednesday, prosecutors filed an indictment, including three counts of assaulting, resisting, or impeding certain officers using a dangerous weapon, against Robert Gieswein, 24, who is said to be a member of the militia group known as the Three Percenters. The F.B.I. has said Mr. Gieswein, who is from Woodland Park, Colo., posted photos on Facebook in which he is flashing hand signs commonly used by the Three Percenters while posing in front of the group's flag with others in clothing that included the Three Percenters logo.
Well, so what actually happens in the past year between Lindsey Graham and President Trump that explains this?
The stimulus package also subsidizes private health insurance premiums for newly unemployed workers. They typically have the opportunity to purchase their former employers' health benefits through a federal program called COBRA, which can often be prohibitively expensive because the employer is no longer paying a share of the worker's premium.
But despite Mr. Trump's longstanding desire to unwind the signature legislative achievement of his predecessor, many parts of the Affordable Care Act remain in place. And the Trump administration is even enforcing some of its provisions more aggressively than President Barack Obama did — a reality that has enraged business groups and Republicans in Congress who still want the law officially repealed.
Uno de los aspectos más populares del Obamacare es que prohíbe a las empresas de seguros que discriminen a la gente que tienen enfermedades que requieren de un cuidado frecuente como la diabetes o el cáncer. El asunto es cómo hacer que las personas se aseguren antes de que se enfermen. Puede crearse algo como un Medicare para todos, o bien, exigir a la gente que compre un seguro y ayudar a quienes tienen bajos ingresos a pagarlo.
He envisions a Rooseveltian campaign to get 100 million Covid vaccine shots into the arms of Americans in his first 100 days. There will be ramped-up testing, contact tracing and mobilization of at least 100,000 people to conquer the virus.
Look at the example. He said, I will take your money to lie about other candidates. What does that mean for our democracy? Not even meet the minimal standard that TV ads run, right?
And I think right now, the push should be not to expand because that's the issue that's on the table.
Does pointing out the possibility of incremental progress mean giving up on a truly universal system? No. By all means let's make something more ambitious, such as Medicare for all, a long-term goal. But this goal shouldn't stand in the way of policies that would immediately benefit millions of Americans, and save thousands of lives.
It'll be free for anybody who's under 18. It'll be free for a family of four making less than $50,000 a year, and it will have a small price for everyone else. This is the advantage to having already identified how you can pay for this.
Justice Anthony Kennedy's retirement has created the most important vacancy on the Supreme Court in our lifetimes. Whoever fills Justice Kennedy's seat will join an evenly divided court with the ability to affect the laws of the United States and the rights of its citizens for generations. Enormously important issues hang in the balance: the right of workers to organize, the pernicious influence of dark money in politics, the right of Americans to marry who they love, the right to vote.
Those delays have been preferable to lawmakers than eliminating the taxes entirely, given a total repeal would have added an estimated $310 billion to federal budget deficits over the next decade, Ms. MacGuineas's organization calculates. That price tag was too high to be included in the 2017 tax bill, which was limited in scope by Republicans' decision to pass the bill on party lines using a budget reconciliation bill that only allowed for $1.5 trillion in revenue losses over a decade.
An expert on college affordability at the Urban Institute told The Times that Senator Warren's $50,000 debt clearance is too much. Setting the level at $10,000 instead would relieve debt for a third of all borrowers, according to their analysis.
Health care was always going to be a big issue in the general election, and the coronavirus epidemic will put health care even more top of mind for voters, said Larry Levitt, the executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan research organization. Sometimes these health care debates can get a bit abstract, but when it's an immediate threat to the health of you and your family, it becomes a lot more real.
Last April, it announced that in the face of mounting losses from individual policies sold in public exchanges under Obamacare, it would radically cut its participation in those markets. It disclosed in its annual report in January that in 2017 the company will participate in individual public exchanges in three states, a reduction from 34 states in 2016. It also said that it would shed more than $4 billion in revenue from them, in an effort to cut its losses.
Public health experts say the entire global system of buying doses, pitting one country against another with little regard for equity, is unfit to the task of ending a pandemic that respects no borders. For the European Union, problems with its vaccination campaigns have reinforced criticism of the bloc's bureaucracy. Unable to speed up vaccine makers, the bloc's leaders have instead resorted to threats about the export process, a sign of the severe pressure facing them as the European Union falls far behind Britain and the United States, which made advanced purchases of vaccines earlier, and have been quicker to authorize the shots and get people inoculated. Britain has given vaccines to 10 percent of its people so far, compared to about 2 percent in the European Union. Britain was the first country to authorize a fully tested coronavirus vaccine, and the government of Prime Minister Boris Johnson has trumpeted its successes. Benjamin Mueller and
BS: Last question. What are you likely to fail at as president?
But now that defenders of the law have asked the Supreme Court to settle the case quickly, the president's lawyers say they are in no particular hurry. The case, which seeks to invalidate the entire health care law, can wait for the lower courts to consider certain questions more carefully, they said in a filing to the Supreme Court on Friday. There is no present, real-world emergency, the brief says, that would require the court to rush the case's progress.
Ultimately, however, Obama said the lessons of his time in office are being misunderstood in the election campaigns. If you look at the platforms, the economic platforms of the current Republican candidates for president, they don't simply defy logic and any known economic theories, they are fantasy, Obama said. Slashing taxes particularly for those at the very top, dismantling regulatory regimes that protect our air and our environment and then projecting that this is going to lead to 5 percent or 7 percent growth, and claiming that they'll do all this while balancing the budget. Nobody would even, with the most rudimentary knowledge of economics, think that any of those things are plausible.
KK: We're running out of time here.
— opponent, and I was calling Trump a race-baiting, religious —
And we had a black president.
What this means is that of the 27 million Americans who have either gained coverage through the Medicaid expansion or purchased insurance on the exchanges, only about two million are exposed to those Trump-engineered premium hikes. That's still a lot of people, but it's not enough to get a death spiral going. In fact, for complicated reasons (silver-loading — don't ask), after-subsidy premiums have actually gone down for many people.
Critics of the wealth tax point out that only four European countries now have one, down from 12 in 1990. In France, the wealth tax triggered an exodus of the ultrarich and didn't raise as much revenue as anticipated.
So let's assume Mr. Ryan isn't an exceptional Republican political liability. What about on policy? We can assess his record by looking at what bills the speaker decided to consider in the House. For that, there are two dynamics to assess: One involves keeping things off the agenda that could split the party, even if they could pass the House with votes chipped in from the other party. As Dennis Hastert, a former speaker, put it, The job of the speaker is not to expedite legislation that runs counter to the wishes of the majority of the majority. The second dynamic entails advancing policies favored by his party.
And there was Senator Joe Manchin, in a sky-blue shirt with the state's craggy outline on its crest, walking the route and greeting voters who brought up his favorite issue themselves.
While the investigation led by Robert S. Mueller III did not conclude that Mr. Trump or his campaign coordinated with Russia, according to a summary of Mr. Mueller's report by Attorney General William P. Barr, the special counsel stopped short of absolving Mr. Trump on obstruction.
In particular, there is a sense — a strictly limited sense, as I'll explain, but real nonetheless — in which the legislation, in addition to reviving the notion of government as the solution, not the problem, also ends the end of welfare as we know it.
Mr. Biden was also pushed to defend some of his own record, including his support for the 1994 crime bill. He repeated a claim he has made before — that the crime bill did not put more people in jail like it's argued. Many experts have linked the measure to an acceleration in mass incarceration.
# #5 Tax credits New change Most people buying their own insurance get a flat tax credit based on age, but the Senate might increase funding for Americans between 50 and 64. Previously Most people buying their own insurance got a flat tax credit based on age. Who's happy with this change Moderates, particularly those from rural districts
Of course, another self-funding billionaire — Tom Steyer — has had little success with the vast sums he has spent on his presidential campaign. With more than $150 million spent in television ads, Mr. Steyer placed seventh in Iowa, sixth in New Hampshire and fifth in Nevada. But Mr. Steyer, who has never held elected office before, started the race with slightly less name recognition than Mr. Bloomberg, and he focused heavily on early voting states.
The department's second argument is even more outlandish than its first. It relies on a legal doctrine known as severability, under which courts decide whether the invalidation of one statutory provision requires the court to invalidate related ones. The Justice Department claims that the tax bill's super mandate is unconstitutional (something that no one in Congress or the presidency noticed when they enacted the bill) and that courts must invalidate other rules along with it.
The American people would have to transition. Americans are more decentralized, diverse and individualistic than people in the nations with single-payer systems. They are more suspicious of centralized government and tend to dislike higher taxes.
The Trump administration said these concerns were unfounded. But in a preamble to the proposed rules, it said, Individuals who are likely to purchase short-term, limited-duration insurance are likely to be relatively young or healthy.
United States troops have recently resumed counterterrorism operations in Syria, suggesting that President Trump intends to leave most of the 500 troops currently stationed there (many of them in combat). Mr. Trump has been inconsistent in his strategy on troops in Syria; Senator Warren has been firm in her stance that all combat troops should come home.
It means democratic socialism or whatever the phrase is, Mr. Biden said. I think Bernie is a decent, honorable man who means what he says.
One of my favorite things that I've ever seen about the Senate — now a political science professor, but then I think he was a grad student — David Broockmann was doing archival research, and he sent me this little letter that Mike Manatos, who was Lyndon Johnson's Senate liaison, so his lead representative to the Senate, sent Johnson about Medicare after the '64 election. Manatos says that given what we've seen in terms of who does and does not support Medicare and given who lost and won seats in the election, that if everybody is there and present and accounted for and voting, Medicare will pass with 55 votes. And at that point, you needed a two-thirds majority to break a filibuster. So that wasn't anywhere near what you would need to break a filibuster. But they didn't expect there would be a filibuster. And so, as you say, by then, when the thing's passing, a bunch of other Republicans jump on board so it ends up having a pretty strong majority in its favor. But the idea that you would imagine passing something like Medicare and not worry about the filibuster. And by the way, it's not like there wasn't a filibuster in that time. The filibuster was being used constantly by the Southern bloc — and these were Southern Democrats — to block civil rights and anti-lynching laws. I mean, it has a horrifying history in this period. But it's just not used, really, on anything else.
The Supreme Court needs to be an institution that helps to undergird limited constitutional government, said Mr. Leo, 51, whose cerebral, unassuming demeanor belies the enormous clout he has developed in Washington.
Usually, about a quarter of the Connector's enrollees are between 18 and 34. But that figure was 40 percent for those who signed up during the special enrollment period, suggesting that the pandemic may have nudged so-called Young Invincibles to decide health insurance was worth the cost.
Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, another moderate, had similar thoughts. I'm here getting votes, Ms. Klobuchar said in an interview on Sunday. It's not something where I can just — what would be the word — transport in a bunch of ads. She called on Mr. Bloomberg to go on the shows that every other candidate goes on, on the Sunday shows and the like.
The economics recommendations to Mr. Biden include more expansive and expensive plans than he has embraced in the campaign. They are heavily focused on addressing racial inequality and on getting Americans back to work in the wake of the recession caused by the pandemic.
Such policies do not have to cover pre-existing conditions and can exclude common benefits like maternity care, mental health care or prescription drugs. The former administration also made it easier for small businesses to band together and offer plans that escape some of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Biden has asked federal agencies to re-examine these rules, which could take months to undo. Should the rules be overturned, patients who have such policies would be unable to renew them, which could leave them without insurance if they think coverage is too expensive. Mr. Biden campaigned on raising the subsidies for Obamacare plans to make them more affordable. Mr. Biden's executive actions on abortion put him in the center of the nation's long-running culture wars. Like his Democratic predecessors, Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, he will immediately rescind the global gag rule — often called the Mexico City Policy — which bars international nonprofit organizations that provide abortion counseling from using American tax dollars. The rule has been riding a philosophical seesaw for decades — in place when a Republican occupies the White House, and overturned when a Democrat moves in. Mr. Biden's revocation of the Mexico City Policy was part of an order that restored funding terminated by Mr. Trump to the United Nations Population Fund, known as UNFPA, the world's leading provider of family planning services, and a major resource for millions of women in more than 120 countries.
Lonnie Carpenter, above, a self-employed roofer, said it would have been tough to survive without his insurance after a back injury.
Nepal on Wednesday began the first phase of a nationwide vaccination campaign for health care workers and other frontline personnel, including cleaners, security guards, and ambulance and hearse drivers. Nepal is one of several countries in South and Southeast Asia to have received donated doses from India of Covishield, a vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India. But the Covishield shipment to Nepal was for one million doses, and the government has not yet explained how it plans to execute its plan of vaccinating 72 percent of its 30 million people. Youmi Kim , Vivian Wang, Richard C. Paddock, Bhadra Sharma and
As the sound cut in and out and the audio often came out garbled, Mr. Biden sought to host what his campaign had called a virtual town hall with Illinois, in which he spoke to supporters and voters via video in place of an originally scheduled Chicago get-out-the-vote event — or at least, that was the goal.
Well, the way I've thought about it is that Trump exploded an old Republican synthesis program and agenda, without really replacing it with anything coherent and fleshed out. So, the Republicans are left in a state of disorientation and don't really know what they stand for and are feeling their way forward in that respect. The divergence you're talking about between, let's say, the donor base and the voting base of the Republican Party, there's always been a difference, as there is in the Democratic Party. I think that divergence got a little bit wider during the Obama years. And it's not just a matter of interest groups within the Republican Party. I think it's also intellectually, the Republican agenda became further and further detached from reality, because it wasn't adapting with the times and it was still keyed towards the circumstances of America in 1981. So, I go on this tangent a little bit, because there is this tendency, sometimes, to think of the history of conservatism as though Obama-era conservatism is the way it was always. But in some ways that extremely anti-government and somewhat rigid and doctrinaire economic libertarianism was unusual for the Republican Party. It wasn't the way the party was under Reagan, or under George W. Bush. And so, in some ways, Trump was a correction to an aberration that got the party back in an odd way towards more of its historical self definition.
I disagreed with them. So for example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership had a robust investor state dispute resolution mechanism, which multiple of our trade treaties have had for decades now. And I just think that's fundamentally wrong. It's a two-tier system that says, in effect, we'll make a bunch of promises in a trade deal on the environment, on use of prison labor, child labor and on anything else, and then we'll give two entirely different enforcement mechanisms.
But let me go back to a couple of things in there because there's a bunch of interesting stuff in that answer, and I want to stay here on institutions for a minute. I want to express sympathy for the idea that there are a lot of key institutions that very much lean left in their personnel. I think that's true for the media. I think that is true for academia, without doubt. I could completely understand conservatives saying that they need their own counterparts that are based in places that are more conservative because where people are matters, that are filled with people who are more conservative, but that do the same kind of thing. So you're at the American Enterprise Institute. The American Enterprise Institute is, in some ways, a reaction to a sense that Brookings is a left-leaning institution, and it's, I would call it, the center left. And AEI, in my view, is a really good conservative institution. I don't agree with everybody there. Some people I really disagree with. But it functions the way I would understand that kind of operation to function, which is it does the same kind of work as Brookings, but it is staffed by more conservative people. That has not happened in a lot of other places where Republicans have tried to build alternatives. I'll take the media, which I know very well, as an example here.
Jesse Wegman: Senator, I want to just take you back for a moment to Mara's question about swing states and swing state voters and your point about large structural changes that people warn you off. The other day, you repeated your argument that you wanted to be the last president to win the Electoral College and the first to win the national popular vote. How do you expect — I'm assuming you're not talking about a constitutional amendment. How do you expect to get there in five years, unless you're the president, unless you win the Electoral College and Donald Trump wins the popular vote in 2020?
Gail: Wow, Trump continues to bring us together. He might be dividing the country but he's uniting the columnists.
The thing is, Australia's summer of fire is only the latest in a string of catastrophic weather events over the past year: unprecedented flooding in the Midwest, a heat wave in India that sent temperatures to 123 degrees, another heat wave that brought unheard-of temperatures to much of Europe.
Wait. No. Is that true? In what sense?
CW: Sure. And they have too much power, not just in an economy, they have too much power in a democracy, and they keep consolidating and expanding — are you worried about individual employees there? You know, Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel.
The new president wants to raise taxes on corporations, strengthen labor unions, expand Obamacare with a public option, stall the existential threat of climate change and spend $2 trillion on energy and infrastructure. On Day 1, he rejoined the community of nations who've agreed to the Paris climate accord.
WASHINGTON — Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has sat in the center seat on the Supreme Court bench since his arrival in 2005. But only this term did he assume true leadership of the court.
And today, the president summoned G.O.P. lawmakers to the White House for the second time in less than a month, after two versions of a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare failed.
Yeah, and I think that gets to the fundamental unsustainability of the Manchin, Sinema position. It would be one thing if by standing in defense of the filibuster, that they could leverage a big bipartisan deal that would be an alternative approach to going it alone with the Democrats and passing things on a 50-vote threshold. But as we're seeing on COVID aid, the idea that 10 Republicans are going to give Democrats their votes for just about anything is laughable. They're not giving them 10 votes for COVID aid, and I don't think they'll give them their votes for anything else. And so, Manchin and Sinema are quickly faced with a much more binary choice, which is, do you get anything done at all, or do you not get anything done? And if you care at all about the success of the Biden administration and the success of all the Democrats who are up on the ballot in 2022, when you're faced with a choice between delivering results and failing because you care more about the filibuster than about getting things done, I ultimately think they will come around. But they are, as you say, they're endorsing the premise on principle of passing big things, multitrillion dollar packages, on a majority vote basis. And so once you start to go down that road, unless there is some massive outbreak of bipartisanship, which I think is vanishingly unlikely, then I think that that's the choice they're going to face.
Though candidates on the right are full of fire and brimstone this year, the trend away from optimism is most pronounced among liberals. A century ago Progressives were the optimists, believing society could be improved, while conservatism saw the end-times approaching. Today progressive thought embraces Judgment Day, too. Climate change, inequality and racial tension are viewed not as the next round of problems to be solved, but as proof that the United States is horrible.
Our reporters reconstructed how Mr. Trump came to his decision.
archived recording (mitch mcconnell) So I made it clear to him we were not going to be doing that in the Senate.
I have no idea how these bills will fare in the Republican-controlled Senate (and they have not yet even been passed by the full House), although I will note that the Senate is the same institution which devoted itself in 2017 to the noble dream of taking away health care coverage from 29 million people by repealing the Affordable Care Act. That effort failed by a single vote, of course — the last great political act of John McCain, who, although no fan of Obamacare, hated even more the idea of bullies picking on the little guy.
Trump just picked a fight with our closest NATO allies, including Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau — who Trump's team said stabbed us in the back after Trudeau's mild-mannered defense of his own country's trade policy on dairy imports. This after Trump has had nary a word of censure for Russia's President Vladimir Putin, who stabbed us in the chest with the biggest cyberattack on our democracy ever.
Given greater flexibility to set their own policies, several governors said, they would like to trim the number of people in Medicaid and the array of benefits offered in both the public program and private plans sold in the markets.
Senator Warren said in an interview with Vox's Ezra Klein that many other economic policies should be accomplished before the government starts sending out checks to every American, as Mr. Yang's Freedom Dividend proposes.
The prices are significantly higher than those that existed before Obamacare and, nationally, expensive premiums have long been a pain point for the Affordable Care Act. But the plans that exist now offer a wider set of benefits and cannot limit annual or lifetime benefits. That's a key trade-off that Obamacare's architects felt was worth making: a requirement that insurers cover a wide range of medical conditions, even if that meant plans became more expensive.
The plans tend to limit how much care they will pay for in a given year. That means that if you develop an expensive illness, your insurance could get cut off when you hit the limit. A typical short-term plan covers a maximum of $250,000 to $2 million in medical care, according to the Kaiser study. Major medical plans, which follow rules set by the Affordable Care Act, can't impose any such limits.
Tariffs are one of the tools. Economic agreements across countries, that many countries join together, and say, we're not going to let anyone import if they're using prison labor, for example, or if they're dumping dangerous chemicals into the water. There are lots of ways to do this, but we can't simply think of this as a tariff, no tariff protectionism barrier. It's not. It's about regulations. Look at the dang NAFTA 2.0, look at what we were negotiating for T.T.I.P. T.T.I.P. was about financial regulations, not about goods that were moving, in a sense, the old way that people think about, that you put a bunch of stuff on a barge and you ship it across the Atlantic Ocean. And we just need to tune into the fact we know what our advantage is and we need to use it, not to try to lock others out, but to try to encourage others to come in.
After six moderate Republican senators signed the declaration, Mr. McCarthy labeled them, in Trumpian fashion, Snow White and the Six Dwarves. He had Ms. Smith removed from her post on the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (replacing her with Richard Nixon) and lavished support on her challenger in the next election (she won anyway).
LK: There's a growing problem of harassment and trespassing at abortion clinics.
The second reason to be skeptical of the critics is that their big assumption depends on the belief that a long shutdown would have put more political pressure on the Republicans and Democrats. As evidence, the critics cite polls showing that most voters believe the Dreamers deserve to remain in this country.
In addition to people who lack insurance, the open enrollment period is expected to apply to people who have A.C.A. coverage but want to switch plans, Ms. Cox said.
[For an even deeper look at what's on Paul Krugman's mind, sign up for his weekly newsletter.]
Yeah, democratic socialism. It's a case for a certain kind of welfare state. And it's a very smart book and one that every conservative should contend with and should think through.
I mean, one of the main ways we can kind of recognize this as a society and the importance of language for people who have worries about it is for cisgender people to start adopting this. I didn't think exactly that what I was advocating was to use language to change politics as much as language has to reflect how our culture and politics are changing. And the culture is changing, and we really have to match the language or at least turn out some wrinkles in the language in order to match how people feel and how the language reflects how they feel.
But economists on the left and the right argue that to really rein in health costs, Congress should scale back or eliminate the tax exclusion on what employers pay toward employees' health insurance premiums. Under current law, those premiums are not subject to the payroll or income taxes that are taken out of employees' wages, an arrangement that vastly benefits middle- and upper-income people.
Well, you know, it obviously depends on the program, but I worry about — for example, increasing the dollar payment on Section 8 vouchers, it doesn't seem to increase the supply of housing. Instead, it seems to make a segment of landlords richer. So I'd rather take that money and put it directly into increasing housing supply.
And he actually got a fair amount of Dodd-Frank. And — that he did, but ——
Fewer still would make such a tasteless comparison.
You see, I thought their behavior was cynical and strategic: They opposed Obamacare because they thought there was political mileage in scaring people about change, and also in denying Obama any successes. Oh, and their donors really hated the taxes on the rich that pay for the ACA's subsidies. And right up through 2016 they could hope to convince voters that they had a secret plan for something much better than Obamacare.

Carrying out Mr. Cohen's elaborate deceptions and gathering enough successful ones to make a seven-episode series takes time, though — Showtime said Who Is America? has been in the works for a year. And that may have something to do with why the premiere episode feels tepid and inconsequential. During that year, we've gotten so used to people saying crazy and hurtful things of their own free will in public that watching them being tricked into doing so doesn't have the entertainment value it used to.
That Brill sees hope emerging from the literal rubble shows the limits of a certain strain of politics, one that sees public policy mainly in terms of incentives, with the most desirable outcome being an electorate that will now settle in the middle. Call me pessimistic, but if a bridge collapsed on the same day as two train derailments, a blackout and another water crisis, chances are the result wouldn't be less rancor but more.
Since scolding member nations at the 2017 summit, Mr. Trump has followed up with strongly worded letters to NATO nations advising that if they don't increase their payments, it will be increasingly hard to justify why American soldiers continue to sacrifice their lives overseas.
In an era of growing income and wealth inequality, Obamacare was a starkly redistributive law. Not only did it subsidize health insurance for those with low and middle incomes, but it also raised taxes on high earners. This mix of policies made the law controversial, but it also furthered the Obama administration's goals of narrowing the gap between rich and poor Americans.
is not rooted in scientific evidence, but the lack of it: Pregnant women have been barred from participating in clinical trials of the vaccines, reflecting a long tradition of excluding pregnant women from biomedical research and one that is now being challenged. While the rationale is ostensibly to protect women and their unborn children, prohibiting pregnant women from studies pushes the risk out of the carefully controlled environment of a clinical trial and into the real world. Vaccines are generally considered to be safe, and pregnant women have been urged to be immunized for influenza and other diseases since the 1960s, even in the absence of rigorous clinical trials to test them. As obstetricians we are often faced with difficult decisions about using interventions in pregnancy that have not been properly tested in pregnancy, said Dr. Denise Jamieson, an obstetrician at Emory University in Atlanta and a member of the Covid expert group at the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The college strongly advocated including pregnant and breastfeeding women in the vaccine trials. In a statement, the C.D.C. said on Thursday that based on how the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines work, they are unlikely to pose a specific risk for pregnant women. The C.D.C. 's recommendation may make sense for the United States, where women may easily be able to consult with their health care providers, said Joachim Hombach, a health adviser to the W.H.O. on immunizations. But the W.H.O.
If Mr. Trump and Mr. Price can make peace with the health law, there are opportunities to steer it in a more conservative direction. The law gives broad authority to the executive branch to shape health care policy. So far, the health law has been driven by Obama administration priorities, but that could change.
KK: Should it be against the law for the children of sitting presidents and vice presidents to serve on the boards of foreign companies or otherwise profit from their parents' service?
I believe we should have Medicare for all.
President Trump's own words tell us that his nominee to the court will almost certainly vote to overturn Roe v. Wade and eviscerate affordable access to health care for millions of Americans. President-elect Donald Trump said in November of 2016 that I'm pro-life; the judges will be pro-life. During the campaign, he speculated that after he appointed two or three judges to the bench, Roe v. Wade will go back to the individual states.
KK: We have some foreign policy questions for you.
The law also made other changes, like cutting the amount the federal government paid hospitals and other providers as well as private Medicare Advantage plans. Undoing the cuts could increase the program's overall costs by hundreds of millions of dollars, according to Ms. Neuman. Premiums for as many as 55 million people under the program could go up as a result.
archived recording Even Republicans appear bewildered by President Trump's promise to make the G.O.P. the party of health care.
So Rubio and Lee were the two Republican senators who had been most forward on trying to put forward pro-family, pro-child policies more recently. And their immediate opposition, combined with the silence or opposition of any other Republican Senator, really struck me for its ferocity actually. One of the reasons I'd wanted to chat with you about this is that this seems to me to put two parts of the Republican coalition very much in tension. There is the Paul Ryan side of the party, the welfare reform side of the party that says, if you want to get anything from the government, anything at all, you have to work, including as a single mother, including by the way, in some cases as a married parent. And then another part of the party that has traditionalist family views. It would like to see more parents, but, I think, usually mothers staying at home with their children that would like to see it be more possible to have a single breadwinner families. And particularly in this post-Trump moment where I do think there's been more assertiveness again from social conservatives, saying they've gotten a raw deal in the party recently. Romney seems to be coming in and saying, the party's focus on work, on paid formal labor, as the only kind of valuable work and its dismissal of parenting as a valuable form of work, is wrong.
But it seems to me the real debate is whether the only way to make care affordable is for the government essentially to dictate prices. The hospitals and doctors are none too happy about that prospect.
Even worse is the way budget reconciliation quietly decides which kinds of problems the Senate addresses, and which it ignores, years after year. Both House and Senate Democrats have said that their first bill will be the For The People Act, a package making it easier and safer to vote, and weakening the power big donors wield in politics by matching small donor donations at a 6:1 rate. But the For The People Act can't pass through the budget reconciliation process, so it's a dead letter.
Democrats enjoy a strong edge with voters on health care, with 40 percent trusting them on the issue, compared with 23 percent who trust Republicans more, according to an April poll by The Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.
At times, however, what looked like the right thing was, from Needham's vantage, in fact the wrong thing. In April 2011, for example, a bill dismantling part of Obamacare did clear the House and then the Senate, and was signed into law by President Obama without hesitation. It was a measure to eliminate the requirement that small companies submit 1099 forms for all transactions exceeding $600, which essentially served as a tax to help pay for the program and which Heritage Action had condemned as burdensome and onerous, guaranteed to generate paperwork and high accounting fees.
Look, we can work — and this is what we should have done. We should have been pushing for negotiations with Turkey, with our allies, in order to protect the Kurds. And we could do that or could have done this as part of withdrawal. We could use economic pressure, we can use diplomatic pressure. We can use coalescing with our allies in order to bring pressure to protect the Kurds, and I think that's what we should have done. We've already abandoned the Kurds in the worst possible way and sent a huge signal to the rest of the world that the United States, at least under the Trump administration, is not a reliable ally.
But for now, they are trying to make the most of the few hours in which their Iowa fates are still, sort of, in their hands.
It's that you don't get the tariff benefit. This is what it's really about. Where's the baseline? Right? And is the baseline one that says, across the board, you've got to give plenty of notice. You've got to work through, make sure you've got something that's achievable for countries we trade with. But this is not like trying to institute a trade war. This is not like saying we're mad at you and therefore we're going to impose all these tariffs on you, and doing it as Donald Trump has done by tweet.
Who feels the Bern? [CROWD CHEERING] [MUSIC]
KK: Well, it has to come to the Senate floor. I mean, Mitch McConnell already has an anti-corruption, election reform bill [passed by the House].
At the same time, you don't want to create some sort of narrative of historical inevitability of the return of bigotry and racism. Right? George W. Bush campaigned in almost all of the ways that liberals now miss about Republican politicians. Right? He went to mosques after 9/11. He pushed a huge program for fighting AIDS in Africa. His was a conservatism of some kind of racial outreach. So you have to ask the question, you know, well, what changed between 2000 and 2016? And I think the big answer is that George W. Bush's foreign policy was a failure. And then we had a huge financial crisis. And we have a host of socioeconomic problems in America that the Republican message wasn't addressing.

These days, no less an authority than Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said recently that God wanted Donald Trump to become president.
The 2010 health care law is under fire once again because of a ruling by a federal judge in Texas in December, in which he declared the law unconstitutional .
Over several decades, it's become increasingly clear that how immigration debates are framed is important. One of the more subtle anti-immigration tactics — employed by the Trump, Kennedy and Johnson administrations, as well as some on the political left — is to suggest that reducing immigration could preserve more jobs for American workers and lead to higher wages, but economic research has consistently disputed the notion that limiting immigration would increase domestic employment or raise average wages. The prevailing view of economists is that immigration increases economic growth; while some workers might benefit from immigration restrictions, more would suffer.
I really wonder if that room for compromise is actually there, and I mean that in this way. I can really track the divisions on the Democratic side around policy. I can really tell you which part of the party is supporting Medicare For All and which part isn't, and it's a real difference. It's going to lead them to do different things and in different ways. And the Republican Party, my background and my present, I guess, is as a policy reporter. You and I used to have lunch and argue about Medicare For All for long periods of time. I often feel, particularly through the Trump era, that when I'm trying to track Republican Party policy divides, I'm tracking something that both is there and isn't. It is there rhetorically, and people will talk in different ways. You'll have a Josh Hawley or a Tom Cotton or a Marco Rubio or Tucker Carlson give pretty interesting speeches — and a Donald Trump, in his own way, in 2016. And then when it comes time to govern, there's a lot less there, that the policy is much more symbolic than it is anything else and that trying to follow the Republican Party this way and trying to then assess what they might compromise on or not just doesn't end up working out because that's not the beating heart of it.
Brent Staples: But she needed the Triangle Shirtwaist fire. What is the contemporary equivalent of the Shirtwaist fire?
A lot of corporate leaders have risen to the moment, throwing their companies into the race to produce masks, hospital gowns and other critically needed equipment. That's been a plus — although we're still waiting for all those testing sites Walmart and CVS were going to be welcoming to their parking lots.
Paradoxically, Mr. Trump reached the same conclusion as President Barack Obama for a completely different reason. Mr. Obama refused to allow partial expansion of Medicaid because he wanted states to go for the full expansion envisioned in the Affordable Care Act.
Novavax's Vaccine Works Well Except on Variant First Found in South Africa Fauci urges a speedy return to school. Pregnant women are getting conflicting advice about vaccines. And New York seriously undercounted virus deaths in nursing homes, investigators say.
I'm sorry, say it again. Facebook?
Legal experts across ideologies criticized that decision. The Trump administration , which has long waged war against President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement, has more or less embraced the lower court's ruling.
I think part of the reason that it can be effective sometimes is that it does link back to what we consider sort of a foundational American value. And you hear people talking about free speech, and you hear people talking about the right of the minority to have their say and not be trampled upon by the majority. And you think, oh, yeah, that's actually a good idea. But when you see it in its use, it is far more consistently applied in defense of the wealthy, the powerful, and the oppressive, than it is applied in defense of minorities. That's a structural factor. It's because conservatives, the party that's interested in maintaining the status quo, already have more power. So a tool that serves to block change helps them preserve power. And so it's not a coincidence that it's often used as a euphemistic defense of the wealthy and the powerful. And that is today how it continues to be used in the Senate.
Yes sir, that will be a revolution!
Mr. Trump suspended H-1Bs and other work visas through at least the end of the year, denying employment permits for hundreds of thousands of skilled foreign workers like programmers. Seasonal hospitality workers and work-study students are also affected.
In terms of your own writing, you're a long way from the guy who made his name with a dense academic book like The Signifying Monkey. Something like Stony the Road is written in much simpler language with much less jargon. How do you make sense of that evolution? The Signifying Monkey is my tenure book. I was just trying to get tenure. I was trying to be a bridge between the black tradition and poststructuralism and deconstruction. Then I got tenure, and as far as the evolution of my own prose, once you get tenure, you could write films, you could do anything. A crucial point came when I gave a lecture at Howard University. A friend of mine invited me down to deliver my essay called Binary Oppositions in Chapter 1 of 'Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass.' I thought I was introducing structuralism. When I was done, I expected a standing ovation. The first question I got was: Yeah, brother. All we want to know is, was Booker T. Washington an Uncle Tom or not? That had a profound effect on me. I have an ego. I want the audience to be with me. That's what you see in my evolution.
Typically, Americans without a special circumstance can buy Obamacare insurance only during a six-week period in the fall, a restriction meant to encourage people to hold coverage even when they are healthy. The sign-up period for this year's coverage ended in mid-December, with enrollments only slightly higher than they were last year. But the Trump administration did little to advertise it. The Biden administration plans to have a large marketing campaign to announce the new opportunity and encourage people to enroll in health plans, two of the people said.
And one of the reasons that they were unable to do it is that at the last minute, a small group of liberals got cold feet and decided that their short-term interests outweighed the structural advantage of getting rid of the electoral college. So you see how that worked out. I think that when you have the opportunity to fix some of these structural inequities, if we had taken that opportunity in 1970, George W. Bush would never have been president, nor would Donald Trump have been president. So I think that the advantages of trying to fix these structural imbalances when you have the opportunity far outweighs the narrow gains of keeping them in place, especially when your opponents can simply get rid of those narrow gains whenever they decide they want to if they're back in power.
Trump Claims to Protect Pre-Existing Health Conditions. That's Not What the Government Says.
What does it mean for the Republican Party and for Republican Party politicians that in the most recent Pew poll I saw, 64 percent of Republicans think Donald Trump actually won the election, that in a fair vote count, he won? Almost two-thirds of Republicans believe that.
In the October Democratic debate, Times national editor Marc Lacey asked Mr. Yang to comment on Senator Warren's calls to break up companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google. Mr. Yang said Senator Warren is correct in her diagnosis of the problem but breaking up the companies isn't an adequate solution because using a 20th-century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new tool kit.
Right now there are two big progressive ideas out there: the Green New Deal on climate change and Medicare for all on health reform. Both would move U.S. policy significantly to the left. Each is sponsored by a self-proclaimed socialist: the Green New Deal by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Medicare for all by Bernie Sanders. (Of course, neither of them is a socialist in the traditional sense.) Both ideas horrify not just conservatives but also many self-proclaimed centrists.

We can use coalescing with our allies in order to bring pressure to protect the Kurds, and I think that's what we should have done.

I've been in favor of getting rid of carried interest for years. –Clinton. No! She didn't seriously try on this, as some members did. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
This lie was invented by Sarah Palin in 2009, during the fight for what would become the Affordable Care Act. It was the hysterical version of the common conservative critique that universal health care means government rationing.
CW: Can I ask about that?
Clinton notes that as SecState she advocated for women's rights. True. On every trip, she raised issues of trafficking or child marriage. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
Mr. Trump appeared to be unclear both about the timing of already scheduled votes in Congress and about the difficulty of his demand — a repeal vote probably some time next week and a replacement very quickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter.
Nick Fox: What did you think of the standards in the Trans-Pacific deal?

If he fails, well, I'm sorry to remind you that most Irish poetry is rooted in despair, in a country whose currency for centuries was misery. Still, in Ireland, poets have moved the masses to uprisings and greatness — most notably, the Easter 1916 rebellion that eventually helped lead to a free Ireland.
In June, Senator Warren released a plan focused on voter disenfranchisement and election security. The plan proposes, among other measures, improved voting equipment across the country and bans on voter purges.
You know, when I put together my anti-corruption plan, which is a big plan about the influence of money, I didn't put the provision in, but it was mostly because it's like so many things, I hadn't actually seen the implications of it. I think it's actually a very bad idea, and I would like to see it as part of an anti-corruption —
Whether we're talking about workers or we're talking about the environment, who has to meet what standards? And there are big corporations who figured out how to game the system. Where standards are high, then move that part of the operation somewhere else where standards are low and save a nickel. Because these corporations, they don't have any loyalty to a country, they just have loyalty to their own bottom line. And they play this all around the world.
In that sense, the role he is most comfortable occupying is the job he was once so over.
The success came during the Obama administration, when she pushed for an agency to protect consumers against banks' misbehavior. The idea was new. It was also simple enough for voters to understand. She hawked it on The Daily Show With Jon Stewart. This time, Warren's side won. Trump has since constrained the agency, but it still exists and is still doing good .
The advertisement, Mr. McCain's first television ad of the election cycle, began airing on Tuesday on network affiliates in Phoenix. It replays an interview in which Ms. Kirkpatrick declares that the health care law is the vote she is most proud of, while recounting problems with the new insurance coverage in Arizona, including premium increases and the withdrawal from the plan by a major insurer.
These are all states that said that the public health crisis was too great for them to hold in-person elections in March. But there's one state that refuses to budge, even as public health officials are urging them and states across the country have taken that drastic step. It's Wisconsin.
It's a pretty extraordinary step for the president to take sides, not just against a law that's already on the books, but really the biggest piece of social legislation that's been passed in recent history. And he does it at the urging of some of his most conservative advisers in the White House, including the chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney —
That loss shows that there are no guaranteed formulas for success in climate politics. If the oil and coal industries decide to fight, they can expend a lot of money and power. But the experiences in Arizona, Michigan and Nevada — not to mention California — at least clarify the political dynamics. When the debate is about the cost of living, climate activists are in trouble. When it's about clean energy or people's health, they have a much better chance.
President Trump hates the West Coast. He has called California out of control and boasted about my sick idea to dump migrants into the progressive cities in this time zone. Worst of all, his administration is actively working to take away health care from more than five million people in California alone.
The House vote would come after the Senate narrowly approved the same measure, a budget blueprint, early Thursday morning. Americans woke up Thursday to the realization that a Republican Congress was serious about repealing President Obama's signature domestic achievement — a move that could leave 20 million Americans unsure of their health coverage and millions more wondering if protections offered by the Affordable Care Act could soon be taken away.
The lawsuit quotes from the scripts being used by the brokers. What's the point of paying all that money every month if it's not going to cover the most important things, right??? the broker asks. This plan covers you from Day 1 …'
His remarks come as Mr. Sanders has appeared to gain ground here in South Carolina, a state Mr. Biden has considered his electoral firewall, after the Vermont senator soundly defeated Mr. Biden in the first three nominating contests.
Yes! The same guy who ran one of the most boring presidential races in modern history. (There's no question it's not good being poor.) Early this year he turned into an impeachment hero. Now he's calling for a voice against racism and marching for Black Lives Matter.
I'm going to repeal and replace your disastrous Obamacare. [CROWD CHEERING] Much cheaper, much better.
Republican leaders have long argued that fixing federal funding for Medicaid would ultimately produce significant savings in the federal budget, and the C.B.O. estimates that changes to Medicaid would decrease direct spending by $880 billion over 10 years.
Well, there are elements to that bill that I would support, and there are elements that I would not. There's a lot of things dumped in there, some of which are just ways of helping Democrats, but others are, I think, ways of broadening the electorate. I would support much more experimentation with things like rank-choice voting. I think the House should allow multi-member districts, which could be done just by a small change in federal law, ways of allowing the diversity of the country to be reflected a little more, especially in the House of Representatives. I think there is room for experimentation within the boundaries of the constitutional system that reaches much further than we've allowed for, and in general, that we should think of this moment as a time to try some institutional reforms, to expand the House some, which is way overdue and could help in a lot of ways, including by rebalancing the electoral college and other things, to try some reforms to the budget process in Congress that could help break some logjams, and to try some electoral reforms. The coming decade ought to be a decade when we try a lot of these kinds of ideas out and get ourselves into a mode where we think about changing rules to improve things. I just don't happen to think that the protections against majoritarianism are the right rules to play with.
archived recording (tony evers) I urge the legislators to take this call for a special session seriously.
Government, declared Ronald Reagan in his first Inaugural Address, is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem. Republicans have echoed his rhetoric ever since. Somehow, though, they've never followed through on the radical downsizing of government their ideology calls for.
1. Senate Republican leaders are barreling toward a showdown vote as early as Tuesday to begin debate on repealing the health law. But senators still haven't been told precisely what legislation they would be debating.
March 4, 2020, 1:59 a.m. ET March 4, 2020, 1:59 a.m. ET Biden picks up Texas. Image Attendees at an event for Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at Texas Southern University in Houston on Saturday. Credit... Tamir Kalifa for The New York Times Joseph R. Biden Jr. has won the Texas primary, giving the former vice president a victory in the second-biggest delegate prize of Super Tuesday — Texas has 228 — as he aims to hold off a looming advantage from Bernie Sanders. Mr. Biden got a bounce on Monday night from an endorsement from Beto O'Rourke, who remains a local political folk hero following his narrow 2018 Senate loss to Ted Cruz. Along with Mr. O'Rourke, Mr. Biden heralded late endorsements from several of the state's members of Congress, along with Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, who joined him for celebratory events in Dallas on Monday. The Texas Democratic Party said early Wednesday that even with a race call, it might take some time to officially divvy up the delegates. They aren't expecting 100 percent of precincts to report results until the morning and will get to work then. Read more
I grew up to the beat of racist denial in Queens, not far from where Mr. Trump grew up. I was raised in the urban hell of neighborhoods he probably avoided, alongside immigrants from countries he derided last week. In school or elsewhere, we all heard recitals of the American ideal of equality, especially on the day we celebrate the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Those events often feature recitals of the words all men are created equal, which were written by a slaveholder who once declared that black people are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.
One week after the Kentucky primary was conducted, The A.P. declared Ms. McGrath the winner after a campaign that was shaped by the coronavirus pandemic and protests against racial injustice. She narrowly defeated Charles Booker, an African-American state lawmaker who harnessed anger over a pair of fatal shootings by the authorities in Louisville to roar into contention in the final weeks of the campaign.
This was at a CNN town hall, and Biden was pursuing his goal of changing the subject from … his predecessor. Part of the strategy seems to be avoiding his actual name.
At the heart of the Medicare for all proposals championed by Senator Bernie Sanders and many Democrats is a revolutionary idea: Abolish private health insurance.
What there was instead was something you can expect to hear a lot of between now and November 2020: If you like this economy, you should like me, too.
Loss aversion actually threatened the repeal effort on two fronts: voters' fear of losing their coverage, and lawmakers' fear of losing their seats. Like the first fear, the second appeared well grounded. Republican voters wouldn't have been the only ones losing coverage, of course, but early studies suggested that losses would have been concentrated among people who voted for President Trump. The Congressional Budget Office estimated, for example, that the A.H.C.A. would have caused premiums to rise more than sevenfold in 2026 for 64-year-olds making $26,500.
Well, I would take the combat troops out of there now. I see no immediate reason we'd send combat troops into the region, but I'd get the combat troops that are there now out.
But it's hard. It's a lot easier not to take on the drug industry. It's a lot easier not to take on the insurance industry. It's a lot easier not to take on the oil industry. But every single issue we care about, every single issue — think about it on climate. All across this country people are saying climate, climate, climate. If you're not willing to take on the corruption, we're going to get laws passed that are going to have great names: Save the World; Everything Is Green; Now Safe for Unicorns.
Brent Staples: But she needed the Triangle Shirtwaist fire. What is the contemporary equivalent of the Shirtwaist fire?
I went to bed that night not knowing whether we would have to declare bankruptcy in the morning.
The lack of optimism in contemporary liberal and centrist thinking opens the door to Trump-style demagogy, since if the country really is going to hell, we do indeed need walls. And because optimism has lost its standing in American public opinion, past reforms — among them environmental protection, anti-discrimination initiatives, income security for seniors, auto and aviation safety, interconnected global economics, improved policing and yes, Obamacare — don't get credit for the good they have accomplished.
Well, I'm not sure I accept the premise of the question, that they actually tried what I was talking about. Look, our No. 1 leverage is everybody wants the American consumer. They want access to the American consumer. They want to be able to sell us all of their stuff because the American consumer is not only the engine of about 70 percent of our economy; it's a worldwide engine. So I think it's perfectly reasonable to say, if you want to be able to trade with United States on the best possible terms, then everybody needs to raise their standards just a little. Who wants to do that?

In October, Senator Warren's campaign bought ads that read: Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election. The campaign was intended as a critique of Facebook's decision not to fact-check or remove political ads. (Updated) Facebook did not remove from the social network the ad falsely endorsing Mr. Trump.
Well, it's not good for them and in a dozen different ways. Wages are part of it, but they are only part of it. It's about unsafe working conditions, for example. If you can hire somebody for cash and not meet current labor standards on safety, that someone needs a safety belt or needs training to go up high on a building, you not only put that person at risk, you reward employers who continue not to follow the law and to undermine safety standards for everyone.
But, he suggested, Mr. Sanders is also a candidate who would endanger the Democratic House majority and jeopardize more seats in the Senate should he be the party's nominee.
You start by disrupting. You start with some wins. You start with some places people want to be, and actually immigration reform is one of them. People don't like our immigration system, and our support for immigrants continues to go up. I can be in a room full of people who are three generations away from any immigration experience personally, and they want to see us get this done. It's not just liberals. What was the latest story? Utah wants more immigrants, right?
Perhaps nowhere is the Bloomberg financial might more prevalent than in Los Angeles and San Diego. Mr. Bloomberg has spent a combined $31 million on broadcast alone in those two markets.

Michelle Cottle: So here's a question about ——
Actually, I don't do polls. I haven't looked at them, so I don't know, but I'll tell you this. I'm out there fighting for those votes every single day. I've been to 29 states and Puerto Rico. I will keep doing this. I've been to blue states and red states, and talked about how we build a future. I think that's what we've got to do. We've got what, two more months before the caucuses start, but this is the question in front of us as a country. How do we think about how to go forward? Is the message going to be business as usual after Donald Trump? It's just too damn hard to get anything done. Therefore, we're just going to just kind of nibble at that problem of all the folks who can't get child care and teachers who are working three jobs?
MC: No, I'm just saying ——
Yeah, I think that's certainly true. It's funny. It's something I talk about in my book, too. But one of the tensions of politics, particularly in this era, is that putting aside the actual argument of Party of Death, the stakes of politics often are life and death. I mean. I do a lot of work on health care politics. I think, if you don't pass universal health care bills people die. And I've talked about that in very explicit terms with Joe Lieberman, threatening to kill Obamacare. And there's this interesting tension, particularly as the parties become more different from each other between, how do you approach politics with the seriousness it deserves, right? I mean, things like climate change. There really are profound stakes here and at the same time, don't push people to a place where they feel they have to burn the Capitol down if they lose.
Last week, the president highlighted a policy in the works meant to narrow the gaps between what drugs cost in the United States and overseas. On Wednesday, he signed an executive order to transform care for patients with kidney disease.
And there's one big fact on the ground that any realistic health strategy has to deal with: 156 million Americans — almost half the population — currently receive health insurance through their employers. And most of these people are fairly satisfied with their coverage.
Y cuando finalmente intervino la oficina presupuestaria, sus conclusiones fueron las esperadas: si se hacen recortes importantes al programa para personas de bajos recursos, Medicaid, y disminuyen los subsidios a los seguros de gastos mayores privados —todo para poder reducir los impuestos que paga la clase alta— mucha gente va a quedarse sin cobertura. La cifra estimada es de unos 23 millones de personas sin cobertura. ¿Es factible ese número? Sí, podrían ser 18 o 28 millones, pero sin duda los afectados estarán entre esas cantidades.
No, I know he did, but I don't know what that means.
A fair statement of the G.O.P.'s position would be this: We're sad that our chosen candidate expresses himself in an openly racist manner. But we still want our racist candidate to become America's next president. So we urge Donald Trump to keep his racist views to himself for now.
So that's why people are asking what happened to Lindsey Graham, and I was asking it myself. I mean, I don't think there was a sharper pivot from vehemently anti-Trump to enthusiastically pro-Trump more so than Lindsey Graham within the Republican Party. So I decided that I would spend some time with Lindsey Graham and see if I could ask him enough questions that maybe he could shed some light on this for me.
Democrats said the rush to repeal was the height of legislative irresponsibility and would endanger the health of millions.
I talk about Citizens United, although that one again is either going to take constitutional amendment or some change in the personnel at the Supreme Court to reslice that issue. But I think it is important to keep that one on the table. And I talk about it because when I close, I talk about why those three things are related to each other.
You don't think debates about racism —
KK: We have some foreign policy questions for you.
But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart. They say, what do we need this for? So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing. And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid — the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons. Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them.
The voter asked how the candidate would replace the law that might have saved his brother-in-law if it had been in effect earlier. Needless to say, all he got was boilerplate about government regulations and the usual false claims that Obamacare has destroyed millions of jobs and caused premiums to skyrocket.
KK: Do you feel comfortable with there still being nuclear weapons in Turkey?
So we have a shrinking supply and a growing population, and that means tens of millions of people are paying more to get less. So how can you turn that around? And the answer is to make a bigger investment in housing supply directly. And that includes housing for middle-class families, for working-class families, for the working poor, for the poor, for seniors who want to age in place, for people with disabilities, for people who've been incarcerated. Expanding housing supply directly, but also using federal dollars to help encourage cities and small towns and rural areas to adopt housing practices, that will lower costs even further. I just think that's a more effective way to get real structural change.
Black leaders wanted me to issue an executive order, and proclaim this by presidential edict, said Mr. Johnson, speaking of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 — an approach that, he concluded, would not be very effective if the Congress had not legislated.
Senator Warren introduced the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act in August 2018, which includes provisions to block government officials from becoming lobbyists, bar federal judges from owning stocks and more, all to be overseen by a new Office of Public Integrity. Much of what's outlined in that bill made its way into Senator Warren's campaign plan to end Washington corruption.
JI: I just want to pause here for one second. You'll have ——
So the result leaves a reforming conservatism as the neglected stepchild of the G.O.P., granted table scraps while the donors get the feast. It leaves Republicans with ownership of a bill that is neither populist nor popular, and Trump with ownership of an economic agenda that a reasonable voter should consider a betrayal of his promises. And it wastes an opportunity to turbocharge the recovery, because the bill's corporate beneficiaries are already sitting on ample cash reserves and it's the middle-class taxpayers who would have been more likely to spend extra money if they got it.
As such he's hesitant to indict one side without trying to indict the other, making for some tortured equivalences. After chastising Obama-thwarting Republicans, he says he's puzzled by Democrats whose highest priority in the Trump years seems to be thwarting this president (before conceding that the president is such an outlier that blocking him may be defensible). He venerates bipartisan consensus and compromise, even though he shows how they can lead to terrible deals. Obamacare, by placating the insurance industry, was a quintessential compromise — as was the haggling after the 2008 financial crisis that kept even the most notorious bankers from jail.
And so, finally we're here. And, I think, a kiddo in the background. What's your favorite children's book?
For a governor known for his fixation with polls (he has spent nearly $300,000 on them since the start of 2017), the anti-Trump strategy is informed by months of focus groups and survey research, according to people involved with the campaign. Mr. Cuomo has rotated the issues he has challenged Mr. Trump on — immigration, abortion and guns most loudly of late — but the broader frame of him leading the charge against the White House has been the same.
One option that appears to have gained support among the public is a single-payer system, which proponents like Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren call Medicare for All. A Kaiser Family Foundation poll found in June that 53 percent of Americans favor such a system. This was up from 46 percent, according to an average of seven polls conducted in 2008 and 2009. But moving to a single-payer system from one dominated by employer-paid health coverage would be a big leap, and in any case the political climate is clearly not ready for it. Many Democratic voters as well as party leaders like Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer have been reluctant to embrace the idea, and, no surprise, most Republican voters and lawmakers oppose it.
But some historians believe the closest comparison to this year, the last time the entire nation was consumed by a single issue, may be 1944, when the threat of Nazi Germany and imperial Japan fully mobilized American citizens behind the war effort.
Yeah. I didn't vote for him. I thought his campaign was —

And there will always be a way out. The problem is not the Supreme Court — it's the First Amendment itself. The challenge in regulating campaign spending is not deciding whether money is speech or corporations have rights, it's defining the boundaries of the election. Elections are a special zone, and by regulating spending clearly intended to influence the election, we keep it a zone of political fairness, where voters hear all sides and elected officials can remain independent. (Think of it like the signs limiting electioneering within 75 feet of the polling place.)
As a young professor on a sabbatical in Vienna in the mid-1970s, Nordhaus happened to share an office with an environmental researcher, who helped spark his interest in the emerging issue. While there, Nordhaus came up with the target, now famous, of holding global warming to two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. He chose the target, as he recently explained to me, because he believed that the earth has experienced similar fluctuations before and that humans had tolerated them.
But Mayor Muriel Bowser of Washington said on Twitter that while some upcoming potentially volatile events would require extra security, she would not accept fencing and additional troops as a long-term fixture in DC. When the time is right, the fencing around the White House and U.S. Capitol, just like the plywood we've seen on our businesses for too long, will be taken down, she tweeted. Earlier this week, Ms. Pittman apologized to Congress for the security failures on Jan. 6 and attested that her department knew of a strong potential for violence but failed to take the necessary precautions. On Thursday, officers stopped a man trying to gain access at a security checkpoint near the Capitol, according to Capitol Police. The officers told the man, later identified by the Metropolitan Police Department as Donald Barr, 51 of Macomb Township, Mich., that he could not enter, but he tried to bypass them. He then actively resisted arrest, the Capitol Police said in a statement. He has been charged with felony destruction of property and two counts of assaulting a police officer, among other charges. A day earlier, Capitol Police arrested a 71-year-old man, later identified by the Metropolitan Police Department as Dennis Westover, for possession of unregistered ammunition and unlawful possession of a firearm. An officer approached him after he exited his car and began walking, asking if he had a gun inside the vehicle, according to a Capitol Police statement on Thursday.

But what they were doing was affirming fantasies and conspiracies that are dangerous to the American civic order and deadly and destructive to a functional politics. We saw that result in a mob attacking the Capitol. I think even if that had not happened, it would have been absolutely inexcusable. And it's necessary for Republican leaders to take a different path on that front.
The Times columnist David Leonhardt wrote in September that despite long positioning herself as a champion for the working class, Senator Warren has had a record of struggling to win in working-class towns and blue-collar parts of Massachusetts.
Now, that's only for collective bargaining agreements, but that's real money in the pockets of those union numbers. Secondly, what at least some of the unions liked about this is the unions never have to bargain on this one again, once you get all the way to Medicare for all, because their workers will have health care coverage. Which means they can bargain once again over wages and working conditions and keeping jobs here in the United States instead of having to go back to their members year after year after year and say: We just bargained. Great for you. Your salary will go up one half of 1 percent, and your deductible will only go up by another $2,000.

• Zimbabwe's military claimed to have taken custody of President Robert Mugabe, one of Africa's longest-serving leaders, in what increasingly appeared to be a military takeover in the southern African nation.
So let me explain what the plan is. The plan is the employer has to keep paying in as the employer does right now. The one exception to that is if you have a collective bargaining agreement, and the employer is paying in more than whatever is the standard minimal that employers are paying in. That difference goes to the workers in cash.
Critics of Gilens' argument contend that enactment of Obamacare marks the first major downwardly redistributive federal legislation in generations, a major progressive achievement after decades of conservative success in distributing income and wealth to those in the top brackets.
This was a really bad time for us to be stuck. I'm just finishing writing a new book, which is partly about the inflection point we hit around 2007. In 2007, Apple came out with the iPhone, beginning the smartphone/apps revolution; in late 2006 Facebook opened its doors to anyone, not just college and high school students, and took off like a rocket; Google came out with the Android operating system in 2007; Hadoop launched in 2007, helping create the storage/processing power for the big data revolution; Github, launched in 2007, scaling open-source software; Twitter was spun off as its own separate platform in 2007. Amazon came out with the Kindle in 2007. Airbnb started in 2007.
Many Democratic politicians criticized the decision Wednesday as insensitive to the needs of the public in a crisis, including Joe Biden, who leads the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also released a statement, suggesting it may become a campaign issue. Democrats made health care a centerpiece of many House races in the 2018 midterm elections.
Senator Warren has laid out an ambitious timeline that would put children and families under Medicare for all in her first 100 days through a congressional maneuver, then fully roll out her system by her third year in office.
The mandate, which many Republicans criticize, was created to keep insurance affordable for those who are older or sick.
MC: So as you're out there trying to convince people to join you on this mission, at certain times, and certainly in the debates it's come up that people who do not embrace your path lack the political courage or will, or they're scared, as you've said, to embrace big change. Now, certainly this will appeal to a lot of Democratic voters, but there are also a lot of more moderate swing voters, Democratic voters who will be put off by the idea that just because they don't embrace your particular policies, they somehow are not courageous or that they're wrong in their ideas. So how do you reach out to these people, because you can't win the nomination just with the progressive base. You've got to kind of convince these people who are nervous about the big ideas. For instance, Medicare for all that you're pitching is not a overwhelmingly popular idea.
But by Washington standards, that is a pittance. Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, an industry lobbying group, set aside $150 million in 2009 to support the law's passage.
WASHINGTON — After defending the Affordable Care Act in all its intricacies for six years, President Obama proposed ways to improve it on Monday, saying that Congress should provide larger subsidies for private health insurance and create a public plan like Medicare to compete with private insurers in some states.
Well, you know, it obviously depends on the program, but I worry about — for example, increasing the dollar payment on Section 8 vouchers, it doesn't seem to increase the supply of housing. Instead, it seems to make a segment of landlords richer. So I'd rather take that money and put it directly into increasing housing supply.
At the beginning of 2017, Republicans promised to release the kraken on Obamacare — to destroy the program with one devastating blow. But a funny thing happened: Voters realized that repealing the Affordable Care Act would mean taking health insurance away from tens of millions of Americans. They didn't like that prospect — and enough Republicans balked at the backlash that Obamacare repeal fizzled.
I was at Netroots Nation last weekend. And they had converted most of the bathrooms in the convention center into all-gender restrooms. What it meant was basically that you sort of had to, if you're a woman, you kind of had to often walk by men in urinals to go use the bathroom. I thought that maybe I was the only person who was so stodgy and old-fashioned as to feel mildly uncomfortable. But there was one bathroom in another part of the building that hadn't been converted, and it had, like, three stalls. And there was this huge line of women waiting to use it. Don't get me wrong. Trans women have every right in the world to use women's bathrooms. Trans men have every right in the world to use men's bathrooms. I think that this kind of rush to pretend that gender is not an important organizing principle can end up trotting on the needs of women for whom their lived experience is that it necessarily is.
The court had heard arguments on the law a month earlier, and Kennedy had already told the other justices he considered it unconstitutional. He wanted to strike it down. Roberts had a different view, wanting to invalidate some of the law and keep other parts. During their conversations that April, the two of them talked through the substantive issues that the case involved, like the law's health insurance mandate, the cost of insurance premiums and so on.
Well, I have some thoughts about that, inspired in part by looking at Elizabeth Warren's proposals on both the tax and spending side. By the way, I don't know whether Warren will or even should get the nomination. But she's a major intellectual figure, and is pushing her party toward serious policy discussion in a way that will have huge influence whatever her personal trajectory.
BS: Right. You have a lot of people in this country who actually, if you asked them about Obamacare, they hate it. These are the same people who are being wounded by the constant diminution of medical care under the Trump administration. How do you convince those people? That's the issue, because he's talking about fake news and disbelief. We had the whole discussion about death committees.
One parallel Senator Warren has used in her plans for breaking up Facebook is the government's antitrust case against Microsoft in 1998, which Senator Richard Blumenthal and Tim Wu wrote in The Times made Microsoft a gentler giant.
And when they do, variations of that simple question — Why would an innocent man, and a jury interested in the truth, not want all the evidence out and all the witnesses to testify? Wouldn't you if you were innocent? — will take on even more power.
Well, I think part of it is how much you're willing to do two things: how much you are willing to push and how much you're willing to be creative about the various ways in which it's done. You know, we did the same thing in Asia with South Korea, with Japan, about which costs the South Koreans pick up and which costs the Americans pick up. The cost of moving, the cost of consolidating the land, the cost of maintaining security around the perimeter. There are a lot of different ways that we can do this, and I think we should be doing this much more in partnership. I think hectoring them and putting their leaders in an embarrassing position domestically, for each of them, do you cave in to the United States president who is trying to throw his weight around by picking up a bigger share of the defense budget? I don't think that's a way to further success in this area.
Some Senate Democrats said the GameStop hubbub — with a stock's value being inflated with little regard to the functional value of the company — showed that far stricter regulations on Wall Street trading were needed.

No. Not — slightly is not the right term.
Yet here was Ms. Pelosi herself, escorting a supporter of Medicare for all, Ady Barkan, to the House Rules Committee meeting. Mr. Barkan, who has long advocated health care expansion, has the degenerative neural disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and used a computer to help him speak. He proved a powerful presence.
Dire staff shortages, inadequate and persistent supplies of protective equipment, limited testing for the virus and pressure to work even if they might be sick have left many workers turning to the unions as their only ally. The virus has claimed the lives of more than 3,300 health care workers nationwide, according to one count. Image A patient arrived in March at the University of Illinois Hospital in Chicago. Credit... Joshua Lott/Reuters We wouldn't be alive today if we didn't have the union, said Elizabeth Lalasz, a Chicago public hospital nurse and steward for National Nurses United. Despite the decades-long decline in the labor movement and the small numbers of unionized nurses, labor officials have seized on the pandemic fallout to organize new chapters and pursue contract talks for better conditions and benefits. National Nurses organized seven new bargaining units last year, compared to four in 2019. The Service Employees International Union, which represents Mrs. McIntosh, also says it has seen an uptick in interest. Ian Prasad Philbrick and
The analysis is part of a wide-ranging set of surveys initiated by the C.D.C. to estimate how far the virus has spread. It found, for instance, that in South Florida as of April 10, under 2 percent of people had been exposed to the virus. (The proportion is likely to be much higher now, given the surge of infections in the state.) The C.D.C. estimated that 117,400 people in that region had been infected — about 11 times the reported number of 10,500 cases.
In this, if in little else, Nixon was joined by Robert F. Kennedy. The journalist Godfrey Hodgson recounts a conversation where Kennedy warned that the country was already split vertically, between sections, races, and ethnic groups, so it would be dangerous to split it horizontally, too, between liberals and conservatives. Politics, in this telling, was meant to calm our divisions, not represent them.

And these policies have endeared him to the G.O.P.'s money men. Deep-pocketed Republicans who snubbed Donald Trump in 2016 are going all in for him in 2020, reports Politico.
This is to try to be relevant.
And millions of Americans finally had the same chance to buy quality, affordable health care, and the peace of mind that comes with it, as everybody else.
So which system should Democrats advocate? The answer, I'd argue, is the system we're most likely actually to create — the one that will play best in the general election, and is then most likely to pass Congress if the Democrat wins.
I will say, so in the second part of your argument about the importance of gender pronouns for people who feel that it very strongly represents them, I think that that universalizing they could well be used as a way to kind of — I heard from people in comments, for example, that they felt that this could lead to something like a erasure for them. And I think that is a danger. I mean, the way that I — the thing that I come back to though is that when people use they, they are very consciously using it as a neutral pronoun. And I don't think that — I think that there would be instances where you might have it used in this trolly way. But that happens with all language. The more pernicious thing you notice all the time is people deliberately misgendering others — and then kind of inadvertently because you don't know or you don't know how to say it. And for those things, I think they takes care of it. You know, one thing I worried about in writing this, and I think it was one of the main criticisms from the left and especially for trans and non-binary people, is that what I was doing here was a kind of appropriation of what they need to do, me doing it from a position of privilege, and that I'm a cisgender man and don't really have a need for this pronoun.
As a result, our analyses tell us about average economic growth and the middle of the distribution — but as our economy grows more and more unequal, that analysis fails to capture the experience of the many people who are left behind, particularly people of color. Ms. Rouse is a labor economist whose work includes a longtime focus on education and discrimination. If confirmed, she would be the first Black economist ever to chair the council. She previously served as a council member under former President Barack Obama. Her testimony comes at a precarious moment in the economic recovery from the pandemic and she is likely to face questions about the $1.9 trillion stimulus package that Mr. Biden has proposed to help get the virus under control and aid struggling families and workers. Data released on Thursday morning showed that the economic recovery stumbled but didn't collapse at the end of last year and that it could have a strong rebound in 2021 once the virus is arrested. Gross domestic product rose 1 percent in the final three months of 2020, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Republicans have already expressed skepticism about whether the economy needs a $1.9 trillion jolt given the $900 billion stimulus package that Congress passed in December. But with millions still out of work and the virus not yet under control, many economists say workers and businesses will need more help to make it through.
All three health care taxes have been extensively discussed and debated by Congress since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.
As vaccine supplies lag, tensions grow in the E.U. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:07 - 0:00 transcript E.U. Pushes for AstraZeneca to Provide More Vaccines The European Union is pushing for AstraZeneca to supply more doses of its Covid-19 vaccine after announcing on Wednesday that it would cut deliveries by 60 percent due to manufacturing issues. Not being able to ensure manufacturing capacity is against the letter and the spirit of our agreement. We reject the logic of first come, first served. That may work at the neighborhood butcher's, but not in contracts, and not in our advanced purchase agreements. There's no priority clause in the advance purchase agreement, and also there's also no hierarchy of the full production plants named in the advance purchase agreement. In the contracts, there are four, I think, four factories listed, but it does not differentiate between the U.K. and the Europe — the U.K. factories are part of our advance purchase agreements, and this is why they have to deliver. Pharmaceutical companies, vaccine developers have moral, societal and contractual responsibilities, which they need to uphold. The view that the company is not obliged to deliver because we signed a best effort agreement is neither correct nor is it acceptable.

Hey, that's entertainment. Schumer is not necessarily the most exciting politician on the planet, but he works like a demon. I've known him since the 1980s, when he was in the House and he was one of the very few members of Congress who had both young children and a full-time working spouse.
In the years since the bill's failure, the story has repeated itself elsewhere. In Australia, a Labor Party-led government put in place a carbon tax in 2012, only to be swept from office the next year by conservatives who ran on an ax the tax platform. In France, to quell the yellow-vest protests, President Emmanuel Macron's government withdrew its gas-tax increase late last year. In the United States, voters in Washington — a blue state — rejected a ballot initiative last year that would have created a carbon tax, by a vote of 57 percent to 43 percent. And in places that have imposed a price on carbon, like the European Union, California and some other states, it tends to be too low to be effective.
Unfortunately, for many African-Americans Northern cities turned into a socioeconomic trap. The opportunities that lured migrants disappeared as blue-collar jobs moved first to the suburbs, then overseas. Chicago, for example, lost 60 percent of its manufacturing employment between 1967 and 1987.
Warren's three older brothers all went into the military. That was their chance to make it into the middle class, she told me. Warren went to college and became a teacher, until the school chose not to renew her contract rather than give her maternity leave. She then went to a public law school — for $450 per semester — and became a bankruptcy expert, early on at the University of Houston and ultimately at Harvard.
Charlie Warzel: Senator, how do you first campaign in and then govern a country as polarized as the one that we're living in right now? Because this doesn't feel like a disagreement on a few policies. This is a situation where the cost of letting the other side wins seems almost too much to bear for the other side. And if you look at impeachment, you see politicians literally inventing alternate realities rather than compromise or disparage a party leader. How do you realistically navigate that and get things done? Because it doesn't feel like a divide that you can heal away.
I think having people here who are working under the table is both bad for American workers and bad for the American economy. One of the reasons I propose to create a pathway to citizenship for everyone who's here to stay, a pathway that is fair and achievable, is to stop the problem of two-tier hiring: those who are hired in the legal system and then those who are hired outside the legal system. People who are undocumented have no protection and are frequently subject to wage theft, to unsafe working conditions, and that's not good for anyone. It's not good for American workers. It's not good for the American economy.
The insurance industry, which usually supports tight limits on insurance enrollments, is backing the extra enrollment period now. Around 15 million Americans are uninsured and eligible for marketplace coverage, according to a recent analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation. Most would qualify for some form of financial assistance if they bought such coverage — and about four million could sign up for a high-deductible plan that would cost them nothing in premiums.
A new Obamacare waiver program has just gone into effect: It would allow states to overhaul their entire health insurance markets if they can show that their revised plans would cover as many people. That process could allow Ms. Verma and Mr. Price to approve state plans that hew more closely to the Republican vision for health care.
Sure, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's youth (she's 29) is crucial to the passion in her voice, the ambition of her ideas and her ability to rouse a contingent of young voters who too often go missing from politics. But it probably also contributes to her heedlessness — to how cavalier she can be with facts. (Not that we don't have a 72-year-old president who surpasses her in this regard.)
In fact, let me quote you a New York Times article from just last week that I thought was terrific, and that's about a 2-cent wealth tax and how it is popular across political lines and it's popular, why? Because most of America gets that they're getting cheated in this game, and you get that wherever you are on that income scale until you get up to the very top.

So we're now going to take Mosul. And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary? Iran. Oh, yeah, they're making — I mean, they are outsmarting — look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision. But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq. You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it. You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way.
Expanding the Medicare universe from 60 million to 300 million people, Mr. Biden said, would eliminate the health insurance program primarily used by older Americans.
And I think that if we are going to commit to the political project of eliminating gender as a social organizing principle, we should be really clear about the amount of political resources that you would have to devote to a project of that magnitude. And then, I guess, the final thing I would say is that my own relationship to femininity is pretty fraught. But I could easily imagine my trolls calling me they to call into question whether or not I am a real woman. That's probably true, I would guess, certainly not all but for some trans people who have gone through a lot of trouble to identify as a man or a woman as opposed to a person of indeterminate gender. And so we have to do a lot more thinking and arguing about what we believe about gender before we go off and try to impose it on everyone else.
A new effort to pass the Republican health care bill has been propelled by an amendment that would allow states to waive certain insurance regulations in Obamacare. We examined the probable effects when the idea surfaced in April. Now that those ideas have become part of the legislative package, we've updated our analysis.
Trump says Obamacare is a disaster. It has problems, but the bottom line is that net 20 million more Americans have health insurance now. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
Look at the example. He said, I will take your money to lie about other candidates. What does that mean for our democracy? Not even meet the minimal standard that TV ads run, right?
Times reporting from Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley found that Senator Warren's wealth tax plan has broad support, including from 77 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of Republicans, with the exception of one demographic: Republican men with college degrees.
There is no doubt that improvements are needed. Deductibles and premiums are too high for many people, and too many young people are forgoing insurance altogether. More generous subsidies for people with modest incomes could bring the cost of health care down at a relatively small expense to the government.
But there was gun violence galore before Columbine, Newtown and Parkland. Feinstein can attest to that. She was at San Francisco City Hall on the November 1978 day when Mayor George Moscone and her fellow city supervisor Harvey Milk were fatally shot. She reached Milk's body first, one of her fingers slipping into a bullet hole in his neck when she checked for a pulse. And during her quarter-century in the Senate, almost no lawmaker of any age has been a more insistent crusader for restrictions on firearms.
Either way, Team Trump recognizes the immediate political potential of its new messaging. The president's gift for waging culture war has served him well in keeping his fans riled up and his critics off-kilter. By turning trade into a matter of national pride — a clash of civilizations, if you will — he's reminding supporters that he is fighting for them against both foreign competitors and globalists here at home. This can help distract from whatever economic pain they're experiencing. At least for now.
Because for me, they all are about a central question and that's: Who's going to get opportunity in this country going forward? Will opportunity be reserved just for those born into privilege? Or will opportunity be something that we say as a country, we're willing to make some hard choices to invest, so that all of our kids get those opportunities?
In fact, let me quote you a New York Times article from just last week that I thought was terrific, and that's about a 2-cent wealth tax and how it is popular across political lines and it's popular, why?

The timing of Nordhaus's Nobel Prize highlighted this political problem. While he was onstage, demonstrators in France were marching against gas-tax increases in raucous protests — the so-called yellow-vest movement — that shut down the Louvre and the Eiffel Tower. This is the ultimate challenge that Nordhaus was describing. Climate change may be an existential crisis, but in their day-to-day lives, many people are more worried about the problems created by the most obvious solution than by climate change itself.

He envisions a Rooseveltian campaign to get 100 million Covid vaccine shots into the arms of Americans in his first 100 days. There will be ramped-up testing, contact tracing and mobilization of at least 100,000 people to conquer the virus.
At that point, all the candidates will be able to do is wait: for the verdict and, they hope, for one of those elusive tickets out of Iowa.
Yeah, that is a really interesting question. It is certainly true that Trump, from time to time talked about, we need a stimulus and we're better off going big, and I want the $2,000 checks. But he didn't have in him the ability to engage in a policy question in a sustained way and negotiate with people on the Hill. That just wasn't something that he displayed at any point in his presidency. He didn't do a lot of the traditional job of a president and instead, took on the mantle of the internet commenter-in-chief on his own presidency. And that's one of the things that was really bizarre about this. Because, I think, there's absolutely no question that if Trump had engaged in August and September and said, I want $2,000 checks, and made this a test of Republican support for him, he would have gotten those $2,000 checks. And there would have been some grumbling and there would have been some Republicans who voted against it, but he would have had it. He would have had the bulk of Republicans, he would have had a lot of Democrats, who would have just been with him on the policy question. And I think you have to look at psychological, more than political explanations, for why Trump did that. Now the question for McConnell, I think, is a little bit different. And I've never had a clear handle on that.

Democrats choose Gary Peters to lead their 2022 Senate campaign effort. Senator Gary Peters of Michigan won his seat handily in 2014, but narrowly defeated a Republican challenger in November. Credit... Al Drago for The New York Times Senate Democrats on Thursday chose Senator Gary Peters of Michigan, a second-term moderate, to lead their campaign arm as the party seeks to hold onto and expand a razor-thin majority in 2022. Mr. Peters has a limited national profile, but he was re-elected last fall in one of the tightest and most expensive Senate races in the country. He said on Thursday that he hoped to parlay that experience into helping Democrats protect seats in key battlegrounds like Georgia and Arizona and make gains in swing states like Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and North Carolina, where the party has had some recent success. It will be a steep task. History suggests that voters tend to swing against the party in power in the first midterm election of a new presidency, and Republicans are entering the cycle determined to reclaim the Senate majority. Democrats are also preparing for a possible drop-off in enthusiasm among their voters now that former President Donald J. Trump, the Republican Party's single greatest motivator in recent years, is out of power. Still, with 14 seats currently held by Democrats and 20 currently held by Republicans on the ballot, the 2022 map generally favors Democrats.
These are the fights we need to have. These are the fights we should be bringing forward. We don't bring those fights forward. We — oh, well, we could — around the edge a little bit. Then we're just going to be the ones who stood by while America became fundamentally a country that lost even a hope that all the kids would have opportunity. That we just extinguish that and say, Nope. Better be born into it, because that's the only way to make it in America. That's not the America I want to see.
These emails are little chronicles of the world as it unfolds. They recount, in unadorned sentences largely free of affect, what happened on any given day. Some of these events will be forgotten. Many, especially this tumultuous year, will linger and scar.
Mr. Trump does not sound like a man trying to stabilize the Affordable Care Act marketplace. He boasted on Thursday that he had mostly obliterated Obamacare. He said in June that he had essentially gutted the law. In July last year, he said his strategy was to let Obamacare implode. In October last year, he declared: Obamacare is finished. It's dead. It's gone.
OK, I'm going to give you two answers on this. One, the serious heavy political book. Michael Greve's The Upside-Down Constitution changed the way I thought about federalism and changed a conventional conservative view of that. It's dense, but it's really quite interesting if you're interested in federalism in the Constitution. And then Popular Crime, Bill James, which changed the way I thought about a number of interesting historical episodes. And it's a real treat to read.
• Female entrepreneurs, entrepreneurs of color and others are finding it harder than ever to get a meeting with a V.C., Ms. Abramson told Michael.
On energy, California is a good case study. Its cap-and-trade program has been disappointing. Its performance standards have worked better. In 2005, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a moderate Republican, committed the state to reducing its carbon emissions to their 1990 level by 2020. He and state legislators later gave regulators the authority to require more clean-energy use by local utilities.
And I came here to talk with you all about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And the very short version of this story is I went around Washington talking to people about how, do not in this crisis, simply outlaw the practices that were bad, that were used on the mortgages, that are used on credit cards, because they'll be like fence posts on the prairie with nothing strong in between. And it'll take the banks and Wall Street about three minutes to figure out how to run around them by redescribing their product or slightly reinventing their product. I think you've got to have an agency that when Wall Street moves, the agency can move. That's how financial crises — it's the only way we're going to make this work.

Senator Warren's campaign ads pitch a 2-cent wealth tax to cover $700 billion in universal child care, $1.25 trillion in universal free college and student debt forgiveness, and more. But Senator Warren's tax would really be more than 2 cents on the dollar for the ultrarich, because you have to add the 2 cents to additional taxes she has promised on assets above $1 billion along with taxes on income and capital gains. Two University of California economists recently calculated that the Microsoft founder Bill Gates's net worth would be more than halved if Senator Warren's wealth tax in its original form had been enacted in 1982.
Since Arkansas reimposed the work requirement last year, its food stamp rolls have lost about 36,000 people, according to the State Department of Human Services. Mr. Hutchinson said the drop was partly explained because people had found jobs, but advocates for the poor said many appeared to have been cut off.
Not surprisingly, violence against African-Americans who managed to achieve any economic success discouraged initiative. For example, the economist Lisa Cook has shown that the number of blacks taking out patents, which soared for several decades after the Civil War, plunged in the face of growing white violence.
There are practical virtues in some of these initiatives: Efforts to expand the availability of cheaper, less regulated plans, for example, can provide alternatives to Obamacare's ever-rising premiums. But there are risks as well. Thanks to the way the health law's subsidies are structured, Mr. Trump's decision to cut off subsidy payments is likely to increase overall federal spending. The design of the cost-control board was legally questionable, but it represented an effort to cap the growth of America's largest entitlement program, and Republicans replaced it with nothing.
Something I see your guests do on Finding Your Roots is framing their narratives as triumphant ones, and I'd say a similar form of exceptionalism shapes how a lot of Americans think of the country's past. In what way does our propensity for that kind of thinking inhibit our ability to fully reckon with subjects — like racism and slavery — that don't easily fit into a narrative of exceptionalism? Because that tension is obviously at the root of the conflict over, for example, the removal of Confederate monuments. I feel as if you and I are sitting here, we're having coffee, and we hear this noise, and these zombies come out of the floor, and the zombie is white supremacy. We thought these [expletive] were dead. I'm trying to use the popularity of Finding Your Roots to get these political messages in there without being a scold. I am trying to deconstruct notions of racial purity. There is no racial purity. We are all diverse. Showing diversity is important to me politically, and insofar as we can achieve that, our series has an educational value for the larger country, particularly at a time when we're at Redemption redux.
But as Republicans plan to reserve the first 100 days of Congress for their more partisan goals, Democrats are preparing roadblocks. The party's brutal election-year wounds have been salted by evidence of Russian election interference, Mr. Trump's hard-line cabinet picks and his taunting Twitter posts. (On Saturday, he offered New Year's wishes to all, including those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do.)
A 1974 law reorganized the budgeting process, shifting power from the executive branch to Congress. Tense disagreements quickly emerged.
The administration is also hunting for consumers who can deliver testimonials advertising the benefits of coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Interested consumers could appear in television, radio, print and/or digital ads and on social media, the administration said in an appeal sent last week to health care advocates and insurance counselors.
The results confirm what some scientists have warned about for months: that without wider testing, scores of infected people would go undetected and continue to circulate the virus.
It would also repeal the individual mandate, which requires all Americans to obtain health insurance if they can afford it, or else face penalties.
We just undercut ourselves when we do that.
One important aspect of health care that Jamie Daw does not mention is the education of medical providers. The cost of medical school in Germany is a tiny fraction of the cost in the United States. Medical schools can cost as much as $75,000 per year, or $300,000 in total, for tuition, fees and living expenses. During the additional four to eight years of internship, residency and fellowship, young doctors are barely paid enough to cover basic housing and living costs. Most are not only acquiring substantial debt but also forgoing about 10 years of earning and saving.
Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said there would be endless amendments if the procedural hurdle were cleared. He played down the significance of which substitute measure would come first.

Mr. Strange's demise, senior party strategists and conservative activists said Wednesday, makes it likelier that Republican incumbents in the House and Senate will face serious primary challenges in 2018, fueled by anger at the party's apparent ineptitude at wielding power in Washington. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's former chief strategist and a vehement antagonist of the party establishment, said on Tuesday night that he intends to target Republican senators in Mississippi, Arizona and Nevada for defeat.
At the same time, none of the dire predictions conservatives made about the law have come true. It didn't bust the budget — in fact, deficits came down steadily even as the A.C.A. went into effect. It didn't discourage workers from taking jobs: Employment of Americans in their prime working years is back to what it was before the financial crisis. And despite Donald Trump's best efforts to undermine it, the system isn't in a death spiral: Insurers are making money and premiums have stabilized.
But he defended his brother's choice of Mr. Roberts. The Obamacare decision, I was disappointed in, Mr. Bush said. But he's made some really good rulings beyond that.

At the very least it adds uncertainty at exactly the moment when plans are trying to set rates for next year, said Ceci Connolly, the chief executive of the Alliance of Community Health Plans. At the worst it could strip away guaranteed coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.
Talks continued this evening and a deal could come anytime, but Democrats were blocking action on the $1.8 trillion package to get stronger protections for workers and restrictions for bailed-out businesses. Above, Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary.
Do you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn't like me? Trump tweeted just after the immigration decision was handed down. I merely get the impression that a majority of the justices are sane.
Yeah well, I'll tell you. I underestimated Trump in 2015 because I thought of him as the latest flavor of the month of extreme right, far right candidates. Or of candidates for those Republican primary voters who described themselves to pollsters as very conservative. I made this point. I have a really embarrassing column in retrospect from mid-2015 where I said, Don't worry about Trump. Because I was like, look at all these people who've come and gone before like the Herman Cains and Michele Bachmanns of the world. This segment of the party never unites around a candidate and never dominates the Republican presidential primaries for various reasons. And the Republican presidential primary after Reagan has always gone to somebody at the center of the party, or on the left of the party, and not to anybody on the right of the party, because these very conservative voters split. They split on religious grounds, they split economic versus social conservatives, they split how pragmatic they're willing to be, and somebody comes up on the middle and left of the party and consolidates. The basic structural theory about how the Republican Party worked turned out to be correct, but I was wrong in that Trump ended up being that guy. Trump is the guy who ends up dominating among Republican voters who describe themselves as moderate and maybe the crucial constituency Republican voters who described themselves as, 'somewhat conservative.
Our ultimate aim must be a comprehensive insurance system to protect all our people equally against insecurity and ill health.
The roots of today's dysfunction date back to some critical decisions starting in the 1970s. Here's a look at why the American government has lurched into crisis over the budget so often since then.
The case was originally brought by a group of Republican state officials, who argued that changes to the Affordable Care Act made by Congress in 2017 rendered the law's requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance unconstitutional. The Trump administration took the side of the state officials, and together they have argued in court that, without the so-called individual mandate, the rest of the major health care law should also be erased.
Roughly 50 percent of Pennsylvania's population supports the fracking industry.
The Black Death — when the bubonic plague killed an estimated 30 percent to 60 percent of the European population in the mid-1300s — is an extreme example of how pandemics can rebalance societies.
The pandemic has exposed some of the glaring weaknesses in the A.C.A., said Paul Starr, a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton who served as a health policy adviser to the Clinton administration. When millions of workers lose their jobs, most of them also lose their health coverage, and the A.C.A. does not provide for any automatic backup or means of transferring coverage to a publicly subsidized alternative.
The auditors found that the Obama administration had flouted this requirement. Under the law, the government was supposed to collect a total of $25 billion from 2014 to 2016 and deposit $5 billion of that in the Treasury.
But Republicans can't admit that this is their goal. The public overwhelmingly supports protection for Americans with pre-existing conditions, so right-wing politicians have to pretend they can provide that while dismantling the regulations and subsidies such protection requires. And they have to hope that voters won't remember that they have been promising a plan, but never delivering, for more than a decade.
That perhaps obvious insight has yet to penetrate Mr. Trump's reality distortion field. He said on Tuesday that Congress should vote to repeal the law as early as next week and replace it with new legislation very shortly thereafter. His statements once again demonstrated cluelessness or indifference to how laws are made, especially in a field as complicated as health care. Most experts think that it could well take years for lawmakers to replace a law that requires insurers to sell affordable policies to people with pre-existing medical conditions, provides subsidies to help people buy insurance and encourages doctors and hospitals to reduce unnecessary and expensive medical procedures.
The report concluded that after 10 years, the Republican plan would create 24 million additional uninsured people — the difference between the number of uninsured under the proposed plan and the number if the Affordable Care Act is not repealed.
And I think that that's something that we have to think about and face as a cold hard fact of our time, and do away with this hope that any leaders at this point are going to rise above their structural incentives and take sort of a West Wing approach to uniting the country, and drill down on what needs to be done here to produce results to make the government function. And I think I would argue that that is restoring majority rule. I mean, one thing that I have lost sleep thinking about is, what would have happened if it had only taken a majority to confirm Supreme Court justices in 2016 when Garland's nomination came up? At the time, Reid's nuclear option in 2013 left the 60-vote threshold in place for Supreme Court justices. So when Garland came up, Republicans had 53 votes, and Democrats had 47 seats in the Senate. So all McConnell had to do to block Garland was prevent 13 Republicans from breaking ranks. That's a lot easier to do than preventing three Republicans from breaking ranks. I'm not totally sure that he would have made the snap decision to try to block that nominee if he had had to keep three Republicans from breaking away. That's much harder to do.
After the endorsement interview, Senator Warren reached out to Mr. Warzel to clarify her response on 20th century antitrust. In that follow-up interview, she said: Antitrust law is a very valuable tool and breaking them up would have important effects but what I realized after I left in the room is that I was pulled in a different direction but I never finished to say that antitrust law is important but not the only tool we need. I don't believe that markets alone are going to fix all the problems we're facing on the tech side. Particularly the issues around privacy and the values that come from aggregation on platforms and how that value would be distributed. I don't believe only antitrust works but I do believe its a powerful tool we should be using in dealing with Big Tech.
Around the world, government rescue packages show that the pain will depend largely on where people live. The Netherlands will pay up to 90 percent of wages for companies hit hard by the pandemic, for instance, and Britain — which just announced its lockdown plan — is adopting a similar approach.
A political marriage made in heaven!
According to Gallup, in the first week of January 2004 more than half of surveyed Americans were satisfied with the direction of the country. Within a few weeks, however, that number had fallen below 50 percent. It has never recovered. Since the 2008 financial crisis, it has not cracked 40 percent. For well over a decade, a supermajority of Americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction. Pew surveys consistently show that a majority of Americans believe that their children will be financially worse off than they are. At the present time, citizens do not believe that America is great.
Yeah, here's the thing. I was pretty struck by how honest, how candid he was in talking about what his game was, what he was doing. Him explicitly saying, you showcase your issues, meaning you say certain things when you're running for re-election, essentially.
So this State of the Union both showed what a more successful version of the Trump presidency would look like — still conservative on many fronts but more genuinely populist, less same-old G.O.P. — and why the possibility of that success has probably already slipped from this administration's grip. There were ideas here that could make Trump's second year more successful than the first, but there was no plan to actually enact them, no sign that Trump is prepared to build bridges where he's burned them, no plan for getting more out of this speech than just a temporary polling bump.
BS: Is it my imagination or are we hearing almost nothing about voter disenfranchisement in this campaign, when in fact we saw disenfranchisement actually tipped races in Florida and Georgia? And post-Obama, all kinds of disenfranchisement methods came online.
In September, when he grandly announced the findings of a yearslong so-called investigation into what nearly everyone else never doubted — President Obama was born in the United States, period — The Times published a Page 1 article with the headline Trump Gives Up a Lie but Refuses to Repent.
Then, I think the next serious moment was actually in the New Deal.
I mean one way — one optimistic way of looking at this for the Democrats, maybe a little bit more optimistic for, say, a Bill Kristol Democrat than an Ezra Klein Democrat would be this. So, you have the potential for — we achieve something like herd immunity. We've got an economic take off as a result of that. And maybe the problem that every presidency, from '92 onward has run into, of overreach and then build backlash doesn't happen. Because he's just structurally incapable of achieving the overreach. And so you don't have a 1994, or 2006, or 2010, or 2018 backlash against Biden. And that you have more, if you're a Democrat and you largely approve of this agenda, you have more slow and steady progress.
Is there also a feeling among Republicans toward the president along the lines of, dude, we just want to stop calling attention to this issue. It's a losing issue for us. Stop drawing attention to it.
Survivors get a vaccine on Holocaust Remembrance Day. Krystyna Budnicka, a Holocaust survivor and member of the Children of the Holocaust Association, at the Monument to the Ghetto Heroes in Warsaw on Wednesday. Credit... Omar Marques/Getty Images Hundreds of survivors of the Holocaust are set to be vaccinated this week in Austria and Slovakia as part of vaccine drives organized in observance of the 76th anniversary of the liberation of the Auschwitz death camp, a day known as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. More than seven decades after one of the darkest periods in human history, the generation that endured the Nazi death camps is aging and especially vulnerable to the coronavirus. Jewish leaders have long pushed to prioritize their inoculations. Some 400 people aged 85 and older, many of them Holocaust survivors, were being vaccinated in Vienna on Wednesday, according to the Jewish Community of Vienna, which helped organize the program in cooperation with the Austrian Ministry of Health. About 12 doctors were administering vaccinations, according to Erika Jakubovits, executive director of the Jewish Community of Vienna, who helped organize the event. I think we owe it to our parents and grandparents to take care of these Holocaust survivors, Ms. Jakubovits said on Wednesday, speaking by phone from a vaccine center. A similar program was underway in Bratislava, Slovakia, according to The Associated Press. People are very happy, Ms. Jakubovits said.
A congressional subcommittee estimated that the two-day shutdown cost taxpayers between $80 million and $90 million, including administrative costs, such as figuring out who could and couldn't work and paying workers who didn't work.
It's interesting. This is not just a debate about how to vote in a pandemic, although clearly that's what's driving a lot of this. But in the background, from what you're saying, is this other question, which is whether the systems needed to vote during a pandemic may fundamentally change who votes, how many people vote and which party wins.
So let me see if I have this right: Because a German chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, came up with an inefficient way to provide universal health care almost 140 years ago, the United States should now copy his system?
But that assumption, which I made before looking at the performance of the companies' shares, couldn't be further from the truth.
What book would you give a conservative to read about democratic socialism?
If America is to survive the challenges of the modern world, we need to heal, we need to be inspired, and we need to revive the exceptional spirit that built America. Never before have we been so closely connected to each other, but more divided as a country.
As its central feature, the Constitution mandates a deliberate separation between the legislative and administrative, or executive, branches of government. This is not a matter of architecture, a quirk of structural whim. The separation is intended to ensure that no single person or branch of government will amass an excess of power and that the citizenry will retain a firm grip on the government's policy-making process. If the Congress cedes its independence, the entire constitutional framework, which depends on a system of checks and balances, is compromised.
However, girtherism isn't the real issue here; as David Axelrod says, a waist is a terrible thing to mind. The point, instead, is that running veterans' health is a management, not medical, job — and Jackson has no managerial experience.
But right now, two of the major contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders, are having an ugly argument about health care that could hurt the party's chances. There are real, important differences between the two men's policy proposals, and it's fine to point that out. What's not fine is the name-calling and false assertions. Both men are behaving badly. And for their party's sake, and their country's, they need to stop it.

At this point it's alarmingly easy to see how the United States could follow the path already taken by Hungary, becoming a democracy on paper but an authoritarian one-party state in practice. And I'm not talking about the distant future: It could happen this year, if Trump wins re-election — or even, potentially, if he loses but refuses to accept the results.
You do what you can with 50 votes to offer people what's possible. And then when lots of people get experience with it and they say, I like this, this works for me, then we vote on it and everybody gets better off and gets to try it. I think that's what's going to happen on Medicare for all. In fact, I think that is the way that we can solve our health care problems.
The cases have been reminders that the Roberts court is not reliably conservative on every issue, even though Republican presidents appointed five of the nine justices, including Roberts. Over the years, the court has also established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage (with Anthony Kennedy, now retired, as the swing vote); declined to outlaw affirmative action; upheld most parts of Obamacare; and more. These decisions have left many conservatives feeling betrayed.
In short, the American public seems to have wised up; voters seem to have recognized the G.O.P.'s reverse Robin Hood agenda of taking from ordinary families and giving to the rich for what it is.
As Mr. Brahin goes, so goes the nation.
Armed with the self-appointed title of personal attorney to the president, Mr. Cohen, who had served as a personal-injury lawyer and owned a taxi business, became seen as the man who could help others gain access to the seat of power that had been denied to him. Major corporations including AT&T, Novartis and the law firm Squire Patton Boggs collectively paid him over $2 million for advice about navigating the suddenly foreign terrain of Mr. Trump's Washington.
No, It's fine. So I actually start with the big vision. You know, if you gave me a chance, I'd do a constitutional amendment to protect the right of every American citizen to vote and to make sure that vote gets counted so you put real federal muscle behind it. I also talk about that for a specific reason, because a lot of Americans are shocked to know that that's not already in the Constitution and that there is no federal muscle behind that.

Once they learn that Medicare for all would eliminate private insurance and raise taxes, only 37 percent of Americans support it, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation survey. In 2010, Republicans scored an enormous electoral victory because voters feared that the government was taking over their health care, even though Obamacare really didn't. Now, under Medicare for all, it really would. This seems like an excellent way to re-elect Donald Trump.
Like Obamacare, the Republicans' proposal would help people who don't get insurance through work or the government buy their own coverage with tax credits. But the structure of the Republicans' tax credits is really different, handing them out on a flat basis according to age, for everyone earning up to around $75,000 a year. The bill would also allow insurers to charge older customers much higher prices than they can under Obamacare.
Well, look, I'm going to start. I don't want Mitch McConnell, obviously.
Margot, thank you very much. We appreciate it.
Look, I have argued for a long time that we need not to expand our nuclear arsenal, and that is the direction the Trump administration has been taking us.
At the beginning of 2017, Republicans promised to release the kraken on Obamacare — to destroy the program with one devastating blow. But a funny thing happened: Voters realized that repealing the Affordable Care Act would mean taking health insurance away from tens of millions of Americans. They didn't like that prospect — and enough Republicans balked at the backlash that Obamacare repeal fizzled.
The tension between incremental and transformative change has been a feature of the 2020 campaign. Mr. Obama, for instance, weighed in to say that the typical American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system, an implicit critique of Senator Warren's and Senator Sanders's campaigns.
You can take it through a constitutional amendment if you think it needs a constitutional amendment.
Mr. Trump briefly acknowledged Nancy Pelosi as Madam Speaker, but dispensed with even perfunctory congratulations. He all but ignored the midterm elections that swept the Republican Party out of power in the House. And he vowed that the United States will never be a socialist country, likening the progressive Democrats in the chamber to the discredited leader of Venezuela.
If the administration prevails in the case, the full force of the decision would not hit until after the midterm elections on Nov. 6. But insurers said the legal debate alone could cause turmoil in insurance markets this summer.
KK: Oh my god, we're running out of time. We have a bunch of questions around technology. [LAUGHTER]
The Department of Labor identifies about 44 million people that it thinks would be eligible. (Fifty percent of the people is a stretch.) Those people include self-employed business owners who buy their own insurance, people in the small group insurance market, and people who do not get insurance, but might, if their company could find a cheaper option.
One of them is use march-in orders on prescription drugs. We can bring down the cost of EpiPens and insulin and other drugs, so that we save families literally hundreds of millions of dollars. It can be done without Mitch McConnell. The power is already there. You've just got to be willing to pick it up and use it. Nobody else has talked about picking it up and using it.
James Carville had it exactly right when he noted on Morning Joe the other day that the only thing standing in the way of lasting damage by this machine to all that makes America unique and great is the Democrats' nominating the right person to defeat Donald Trump.
Evidence from states that tried something similar last spring suggests that the extra enrollment time could be an effective way to bring coverage to hard-to-reach populations: younger Americans, and those who have remained uninsured despite the health law's coverage expansion.
It got more than 50 votes because it was a good piece of legislation, and Republicans saw that it was passing, regardless of whether they opposed it or not. So they might as well get on board and try to influence it.
Pasa lo siguiente: lo que acaba de suceder en materia climática no es un caso inusual, en parte porque Trump no es un republicano inusual. Al actual Partido Republicano no le preocupa el fondo; no recaba pruebas ni hace análisis para formular o incluso justificar las posturas que adopta en sus políticas. Hay un desdén por los hechos y el pensamiento razonado, y cualquiera que trate de incorporar esas cosas al debate es un enemigo.

President Obama's health care battles foreshadow some of what Senator Warren might face in trying to institute her single-payer system. Mr. Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law in March 2010 after a protracted fight in Congress, and by November 2011 the Supreme Court had agreed to hear a case challenging its constitutionality.
Senator Warren's famous paper laying the groundwork for the creation of the C.F.P.B. opens with the sentence, It is impossible to buy a toaster that has a one-in-five chance of bursting into flames and burning down your house and later says, Why are consumers safe when they purchase tangible products with cash, but when they sign up for routine financial products like mortgages and credit cards they are left at the mercy of their creditors?
Among the increasingly concerned lawmakers are those who represent the 24 Republican congressional districts that Hillary Clinton won in the presidential election — roughly the edge Republicans hold over Democrats in the House — and another dozen in districts that President Barack Obama took in 2012 but President Trump won in November. If 25 conservative hard-liners oppose any robust replacement plan, and 30 swing-district House members demand a more generous plan, passage of a compromise bill will be in jeopardy.
Many of us stayed in dead-end jobs for years just to keep our health insurance.
So let me do both of these, because I think there are two answers. There are two pieces in this answer. One is, I think attacking the corruption in Washington brings a lot more people together than most folks recognize, and that it really does reach across party lines.
Those county governments don't like the current system because they have to pay their share out of property taxes. The change would instead require state government to pick up the bill. The result: Either the state will have to find more money, or Medicaid funding could be cut substantially. If this sounds like a weird parochial concern you might not expect in a piece of major federal policy legislation, that's because it is. But its inclusion signals congressional leaders' concerns about securing enough votes for passage. Some similar local policy giveaways were part of the Affordable Care Act. Many had memorable nicknames. On Twitter, possible names for this maneuver have begun circulating.
Given the Democratic advantage, many Republicans say they should not focus their energy on health care but instead emphasize immigration and other issues where they are stronger. But the president and his team counter that even if they cannot win on health care, it would be ridiculous to simply cede the territory if they could at least narrow the gap.
By the way, some people seem surprised by the administration's moves here, since Donald Trump has promised many times to protect people with pre-existing conditions. But remember: The campaign against the Affordable Care Act has been based on lies every step of the way.
The economics recommendations to Mr. Biden include more expansive and expensive plans than he has embraced in the campaign. They are heavily focused on addressing racial inequality and on getting Americans back to work in the wake of the recession caused by the pandemic.
That health care would play such a prominent role in the Democratic primary race is hardly surprising, given its role in last year's midterm election. Exit polls found that health care was the top issue for voters, and even the Republican leadership in the House has seemingly blamed midterm losses on the issue.
In fact, let me quote you a New York Times article from just last week that I thought was terrific, and that's about a 2-cent wealth tax and how it is popular across political lines and it's popular, why? Because most of America gets that they're getting cheated in this game, and you get that wherever you are on that income scale until you get up to the very top.

Gabriel's family, who live in rural southwestern Pennsylvania, have private health insurance but rely on Medicaid to pay for treatments for Abby that her insurance doesn't cover. A lot of our life is dependent on policy, Medicaid policy in particular, she said. So she's always paid close attention to politics, but her involvement was necessarily limited.
Senator Warren introduced the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act in August 2018, which includes provisions to block government officials from becoming lobbyists, bar federal judges from owning stocks and more, all to be overseen by a new Office of Public Integrity. Much of what's outlined in that bill made its way into Senator Warren's campaign plan to end Washington corruption.
In the case of health care, it was a lot easier to peddle scare stories about Obamacare before it went into effect, insuring tens of millions, than it is to defend taking away coverage people already have.
I talk about Citizens United, although that one again is either going to take constitutional amendment or some change in the personnel at the Supreme Court to reslice that issue. But I think it is important to keep that one on the table. And I talk about it because when I close, I talk about why those three things are related to each other.
And the timing on the Democratic side is sort of comical in that it is literally Nancy Pelosi's 79th birthday —
In conversations with some unions, Senator Warren has dodged the question of how she would protect existing coverage. At a recent town hall with the Culinary Workers Union, for example, she said their health care is not supposed to change but sidestepped details.
I have not finished reading the report, but they look like they've laid out their ducks. The Trump administration evidently does not wish to put up a defense and call its own witnesses. In fact, it seems to be still in the process of trying to block witnesses from coming and block documents from exposure. Yeah. And look, I think they've got enough. And if they've got enough, it can't be that the House impeachment process is the tail that gets wagged by Donald Trump based on when he's willing to allow access to various witnesses or various documents. Not even Richard Nixon tried to stop people from testifying or tried to stop the House from getting access to documentation. So they've got what they've got. If it's enough, then go forward.
I said there were going to be two parts to this. So I've done part one about the inside/outside theory of change, but the second part, that's why we've got to do this through grass roots movement. We cannot do this through television commercials. If winning the presidency, and I'll speak only to the Democratic side, is about who comes in, and oh, let's see, drops $37 million in one week on TV ads, and that's what it takes to win a Democratic primary, then we have a democracy that's just our TV ads versus their TV ads, and at that point, they're fake news. They claim ours is fake news, right? Everybody just gets farther and farther and farther into their corners.
Hillary's weak points aside, Trump also has one main advantage, which is that he'd be probably the most moderate nominee in decades. Now, Trump is not normally what we think of when we think of moderates – reactionary moderate is perhaps the best term to describe him. But border walls and Muslim bans aside, Trump really most closely resembles an old-school northeastern centrist Republican. Trump likes the welfare state. He's made protecting entitlements central to his pitch. It's safe to say that he's likely, at heart, socially liberal — the story of how he became anti-abortion, for example, doesn't make a great deal of sense. … And given the milieu he's always existed in, it's hard to believe he really opposes gay marriage, either. Trump has had the benefit of never really fleshing out what he believes about specific policies; nearly a year into his campaign, we still don't know what he'd replace Obamacare with. He is, as his longtime advisor Roger Stone says, a big picture guy: pro-business, pro-military, pro-America. The rest is all open to negotiation, to making the best deal. And, as Jim Antle notes over at The Washington Examiner, that puts him pretty squarely into the vast middle of the American electorate … Now, there are still plenty of reasons why someone who agrees with Trump on a whole mess of issues might still be unwilling to vote for him. But it's a mistake to assume that the man doesn't have a natural constituency outside the GOP.
Senator Warren's Medicare for all would require $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over the next 10 years. She has promised the money won't come from raising taxes on the middle class and maintains that between defense cuts and a wealth tax, the costs would be covered. But of course, that would require Senate approval — and Senator McConnell has sworn it won't happen as long as I'm majority leader.
And I say good jobs because when the wealth of the top 1 percent equals that of the bottom 90 percent, we do have to redivide the pie. I favor raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans to subsidize universal pre-K education and to reduce the burden of student loans. Let's give kids a head start and college grads a fresh start.
We should be building on Obamacare, we should not scrap Obamacare, he said, rising to his feet as he addressed a cheering crowd.
So is Trump's magical thinking. The president seems to see certain people as exempt from the laws of gravity, and he has accorded Kushner a place snug beside him in that pantheon. He keeps telling us that he can predict the future, and he keeps telling himself that Kushner can juggle more than even the most seasoned, brilliant White House aides of yesteryear pulled off. Kushner doesn't seem to be quibbling.
I find it ironic that people suggest reconciliation is somehow better for the institution, Adam Jentleson, former deputy chief of staff to the former Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, and the author of the excellent new book, Kill Switch: The Rise of the Modern Senate and the Crippling of American Democracy, told me. It's terrible for the Senate! As he notes, budget reconciliation decreases the power of committees and increases the power of the Senate leadership, since leadership drives the assembly line for putting together these mega-packages. There's no transparency and it creates a field day for lobbyists.
At the same time, though, he has relied on personnel who are associated with 2010-era G.O.P. orthodoxy, rather than elevating the kind of conservatives who have actively theorized for a more populist right. Trump's choice of Steve Moore to the Federal Reserve is a recent case study: Instead of elevating a principled inflation dove (National Review editor and Bloomberg columnist Ramesh Ponnuru would have been my outside-the-box choice), Trump picked a hack who was obsessed with imaginary inflation under Obama, and only flipped to back a looser monetary policy because, well, it was the Trumpy thing to do.
Mr. Azar did announce one policy that is likely to help consumers and insurers. He said the administration would, in effect, allow insurers to continue shifting certain costs to the federal government — because officials did not have time to issue rules banning the practice in 2019.
Virus advisers warn the U.S. will remain vulnerable without the quick passage of a relief bill by Congress. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:15 - 0:00 transcript White House Covid-19 Team Warns of Virus Variants Members of President Biden's coronavirus response team said they are increasing surveillance of potentially dangerous Covid-19 mutations. The variants have been identified recently, seem to spread more easily. They're more transmissible, which can lead to increased number of cases and increased stress on our already taxed health care system. In the United States, 308 cases of the 117 variant that originated from the U.K. have been confirmed in 26 states as of Jan. 26. We also identified this week, our first case of the P1 variant in the United States in Minnesota. To date, no cases of of the B1351 variant that was first detected in South Africa has been identified in the U.S. C.D.C. is committed to working with international and state and local partners, and increasing surveillance to monitor the situation and share as soon as we learn more. The N.I.H. will be collaborating with the C.D.C. in looking at what the functional characteristics of these are. For example, we will be monitoring in real time the effect of antibodies that we induced with the current vaccines and with future vaccines as to what impact they have on the ability to neutralize these mutants. Members of President Biden's coronavirus response team said they are increasing surveillance of potentially dangerous Covid-19 mutations.
Health Insurance Innovations says it was never involved in Simple Health's activities. While the company said it had relied on Simple Health brokers to sell policies and collected the premium payments, it required all brokers to provide clear disclosure of the information necessary for consumers to understand the policies they purchase, according to its statement.
The Times columnist David Leonhardt wrote in September that despite long positioning herself as a champion for the working class, Senator Warren has had a record of struggling to win in working-class towns and blue-collar parts of Massachusetts.
A recent op-ed in The Times argued that Carrie Lam's decision to characterize the Hong Kong protests as a riot echoed a moment in 1989 when The People's Daily, the newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, referred to a gathering of students in Tiananmen Square as turmoil. Protesters in Hong Kong demanded that the term riot be retracted.
In states that have expanded eligibility under the health law, Medicaid is available to people with annual incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty level, up to $27,724 for a three-person family and $16,242 for an individual. And states that have expanded Medicaid eligibility have generally had much broader gains in insurance coverage.
So how does that play out when all of a sudden there is a Democratic governor in Evers, who I assume wants to start making compromises with the Republican legislature?
So my plan to forgive student loan debt is capped at $50,000 and an income of $250,000. And the reason for that is because it is the best way, not only to give maximum forgiveness to a lot of people who are struggling, but it also helps close the black-white wealth gap, and is part of the reason that the N.A.A.C.P. endorsed it along with the other parts I was doing about investment in our colleges. But I really worked through hard on these numbers to deal with exactly that question and that's why I got the numbers where they are. I don't think they raise that same issue. I'm not ——
Now, as the coronavirus sweeps through the country, many state officials are relying on the Affordable Care Act to provide health coverage for residents who have none. On Friday, California became one of the latest states to set up a special enrollment period so people can sign up for insurance on their state-run marketplaces, and the Trump administration is considering reopening enrollment in the larger federal marketplace, which serves most states, for a limited period.
Mr. Trump isn't the first to mount a pressure campaign on NATO member states to increase their contributions. President Bush used a summit in Latvia in 2006 to urge other nations to raise their military spending, and President Obama echoed the plea at a 2014 conference in Brussels. Mr. Trump, though, has made spending levels a more central issue.
In some ways, the bill is less generous to the rich and less punishing to the poor than previous drafts of the legislation. The super-rich no longer qualify for a tax credit. Unlike previous drafts, which allowed anyone, regardless of income, to qualify for assistance, the bill offers the full subsidies only to individuals earning less than $75,000 a year or to joint filers earning $150,000. The subsidies slowly decrease above that threshold, meaning the country's unemployed millionaires would still have to pay full freight for their health insurance.
— the morning after this Justice Department announcement comes out. And when you have Democrats singing Happy Birthday to her, there was this sense in the caucus that she had gotten the best gift a president could have given her.
While the Obama administration allowed hardship exemptions to the mandate, the Trump administration could conceivably interpret the requirement in a more lenient way, so that more people would not be penalized.
Yes. I do think that the Europeans need to bear a significant share of the cost of defense of Europe. I don't think that hectoring or embarrassing them is a way to get there. I think we get there by talking about the ways that work best for them on the ground, but I do think it's important. It's an important partnership, and it should be a partnership.
So as your book demonstrates, the history of efforts to weaken the filibuster is a history of unintended consequences. Originally, the filibuster comes from a rules change that nobody quite recognizes what it's done, until, as you say, Calhoun and others understand what unlimited debate actually can mean. Then for a long time, there is no closure rule. That's until 1917, so filibuster in theory can never be broken, so long as the people doing it don't give up. Then it goes from two-thirds of the Senate down to three-fifths. And during this whole period, filibusters keep getting more and more and more frequent. The weaker it gets, the more it is used. There are a lot of reasons for this. We don't need to go into all of them. But from a liberal perspective, there is a way of worrying that getting rid of the filibuster will have an outcome they don't like, which is to say that because Republicans win rural areas and Democrats win urban ones, and the Senate is designed to overrepresent rural areas, there is somewhere between a three and seven-point Republican bias in the Senate. Democrats need to win a huge majority of the popular vote in order to win a Senate majority. Right now, 50 Democrats in the Senate represent 41 million more people than 50 Republicans in the Senate.
This doesn't mean that systemic racism is gone — far from it. But a majority of Americans are willing to acknowledge that racism is real and see it as a problem, which represents huge moral progress. Nixon's silent majority is now a noisy minority.
I'm Lindsey Graham, and I approve this message.
MC: But with particular policies, like not everybody's going to be down with banning fracking altogether, especially in the state of Pennsylvania.
MG: Your standing in some of the polls in the swing states is not as competitive as some of the other candidates'. Do you think that this issue is hurting you in the swing states like Michigan? If not, what do you make of the discrepancy in swing states?
But I want every delegate at this convention to understand that as long as I'm a vote —
The House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, to strengthen voting rights and ethics provisions, in March 2019 and sent it to the Senate. It is now awaiting a vote there.
Yeah, absolutely. I think it gets at a very interesting point and a very important point in this moment, when we have a new administration that, it seems to me, wants to make some cross-partisan deals. Because the point you make really can help us see where those deals are to be had, which is not quite where they would have been had 15 years ago, as you say. My first job in Washington, now more than 20 years ago, an even older man, was for a Republican member of Congress named Bob Franks, who was really a wonderful member and a great mentor. He was a pro-choice Republican. He was, in every other way, and absolutely mainstream Republican. He was in the leadership some of his career. He was on the Budget Committee. But he didn't agree with most other Republicans in the House about abortion. That kind of Republican today would have a much harder time being as central as Franks was in the Republican Party in that time. And I think it's even more the case on the Democratic side that a pro-life Democrat, of which there were many in that time when I started working in the House, would have a very hard time now functioning in the party.
My view on that one is that really you can be the umpire in the baseball game or you can have a team in the baseball game, but you don't get to do both at the same time. So breaking the platform off from the competitive business, yeah, that would give a lot of small businesses a much more level playing field and ability to compete.
It's embedded in a larger series of economic shifts in Western Europe, but the economic impact of the Black Death is the thing you cannot possibly overstate, because it's a shock to both the supply of labor and the demand, Mr. Wyman said.
So even though with the Affordable Care Act we didn't end up with government-run health care, we end up with more government in our health care, which it sounds like is beginning to change people's perception of what the government's role should be when it comes to medicine.
Look, this is very personal to me. When my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, my two boys were really very badly injured, I couldn't imagine what it'd be like if I had not had adequate healthcare immediately. I had prostate cancer recently, as you may know, and it's why I was a little late getting in the race. The same week my kid had her appendectomy out, and I feel very strongly that families ought to be able to have this choice.
For now, the restrictions will apply only to countries already deemed high-risk because of the emergence of more contagious virus variants, like South Africa, Portugal and Brazil. But Ms. Patel said the government could expand the list to include other countries where the virus is highly prevalent. Under the new rules, arriving passengers would be taken from the airport to nearby hotels, where they would be required to stay in their rooms for 10 days at their own expense. With a few exceptions, non-British citizens from the 22 high-risk countries are already banned from entering the country. Public health experts said the plan had too many loopholes and could be evaded by traveling first to an unaffected country and then to Britain from there. It won't be effective, because people will just connect in other countries to avoid quarantine, said Devi Sridhar, head of the global public health program at the University of Edinburgh.
The second change came more recently, when the Trump administration decided not to defend Obamacare from a lawsuit brought by the Republican attorneys general of 20 states. The lawsuit argues that the entire law should be invalidated as unconstitutional. The Trump administration's position is that most of the law should remain on the books, but that its protections for people with pre-existing illnesses should be stripped away.
If America were a blank slate, Medicare for all would be a plausible policy, but we are not a blank slate. At this point, the easiest way to get to a single-payer system would probably be to go back to 1776 and undo that whole American Revolution thing.
He was becoming one of the smart people. He was talking to me, wise guy to wise guy. And he was essentially giving away the game, as if his Senate office in Washington and a luncheon hall in Greenville, South Carolina were completely different worlds that have nothing to do with each other.
The argument isn't new. Chris Hayes made a similar case in his prescient 2012 book Twilight of the Elites. (He used the pulled-up ladder metaphor too.) But Tailspin arrives at a different moment. Hayes was writing when the clouds were just visible on the horizon; Brill is writing from the eye of the storm.
No, it's fine. It's just that look out there. People's financial circumstances have gotten worse. The amount of student loan debt has been going up at a rate of $100 billion a year. Oh, here's one. Just saw some data not long ago out of the Department of Education. Go take a look 20 years out on people who borrowed student loan debt. Ninety-four percent of whites have paid off their student loan debt. Want to guess what the percentage is for African-Americans is?
From the moment the result was announced, friends and supporters began texting Murkowski to urge her to run in the general election as a write-in candidate. Leadership told her not to do it, that she was going to jeopardize the seat and have a Democrat win, says Andrew Halcro, a former Republican state legislator and a friend who served with Murkowski. I think at that point, Lisa recognized, 'I don't have any friends.'  Murkowski decided to mount the write-in campaign.
No. I thought you were talking about undocumented workers.
CW: That's just a process of fact-checking and you want that to be independent, because then there's the issue of Facebook getting involved.
KK: We have time for, I think, one or two more questions.
I'm an Orthodox Jew and I have never catcalled a woman in my life, he said. I don't know how they catcall down in Queens, but it must be weird.
Their plan limited spending for Medicare and turned Medicaid and most other welfare programs over to the states. House Republicans, in particular, were keen on using a shutdown to get Mr. Clinton to sign their bill.
CW: You previously suggested that Facebook intends to use their influence in this election. What did you mean by that and did you think ——
WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Thursday proposed sweeping new rules that could make it easier for small businesses to band together and create health insurance plans that would be exempt from many of the consumer protections mandated by the Affordable Care Act.
Number of people who would lose Medicaid coverage under the Republican plan
MG: The U.A.W. was not one of them.
For Joseph R. Biden Jr., campaigning these days means virtual fund-raisers. Shuttered field offices. And rallying support by live stream, a tactic vulnerable to severe technological difficulties, as he discovered on Friday evening.
Opposed Obamacare from day one, voting against it.
JI: I want to just pivot very quickly to health care. It seemed like a good moment. With respect to what you will fight for, can you talk a little bit about Medicare for all and where it ranks in terms of your priorities, and then to kind of sort of reiterate the question, how do you convince people who are wary of massive health care overhaul yet again that that's the right approach to that problem basically?
Every day, a dozen women die unnecessarily in America from cervical cancer–yet GOP closes women's health centers and cuts Title X. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
The idea was that everyone, once they turned age 65, if they had worked and paid payroll taxes, would be able to have government health insurance. They would have access to insurance that would pay for their hospital care and further visits to doctors.
PhRMA disputes the suggestion that it backs particular actions by the recipients of its donations. PhRMA engages with groups and organizations that have a wide array of health care opinions and policy priorities, said its spokesman, Robert Zirkelbach. It is inaccurate and would be inappropriate for you to attribute those grants to a specific campaign.
Right. Even though it does redouble the loyalty of his base.
The special counsel completed its report and found no collusion and no obstruction. … Total exoneration, complete vindication.
AK: O.K. No, I mean, it's not my critique. This is a critique on the left as well, you know, that going about forgiving student debt in this way puts a lot of money in households that are going to make a lot of money.
In June, Senator Warren released a plan focused on voter disenfranchisement and election security. The plan proposes, among other measures, improved voting equipment across the country and bans on voter purges.
WASHINGTON — After defending the Affordable Care Act in all its intricacies for six years, President Obama proposed ways to improve it on Monday, saying that Congress should provide larger subsidies for private health insurance and create a public plan like Medicare to compete with private insurers in some states.
I mean, I don't think the Supreme Court is going to kill Obamacare.
And one of the reasons that they were unable to do it is that at the last minute, a small group of liberals got cold feet and decided that their short-term interests outweighed the structural advantage of getting rid of the electoral college. So you see how that worked out. I think that when you have the opportunity to fix some of these structural inequities, if we had taken that opportunity in 1970, George W. Bush would never have been president, nor would Donald Trump have been president. So I think that the advantages of trying to fix these structural imbalances when you have the opportunity far outweighs the narrow gains of keeping them in place, especially when your opponents can simply get rid of those narrow gains whenever they decide they want to if they're back in power.
It's true that, as Brad DeLong says, many of Robin's examples would actually apply in any complex economic system: I've wasted time dealing with both Verizon and the Social Security Administration, and in both cases my socioeconomic status surely made it a lot easier than it would have been for a minimum-wage worker. (I have, on the other hand, had consistently good experiences at the much-maligned DMV.) But the idea that free markets remove power relations from the equation is just naïve.
CLINTON: And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that. Now, why does that matter? Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position. I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.
Strangely enough, in a year that yielded one blaring headline after the next, there is no single headline to encompass what we have just lived through. Instead, there are notes, sent late, and there are vivid photographs. Make of them what you will, for 2020 — the same shorthand for clear vision — had, at once, the sheer weight of history and the intimacy that reminds us of what it means to be alive.
Reed: This is where the advocates point to Medicare as an example of the government's ability to run an insurance program, and they also like to point to Medicare Advantage as proof that you can have it both ways — people have a choice of the government-run program or a choice of a private plan.
KK: And then I think Brent is going to close us out.
Part two is again, we should be working more with our allies. Donald Trump seems to think somehow that we are stronger alone and I think that's fundamentally wrong. If you want to bring economic pressure on China, if you want to bring diplomatic pressure on China, it makes a lot more sense to do that if we're doing it with our allies, if we're doing it in conjunction with others. And I think that provides potentially much better protection for Hong Kong. The idea that this is going to be a direct military conflict between China and the United States, that would be deeply destabilizing to the entire world. So I want to see us use our diplomatic tools. I want to see us use our economic tools, and I want to see us leverage everything that we want to do by working much more tightly in conjunction with our allies. We just haven't been doing that. None of the above.
Yeah. These companies would essentially be wiped out by the Sanders proposal.
And you may start out with modest increments and increase them over time, but there's no reason that we should be treating a country that is producing goods through prison labor or child labor or unsafe working standards or by polluting the earth, that we should treat a country that produces goods in that way the same way we're treating a country that produces goods with standards that are much closer to ours. We simply put our own businesses and our own workers at a competitive disadvantage, so we end up doing things like exporting pollution. Can't pollute here in the United States, but move this polluting industry. This way that you're going to paint dolls or produce chips, move it somewhere else where they have no environmental standards and then resell, and then sell those goods back in the United States.
BS: You speak of these people standing around at rallies, are a lot of these people you're talking about. A lot of people standing around at Trump rallies are the very people you're talking about.
Well, I think the filibuster can be disciplining in a different way. I don't think it's true that nothing in HR1 couldn't get through the filibuster. It's certainly true that HR1 couldn't get through the filibuster, and what that calls for is some negotiation, is breaking it apart into pieces. I think you'd see the same thing about the immigration reform that the Biden team seems ready to propose. These things, if they were broken down into smaller pieces that could be negotiated as legislation in a more traditional way, some of them could get through. Whether they could get time on the floor, I don't know. That's a separate problem. But I don't think it's the case that the argument for social change has to be that these ideas that only the narrow majority party can get through and you can't even get one in five members of the other party to agree to them have to be pushed through for there to be any movement on any issue, I think that suggests to us something about how we're thinking about packaging these issues and how we're thinking about putting debates on the floor. I do expect the Democrats to expand the bounds of the reconciliation process. I think they will do that, even if they don't get rid of the filibuster, which they probably won't. And so to push a little more through that path, and social conservatives do hate the filibuster, generally speaking.
And there's one big fact on the ground that any realistic health strategy has to deal with: 156 million Americans — almost half the population — currently receive health insurance through their employers. And most of these people are fairly satisfied with their coverage.
Medicare beneficiaries would have to pay more for preventive care, like a wellness visit or diabetes check, which are now free. They would also have to pay more toward their prescription drugs. About five million people faced the so-called Medicare doughnut hole, or coverage gap, in 2016, which the A.C.A. sought to eliminate. If the law were overturned, that coverage gap would widen again.
Oh, I'm not going to do names.
It'll be free for anybody who's under 18. It'll be free for a family of four making less than $50,000 a year, and it will have a small price for everyone else. This is the advantage to having already identified how you can pay for this.
The Times columnist David Leonhardt wrote in September that despite long positioning herself as a champion for the working class, Senator Warren has had a record of struggling to win in working-class towns and blue-collar parts of Massachusetts.
And when those questions come and the remedies are proposed, whether it's online or vote-by-mail or the like, these same struggles of power will persist. And we will see factions emerge that question whether the new systems are fair and who politically benefits from them.
While President Obama himself didn't personally appear in court to defend the Affordable Care Act, the legal challenges hurled at the legislation demanded years of government and legal resources, not to mention public attention — so the legal dimension of the health care fight can't be discounted.
The major insurers, which appeared more optimistic about the marketplaces earlier in the year, have been seeing losses, and the losses have worsened, said Ana Gupte, an analyst at Leerink Partners who follows the insurance industry. In the case of Aetna, she said, its ability to withstand those losses was weakened when it became clear it might not be able to rely on the cost savings it expected from its merger with Humana.

You know, when I put together my anti-corruption plan, which is a big plan about the influence of money, I didn't put the provision in, but it was mostly because it's like so many things, I hadn't actually seen the implications of it. I think it's actually a very bad idea, and I would like to see it as part of an anti-corruption —
But obviously we're not seeing that yet. On Wednesday, across New York City, 45 ZIP codes had a seven-day average positive test rate at or over 10 percent, according to city data. At the same time, some public health experts expressed concern that too much focus had been placed on vaccinations — as opposed to limiting the spread of the virus. Restaurant owners across the state have also asked officials to push back their state-mandated 10 p.m. closing time to midnight. Mr. Cuomo said Wednesday that the state was looking at those requests, but would not be changing the hours at this time. Months ago, Mr. Cuomo pledged he would largely lock down areas where positive test rates consistently topped 4 percent, closing indoor dining and curbing other high-risk activities. But few communities have faced new rules in recent weeks following changes to how areas of the state are divided into three color-coded zones, red, orange and yellow, that specify what measures apply in each place. Outside of areas with zoned restrictions and New York City, indoor dining at restaurants has been permitted at 50 percent capacity statewide. On Wednesday, Mr. Cuomo said that, statewide, all orange zone designations would be lifted, allowing activities like retail businesses operating at 50 percent capacity, in six places including Staten Island, Erie County and Westchester County. Brooklyn, Nassau County and Suffolk County were among 16 areas where Mr. Cuomo said the less-stringent yellow zone rules will be eliminated.
KK: I'm trying to get a lot in here.
California is another state where polls show Mr. Bloomberg running far behind Mr. Sanders, who is the front-runner, as well as Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
Oh, right, Steve Daines, yeah, he went on a sort of America, love it or leave it kind of thing. Yeah. But I think, in general, the Republican response is either a kind of condemnation, like the one Romney gave that is not as strenuous as it should be, or a kind of let's pretend Trump didn't say that and just say, yeah, Trump's right that it's bad that these Democrats are socialists.
And that language of who rules, of the great middle of the country exercising the power it's entitled to, is very much a part of the language of the populist tradition in America. But of course, there's a politics of who rules on the left, too. It takes the form of a certain kind of identity politics, of counting minorities and women and the first this and the first that. And these things matter to people. They're important. I don't mean to degrade it. But I think that the question for us in the coming years is whether we can move a little more in the direction of a politics of what does government do and less of a politics of who rules on both the left and the right. I think the health of both parties depends on that being possible.
The task force suggested that Mr. Biden consider several plans that his more liberal rivals had championed during the Democratic primaries, though at times it stopped short of endorsing them.
archived recording (theresa may) Despite the best efforts of M.P.s, the process that the House of Commons has tried to lead has not come up with an answer. So today, I'm taking action to break the logjam.
Think of what that means. Do — you know that the top — just one quick — one number. I've resisted numbers while I'm in here. The 99 percent America pays 7.2 percent of your total income in taxes. Not total income. Total wealth. The top one-tenth of 1 percent, the part I want to hit with a 2-cent wealth tax, 3.2 percent. 3.2 percent. They have wealth managers who are managing these huge funds that are growing at what rate? Six percent a year, 8 percent a year, 10 percent a year?
In short, on the eve of Obama's presidency, something big happened: Everything started getting digitized and made mobile — work, commerce, billing, finance, education — reshaping the economy. A lot of things started to get very fast all at once. It was precisely when we needed to double down on our formula for success and update it for a new era — more lifelong learning opportunities for every worker, better infrastructure (roads, airports, rails and bandwidth) to promote the flow of commerce, better rules to incentivize risk-taking and prevent recklessness, better immigration policies to attract the world's smartest minds, and more government-funded research to push out the boundaries of science and sow the seeds for the next generation of start-ups.
Two federal judges in one of the most conservative appeals courts in the nation appeared ready on Tuesday to fall for the most specious legal challenge that the Affordable Care Act has faced — which is saying something.
Pensemos en otra política de suma importancia: la atención médica. ¿Cómo se conformó Trumpcare? ¿Acaso la administración y sus aliados consultaron a expertos, estudiaron las experiencias anteriores con las reformas de salud y trataron de vislumbrar un plan congruente? Claro que no. De hecho, los líderes parlamentarios insistieron en la aprobación del proyecto de ley antes de que la Oficina Presupuestaria del Congreso de Estados Unidos (CBO) —o cualquier otra entidad— pudiera evaluar su posible impacto.
With roughly $410 million, Michael R. Bloomberg bought omnipresence. Whether that translates to votes is a premise that faces its first test on Super Tuesday, when more than one-third of all delegates are up for grabs. It will be the first time Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City, is competing in a primary; he opted to skip the first four nominating contests.
I mean, the most obvious reason is because it's just he or she is not inclusive. It does not precisely refer to everyone. A lot of people feel that they don't fit within that gender binary. And referring to them as they, it solves the kind of inadvertent misgendering problem. You know, some people say that it's a huge accommodation to make because it doesn't affect that many people. But I feel like we don't really know how many people this affects. And I think those numbers are increasing as people think about this more. It doesn't seem like a huge task for the rest of society to start thinking about language in a way that is more inclusive.
Well, I would take the combat troops out of there now. I see no immediate reason we'd send combat troops into the region, but I'd get the combat troops that are there now out.
Though Mr. Bloomberg averages a few in-person events per day and has a staff of 2,500 around the country, his sprawling campaign is powered by one of the most traditional weapons in a candidate's arsenal: the television ad.
BS: You speak of these people standing around at rallies, are a lot of these people you're talking about. A lot of people standing around at Trump rallies are the very people you're talking about.
We've got a real strong job market going, said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. It does suggest that fears about a U.S. recession have been greatly overdone.
Hence his essential unelectability, which no centrist positioning is likely to much change. And the fact that so many Republican voters can't seem to see this, haven't been able to see this, may be a sign of cultural isolation above all. They can see how Trump might be able to win on the issues if he hadn't alienated so many millions of Americans on the basis of their race or sex … but they can't quite grasp how powerful that alienation is for the people who experience it, and how impossible it will be for Trump to overcome.
Democrats consider health care a winning issue, and they wanted the court to act quickly to keep the fate of the Affordable Care Act in the public eye during the presidential election. In the meantime, the law remains almost entirely intact but faces an uncertain future.
But if your complaint is a labor complaint, that is, gee, here I am in America and I'm trying to compete against workers in a foreign country who are getting paid a dollar a day. What's your path? Well, first you've got to go to the U.S. government and persuade the U.S. government that they should go after this country, for which we know what has happened. U.S. government has repeatedly — and this is not just by — well, yeah, we get your point.
KK: So who would be your running mate?
Number of uninsured if the current health law is not repealed
Well, I'm not sure about that. I mean, so, obviously, I don't think that the racist tweets have majority support in this country. But we don't have majority rule in this country. And so does it fire up enough of the Trump supporters who came out for him in 2016, stayed home in 2018, enough of those to make a difference in the few unrepresentative states that end up deciding all of our fates in our system of minority rule? I hope not, but maybe.
And I know it's tough between here and there. I was in a very tough primary back in 2012 and I wasn't in any primary at all in 2018, so those are my two electoral experiences.
John McCain was always surrounded by an entourage. He was always surrounded by cameras. He was always surrounded by a sense that because John McCain was there, something momentous was happening. And Lindsey Graham, by virtue of residency in that orbit, was able to reap that also.
But doing away with an entire industry would also be profoundly disruptive. The private health insurance business employs at least a half a million people, covers about 250 million Americans, and generates roughly a trillion dollars in revenues. Its companies' stocks are a staple of the mutual funds that make up millions of Americans' retirement savings.
And it seems to me that what's happened in the Republican Party is that you had a generation of people like Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney who thought that everybody was really in it for the tax cuts, thought that this economic libertarianism was sincere instead of a cipher for a broader set of grievances. Trump has stripped that all away and gone back to giving the base of the party what it wants. Once you discover that this is what the voters of the Republican Party wanted, I don't see how you go back to giving them what they don't want so much.
I currently buy Obamacare insurance, but I'm making less money than usual.
I'm biased because he's a very good friend of mine. But, I think, I would give both to a progressive, who wants to learn about conservatism, and the other way around, Yuval Levin's, book The Great Debate about the debate between Thomas Paine and Edmund Burke. Because Yuval, being a conservative, is very much on the Burke side of this. But he does such a nice job and is such a fair-minded articulator of their different positions. I mean, my own experience was that I ended up being a little bit, maybe more sympathetic to Paine and a little bit less sympathetic to Burke by the end of that book.
Needham and Chapman knew there were risks in allying themselves with King, an inveterate bomb-thrower with a deep yearning for the spotlight. But King was also a tenacious conservative. On June 16, he introduced his discharge petition, and Heritage Action began sending out emails to the foundation's 661,000 members, urging them to pressure representatives on both sides of the aisle to sign it — ominously adding in a news release that those who fail to support this effort are responsible for Obamacare. The petition soon picked up two highly influential signatories: Representative Tom Price of Georgia, an orthopedic surgeon who was chairman of the Republican Study Committee, the House's internal conservative think tank; and Representative Mike Pence of Indiana, a staunch conservative and personal hero of Needham's who refused to vote for Bush's Medicare bill in 2003.
Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced on Wednesday that officials were assessing whether indoor dining could soon return with limited capacity in New York City, after he barred it last month. He also eased coronavirus-related restrictions on nonessential businesses and restaurants in several areas across the state, including parts of the city. The city's restaurant industry, however, has been hit particularly hard during the pandemic, relegated mostly to outdoor dining for months, and Mr. Cuomo said officials were looking at going back to the 25 percent capacity limit that was set citywide when indoor dining briefly restarted in September. He did not specify additional details, but said that a plan would come by the end of the week. I fully understand how difficult it is that they're closed, not just for the restaurants, but all the people who are employed there, Mr. Cuomo said. On the flip side is how fast this virus can take off, but we'll have a plan. It was a stark difference in tone from remarks made by Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City on Tuesday, when he expressed concerns at a news conference over restarting indoor dining because of the high number of virus cases and the potential spread of new variants of the virus. I want to see indoor dining reopened when it's safe, Mr. de Blasio said on Tuesday. So, when the numbers come down, and we're confident that they're staying down, that is a great time to do it.
I'm not going to do names. That's enormously presumptuous.
Every one of the Romney campaign's major themes, from the attacks on President Obama for going around the world apologizing for America (he didn't), to the insistence that Romneycare and Obamacare are very different (they're virtually identical), to the claim that Mr. Obama has lost millions of jobs (which is only true if you count the first few months of his administration, before any of his policies had taken effect), is either an outright falsehood or deeply deceptive. Why the nonstop mendacity?
Such policies do not have to cover pre-existing conditions and can exclude common benefits like maternity care, mental health care or prescription drugs. The former administration also made it easier for small businesses to band together and offer plans that escape some of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Biden has asked federal agencies to re-examine these rules, which could take months to undo. Should the rules be overturned, patients who have such policies would be unable to renew them, which could leave them without insurance if they think coverage is too expensive. Mr. Biden campaigned on raising the subsidies for Obamacare plans to make them more affordable. Mr. Biden's executive actions on abortion put him in the center of the nation's long-running culture wars. Like his Democratic predecessors, Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, he will immediately rescind the global gag rule — often called the Mexico City Policy — which bars international nonprofit organizations that provide abortion counseling from using American tax dollars. The rule has been riding a philosophical seesaw for decades — in place when a Republican occupies the White House, and overturned when a Democrat moves in. Mr. Biden's revocation of the Mexico City Policy was part of an order that restored funding terminated by Mr. Trump to the United Nations Population Fund, known as UNFPA, the world's leading provider of family planning services, and a major resource for millions of women in more than 120 countries.
Your book is Kill Switch. It is my favorite book on the modern U.S. Senate. And believe me, you did not get the full of it listening to this conversation. So if you want to understand why the place works the way it does or doesn't work the way it does, you should read Kill Switch. Adam Jentleson, thank you very much.
Among those who are said to be influencing the discussion within the administration are Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services; Seema Verma, the head of the agency that runs Medicare and Medicaid; and Joe Grogan, the director of the White House Domestic Policy Council.

In October, Senator Warren's campaign bought ads that read: Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election. The campaign was intended as a critique of Facebook's decision not to fact-check or remove political ads. (Updated) Facebook did not remove from the social network the ad falsely endorsing Mr. Trump.

In seeking higher rates for 2019, insurers point to several developments. Mr. Trump cut off subsidies that insurers use to reduce out-of-pocket medical costs for low-income people. And Congress, with encouragement from Mr. Trump, eliminated tax penalties for people who go without insurance, starting next year, giving healthier people less incentive to obtain coverage.
Members of Mr. McConnell's leadership team were incensed at Mr. Mulvaney and allies like the acting White House budget director, Russell Vought, for rekindling a fight that served Democrats so well in 2018 and could harm vulnerable incumbents in 2020, according to two senior aides with direct knowledge of the situation. The maneuver may make it much less likely that Mr. Vought, the chief of staff's handpicked successor to head the Office of Management and Budget, will be confirmed by the Senate, the aides said.
A recent op-ed in The Times argued that Carrie Lam's decision to characterize the Hong Kong protests as a riot echoed a moment in 1989 when The People's Daily, the newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, referred to a gathering of students in Tiananmen Square as turmoil. Protesters in Hong Kong demanded that the term riot be retracted.
KK: Yes, and even more practically, is it enough to get anything passed in Mitch McConnell's Senate?
The second change is political. A decade ago, there was reason to think that carbon pricing could be bipartisan. It borrows from the best traditions of liberalism and conservatism by using the government to address a failure of the private market while still relying on that market. President George H.W. Bush's administration used a pricing scheme to solve the problem of acid rain. John McCain favored such a carbon scheme.

He went on to suggest that in previous elections, Mr. Sanders made political calculations about how much to discuss gun control.
The importance of a grass-roots movement is there is one thing that beats fake news, and actually the data showed this, and that's somebody you know. It's somebody who actually talks to you. It's somebody who does the face to face. It's somebody who reaches out. It's somebody who knocks on your door. It's your neighbor. It's the person who talks to you in line at the grocery store. That's part of it. It's why you have to build — when I did inside/outside, it's also about the importance of building grass roots, building it from the ground up. It's why I made the decisions I made in running for president right from the beginning, which we can talk about in a minute. But for me, that's at the heart of it, and then there's a second part. I'll push first to get the anti-corruption bill through. I'll push to deliver on a meaningful anti-corruption deal. I think you can get a lot of people on board for that, Democrats and Republicans to push for it. I dare you to vote against it, right? That is a fight I will have, and it will be a fight.
But I get it. There are right now, Democrats against Democrats on this. But understand this, we'll get into a general election. Oh, I know what the insurance industry will want to do. I know what Donald Trump will want to do. But the truth is we're going to have the party who tried to take away health care from 35 million Americans, said it was O.K. to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions and is continuing to follow that right now, both in their lawsuits and in their agency practices, and millions of people have lost their health care.
Actually, I don't do polls. I haven't looked at them, so I don't know, but I'll tell you this. I'm out there fighting for those votes every single day. I've been to 29 states and Puerto Rico. I will keep doing this. I've been to blue states and red states, and talked about how we build a future. I think that's what we've got to do. We've got what, two more months before the caucuses start, but this is the question in front of us as a country. How do we think about how to go forward? Is the message going to be business as usual after Donald Trump? It's just too damn hard to get anything done. Therefore, we're just going to just kind of nibble at that problem of all the folks who can't get child care and teachers who are working three jobs?

Under Mr. Trump's new rule, however, such plans can last for 364 days and can be renewed for up to three years. That rule joins an earlier one that allowed businesses to join together to create association health plans that also evade the Affordable Care Act's strictures. In effect, these rules are creating a cheap form of junk coverage that does not have to meet the higher standards of Obamacare. This sort of splintering of the insurance markets is not allowed under the Affordable Care Act as Congress drafted it.
Senator Warren called for the House of Representatives to begin impeachment inquiry proceedings against Mr. Trump as early as April 2019.
Since the start of the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces in 2014, Texas' uninsured rate has fallen about five percentage points. The number of insured Texans has increased by about one million people, according to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Four years ago, at this point in the last presidential election cycle, the jobless rate was 8.3 percent and the economic recovery was in a relatively early stage. Then, worries centered on rising gas prices, deep consumer debt and government layoffs.
In the October Democratic debate, Times national editor Marc Lacey asked Mr. Yang to comment on Senator Warren's calls to break up companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google. Mr. Yang said Senator Warren is correct in her diagnosis of the problem but breaking up the companies isn't an adequate solution because using a 20th-century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new tool kit.
KK: We're running out of time here.
Several main changes under the Republicans' proposal would cause fewer people to have insurance.
Several members of the Trump family have come under fire for profiting from Donald Trump's administration in possible violation of the emoluments clause, including Ivanka Trump, who was paid more than $1 million from her ties to the Trump Organization last year. And former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter held a lucrative position on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. In late September, Ms. Warren was, in the words of one reporter, uncharacteristically flustered when asked about the Biden matter.
And to me, a good example of that is Florida. I mean, Ron DeSantis, who's the current governor of Florida, ran a campaign last year that were it not for Donald Trump, I think, would have stood out for how racialized and, I would argue, racist it was. And Ron DeSantis is now the governor of Florida who's doing all kinds of things like trying to take voting rights away from African-American former felons. Ross, I take your point that this is not full Trumpification, but I do worry that it's moving in that direction.
A lot needs to get sorted out and it's complicated, Mr. Flentje replied.
President Trump has been threatening to repeal Obamacare since before he was elected, yet in his July 19 interview with The Times, he made it clear that he doesn't understand anything about health care, conflating health insurance and life insurance. He has shown no sign since then that he is any less ignorant now.

The difference between recorded infections and those that were missed was even more significant in Missouri, where about 2.65 percent of the population was infected with the virus as of April 26, although many people might not have felt sick.

WASHINGTON — Amy McGrath, a former Marine fighter pilot who built a formidable campaign war chest, emerged Tuesday as the Democratic nominee to take on Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, fending off a challenge from the left that highlighted the party's ideological divisions.
Trump ha dicho que no le gusta la palabra mandato, utilizada para definir el Obamacare, porque eso significa que es obligatorio.
Politics abhors a vacuum, and judicial activism increasingly fills the empty space created by legislative sclerosis and political cowardice, by the unwillingness of elected representatives to act on controversial issues. This abdication, persistent and ongoing, naturally impels partisans to look to the courts and the executive to act instead. Kennedy answered this desire too readily, but he didn't invent it, and there were times when he clearly tried to act as the good emperor that our decadent system and polarized country may require — by balancing his own liberal rulings on abortion and same-sex marriage, for instance, with subsequent decisions that allowed some space for pro-life activism and protected some religious liberties against the anti-clericalism of the left.
Senator Warren's anti-corruption plan includes provisions to extend conflict-of-interest laws to the president and vice president, compel government to divest from privately owned assets and restrict the ability of lobbyists to be hired for government jobs. It takes aim in particular at many of the practices that the Trump family has used to profit from office, which The Times has editorialized against.
Of all the political issues that divide us, health care is the one with the greatest impact on ordinary Americans' lives. If Democrats hadn't managed to pass the Affordable Care Act, around 20 million fewer Americans would have health insurance than currently do. If Republican-controlled states hadn't refused to expand Medicaid and generally done as little as possible to support the act, national progress might have tracked progress in, say, California – so another 7 or 8 million people might have coverage.
JW: So you think a constitutional amendment?
KK: Well, it has to come to the Senate floor. I mean, Mitch McConnell already has an anti-corruption, election reform bill [passed by the House].
One of the biggest reasons premiums will go down is because insurance will become expensive for older people, causing them to leave the market, improving the risk pool.
Michelle Cottle: So here's a question about ——
This article is just the latest indication that health care legislation is going to be a huge problem for Republicans. As the former chief executive of John Hancock Insurance Company, which once sold health insurance, I think it is fair to say that health insurance sold on an individual basis is a difficult proposition no matter how it is done.
That loss was bigger than most experts anticipated, and led to a round of predictable laments from congressional Democrats — and less predictable ones from Republican senators, including Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and John Thune of South Dakota, who told reporters that the bill needed to be more helpful to low-income people who wanted insurance.
I talked to a lot of Republicans in Washington, including some people we've been talking about, about these policy questions. I spent a lot of time talking to Scott Winship, who is a former Mike Lee staffer, now he's a colleague of yours at AEI, about this. And I would say that there's a very high level of abstraction when conservatives begin talking about things like work, right? I mean, that it's important for children to see their parents and going to work. And I agree, of course. But that is a really different situation when you're dealing with a parent who has a good, flexible job, then you have a parent whose only job they can get has just-in-time scheduling behind it. And so, that their parent is constantly not being able to be there when they said they were, they're not being able to come to school functions, that their whole home life is unstable. In my piece I talked to a woman named, Wanda Lavender, who was working at a daycare. She was there for 12 years. Her wages never went above $9. So then she began working at a daycare and a Popeye's. She's working more than 60 hours a week. She never has time to see their kids — her kids. She has rheumatoid arthritis, so it's really hard on her body. Work is great. I think it's good for my son to see me as a New York Times columnist.
Four years of Trump feeling validated in all the crazy stuff he's done and said. Four years of Trump unburdened by the need to run for re-election and able to amplify his racism, make Ivanka secretary of state, appoint even more crackpots to his cabinet and likely get to name two right-wing Supreme Court justices under the age of 40.
It doesn't go to a doctor making $1 million a year who also has $1 million in student loan debt.
Yeah. I mean, that's precisely it. I feel like gender and gender constructs have too big of a place in society in the way that we think about the world, in the way that people understand their preferences. I have a son and a daughter who are six and eight. And it's just crushing to me that they feel so strongly attached to very gendered expectations. They play with girl toys and boy toys and listen to what they call girl music and boy music. And it seemed to happen kind of automatically in a way that was difficult to think about how they were being kind of hemmed in by these gender expectations. I don't know if changing the pronouns we use will have a huge effect on this. But it feels like a small thing we could do to kind of free ourselves from what I think of as this kind of prison of gender expectations in society.
Stop and frisk isn't too much of a problem for him? He faces two problems that he has to overcome. He has already apologized for stop and frisk, but he has to put it behind him, and also the Central Park Five. What the city and the legal structure did to those five boys was shameful. The mayor has to put that behind him. If he's successful doing that, I think black people want him, because he is smart, sensitive, strong. I think he cares about health care. He understands the economic system. This is not an endorsement. But I would support him if he got the nomination.
So let me do the pitch, because I'll tell you exactly what the pitch is. That is the Affordable Care Act already requires employers to provide health care for their workers if they have more than 50 workers. I propose we just keep that in place, and that will yield about $9 trillion over the next 10 years. That's what they pay.
That at the moment, people thought might have really changed the momentum of this thing.
In between, administration lawyers told a receptive panel of judges in New Orleans that the entire Affordable Care Act should be overturned.
All of these storylines have at least some truth to them. Like a stopped clock, they sometimes have a lot of truth. But they are indeed like a stopped clock. They never change.

But allowing for the low bar, March and April brought a lot of good news for Donald Trump. For one thing, his basic political position has improved: He's up to 44 percent job approval in the RealClearPolitics average and 41 percent in FiveThirtyEight, some of the highest numbers since the beginning of his administration. And his party's situation has improved too, with the Democratic generic ballot lead no longer large enough to guarantee a wipeout of the G.O.P.
From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today:
For now, Arkansas is sending letters to Medicaid enrollees to let them know they are eligible for free job search assistance, including career counseling and help writing résumés. The state is putting together a system to keep track of those who take advantage of the offer and whether they end up finding jobs. Many Medicaid recipients here already have low-paying jobs, but roughly 40 percent report having no income, according to the state.
Two main changes appear to have turned the tide on health care as an issue. The Republican effort to repeal Obamacare last year made the embattled health law more popular than it has ever been. For the first time, the Affordable Care Act earned the support of a majority of Americans in public polls, a small shift but one that has been durable, even as Congress moved on to a tax overhaul and other issues. Pre-existing condition protections have always been much more popular than the law over all.
But increasingly, the logic looks a little different to them. Some of their customers want them to be in the fight and to have something to say, whether it's about Black Lives Matter or whether it's about the big issue of the day. And a lot of the workers want them to. [MUSIC PLAYING]
It would, for starters, stop cowing to Trump and stand up for American national security.

Biden signs orders aimed at expanding health care access, including abortion, and opening Obamacare enrollment. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:06 - 0:00 transcript Health Care Orders Undo 'Damage Trump Has Done,' Biden Says President Biden took executive action to expand health care access by strengthening the Affordable Care Act and reopening enrollment. He also moved to protect reproductive rights and expand abortion access. Today, we're about to sign two executive orders. Basically, the best way to describe it, to undo the damage Trump has done. There's nothing new that we're doing. The first one I'm going to be signing here is to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. And of all times that we need to reinstate access to affordability of and extent of access to Medicaid, is now, in the middle of this Covid crisis. And the second order I'm signing relates to protecting women's health at home and abroad, and it reinstates the changes that were made in Title X and other things, making it harder for women to have access to affordable health care as it relates to reproductive rights. President Biden took executive action to expand health care access by strengthening the Affordable Care Act and reopening enrollment. He also moved to protect reproductive rights and expand abortion access.
Attempting to hold this administration to account will be among the new Democratic majority's most vital, and most fraught, duties — especially after two years of cowed Republicans letting the president operate unchecked. A White House has perhaps never more vividly demonstrated the need for some countervailing force to check its corruption and incompetence, its disdain for the Constitution and its assault on democratic norms.

After the endorsement interview, Senator Warren reached out to Mr. Warzel to clarify her response on 20th century antitrust. In that follow-up interview, she said: Antitrust law is a very valuable tool and breaking them up would have important effects but what I realized after I left in the room is that I was pulled in a different direction but I never finished to say that antitrust law is important but not the only tool we need. I don't believe that markets alone are going to fix all the problems we're facing on the tech side. Particularly the issues around privacy and the values that come from aggregation on platforms and how that value would be distributed. I don't believe only antitrust works but I do believe its a powerful tool we should be using in dealing with Big Tech.

I have not finished reading the report, but they look like they've laid out their ducks. The Trump administration evidently does not wish to put up a defense and call its own witnesses. In fact, it seems to be still in the process of trying to block witnesses from coming and block documents from exposure. Yeah. And look, I think they've got enough. And if they've got enough, it can't be that the House impeachment process is the tail that gets wagged by Donald Trump based on when he's willing to allow access to various witnesses or various documents. Not even Richard Nixon tried to stop people from testifying or tried to stop the House from getting access to documentation. So they've got what they've got. If it's enough, then go forward.
This has to be ripped out by its roots. This is government taking over the entire health insurance industry.
The bill to end the shutdown, which funds government operations through Feb. 8 and also includes a six-year reauthorization of the Children's Health Insurance Program, did not move through budget reconciliation, the parliamentary procedure that circumvents filibusters in the Senate. That allowed Republican leaders to include the delays in the health insurance taxes without worrying about their fiscal cost, a move that drew few objections from Democrats.
In the age of populist revolts and anti-elite crusades , we ought to have known that Wall Street traders would get some kind of comeuppance. And across parties, politicians are feeling obligated to side with the insurgents, no matter where they usually come down on matters of Wall Street regulation.
A nationwide poll conducted by SurveyMonkey for The New York Times found that six in 10 Americans support a wealth tax. The slice of the electorate least likely to support it is Republican men with college degrees.
This is kind of an extraordinary move by the legislature to really thumb their nose at the power of the executive and the governor. The biggest elected official in the state has called them into session and said, take up this issue. And they basically start the session and end it without doing what he asked.
And the leader job was very much, what have you done for me lately? The Tea Party was on the rise. Ted Cruz, in the summer of 2015, came to the Senate floor, and in a moment of shocking violation of Senate decorum, called Mitch McConnell a liar in front of the entire world. That fall of 2015, the Tea Party successfully ousted Speaker Boehner and were very explicit about the fact that they were turning their sights on Mitch McConnell next and trying to take him out. And then you had the rise of Donald Trump, who McConnell opposed. And so when Scalia died in February, the day that Scalia died, there was a Republican debate that night, and it was sort of widely suspected that Ted Cruz and probably also Donald Trump were going to use that debate to come out and demand that Mitch McConnell block any Obama nominee. So McConnell didn't want to be responding to a demand by Cruz or Trump. He wanted to get out in front of them. So literally, before Scalia's body was cold, he issued a statement, getting out ahead of Cruz and getting out ahead of Trump, saying that he would block anyone Obama opposed.
Republicans are in a bind. They've been promising to repeal Obamacare for seven years, and having won control of the White House and Congress, they had to try to deliver. But while their bitter denunciations of the Affordable Care Act may have depressed its approval numbers, they didn't make replacing it any easier.
Right. Instead of talking about what I had imagined Republicans would be talking about for the next couple of months and maybe even the next year, which is the Democratic fight over Medicare for all, the Democratic fight over whether private insurance should even exist — I had expected that that would be the consuming discussion in the political world and in the political campaigns to come when it came to health care.
That Congress can fail to pass a budget with so little consequence — if anything, it boosted Republicans, by giving them two opportunities to try major partisan legislation — shows what a cynical charade the process has become. The eventual budget resolutions that were passed reveal how disconnected the process has become from actual budgetary considerations. The Republican resolution a year ago was what's known as a shell budget — essentially just a set of instructions that would have allowed the health care bill to be passed with a simple majority vote.
CW: But does that fix the power consolidation that's happening right now? If you took Facebook and spun out to Instagram, say, you still have a real dominance and a power that has been accumulated there. So Facebook, for example, in the media and advertising industry.
The recommendations make no mention of the Green New Deal, an ambitious plan that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez and other supporters of Mr. Sanders have championed.
It doesn't want to be a place where violent insurrections are planned. Where do you come down on that?
It has a really mixed perception. So I think that it really speaks to some people who respond to the moral case that he's making and to people who have really felt left behind by our current system, who are struggling with high health care costs or fighting with their insurance companies. So I think it really galvanized his campaign. It's a central theme. Obviously, he really outperforms everyone's expectations in the Democratic primary.
So we have a shrinking supply and a growing population, and that means tens of millions of people are paying more to get less. So how can you turn that around? And the answer is to make a bigger investment in housing supply directly. And that includes housing for middle-class families, for working-class families, for the working poor, for the poor, for seniors who want to age in place, for people with disabilities, for people who've been incarcerated. Expanding housing supply directly, but also using federal dollars to help encourage cities and small towns and rural areas to adopt housing practices, that will lower costs even further. I just think that's a more effective way to get real structural change.
If the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out, we'll have a plan that is far better than Obamacare, he said.
With a hustler's spirit and some sleight of hand, he made it, but not in total.
March 4, 2020, 12:25 a.m. ET March 4, 2020, 12:25 a.m. ET In downtown Los Angeles, two polling places, a world apart. LOS ANGELES — It is only a 15 minute walk, if you go fast, between the two polling places in downtown Los Angeles. On a normal day, the Union Rescue Mission on Skid Row and the hipster Ace Hotel are a world apart. On Election Day evening, the differences seemed even more potent. At the Union Rescue Mission, a five-story building that houses close to 1,100 people struggling to stay off the streets and out of the tent encampments, the cafeteria was turned into a polling place. Voters — firefighters from the nearby station, homeless outreach workers, residents of the Mission, the homeless themselves — trickled in, but there was never much of a line. Close by, a line of people snaked far down the street and around the corner, as voters waited, some for more than two hours, to vote at the Ace Hotel. At the bar, happy hour customers were eating oysters. Jennifer Van Leigh, 36, first went to the Ace, saw the line, and was one of the few to realize that there were other options. I figured this place would have no line, she said, at the Mission. Because no one wants to come to Skid Row.
Rivals like KKR and Blackstone have already made the transition, which has helped bolster their stock prices.
And I think this lays the groundwork for Bernie Sanders when he comes forward with a proposal in 2016 that he calls Medicare for all.
But, he suggested, Mr. Sanders is also a candidate who would endanger the Democratic House majority and jeopardize more seats in the Senate should he be the party's nominee.
I talk about Citizens United, although that one again is either going to take constitutional amendment or some change in the personnel at the Supreme Court to reslice that issue. But I think it is important to keep that one on the table. And I talk about it because when I close, I talk about why those three things are related to each other.
Well, I think that it's the upside of polarization. I think that at the end of the day, they care about keeping the Senate majority. And they care about Biden being successful. Right now, I think there's this sense that by standing in defense of the filibuster, they're blocking things like Medicare for All or the Green New Deal or far-left priorities from passing. But it's going to quickly become clear that they're not blocking Medicare for All, they're blocking the basic tenets of the Biden agenda. And that is a much harder choice. And I don't think they're going to like being the ones who stand in the way. I mean, Mark Kelly, Kyrsten Sinema's fellow Arizona senator, is up for re-election again in 2022. And when push comes to shove and the choice is between getting things done and Mark Kelly having a better record to run on and hopefully get re-elected in 2022, or Kyrsten Sinema's stand for the filibuster, I don't think Sinema is going to tell Mark Kelly to take a hike and fend for himself with no accomplishments because she, for some reason, feels so strongly about the filibuster, that she's going to leave him hanging like that. So I do think peer pressure can be powerful and good in that way.
MC: But with particular policies, like not everybody's going to be down with banning fracking altogether, especially in the state of Pennsylvania.
If you are among the millions of Americans who put in hours of unpaid labor last year arguing about or responding to national politics, you may be entitled to a tax credit of at least $45.
Is there also a feeling among Republicans toward the president along the lines of, dude, we just want to stop calling attention to this issue. It's a losing issue for us. Stop drawing attention to it.
A lot of us are living like this, right? How does anyone do the stuff they want to do with their money while they're doing the stuff they need to do? It's easy to make fun of people for buying avocado toast with precious take-home pay, but what if what I'm spending isn't my mom's money? What if there's no clear path from $0 in your checking account to a down payment on a house that's fit to live in? I am sure there's a financial adviser somewhere who could use trigonometry to explain how to whittle a three-car garage out of $20,000 a year, but since I can't afford his services, I'll just be over here in the bottomless-mimosa brunch line.
BA: What is the specific standard that you would apply in antitrust? Right now we basically have a consumer pricing setup.
An earlier government estimate suggested that about 300,000 people who didn't qualify for help paying their premiums in 2016 would qualify in 2017. If that calculation proved true, enrollment among people without subsidies actually fell by around a million people.
While people over 65 are more likely to have health problems, they have access to health insurance coverage through the federal Medicare program, Ms. McKernan said. Baby boomers are also more likely to have health insurance, which may contribute to their lower rates of medical debt.
One thing I see you doing in a lot of your work is trying to reassure Republicans that the stakes of Democratic victories, big-D Democratic victories, Democratic Party victories aren't so existential. That politics is still a contest of ideas that you can lose and it'll be OK. You have a piece about how Republicans should be optimistic in opposition and that you can then win back and it'll be OK. In '06 you wrote this book about Democrats called, Party of Death, which the argument had to do with things like abortion and death with dignity ideas, but obviously was a pretty hot title. I'm curious if watching the escalation of political stakes in people's minds, how you feel about the title and the rhetoric around that looking back?
Several main changes under the Republicans' proposal would cause fewer people to have insurance.
The era of searching is over. Zucker has found a story to ride, the biggest story we could ever imagine, he says. And as it turns out, the only thing better than having Donald Trump on your network is having him attack it. Far from hurting CNN, Trump's war against it has amounted to a form of product placement — earned media, you could say — giving its anchors and correspondents starring roles in the ongoing political drama, turning them into camera-ready warriors for the First Amendment. Zucker has not shied away from the conflict, which has been reassuring, even inspiring, to his staff. I hate to sound like a fanboy, but he's the best boss I've ever had, Tapper, a former senior White House correspondent at ABC News, told me. It has also been good for business. Last year, CNN's average daytime audience was up more than 50 percent, and its prime-time audience 70 percent. The network earned nearly $1 billion; it was the most profitable year in CNN's history. Ratings are up again this year, which is expected to be more profitable still. And CNN's newfound relevance may not be fully monetized until a few years from now, when its parent company, Turner Broadcasting System, renegotiates subscription fees with a variety of cable providers.
BS: What do you say about disenfranchisement? Forgive me for not knowing.
I think it includes anti-competitiveness and unfair trade practices. I think we need to resuscitate the old tying concept that we use.
Now here's the good news. We've created associations, millions of people are joining associations. Millions. That were formerly in Obamacare or didn't have insurance. Or didn't have health care. Millions of people. That's gonna be a big bill, you watch. It could be as high as 50 percent of the people. You watch. So that's a big thing. And the individual mandate. So now you have associations, and people don't even talk about the associations. That could be half the people are going to be joining up.
Polling has consistently shown Senator Warren to be in the top tier of candidates, but not the front of the pack. She trails Joe Biden — and Donald Trump — in key swing states.
BA: So you'd put tariffs on existing foreign imports?
And there's been a change in the climate of communications. Smartphones connected to the cloud are super-empowering good people to be reporters, photographers, filmmakers, innovators and entrepreneurs — with a global reach — and they're super-empowering bad guys to be cybercriminals and breakers with a global reach.
Over all, Obamacare has substantially reduced the number of Americans without insurance. According to the report, 19.3 million fewer people were living without health insurance in 2017 compared with 2010, when the Affordable Care Act passed Congress.
There was a view that while health insurance was starting to become available as a way for working people to protect themselves, that once you got old and you didn't have a job that came with insurance and you started to get sick — that no one wanted to sell you insurance. And so he proposed this idea of having a health care program that would be financed by payroll taxes like social security, but he couldn't get it through.
His wealth also allows him to spend in states where he clearly will not win. Minnesota, for instance, has 75 delegates up for grabs, only the sixth-most on Super Tuesday and far less than the 415 delegates in California. It also has a popular home state senator, Amy Klobuchar, ahead in the polls, with the 2016 primary winner, Mr. Sanders, not far behind.
And so how does Graham explain to you how his relationship with Trump develops and how this evolution kind of lands with him having a relationship with Trump?
Inside the White House, strict rules aim to slow the spread of the coronavirus. President Biden swore in members of the White House staff remotely on Jan. 20. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Senior staff members in West Wing offices are prohibited from meeting together in an office for more than a total of 15 minutes in a day, according to a senior Biden administration official. No more than six people are allowed to gather in the Oval Office at a time, and a maximum of five staff members are allowed to meet together in the spacious office of the chief of staff, Ron Klain, the official said. That means that both the morning and afternoon senior staff meetings in the White House are conducted on video calls, even though many of the participants are working in offices near one another. In the Roosevelt Room, gatherings are limited to 10 people. And when staff members remove their masks to eat lunch at their desks, they are required to close their doors. Visitors are not allowed without approval, and West Wing staff members generally do not intermingle with the team working in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building across the street. As the new administration finds its footing, life in the West Wing has become incredibly disciplined, partly because of the way President Biden's team wants to work, but mostly because of the strict rules the administration has put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
We had a fire, and the fire there was millions of people who lost their homes, but the fire by itself doesn't get it done. The fire by itself wasn't enough. You had to be ready with the big structural change and had to have somebody from the inside who would fight for it.
The highest-profile current attempt to redefine climate policy is the Green New Deal. In February, two Democrats — Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the House and Ed Markey in the Senate — released a 14-page resolution calling for a huge federal effort to fight climate change.
The Affordable Care Act said that products called health insurance had to include a basic set of benefits, including hospital care, prescription drugs and maternity care. Those provisions have been criticized for driving up the cost of insurance and making the market too inflexible.
But now Donald Trump is, in effect, implementing at least part of the drastic reduction in government's role his party has long claimed to favor. If the shutdown drags on for months — which seems quite possible — we'll get a chance to see what America looks like without a number of public programs the right has long insisted we don't need. Never mind the wall; think of what's going on as a big, beautiful libertarian experiment.
I mean, I actually thought that it shows the limits of Trumpification and the fact that the Republican approach to Trump's racist provocation is a kind of denial rather than a kind of wholesale adoption. I mean, I think there is a part of the Republican Party and the conservative coalition that's fully on board with the way that Trump talked about the four congressmen and the way he talks in general. But what you get from elected officials is the kind of weak condemnation of what Trump says joined to a pivot to let's talk about something else, like how bad the liberals are. Which tells you something important, right? I think it tells you that a lot of G.O.P. elected officials still have this sense that the bigoted strain in Trumpism can just sort of go away when Trump does. You would have Trumpification if Mitt Romney came out and said, Trump's absolutely right. They should go back to their home countries. Right? I mean that would be Trumpification.
Supporters of the health care law might describe many of these changes as sabotage, and it's certainly true that many of them are not being made out of love for the law. But the changes also suggest that Republicans are belatedly engaging with the particulars of the law and its operation, cobbling together a not entirely coherent replacement on the fly.
But Democratic leaders appeared to be focused less on the substance of the measures than on their likely demise in the Republican-controlled Senate.
Senator Warren has released one of the most robust housing plans in the 2020 field, including the creation of a Tenant Protection Bureau modeled after the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The sky-high rates of homelessness across the country was a major focus of Times reporting last year — read it here.
James Carville had it exactly right when he noted on Morning Joe the other day that the only thing standing in the way of lasting damage by this machine to all that makes America unique and great is the Democrats' nominating the right person to defeat Donald Trump.
KK: But you have to admit, many of the things you're saying are the same pitch Obama gave us in 2008, and Obama, of course, got health care done, but with a lot of compromises and left a law that I think by everyone's estimation is flawed. So what's different in 2020 — excuse me, I don't know what year it is, 2019 — than it was in 2008?
Save our health care! Barbara Miller shouted.
Thus, on Wednesday, the first message from the Irish president Michael D. Higgins to Biden contained a quotation from the poet John O'Donohue — Unfurl yourself into the grace of beginning.
The apology, which Mr. Bloomberg looked uneasy delivering, did not satisfy his rivals.
And even if the lawsuit fails, the administration's support for an incredibly flimsy legal challenge — one so indefensible that three career Justice Department lawyers withdrew from the case — is a clear signal of Republican priorities: G.O.P. to Americans with health problems: Drop dead.
Actually, I don't think of what I say that way. What I think of is the leadership possibilities that the candidates for president are offering. I don't know anybody who sits around and says, I want to make peace with corruption. I don't know where those people are in America who think it's O.K. that Amazon makes $11 billion and pays nothing in taxes. I haven't seen those people. Now, maybe they just stay away from me, but I don't think so. I think —
MC: Not everybody likes Medicare for all, where you do away with private health care. Not everybody is going to appreciate if you've suggested that the candidate that they happen to back now is in the wrong primary. I'm just saying these things will come back as you have to win voters in swing states, things like that.
archived recording (mick mulvaney) It's almost as if the folks who wrote this piece of legislation last year either have no idea how small business works or they don't care how small business works. Either way, the current health care legislation is a complete disaster for small business, and —
Mr. Douthat's musings — that Asians might lead the Democrats back to 1990s-style Clintonism  — are wrongheaded fantasies. No surveys show voters clamoring for President Bill Clinton's blend of cutting welfare while deregulating finance. And even if such centrism were on the rise, Asian-Americans won't lead the way.
I'm in remission now, thankfully, but if my disease comes back, it cannot be while having my health insurance company tell me that my pre-existing condition precludes coverage. Nor should any of us with these long-term issues be denied coverage, or required to pay higher premiums.

Such an appropriation cannot be inferred, the judge said in her opinion. She blocked further spending under the program but said that order would be suspended pending an appeal by the Obama administration. No immediate disruption in the program was anticipated.
Biden signs orders aimed at expanding health care access, including abortion, and opening Obamacare enrollment. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:06 - 0:00 transcript Health Care Orders Undo 'Damage Trump Has Done,' Biden Says President Biden took executive action to expand health care access by strengthening the Affordable Care Act and reopening enrollment. He also moved to protect reproductive rights and expand abortion access. Today, we're about to sign two executive orders. Basically, the best way to describe it, to undo the damage Trump has done. There's nothing new that we're doing. The first one I'm going to be signing here is to strengthen Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act. And of all times that we need to reinstate access to affordability of and extent of access to Medicaid, is now, in the middle of this Covid crisis. And the second order I'm signing relates to protecting women's health at home and abroad, and it reinstates the changes that were made in Title X and other things, making it harder for women to have access to affordable health care as it relates to reproductive rights. President Biden took executive action to expand health care access by strengthening the Affordable Care Act and reopening enrollment. He also moved to protect reproductive rights and expand abortion access.
In December, former Vice President Joe Biden said that he would consider choosing Senator Warren as his running mate and wondered whether she would choose him. The Senator, for her part, has suggested she might prefer a woman.
Here's what else you need to know today.
archived recording (scott fitzgerald) It was completely disingenuous for the governor to tape a video and post it as if this was reality. To float the idea that they were going to find enough outer envelopes, ballots themselves, inner envelopes with first class postage, and mail it out to 3.3 million people in Wisconsin is completely made up.
So let me do the pitch, because I'll tell you exactly what the pitch is. That is the Affordable Care Act already requires employers to provide health care for their workers if they have more than 50 workers. I propose we just keep that in place, and that will yield about $9 trillion over the next 10 years. That's what they pay.
No. This is on budget reconciliation.
A C.D.C. study in rural Wisconsin shows little in-school transmission. Elementary students in Wausau, Wis. A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in one rural Wisconsin county showed that the rate of transmission in Wood County schools was well below the county's rate of infection. Credit... Jenn Ackerman for The New York Times Rigorous scientific studies tracing the transmission of coronavirus in schools have been few and far between during the pandemic. But on Tuesday, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention published a study of 17 rural schools in Wisconsin that found there was little in-school transmission, even though the virus was raging in the surrounding communities. Experts and advocates have pointed to the study as evidence that it is possible to keep schools open safely even when community transmission is high, provided that mitigation measures — including strongly enforced requirements to wear masks and keeping students in stable groups — are used. Among 5,530 students and staff members in Wood County, Wis., there were 191 coronavirus cases reported during the study, from Aug. 31 to Nov. 29. Only seven cases were attributed to in-school transmission, all among students. There was no surveillance testing, so some asymptomatic cases might have been missed. Overall, the rate of infection among students and staff was about one-third lower than in the county as a whole.
Senator Warren's plan on trade, released in July, would change American trade policy by pushing the country's trade partners to abide by higher labor and environmental standards. Under her plan, more representatives from labor, environmental and consumer groups would be involved in trade negotiations, and the process would be more transparent through public disclosure of draft agreements.
When they're in the minority, I think they can say, we want to tell you what our values are. We want to tell you what our dreams are and what we care about — equity, and we care about fairness. And they don't really have to worry about the dirty little details.
Mr. Trump, for his part, has at times sought to use the uncertainty to his advantage. Last month, after his most ardent supporters had attacked the worst-case death estimates for weeks as evidence of hysteria, Mr. Trump began calling attention to the two million figure — as a benchmark against which to judge his handling of the crisis.
You start by disrupting. You start with some wins. You start with some places people want to be, and actually immigration reform is one of them. People don't like our immigration system, and our support for immigrants continues to go up. I can be in a room full of people who are three generations away from any immigration experience personally, and they want to see us get this done. It's not just liberals. What was the latest story? Utah wants more immigrants, right?
Heather McGhee's The Sum of Us. I was lucky to read an early copy. It's incredibly good. I think that it's a holistic look at the cost of racism in America, and it's incredibly thoughtful. She moves deftly from political science, sociology, to history, and it's just an incredible book. And I would highly recommend it.
Well, real dismay and surprise and sort of horror.
Health plans design products that address the cost and access challenges by aligning quality and affordability together. Offering a range of coverage options allows individuals and employers to choose the plan that best fits their needs. It's only when all stakeholders — hospitals, health plans and drug companies — embrace the goals of affordability, quality and access that consumers will see true value in their care.
What unites both of these blunders, apart from simple political stupidity, is that neither has much to do with actual policymaking. There is little chance that John Roberts, having declined to do away with Obamacare when the law faced a reasonable constitutional challenge, will rule in favor of a more implausible attack. There is zero chance that the Special Olympics will be defunded; the budget that imagined doing so was a symbolic statement that gets ignored by Congress every year.
The argument isn't new. Chris Hayes made a similar case in his prescient 2012 book Twilight of the Elites. (He used the pulled-up ladder metaphor too.) But Tailspin arrives at a different moment. Hayes was writing when the clouds were just visible on the horizon; Brill is writing from the eye of the storm.
CW: I'm just curious, do you think that Facebook could tip the scales in favor of a candidate? What did you mean by that specific power and is it something that an employee like Mark Zuckerberg is going to wield on his own or just the company's power in political influence?
I think Robert Bork narrowed the standards we use for antitrust and for breaking up big companies. Market dominance by itself, when you totally dominate a market, that is anti-competitive. Then the platforms — this new — you want to go to the new part. The platforms themselves create a new kind of problem that we haven't seen. We can only do this by analogy, which is what we always do in law, but think of it this way. There's Amazon that owns the marketplace where people go and buy toasters and sell toasters, but they also are scraping bits of information off every one of those purchases. When they decide that your toaster business is getting very profitable, and they might like to crowd in on that, they take all that information they took from you without your consent and they go into the 2.0 version of your toaster business and move you back to page seven on the search.
But as the Republican negotiators announced Wednesday evening that they had reached a tentative agreement — which the House approved early Thursday in a 239-171 vote — Democrats lashed out. They said the proposal was layered with numerous unrelated provisions that they would never accept, including an effort to restrict government financing of Planned Parenthood, the women's health organization.
KK: As student loan debt has come up a couple of times, I want to make sure we have a question.
So my plan to forgive student loan debt is capped at $50,000 and an income of $250,000. And the reason for that is because it is the best way, not only to give maximum forgiveness to a lot of people who are struggling, but it also helps close the black-white wealth gap, and is part of the reason that the N.A.A.C.P. endorsed it along with the other parts I was doing about investment in our colleges. But I really worked through hard on these numbers to deal with exactly that question and that's why I got the numbers where they are. I don't think they raise that same issue. I'm not ——
Should Mr. Biden select Ms. Warren, the Democratic ticket would be a marriage of contrasting policy ideas and governing philosophies unlike any seen since Jimmy Carter, the moderate governor of Georgia, chose Walter F. Mondale, the liberal senator from Minnesota, in 1976. And some Democrats are arguing that might be precisely what Mr. Biden needs as he tries to unseat President Trump — particularly at a moment when the country's deep economic despair could demand bold action of the type Ms. Warren pushed for during her candidacy.
House Republican leaders and the White House have restarted negotiations on legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, despite a similar bill being pulled because it did not have enough votes to pass.
After the endorsement interview, Senator Warren reached out to Mr. Warzel to clarify her response on 20th century antitrust. In that follow-up interview, she said: Antitrust law is a very valuable tool and breaking them up would have important effects but what I realized after I left in the room is that I was pulled in a different direction but I never finished to say that antitrust law is important but not the only tool we need. I don't believe that markets alone are going to fix all the problems we're facing on the tech side. Particularly the issues around privacy and the values that come from aggregation on platforms and how that value would be distributed. I don't believe only antitrust works but I do believe its a powerful tool we should be using in dealing with Big Tech.
He said he would either seek the Trump administration's permission to impose a work requirement or seek a block grant — and, with it, leeway to create new rules — to cover those who newly qualified for Medicaid under the health law.
Well, I think it actually makes sense to go all the way back and think about the origin of Medicare. [MUSIC] This is actually an idea that has been kicking around in progressive politics for a very long time. It had a brief moment in the Progressive Era in 1910.
Outreach efforts will include considerable awareness-building efforts to encourage the uninsured to go to HealthCare.gov and enroll, according to a statement from the health care agency.
And it seems to me that what's happened in the Republican Party is that you had a generation of people like Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney who thought that everybody was really in it for the tax cuts, thought that this economic libertarianism was sincere instead of a cipher for a broader set of grievances. Trump has stripped that all away and gone back to giving the base of the party what it wants. Once you discover that this is what the voters of the Republican Party wanted, I don't see how you go back to giving them what they don't want so much.
I think the main reason why health care at that time was so controversial is because doctors were really against it. Doctors were these small business owners, people paid them directly for medical care, and they really didn't want the government getting involved in their business and, perhaps, making it harder for them to make a living.
But the budget office pointed to another reason premiums would decline: Insurers would be allowed to offer skimpier benefits. In the absence of federal standards, the budget office said, insurance plans would cover a lower share of health care costs, on average.
Senator Warren's campaign ads pitch a 2-cent wealth tax to cover $700 billion in universal child care, $1.25 trillion in universal free college and student debt forgiveness, and more. But Senator Warren's tax would really be more than 2 cents on the dollar for the ultrarich, because you have to add the 2 cents to additional taxes she has promised on assets above $1 billion along with taxes on income and capital gains. Two University of California economists recently calculated that the Microsoft founder Bill Gates's net worth would be more than halved if Senator Warren's wealth tax in its original form had been enacted in 1982.
The new president wants to raise taxes on corporations, strengthen labor unions, expand Obamacare with a public option, stall the existential threat of climate change and spend $2 trillion on energy and infrastructure. On Day 1, he rejoined the community of nations who've agreed to the Paris climate accord.
Is there anything wrong with that passage? The apology tour thing was a constant refrain, even though Politifact declared it pants on fire. So were the Romneycare not Obamacare and job loss things, which were equally false. So what is the assertion here? That I should not have called Romney out on lies, because that would undermine my authority when a much bigger liar came along?
They could do this tomorrow, Judge Engelhardt said, leading Mr. Letter to dryly point out that Mr. Trump would need to sign off on new laws, too.
And I don't think that's the right model.
Mr. Azar and Ms. Verma had been discussing the idea with the White House for several months, but were unable to persuade Mr. Mulvaney and his allies, who shot down the proposal in two meetings at the end of last week, with the president's blessing, administration officials said.
Mr. Looney, of the Brookings Institution, estimated that the benefits from Senator Warren's plans are skewed — he estimated that borrowers with advanced degrees will claim 37 percent of the annual benefits, while representing only 27 percent of borrowers overall.
JB: And you would bring them all home?
I want to note something on bipartisanship that struck me as an interesting example of how this plays out. So there was a real interesting bipartisan proposal that came out over the last week, which is Senator Mitt Romney's child allowance plan, which is, in my view, a genuinely fascinatingly excellent piece of legislation. I have my quibbles with the way it's paid for, but you'd be creating a universal child allowance in this country and simplifying a lot of other anti-poverty programs in a way that, from every analysis I've seen, would massively cut child poverty, massively cut it — cut adult poverty, too — and really, I think, be a step forward. That is the kind of thing you wish to see, right? That is a space where you could really imagine Democrats and Republicans working together. And what was interesting to me was that immediately, the Republican senators who have been most vocal on increasing support for children, increasing, in this case, the child tax credit, which is a more complicated, less progressive, and universalist way of doing it, Marco Rubio and Mike Lee came out against Romney — instantly. There's not been, to my knowledge, even one Republican Senator who said they would work with Romney on this plan. And I was thinking in the aftermath of that that — not the aftermath. I mean, this is still a live ball with reconciliation particularly because you could pass that plan with just Romney and the Democrats.
There was a view that while health insurance was starting to become available as a way for working people to protect themselves, that once you got old and you didn't have a job that came with insurance and you started to get sick — that no one wanted to sell you insurance. And so he proposed this idea of having a health care program that would be financed by payroll taxes like social security, but he couldn't get it through.
Several legal experts have identified trouble spots in the drafting of the provision that could cause conflicts with other parts of the law. Various other insurance regulations depend on the federal benefit package, including a rule preventing insurers from imposing annual limits on how much care they will cover. Experts also say that, because of the way the provision was written, it may, in fact, fail to eliminate the federal benefit rules for most purposes.
No, but I think this is important.
1. G.O.P. Senate leaders are out of options in their efforts to repeal and replace the health care law, at least for now.
KK: Senator, a number of your opponents have proposed in various ways either new entitlements or other programs that would give cash directly to low-income families.
I think what's propelling Donald Trump's success more than anything is the feeling of many Americans that our politics are totally stuck. There is an overwhelming sense of stuckness — and the fantasy that Trump plays to, and plays up, is that he can pull the sword from the stone and do deals. No one was more responsible for this stuckness, though, than today's Republican Party. When Mitch McConnell, the G.O.P. leader in the Senate, said in October 2010 that the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president, he described the Republicans' dominant strategy since 2008. The party stopped thinking seriously about market-based alternatives. Into that emptiness entered Trump, like an invasive species.
So, there's a new conservative take on who's to blame for Donald Trump — and the answer, it turns out, is liberal commentators, and me in particular. Yep, by denouncing the dishonesty of people like Mitt Romney, I was crying wolf, so that voters paid no attention to warnings about Trump.
The other day the Trump administration announced a new trade deal with South Korea. It also announced that President Trump was nominating the White House physician to head the Department of Veterans Affairs. What do these announcements have in common?
Former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado was asked to address his criticism of Mr. Sanders' policies, and Ms. Gillbrand attempted to provide middle ground.
So we asked them: How much overlap is there between the two groups?
I think you're overlooking the places where we're not divided. I have three brothers back in Oklahoma. One is a Democrat. Do the math, the other two are not. And yet, all three of my brothers and tens of millions of people around this country get furious over the fact that Amazon reports $11 billion in profits last year and paid zero in taxes. All three of my brothers understand that we have an America that works great for giant drug companies, just not for people trying to fill a prescription. Works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for people who are worried about climate change.
Senator Warren frequently refers to Frances Perkins, who was Franklin Roosevelt's labor secretary. In The Atlantic, the former Obama speechwriter Susannah Jacob wrote that Senator Warren's campaign slogan Dream big, fight hard echoes a sentence in Ms. Perkins's memoir, in which she wrote that her heart sank when President Roosevelt questioned the public works program, because Ms. Perkins realized we must fight hard now.
Let me ask you both something, which is if there's one thing Donald Trump is good at, it's manipulating public opinion.
Excellent agenda. Sitting in disgraced, double-impeached political purgatory, Trump has been trying to retrain the world to refer to him as the 45th president during his unwelcome retirement. (If you are lucky enough to get a mass email from him, the return address will be 45 office.) How cool would it be if he had to sit in front of the TV listening to people talk about the former guy?
Now what is this? To work with him, or —
Yeah, I do agree that deconstructing the power that has gone to leadership to control every aspect of the floor agenda, trying to democratize power in the Senate would be a good thing. I think that the ability of leadership to control every minute detail of what happens on the floor is a bad thing for the institution. I just think that the political pressure on Murkowski, Collins, and Ayotte, who did feel a lot of pressure in this and lost her Senate race that year, to break ranks would have been enormous if the three of them alone could have been the difference in proving that there was a majority for Garland. What the cushion of 13 allowed Republicans to do was dodge accountability. Because when reporters came to Ayotte or Collins or Murkowski or whoever, they could just sort of point that way, and point at their other colleagues, and say, don't ask me. I'm not the decisive vote here, even if I came out and demanded a hearing. And they sort of did lean a little bit in that direction. It wouldn't have made a difference. And the insurmountability of that 13-vote cushion just took the steam out of the issue. It was very hard. We were trying to sort of mount a campaign and put pressure on Republicans to do this. But what I kept hearing from reporters again and again was, how are you going to get to 13? They're never going to break ranks.
Yeah, I can imagine. Nobody ever wants to answer this probably. To try this, you've got to have an optimism bias. And I do. I know that. It's an optimism bias that keeps me working 14 hours a day. It's an optimism bias that pulls you in more and more people to try to talk about it.
Margot: Were you surprised by his acknowledgment of problems? I know I was.
Even members of her own family take advantage of a flawed system, in her view, by getting Medicaid. They don't work because they don't want to, and they get free health insurance. She said. What the heck? If my husband and I, who grew up with relatively middle-class backgrounds in wealthy states, know people that mooch off the system in our immediate families, imagine what it's like elsewhere.
He campaigned on repealing and replacing Obamacare for years, and then he got to a vote and he said thumbs down, Mr. Trump said on Tuesday after taking reporters' questions alongside the president of Brazil, who was at the White House for an official visit. Our country would have saved a trillion dollars and we would have had great health care.
But that is the specific, right? This is the place where Democrats have fired on Democrats about how we're going to do health care. And I'll make two pitches on that. One is I think the best way we're going to do health care — this is just what I believe — is you do what you can to bring down costs. You got a little success on the table. It's a lot of success. It's hundreds of millions of dollars of success. You've got that on the table. You start to offer people what's possible.
Since entering the Democratic race in November, former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg has outspent almost all of his opponents in TV advertisements, spending over $100 million in just the first month.
But even if you do that— and I support those moves, there are all kinds of ideas on that front— on the big issues, the ones that really matter to us, there are still going to be filibusters. There's no way around that. And I think a lot of the reason why there are so many more filibusters now is also the increasing centralization of control of the Senate schedule, where the party leaders arrange things such that most votes that make it to the floor are clean and convenient kinds of party votes, where their members all know how to go. Otherwise, they wouldn't have gotten to the floor. That, in itself, ought to change, and I think there are ways to empower committee leaders to control some floor time to put some very uncomfortable votes on the floor for the minority party, whoever that happens to be. And a fair number of its members might feel like they need to vote for that bill because they believe in it or their voters want to see them support it. Senators now almost never have to take those kinds of votes. And so we're in a place where, in some ways, the cause and effect of the filibuster and inaction are hard to pull apart. But I think, ultimately, it is a good thing for a very narrow majority to have to get some support from the minority for its big ideas, if those are going to endure.
KK: But do you know of any specific evidence that immigrants drive down wages?

A major reason for the moderation in prices is that insurers overshot with their premium increases in the last couple of years, said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation. In other words, insurers, who underestimated their costs and often lost money in the first years under the Affordable Care Act, made corrections — and, in some cases, may have overcorrected — in the last year or two.
Now, the recovery is in its seventh year, the unemployment rate has dropped sharply to 4.9 percent and the private sector has chalked up 72 months of uninterrupted job gains, the longest streak on record. Oil prices may still be causing ulcers, but this time it is primarily producers who are feeling the pain, because prices have plunged.
Usually, about a quarter of the Connector's enrollees are between 18 and 34. But that figure was 40 percent for those who signed up during the special enrollment period, suggesting that the pandemic may have nudged so-called Young Invincibles to decide health insurance was worth the cost.

In 2012, Massachusetts Democrats, worried about a tough fight against Republican Senator Scott Brown, coalesced around Ms. Warren, knocking her only primary challenger, an immigration attorney, Marisa DeFranco, off the ballot. Winning in November is more important to Democrats than standing behind one woman who wanted to challenge another one for the right to run for U.S. Senate, Boston Globe columnist Joan Vennochi wrote at the time. Whether Ms. Warren could beat Mr. Brown, the incumbent, was more of a tossup, though by late summer 2012 most polls had her ahead.
There we go. But the point is there are some things about tech that are special. I mean, that we're seeing for the first time. Ways that you can be anti-competitive that we hadn't seen before, just like that was true in the early 1900s about, you know — you had the oil supply, and you also owned all the gas stations and how that one worked. We broke that apart.
Congress is debating repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, spurring concerns that more Americans may lose health coverage and become more vulnerable to medical debt. People with health insurance are less likely to have medical debt, but even those with health coverage have trouble paying medical bills on time, institute researchers noted.

But these efforts have tended to be cursory and short-lived, with tiny or nonexistent constituencies. Few conservative lawmakers talk about them today, and it's unclear whether many Republicans in Congress today even grasp the basics.
This is not how laws affecting the health of millions of people and an industry that accounts for about one-sixth of the American economy should be made. Yet, here we are. To senior Republicans like the health and human services secretary, Tom Price, this process is about getting to the lowest common denominator, not about improving health policy or providing people with better, more affordable medical care.
But the downsides of performance standards are often exaggerated. Most Americans are surely happy to pay a small amount more for their homes, for instance, if their children no longer have to ingest lead paint. And the initial skepticism about California's plan appears to have been misplaced. Critics predicted that the state wouldn't be able to meet its goal without hurting its economy. They were wrong: The state met its goal four years early, by 2016. The costs to consumers were modest and hard to notice. John Podesta told me he considered California's approach a model for future federal action.

LK: And a growing concern during the Trump era about violence. And I'm just wondering how you would address that, if that is in fact something that's not going to go away once the Trump era ends, which I think is a safe assumption.
Based in Louisville, Ky., Humana is not a major player in the individual exchanges and is among the national insurers, like Aetna and UnitedHealth Group, that have struggled to make money in the market. The company has steadily scaled back its presence, selling policies for 2017 in just 11 states. In early January, the company said the number of its customers buying coverage through the exchanges had dropped to about 150,000, a small fraction of the roughly 12 million individuals who initially signed up for coverage through the exchanges.
But Mr. Powell made clear that this was an intentionally small step. He said the move was not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts, disappointing those who either wanted a bigger rate cut or the hint of future reductions this year.
JI: Let me try to frame it a different way. What do you say to critics who would argue that it will take so much political capital just to enact the first portion of this plan, the aggressive public option that you've laid out, that it would be essentially impossible to then segue to a Medicare for all? You'll spend so much capital getting that first part that it seems — people have said it seems like a pipe dream to say we're going to have this aggressive public option, and then we're going to have Medicare for all three years later.
Oklahoma's Republican leadership had opposed Medicaid expansion and initially offered more limited alternatives. Gov. Kevin Stitt outlined a program in January in which new low-income enrollees would pay modest premiums and be required to work to gain coverage.
Senator Warren's support among young people — the Gen Z and millennial voters she describes, saddled with debt — has been on the rise. A November poll from Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics found that 22 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds support her, up from 4 percent in March.
Times reporting from Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley found that Senator Warren's wealth tax plan has broad support, including from 77 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of Republicans, with the exception of one demographic: Republican men with college degrees.
Yet the steady flow of right-wing commentary mocking concerns about the Supreme Court's legitimacy (and I readily admit to having added my voice to those concerns) leaves me with this thought: What about the other justices? Why is it assumed on the right that Chief Justice Roberts is the only conservative on the court who has its welfare in view and who worries about the loss of public confidence if the justices come to be seen as mere politicians in robes?
CW: Can I ask about that?
But the deep cuts enshrined in the budget's numbers are not consistent with modest tweaks. Taken together with Medicaid changes recommended elsewhere in the budget, the proposal would strip about $1 trillion out of Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act's premium subsidies, the two pillars of the law's expansion of insurance coverage. By 2029, the cuts to those programs in Mr. Trump's budget would represent around 85 percent of the total that the Congressional Budget Office estimates would otherwise be spent on Obamacare coverage that year.
I don't — I'm not — I wouldn't count on that.
Both proposals offered far less money to fight Zika than the $1.9 billion requested by the Obama administration. Still, Senate Democrats and the White House had indicated some willingness to go along with the Senate plan.
Then came Nov. 8, 2016. It was terrifying, Gabriel said of Trump's victory. She worried about the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the return of insurance discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions. Her older daughter, who is 11, had been excited to see a woman president, but was picked on by her classmates in their largely conservative area for supporting Hillary Clinton. It was awful to have to tell her the morning after, Gabriel said. She let her stay home from school Nov. 9.
Well, there's been a significant amount of legal legislation that has surrounded all of this political action.
archived recording Some Republicans are nervous about that, including House minority leader Kevin McCarthy. According to Axios, McCarthy called the president and told him the decision made no sense, saying the health care battle helped Democrats win the House and several state capitals last year.
I want to draw out a move that was made in that era, but before I do, I want to note something. Because there's a slight bit to that I disagree with you on. And it goes back to our budget reconciliation discussion earlier. We still do have two classes of legislation. And so for people who think this is not the world we live in now, one thing I do want to note is that all kinds of civil rights legislation that needs to be passed now — the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, the For the People Act, which has all kinds of automatic voter registration and voter protection and amplifies small donor donations six to one, so you begin to rid big money of its control of politics — that will all get filibustered. DC statehood to enfranchise DC, which is primarily African-American voters, cannot pass because of the filibuster. But the Trump tax cuts could pass because he only needed 51 votes. You could repeal Obamacare because you only needed 51 votes. They didn't get it, but they could have. There's still tracking. And I mean, it hits all kinds of different things now, so it's not the way it was before, where it's just civil rights issues. But I do want to note that civil rights issues remain subject to a much higher threshold than, say, a corporate tax cut.
In 2009, when the Affordable Care Act was being written, Sarah Palin popularized the phrase Obama's 'death panel,' which became a rallying cry for the Tea Party.

Under Senator Warren's plan to pay for Medicare for all, a substantial chunk of funds would come from an employer contribution into the health care fund. Senator Sanders has not released a detailed plan explaining how he would pay for the system.
Republicans are also spending far too little time on trying to deal with the underlying problem of costs. A couple of suggestions: How about requiring hospitals to publish their prices, and allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices (which Donald Trump backed as a candidate)?

WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans took their first major step toward repealing the Affordable Care Act on Thursday, approving a budget blueprint that would allow them to gut the health care law without the threat of a Democratic filibuster.
And I'll note, you can listen to Yuval. He was on the show just a couple of weeks ago. The episode is called, Can the Republican Party be Saved? What's the last book you read that actually changed your mind about anything?
Yes and no. I think you have to see the Affordable Care Act as a sort of compromise. As a moderate proposal that expands some government health care, expands some private insurance, keeps a lot of what already exists and doesn't take things away from people. But I also think that it did change Americans' expectations about what the role for government was in health care, and also what kind of health care they were entitled to. So, you know, we're moving closer to the idea that everyone should be able to have health insurance, even if they're poor, even if they don't get insurance through work. And there are certain guarantees in the Affordable Care Act, like the guarantee that people who have pre-existing health conditions should be able to buy insurance —

I think there's a question that gets asked a lot today, which is, where does the Republican Party go from here? And I don't want to ask that specific question. I think it is a axiomatically important, that America needs a responsible right-wing party. It needs a party on the right that governs, that is, in some way or another, committed to the system itself. I think this is how political systems work, and they don't work well if the right-wing party goes off the rails. So I think you have views about where the Republican Party should go. It would be, ideologically, not the right party for me, but I think I'd probably be happier if you were in charge over there. So how does the Republican Party change? When you think about what's going to happen to it, as an institution, what are the levers? What are the pathways? Who are the leaders? When you think about a good future for the Republican Party, one that moves in a direction you'll be happier with, what are the points of pressure and power that can be leveraged there?

Can I just say quickly we've exaggerated them very specifically to put women in a subservient position. Right? So that's the problem, I mean, basically saying that women aren't fit, weren't fit to vote, then weren't fit to run for office, or basically only fit to be a sort of live-in maid, and concubine, and nanny, and are built to do all of the drudgery that men don't want to do but that then kind of makes men's lives easier. That wasn't an accident. But in a way, I think you kind of have to be cognizant of gender in order to see the way that it still functions to women's detriment.

In other words, could it be that the problem with Chief Justice Roberts is that he isn't sufficiently political in the right direction? That was certainly the message Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas sent last month when called the chief justice the tip of the spear in playing politics. In remarks at the Heritage Foundation, he explained: Chief Justice John Roberts knowingly, clearly and unabashedly rewrote Obamacare twice. What we are seeing is nothing more than naked politics being played by the United States Supreme Court. (By twice, Governor Abbott was referring to the chief justice's majority opinion last year in King v. Burwell, which saved the statute from a contorted reading that would have stripped the federal government of the ability to set up insurance exchanges.)
Senator Warren published an op-ed in The Washington Post in 2015 attacking the investor-state dispute settlement clause in the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement, which she argued would tilt the playing field in the United States further in favor of big multinational corporations.

Ms. Hanks's experience illustrates how America's employment-based health insurance system could become another liability in the country's fight to contain coronavirus. It could push workers at highest risk of serious illness from coronavirus back to work the fastest. Those people need coverage to treat the pre-existing conditions that make them vulnerable in the first place.
While President Obama himself didn't personally appear in court to defend the Affordable Care Act, the legal challenges hurled at the legislation demanded years of government and legal resources, not to mention public attention — so the legal dimension of the health care fight can't be discounted.

The People and Forces Behind America's Fifty-Year Fall — and Those Fighting to Reverse It
Early in the campaign, Mr. Trump's response to specific policy questions was often to assure voters that he would hire intelligent people to work on the problem. In his book Crippled America, he wrote that to develop a replacement for Obamacare, we should hire the most knowledgeable people in the world on this subject and lock them in a room — and not unlock the door until they've agreed on the steps we need to take.
The dividing line, the litmus test that helps people to see if they are on the right or the left seems to be changing.

You really could tell everybody almost based on that. Economic issues were the locus of party competition, and social issues and views were much more mixed in between the parties. And that seems to me to have changed, not that literally Republicans are voting for a bunch of tax increases in Congress. They're not. But in terms of where the energy in the party is, in terms of where the energy between the party is, it seems to me, it's moved much more towards the issues of civil rights, of demographic change, of LGBTQ rights, of gender issues, of what people broadly categorize as social issues. And I do think that has changed some of the elite lining up. I would say that a lot of corporate America is still quite fiscally conservative, so to speak. There's not a lot of great statements in support of Medicare For All or some other kind of single-payer health care or cutting the child poverty rate by half, all kinds of things that I think of as very, very, very important questions within our political sphere.
BA: Would you reduce existing access in order to achieve that goal?
In town for Mr. Trump's inauguration, nine governors — some who had expanded Medicaid under the law and some who had refused — presented a united message: The Obama administration was too rigid in prescribing standards for Medicaid and private insurance coverage, and states need more power to set their own policies.
Right. And that's the position they held for about a week.
America regularly renegotiates its defense cost-sharing agreements with host countries. In November, Mr. Trump asked Japan to quadruple its payments for the American troop presence.

The only exception, the only issue where he does actually have some details to offer, is immigration reform. But here the speech's appeal to the assembled legislators to make a version of the deal he's offering on DACA — essentially an amnesty and path to citizenship now in exchange for future immigration reductions — was undercut by all the fearmongering about immigrant crime that Trump wrapped it in. For Democratic politicians whose base doesn't want to compromise and whose own political interest isn't served by any kind of major immigration deal, the bloody-shirt business with MS-13 murders was a permission slip for intransigence: Why make a bargain with a president who talks like half your immigrant constituents are gangbangers?
Democrats want universal coverage, but actually most of the roughly 28 million uninsured Americans are already eligible for public coverage or an employer plan. That's not true of 2.5 million people who live in states that have not yet expanded Medicaid and have incomes below the federal poverty line. They are ineligible for the A.CA.'s subsidies and can't afford to buy coverage on their own. Republicans should embrace a compromise that allows the non-expansion states to expand Medicaid eligibility to 100 percent of the federal poverty line instead of 138 percent as required by the A.C.A. The expansion states could stay at 138 percent if they wanted to. States should also be given more flexibility to run the program with less federal interference in return for accepting limits on overall spending.
JI: So you have, on one hand, the boldest public option that's probably been offered by any of the Democratic candidates. On the other hand, you have the most aggressive Medicare for all universal plan that's been offered. You'll be, if I understand it correctly, starting with this aggressive public option hoping to segue to a Medicare for all by year three, and in the middle of all that, you will probably be called upon to defend the Affordable Care Act at the Supreme Court level. How do you think about those three — and of distinct — that just seems like an awful lot of health care reform.
It means that during the time in which you possess political influence and power, you use it.
Insurers and brokers have an incentive to market these plans
The case, California v. Texas, No. 19-840, was brought by Republican officials who said the law's mandate requiring health insurance coverage became unconstitutional after Congress in 2017 eliminated the penalty for failing to obtain coverage because it could no longer be justified as a tax.
So what's really behind the war on the poor? Pretty clearly, the pain this war will inflict is a feature, not a bug. Trump and his friends aren't punishing the poor reluctantly, out of the belief that they must be cruel to be kind. They just want to be cruel.
The 2010 health care law is under fire once again because of a ruling by a federal judge in Texas in December, in which he declared the law unconstitutional .
Lauren Kelley: Sure. I wanted to ask about reproductive rights.
Yeah, it leads to poor policy design. You get these Rube Goldberg policies that were created a certain way, not because they're the most efficient way to deliver benefits to the American people at the highest impact for the lowest cost, but they're designed the way they are to comply with these restrictive and, rather, obscure rules. So you can feel the institution sort of reaching for the ability to pass things on a majority rule basis. And instead of going directly at the filibuster, they're taking this detour through reconciliation that maybe it's fine as a stopgap, I guess. But it's going to lead to extremely poor policy design that's not just sort of abstract in why it's bad. These are things that will cause benefits to be delivered less efficiently. They will open them up to legal challenges and ultimately, have the potential to undermine a lot of the good that is passed through this process.
But, Rhodes continued, the reality is more complicated than the Sanders claim that the party is dominated by corporate interests and is unresponsive to the demands of the working and middle classes.
MC: Not everybody likes Medicare for all, where you do away with private health care. Not everybody is going to appreciate if you've suggested that the candidate that they happen to back now is in the wrong primary. I'm just saying these things will come back as you have to win voters in swing states, things like that.
To certain audiences. He said facetiously — but not really facetiously — you recall that in 2010, John McCain turned himself into the most conservative senator in the Senate when he was running for re-election in 2010. That was the re-election when John McCain sort of tried to disassociate himself with the term maverick, when, in fact, two years earlier, he had based his entire presidential campaign about being a maverick. People at that point were asking, what's going on with John McCain? So I think, in a sense, he was pointing out the synergy between his hero eight years ago and what he was going through today. But again, that's a pretty transparent way of looking at and describing what is happening to someone when they are essentially doing political contortions. [MUSIC] Lindsey Graham is, one, a good politician, two, someone who is fully aware of what the political reality is for him as a conservative or someone who wants to be re-elected in a very conservative state and a very conservative party, and is someone who knows very much how Washington works.
JD: Do you think it's better, then, that the Senate finish a trial as early as possible next year?
WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Tuesday that he was never a fan of the late Senator John McCain, and I never will be.
Yeah. I mean, that's precisely it. I feel like gender and gender constructs have too big of a place in society in the way that we think about the world, in the way that people understand their preferences. I have a son and a daughter who are six and eight. And it's just crushing to me that they feel so strongly attached to very gendered expectations. They play with girl toys and boy toys and listen to what they call girl music and boy music. And it seemed to happen kind of automatically in a way that was difficult to think about how they were being kind of hemmed in by these gender expectations. I don't know if changing the pronouns we use will have a huge effect on this. But it feels like a small thing we could do to kind of free ourselves from what I think of as this kind of prison of gender expectations in society.
The tension between incremental and transformative change has been a feature of the 2020 campaign. Mr. Obama, for instance, weighed in to say that the typical American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system, an implicit critique of Senator Warren's and Senator Sanders's campaigns.
This is not a partisan statement. One of us is a Republican, the other a Democrat. We differ on many policies, including health care reform.
We know that Donald Trump, the first president without a pet since James K. Polk, appears to hate dogs. And the feeling is mutual, according to one of his ex-wives. He also uses pooches as pejoratives when insulting women.
Richard A. Friedman, in Mentally Ill Without Obamacare (Op-Ed, Dec. 12), correctly focuses on the necessity of preserving medical coverage for psychiatric disorders.
After vetting Chinese suppliers of masks, gowns, face shields and swabs, another call by Mr. Benioff, to the FedEx C.E.O. Fred Smith, secured planes and trucks for distribution. As David writes:
Six decades later, a similar impulse seems to hold sway in Washington. While Democrats search for a muscular patriotic language to win back Trump voters (or galvanize their own), Republicans and conservatives seem happy enough to claim the gentler mantle of reform, especially when facing popular skepticism or outright hostility toward their policy proposals. Having accomplished tax reform, Speaker Paul Ryan now dreams of entitlement reform, through which he envisions reducing the deficit by cutting back on signature liberal programs like Medicare and Social Security. In a recent open letter sponsored by the Heritage Foundation, 12 conservative figures urged Ryan, along with Trump and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, not to forget about health reform, by which they mean continuing the effort to undo Obamacare. Several signers of that letter have been described as reform conservatives, a loose term that signals inside-the-Beltway policy seriousness while creating distance from the more xenophobic elements of the Republican Party.

But the Trump administration has signaled loud and clear that its campaign against Obamacare is not over; that it will stop at nothing to achieve in court what it could not achieve in Congress; and that it doesn't care how many people are hurt if the Affordable Care Act is undone.
Binyamin Appelbaum: Would you reduce existing —
The House of Representatives approved the nearly $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief plan this afternoon — a landmark moment for President Biden. The plan, which passed without any Republican votes, will send direct payments of up to $1,400 to many Americans, expand a child tax credit and extend a $300 weekly unemployment supplement. Mr. Biden is expected to sign the bill into law on Friday.
But is that truly possible? And here's why I ask. Take a Josh Hawley because he's come up a couple of times in this conversation. Not my favorite politician in recent weeks, in particular. But here's a guy who what he is trying to do is create simultaneously a more policy populist profile than Donald Trump really did, take some of Trump's rhetoric and make it into to actual ideas, and at the same time, be as much or even more of a fighter against liberalism, against the establishment, against the forces arrayed against the right than Trump even was, in part because I think he's not able to be as naturally celebrity-oriented and outrageous, so he's got to do much better at getting into direct fights with people. And Josh Hawley cannot come together with a Biden administration over $1,400 checks, or whatever it might be, because to do so would be to violate the other side of his politics. If you're going to combine this kind of populism with this kind of anti-establishment, and particularly anti-liberal, anti-left, anti-Democratic-Party approach, where they're real villains who maybe even just stole the election, there's no room for compromise there. You have already ruled that kind of positive-sum negotiating out because to compromise with the Biden administration is such a breach of another part of your politics. It doesn't really matter what they think about checks or coronavirus relief or that the government should move when people hurt. You can't get over that first hump.
The problem as I see it in the housing market, just picking that one, is we have a supply problem. The two big providers of housing from half a century ago just aren't there. So the developer that built the two-bedroom, one-bath house, garage converted to hold my three brothers for their bedroom, that developer is building McMansions today. And I'm not mad at him. That's where the profits are. And the federal government, as you know, now under current federal law, can't expand federal housing. It can only do replacement when it's taking it off the market. And if it takes it off the market and it doesn't replace it, then it shrinks even more. Housing deteriorates like anything else.
NF: In the last month or so, your — I know you don't poll, but others do, and your poll numbers have gone down, and it seems to coincide with your major rollout of your health plan and the attacks you've gotten, basically painting you as extremist, going too far, both from Wall Street, from other candidates and elsewhere. And I'm wondering if that's because people are afraid of what you're proposing as much as others might like it?
Ignoring the binding vote, Gov. Paul LePage has refused to expand the program, blasting it as a needless, budget-busting form of welfare. He vetoed five expansion bills before the issue made the ballot, plus a spending bill this month that provided about $60 million in funding for the first year. Earlier this month he went so far as to say he would go to jail before I put the state in red ink by adding at least 70,000 more low-income adults to the state's Medicaid population of 264,000.
It's both capped in terms of the number of dollars, and it's capped in terms of the income.
The court had heard arguments on the law a month earlier, and Kennedy had already told the other justices he considered it unconstitutional. He wanted to strike it down. Roberts had a different view, wanting to invalidate some of the law and keep other parts. During their conversations that April, the two of them talked through the substantive issues that the case involved, like the law's health insurance mandate, the cost of insurance premiums and so on.
It's really interesting. Medicare for all gets more popular than ever. So, you know, it's not just that Sanders loses the primary to Hillary Clinton, who wants to do something much more moderate on health care, but also Hillary Clinton loses the election to Donald Trump.
In particular, the Justice Department insists that two popular features of the Affordable Care Act must go, too. The first is the guaranteed issue provision, which prohibits insurers from charging more to people who have cancer, or any pre-existing condition, than to whose who do not. The second is the community rating provision, which prohibits insurers from refusing to sell a policy to someone who can pay the policy's listed price.
So let me do the pitch, because I'll tell you exactly what the pitch is. That is the Affordable Care Act already requires employers to provide health care for their workers if they have more than 50 workers. I propose we just keep that in place, and that will yield about $9 trillion over the next 10 years. That's what they pay.
KK: As student loan debt has come up a couple of times, I want to make sure we have a question.
Vietnam recorded nine more coronavirus cases on Friday, including one in the capital, Hanoi, as a new outbreak spread beyond the two northern provinces where infections had first been detected a day earlier. Officials put the number of cases from the latest outbreak at 93 as of Friday afternoon but said that it could reach 30,000, nearly 20 times the number of cases that Vietnam detected during the entire first year of the pandemic. Vietnam has been among the most successful countries in containing the virus, with strict border controls, mask-wearing, contact tracing and isolation of infected people. The latest outbreak comes as officials from the governing Communist Party meet to select the country's new leaders, an event held once every five years.
That's exactly what we saw happen in the midterms.
Fighting corruption is, indeed, an issue with cross-party support. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last year, people ranked as the country's second most important issue reducing the influence of special interests and corruption in Washington.
This week's Campaign Stops column tries to reckon with an important part of the Trump surprise, which is the willingness of Republican primary voters — who are plugged-in, high-information, politically-savvy voters by the standards of the country as a whole — to support a candidate who is neither ideologically reliable nor obviously electable. The ideological part is fairly easy to understand: Trump represents (among other things) a revolt of ideologically-heterodox Republicans against the party's litmus tests, which lots of people saw coming even if we didn't imagine would take this form or rope in quite this much support. But the electability issue is trickier to parse: No Republican (or Democratic) primary in generations has produced a nominee with anything like Trump's unfavorable ratings or long general-election odds, and you would think the combination of eight years of Obama and the hated Hillary waiting in the wings would have concentrated voters' minds on that, ah, problematic aspect of Trump's candidacy.
Outreach efforts will include considerable awareness-building efforts to encourage the uninsured to go to HealthCare.gov and enroll, according to a statement from the health care agency.
So this is one of my things where I recommend not so much a show as a performance within a show. But I'm going to recommend Meryl Streep's performance on the second season of Big Little Lies on HBO. The season as a whole has been a little bit more forced. But Streep has showed up, basically, as the mother of a character who was killed by the female characters in the first season. It's sort of a cliche to praise a Meryl Streep performance, but it really is just a tremendous performance as this particular kind of older, WASP-y, slightly passive-aggressive—
It did allow people to debate if they chose to use that time. But when that debate becomes solely for the purpose of obstruction and delay and ceases to be about persuasion, you have to be able to end it on a majority vote and move the bill to the final stage of passage at a majority vote. That is how the framers intended the Senate to be. That would be a restoration of their original Senate. And that's what I think we need today.
But while Trump is willing to run trillion-dollar deficits to give giant tax breaks to corporations and the wealthy, he's as determined as the rest of his party to make life harder for the less fortunate. The grand plan to repeal Obamacare fell just short, but the administration is supporting a court challenge that could declare the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional. It is also supporting things like work requirements for food stamps and block grants that would de facto lead to major cuts in Medicaid compared with current law.
A 2018 Gallup poll found that a record-high 75 percent of Americans say immigration is a positive, including majorities of all parties. Yet immigration reform has become a wedge issue in Congress, with the government brought to a shutdown multiple times over issues like the treatment of Dreamers and the funding for Mr. Trump's border wall.
A recent op-ed in The Times argued that Carrie Lam's decision to characterize the Hong Kong protests as a riot echoed a moment in 1989 when The People's Daily, the newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, referred to a gathering of students in Tiananmen Square as turmoil. Protesters in Hong Kong demanded that the term riot be retracted.
Mara Gay: Actually, that's a perfect point for me to just ask you a question that's related. My family is from Michigan, and U.A.W. workers. One of the last things that they really love, many of them, is their health care. So I guess my question is, is both a practical one and a political one, which is why not try and expand health care access without actually taking away programs that people already like? Is there a way to do that? Is there even a way to get to what you're talking about without talking about it in such dogmatic political terms, and how do you — this is I guess the most important part of the question, I think, is how do you make the pitch to a U.A.W. worker that what you can offer is actually better than what they already have?
Those delays have been preferable to lawmakers than eliminating the taxes entirely, given a total repeal would have added an estimated $310 billion to federal budget deficits over the next decade, Ms. MacGuineas's organization calculates. That price tag was too high to be included in the 2017 tax bill, which was limited in scope by Republicans' decision to pass the bill on party lines using a budget reconciliation bill that only allowed for $1.5 trillion in revenue losses over a decade.
Soon after, in the middle of a strategy call with political aides and policy experts at his foundation, an excited Mr. Obama pronounced that a tailor-made moment had arrived.
In another wrinkle, August E. Flentje, a lawyer for the Justice Department, appeared reluctant to answer questions from Judge Elrod about how applying the ruling only to the plaintiff states would work. He was also vague about another new and surprising position the administration mentioned almost in passing in its May brief: that some pieces of the health law, though not its insurance provisions, should be preserved.
Uno de los aspectos más populares del Obamacare es que prohíbe a las empresas de seguros que discriminen a la gente que tienen enfermedades que requieren de un cuidado frecuente como la diabetes o el cáncer. El asunto es cómo hacer que las personas se aseguren antes de que se enfermen. Puede crearse algo como un Medicare para todos, o bien, exigir a la gente que compre un seguro y ayudar a quienes tienen bajos ingresos a pagarlo.
JW: Senator, do you think that the House of Representatives is moving too quickly toward a vote on impeachment?
On the other hand, some ask, should they pull out all the stops to delay a vote, gambling that such a move would end up being a wash with voters, and hoping that if they get lucky and take back the Senate, they can block Judge Kavanaugh's ascension, as the Republicans did with Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland?
Donald Trump sort of short-circuited the process by calling him first.
Over several decades, it's become increasingly clear that how immigration debates are framed is important. One of the more subtle anti-immigration tactics — employed by the Trump, Kennedy and Johnson administrations, as well as some on the political left — is to suggest that reducing immigration could preserve more jobs for American workers and lead to higher wages, but economic research has consistently disputed the notion that limiting immigration would increase domestic employment or raise average wages. The prevailing view of economists is that immigration increases economic growth; while some workers might benefit from immigration restrictions, more would suffer.
Senator Warren introduced the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act in August 2018, which includes provisions to block government officials from becoming lobbyists, bar federal judges from owning stocks and more, all to be overseen by a new Office of Public Integrity. Much of what's outlined in that bill made its way into Senator Warren's campaign plan to end Washington corruption.
So what happens after that special session, that minute-long special session about the election?
Well, I would take the combat troops out of there now. I see no immediate reason we'd send combat troops into the region, but I'd get the combat troops that are there now out.
One good thing is that the bill's stimulus, flawed as it is, still might give the economy a further short-term boost and undo more of the Great Recession's damage. Another good thing is the child tax credit increase that Rubio and Lee did win, which is much too modest but still a step toward the family policy the United States needs. A third good thing is the bill's willingness to raise taxes on the not-quite-rich upper-middle class, a constituency whose influence is often bad for the country and whose liberal drift and blue-state concentration has left Democrats leery of any confrontation.
So this State of the Union both showed what a more successful version of the Trump presidency would look like — still conservative on many fronts but more genuinely populist, less same-old G.O.P. — and why the possibility of that success has probably already slipped from this administration's grip. There were ideas here that could make Trump's second year more successful than the first, but there was no plan to actually enact them, no sign that Trump is prepared to build bridges where he's burned them, no plan for getting more out of this speech than just a temporary polling bump.
Another angle: A growing number of American workers could be asked to alter their routines because of the outbreak, or to stay home. Here's what could happen — and what rights employees have.
That sure gets a lot done.
The president has repeatedly promised something better than the A.C.A. but has never come up with a plan himself, and the congressional plans he endorsed were definitely not better for everyone, said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Mr. Trump has unsettled markets with trade threats aimed at China, which The Times has editorialized against. He famously boasted Trade wars are good, and easy to win. But a recent Axios report noted that China's exports to the United States dropped 23.1 percent this year.

But something surprising is happening here. Despite deep uncertainty about the law's future, Utah recorded one of the biggest increases of any state in residents who signed up for coverage under the act this year. Now, the state is seeing a surprising burst of activism against repealing the law — including from Republicans.
It's not the role of the federal bureaucrat to impose their own meanings on the words that their representatives have enshrined into law, he said.
And to me, a good example of that is Florida. I mean, Ron DeSantis, who's the current governor of Florida, ran a campaign last year that were it not for Donald Trump, I think, would have stood out for how racialized and, I would argue, racist it was. And Ron DeSantis is now the governor of Florida who's doing all kinds of things like trying to take voting rights away from African-American former felons. Ross, I take your point that this is not full Trumpification, but I do worry that it's moving in that direction.
Ramesh Ponnuru, thank you very much.
California is another state where polls show Mr. Bloomberg running far behind Mr. Sanders, who is the front-runner, as well as Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
So I actually disagree with a lot of what Farhad said, even though, Farhad, I think you and I come from a pretty similar place ideologically. I agree with you both about the prison of gender expectations and about the need for they to refer to people who don't want to identify with a gender. So I'm old enough that the word still trips me up a little bit. But you know, I use it, and you need it for the people who want it. Where I disagree is the idea that it should be universalized, for a couple of reasons. I mean, first of all, I think there is a real difference between changing language to adapt to an underlying changing reality and trying to use language to change the underlying reality. I think the second is very fraught. It enrages people. It makes them feel like they're being forced to participate in a lie or in propaganda. I think that people's attachment to the gender binary is extremely deep. And different societies and different cultures attribute different qualities to men and women. So these qualities aren't essential. They're extremely historically contingent. And this can be changed when they don't suit us anymore. There might be an argument to make for rooting this out altogether. But it's very hard, for at least me, to picture what that society would look like.
Spain's first case of the South African variant of Covid-19 was detected in the port city of Vigo, in the northwestern region of Galicia. Health authorities in Galicia said a 30-year-old man who works in the shipping industry returned from a recent work trip to South Africa and tested positive for the variant earlier this month. He had light symptoms and was not hospitalized, they said. Javier C. Hernández, Richard C. Paddock, Benjamin Novak and
But discrimination and repression were less severe than in the South. And one might have hoped that the terrible saga of black repression would finally have wound down after the Civil Rights Act, enacted a century after Emancipation, put an end to overt discrimination.
Farhad, let's end here with some advice from you. I was talking about your column with my 15-year-old. And I was expressing some skepticism. I'm one of those grammarian prissies who feels anxious about the difference between the singular and the plural. And my 15-year-old said to me, yeah, but, Dad, language changes. And so for people who were intrigued by the argument that you're making, how would you encourage them to make the language they use in everyday life a little bit less gendered?
Since Donald Trump's election, a loose coalition of citizens, doctors, nurses, activists and others have rallied together to prevent their fellow Americans from losing health insurance. They won a big victory last month when Congress set aside its efforts to pass a destructive bill. But now the coalition has a new fight.
Mr. Buttigieg said that criminalizing illegal entry is the basis for family separation. You do away with that, it's no longer possible. That person should not be the focus of deportation.
Why attacking corruption and getting some structural change in our economy that actually is about not just the wealth gap top to bottom, but this fact that more and more and more of our value is being sucked up to the top, and more and more people are sliding back behind it. And not having power at the polls. How those three things are tied to each other.
And so, at the confirmation hearing on his nomination to become attorney general, Mr. Barr said that he would review the Justice Department's position in the Texas lawsuit. Apparently he did just that — but instead of mounting a vigorous defense, he doubled down on killing Obamacare. It's as if Mr. Barr said to his predecessor, Jeff Sessions: You thought your position was crazy? Hold my beer.
So let me do both of these, because I think there are two answers. There are two pieces in this answer. One is, I think attacking the corruption in Washington brings a lot more people together than most folks recognize, and that it really does reach across party lines.
Well, I think part of it is how much you're willing to do two things: how much you are willing to push and how much you're willing to be creative about the various ways in which it's done. You know, we did the same thing in Asia with South Korea, with Japan, about which costs the South Koreans pick up and which costs the Americans pick up. The cost of moving, the cost of consolidating the land, the cost of maintaining security around the perimeter. There are a lot of different ways that we can do this, and I think we should be doing this much more in partnership. I think hectoring them and putting their leaders in an embarrassing position domestically, for each of them, do you cave in to the United States president who is trying to throw his weight around by picking up a bigger share of the defense budget? I don't think that's a way to further success in this area.
Because their cause is hate. It is un-American. They are domestic terrorists. And we need more from our president on this issue.
President Biden's Covid-19 relief proposal remains incredibly popular; if anything, it's getting more popular as it barrels through Congress. Multiple polls show that something like 70 percent of Americans approve of the $1.9 trillion plan. It's almost twice as popular as the Republican tax cut of 2017; it's more popular than the Obama stimulus of 2009; it's hard to believe now, but the Biden plan is more popular than Medicare was in the months before it passed in 1965.
I've spent lots of time reporting in countries where winners do imprison losing candidates. Believe me, we don't want to go there. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
And the Republican Party has come to be defined far too much by its opposition to the left or to some idea of the left. And so I think Republican politicians have not had to think about what they're for and what they want to offer their voters enough. And the doing that would not only allow them to approach the public in a much more constructive way, it would also allow them to broaden their coalition beyond getting out every last base voter and by appealing to voters who are winnable, who might be persuadable in other ways. There's nothing insightful about this. I mean, that's just an obvious description of what a politician in a democracy ought to be doing. But I think the party needs to hear that and think about it. And in these years, when it is mostly out of power at the national level, needs to be thinking about the agenda that it needs to put before the public going forward, a future-oriented agenda that is not about who won or lost the fights that are the sources of the grudges we've had for decades, that are not about finishing to-do list of the early 1980s, but that are about what 21st century America needs. And I think there are some people in the party who see that and who are inclined in that direction, but there are a lot of people in the party who don't.

James Dao: Moving from Europe to Asia, if China were to send troops, massive numbers of troops into Hong Kong, and impose a violent crackdown there similar to Tiananmen Square in 1989, what would you do as president?
And I still believe that Obama could and should have taken a couple of big banks into temporary receivership as the price of being bailed out. Obama definitely showed too much respect for the bankers who got us into the financial crisis in the first place.

From most people's perspective, yes, he was not a Democrat. He voted against overtime. He voted against Obamacare. He voted against the Dream Act in 2010. It just was clear: He was not only out of step with the district, but really out of step with the Democratic platform.
Under the proposal, the Trump administration would have offered more waivers to states, so they could devise and run their own health programs with federal money that would otherwise be available under the Affordable Care Act.
Senator Warren frequently refers to Frances Perkins, who was Franklin Roosevelt's labor secretary. In The Atlantic, the former Obama speechwriter Susannah Jacob wrote that Senator Warren's campaign slogan Dream big, fight hard echoes a sentence in Ms. Perkins's memoir, in which she wrote that her heart sank when President Roosevelt questioned the public works program, because Ms. Perkins realized we must fight hard now.
Millennials also tend to have a lower level of financial knowledge, which may make them more vulnerable to medical debt, another institute analysis found.
I wrote a very big Sunday review cover at the beginning of the presidency saying that, Democrats need to go big and they need to go fast and to do that they need to get rid of the filibuster. And then of course. Senators Manchin and Sinema said, Absolutely not. We will never do that under any circumstances. And so there is simply no doubt the Democrats are going to end up disappointing a lot of their base on a lot of issues, particularly around things that you can't do through direct economic measures. So statehood for DC and the offering of statehood to Puerto Rico, democracy reform, gun control, immigration reform, et cetera. But you can through budget reconciliation, get tremendously large economic and health care bills done. I think even plausibly, we'll see, but plausibly a public option certainly lowering the Medicare age. So we're going to have to see what that looks like in a year. Whether or not Democrats think Biden has delivered beyond their expectations for him or under-delivered, really depends on what happens with the Budget Reconciliation bills and how ambitious Democrats are willing to be with them. But I would say he surprised me to the upside, so far.

and other critical materials. We need emergency funds in order to make sure that we have those materials. The briefing comes as Mr. Biden is under intense pressure to speed up the pace of coronavirus vaccinations. A C.D.C. advisory committee met on Wednesday to discuss vaccine safety, as well as a new vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca. The C.D.C. said Wednesday that about 20.7 million people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and that about 3.8 million people have been fully vaccinated. More than a million people a day, on average, have received a shot to help protect them against Covid-19 in the United States over the last week. As the vaccine rollout accelerates, the number of daily new cases in the United States, which has the worst outbreak in the world, has been on the decline in recent weeks. U.S. deaths, though, remain high, numbering more than 3,000 per day on average in recent days.
Well, I'll start with 43 million Americans who are dealing with student loan debt. And not all of them are having trouble, but a whole, whole bunch of them are. Or how about the parents of 12 million children who are struggling to find child care? And I'm not just talking about one narrow slice. I'm talking about a whole bunch of parents across a wide range of ZIP codes and income categories who are struggling. I'm talking about the 36 million Americans last year who didn't have prescriptions filled because they simply couldn't afford it. Or the 35 million Americans who didn't go have a lump checked out at the doctor, or some other medical condition, because they were afraid they couldn't afford the — and these are people, most of them, many of them, with insurance, right? Couldn't afford the co-pay, couldn't afford the deductible. I think people are feeling this in their lives right now. And what is the spark, which is what I hear your question to be? It's you show them a path out. It doesn't have to be this way. Can I just say, the first time I think I came to The New York Times was during the financial crisis.
Let's back up. There are, broadly speaking, two ways a country can try to achieve universal health insurance. One is single-payer: The government simply pays the bills. The other retains a role for private insurance but relies on a combination of regulations and subsidies to ensure that everyone gets covered.
Biotech stocks promptly fell nearly 3 percent on Wednesday. They recovered slightly on Thursday and Friday, but the comments remained a warning blow for an industry that had rallied in the weeks after the election, on the assumption that Mr. Trump and a Republican Congress would be friendly to the nation's drug makers. Suddenly, it looked as if pharmaceutical companies might join Carrier, Ford and Boeing as targets of Mr. Trump's ire.
But a degree worse, two degrees worse. I watch that, and I watch as one more player in the game gets even more deeply embedded in Washington and Washington decision making. One more player hires more lobbyists, spends more money on campaign contributions, puts more money into bought-and-paid-for experts and think tanks so that nothing will change. It's like you talk about hardening between right and left. That's not the hardening. The part that's happening is it's hardening between the top and the bottom.
A recent op-ed in The Times argued that Carrie Lam's decision to characterize the Hong Kong protests as a riot echoed a moment in 1989 when The People's Daily, the newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, referred to a gathering of students in Tiananmen Square as turmoil. Protesters in Hong Kong demanded that the term riot be retracted.

The court had heard arguments on the law a month earlier, and Kennedy had already told the other justices he considered it unconstitutional. He wanted to strike it down. Roberts had a different view, wanting to invalidate some of the law and keep other parts. During their conversations that April, the two of them talked through the substantive issues that the case involved, like the law's health insurance mandate, the cost of insurance premiums and so on.

So I start with trying to understand the problem, what it means that tens of millions of people don't have prescriptions filled, don't go to the doctor. People with health insurance who are being sued by their hospitals for medical bills. I think of this as offering the most help to the greatest number of people as quickly as possible. So in terms of priorities, day one, there's a lot a president could do all by herself, and I'll do it.
The plan would reduce the federal deficit by $337 billion over 10 years.
The only areas still under yellow zone restrictions are the Kew Gardens and Forest Hills areas of Queens, two parts of the Bronx, Washington Heights in Manhattan and Newburgh in Orange County, he added. Elsewhere, general precautions will still limit gyms to 33 percent capacity and residential gatherings to 10 people, among other broader safety measures. We're not going to wait six to nine months to start to reopen the economy, Mr. Cuomo said. We're not waiting because the future is what we make it.

Other Silicon Valley chiefs are tapping their connections. Tim Cook of Apple sourced 20 million masks and Jack Dorsey of Twitter pledged $1 billion to coronavirus relief programs.
But even those issues — narrow, practical and still contentious — point to some of the limits of reform right now. A century ago, reform meant coming up with inspiring new ideas that would lead to greater justice, a confidence that human planning and ingenuity could accomplish grand and transformative things. Now it seems to mean, at best, restrained corrective measures — and far more often than that, actively undoing the policies of the past, an act of hardheaded resignation rather than of collective hope. Reform once promised a future of unparalleled opportunity. Today, it often marks the opposite, a loss of faith in the idea of progress itself.
Mr. Feldman and his colleagues aren't planning simply to replicate the federal individual mandate. Instead, they are trying a new strategy. People who fail to obtain insurance would still be charged a fine, but they would be allowed to use that money as a down payment on a health plan if they wished. Legislators estimate that many people subject to the penalty would not owe anything more to buy health insurance, after federal tax credits are applied.
So let's spend at least a couple minutes on health care. There is a lawsuit that the Trump administration is supporting that says that Obamacare should just be invalidated. Conservative legal scholars, including ones who supported past challenges to Obamacare, have called the case absurd and shocking. And yet a Republican-appointed trial judge ruled with the Trump administration. I mean, I just find this really alarming.
It's both capped in terms of the number of dollars, and it's capped in terms of the income.
But why can't Republicans come up with a better alternative to Obamacare? Are they just incompetent? Possibly — but even if they did know what they were doing, they couldn't produce a superior plan, because no such plan is possible. In particular, unless you're willing to move left instead of right, by going for single payer, the only way to guarantee coverage for Americans with pre-existing conditions is a system that looks a lot like Obamacare.
It's true that he would not be available to provide any advice or feedback to Mr. Trump. But, since Mr. Trump wouldn't listen to anyone except himself anyway, that would not be a significant drawback. And finally, his presence on the ticket could inspire alliteration in Mr. Trump's infantile rants, drawing in just enough educated voters to put him over the top.
Mm-hmm. One of the most vulnerable population to this deadly virus. And they start dropping off, informing their local jurisdictions that they don't think that they want to participate in the scheduled election. A survey from the Election Commission in the state showed that more than a hundred jurisdictions cannot adequately staff their polling locations, because they wouldn't have the right poll workers to do so.
I'm not going to do this. I'm just not. I'm not here to take on Joe Biden and what Joe Biden has done. I'm glad to talk to you about why I'm running for president, but not to attack him.
The Obama administration frequently published information about enrollment in the official marketplaces, where more than 80 percent of customers qualified for subsidies each year. But researchers had been relying on informal estimates from the insurance industry about enrollment from those who bought coverage directly. The new report provides more official numbers on those who bought insurance themselves. It shows that signups among people who didn't use a subsidy fell by 1.3 million people between 2016 and 2017, the most recent year with full data.
BS: Just to tie in with Charlie here, let's just take the prescription problem.
Mr. Trump has unsettled markets with trade threats aimed at China, which The Times has editorialized against. He famously boasted Trade wars are good, and easy to win. But a recent Axios report noted that China's exports to the United States dropped 23.1 percent this year.
This comes on the heels of reports that Mr. Trump lacks anything resembling a conventional campaign apparatus. Benjy Sarlin, Katy Tur and Ali Vitali write at MSNBC that while most campaigns have staff members ready to respond quickly to criticisms, Mr. Trump has largely failed to build such a team. The campaign's meager response to the Trump University scandal, the writers explain, left the candidate to fill the vacuum with a torrent of demagoguery. According to one Republican strategist, no one is really allowed to speak on behalf of the candidate except the candidate.
WASHINGTON — President Trump is expected to propose on Monday a $4.8 trillion budget that will include billions of additional dollars for his wall along the southern border and steep cuts to safety net programs like Medicaid, disability insurance and housing assistance, according to senior administration officials and documents reviewed by The New York Times.
In practice, sending Roe v. Wade back to the states would claw back a constitutional freedom to abortion that all American women have had for over 40 years. There are at least 20 states poised to ban abortion immediately if the 1973 decision is overturned, and legislatures in Iowa, Mississippi and Louisiana have already passed strict anti-abortion laws that could trigger challenges to the decision.
Such policies do not have to cover pre-existing conditions and can exclude common benefits like maternity care, mental health care or prescription drugs. The former administration also made it easier for small businesses to band together and offer plans that escape some of the requirements of the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Biden has asked federal agencies to re-examine these rules, which could take months to undo. Should the rules be overturned, patients who have such policies would be unable to renew them, which could leave them without insurance if they think coverage is too expensive. Mr. Biden campaigned on raising the subsidies for Obamacare plans to make them more affordable. Mr. Biden's executive actions on abortion put him in the center of the nation's long-running culture wars. Like his Democratic predecessors, Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, he will immediately rescind the global gag rule — often called the Mexico City Policy — which bars international nonprofit organizations that provide abortion counseling from using American tax dollars. The rule has been riding a philosophical seesaw for decades — in place when a Republican occupies the White House, and overturned when a Democrat moves in. Mr. Biden's revocation of the Mexico City Policy was part of an order that restored funding terminated by Mr. Trump to the United Nations Population Fund, known as UNFPA, the world's leading provider of family planning services, and a major resource for millions of women in more than 120 countries.
Conservatives are right to worry that feeding at the government trough breeds dependency and laziness. So I suggest we introduce pay for performance, using metrics like, say, health.

You don't think debates about racism —
Analysis: Why aren't progressives pushing Biden on the filibuster? Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts is one of several progressive Democrats who want to see the filibuster eliminated. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times President Biden has moved swiftly in his first days to start carrying out his agenda, signing executive orders and outlining new actions. But his most significant move may in fact be a reaffirmation of an old stance: that the Senate should protect the filibuster, the 60-vote threshold that has for years stymied expansive legislation, including on issues he now seeks to address. Progressive grumbling over the filibuster rose this week after Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, initially refused to agree to basic operating rules for the chamber unless Democrats agreed to maintain the procedural tactic. But it remained just a grumble, reflecting progressives' desire to avoid intraparty warfare early in Mr. Biden's term and their belief, shared more widely in Washington, that his hand may eventually be forced. We have to recognize that the Senate has fundamentally changed from the time President Biden served, said Senator Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, a progressive who has endorsed eliminating the filibuster. And it's made it impossible to move forward on big issues. Whatever the liberal wing of the party may want, eliminating the filibuster requires the support of the entire Democratic caucus. And several moderate senators, like Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, remain staunchly in favor of keeping it.
I think that is not enough, Mr. Barkan said.
WASHINGTON — Senate Republicans took their first major step toward repealing the Affordable Care Act on Thursday, approving a budget blueprint that would allow them to gut the health care law without the threat of a Democratic filibuster.
Thomas Jefferson was not a founding father of equality. He was a founding father of the heartbeat of denial that lives through both Mr. Trump's denials and the assertion that his racial views are abnormal for America and its presidents.
He's a little emperor of the house. So, I really enjoyed reading The Chronicles of Narnia to my eldest, when she was little.

Advocacy for this year's progressive causes by a number of the Democratic presidential candidates has become a source of anxiety for some well-respected, mainstream Democrats.

The Republican Party will either rally around its Republican president — and defend our shared accomplishments — or it will enter the fall with a depressed base and a turnout disadvantage that will lead to major losses in Congress, governorships and state legislatures.

What's your favorite book on the Senate?
Now senators are searching for changes to make the bill more politically palatable. But the notion of making those changes today and then speeding immediately to a vote is madness. There would be no time for experts to consider the consequences — to discover the sort of problems and unintended effects that last-minute changes are bound to create. By the time they did, the Senate would have passed it.
The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a program for restoring the ecosystem of the Great Lakes, was first implemented by the Obama administration in 2010. Federal funding ranged from nearly $300 million to $450 million every year under Mr. Obama.
But I take your question seriously. The place I might be most likely to fail is to get only part. Now, part's better than none, right? But only part. And that's a deeply worrisome thought.
Most Americans would still be able to get coverage under a plan provided by an employer or under a federal program, as they did before the law was passed, but protections for pre-existing conditions are particularly important to those who want to start their own businesses or retire early. Employers would sometimes refuse to cover certain conditions, and companies would have to decide if they would drop any of the conditions they are now required to cover.
Yeah, I can imagine. Nobody ever wants to answer this probably. To try this, you've got to have an optimism bias. And I do. I know that. It's an optimism bias that keeps me working 14 hours a day. It's an optimism bias that pulls you in more and more people to try to talk about it.
I think we need to get our combat troops out. I don't think that combat is advancing the interests of the United States in the Middle East, and it's time to end combat operations. Of course we'll have a continuing presence in the Middle East. We have interests in the Middle East with our allies. We have interests in the Middle East and keeping shipping lanes open, and we will continue to have a presence there, but I don't think combat troops are how we best advance that presence.

Hence his essential unelectability, which no centrist positioning is likely to much change. And the fact that so many Republican voters can't seem to see this, haven't been able to see this, may be a sign of cultural isolation above all. They can see how Trump might be able to win on the issues if he hadn't alienated so many millions of Americans on the basis of their race or sex … but they can't quite grasp how powerful that alienation is for the people who experience it, and how impossible it will be for Trump to overcome.

JI: Let me try to frame it a different way. What do you say to critics who would argue that it will take so much political capital just to enact the first portion of this plan, the aggressive public option that you've laid out, that it would be essentially impossible to then segue to a Medicare for all? You'll spend so much capital getting that first part that it seems — people have said it seems like a pipe dream to say we're going to have this aggressive public option, and then we're going to have Medicare for all three years later.
They don't, and they kind of never have, not a consensus plan that's supported by a broad cross-section of the party and voters. And that's why when the president came out with this position through the Justice Department and then suggested that Republicans in Congress ought to come up with something great, the backlash from Republicans at the highest levels of the congressional party was swift and severe. The view among congressional Republicans was that this was just sort of a total fantasy coming from the president. The idea that they would not only come up with a plan and come up with a plan that would be popular and meet the standards that the president has laid out in rally after rally, but that they would do it within a year and then run on it in 2020 just seemed like it was cut from whole cloth.
On Monday night, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin, who had opposed extending the deadline for absentee ballots in today's election. In a 5-to-4 ruling, the court's conservative justices wrote that such an extension, quote, fundamentally alters the nature of the election, and said that all absentee ballots must be postmarked by 8:00 p.m. Tuesday night. Polls in Wisconsin are scheduled to open at 7:00 a.m. this morning, but it's unclear how many poll workers will show up, how many polling stations will be open, and what kinds of protections will be in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus during in-person voting. Meanwhile, the virus continues to spread across Wisconsin. As of Monday, the state reported nearly 2,500 infections and 77 deaths. We'll be right back.

MC: No, I'm just saying ——
A majority of the American electorate — liberals, moderates and even some conservatives — want a greater government role in health care, a higher minimum wage, higher taxes on the rich and less punitive border policies. If Trump isn't going to move to the center, then their only choice should be the party that, no matter its nominee, backs each item on that list.
Republicans have a taken different tack. Perhaps the clearest example is Obamacare, the final version of which received no Republican votes even though it included conservative ideas and Obama was eager to include more in exchange for Republican support. But top Republicans, led by Senator Mitch McConnell, thought that any support of the bill would strengthen Obama and weaken them.
Senator Warren called for the House of Representatives to begin impeachment inquiry proceedings against Mr. Trump as early as April 2019.
It looks like the beginning of the end for Obamacare as we know it.
There is not yet an estimate of how many people would gain coverage under the Senate plan, but the Congressional Budget Office did estimate that the original House version would reach 2.2 million former workers.

As vaccine supplies lag, tensions grow in the E.U. Video transcript Back bars 0:00 / 1:07 - 0:00 transcript E.U. Pushes for AstraZeneca to Provide More Vaccines The European Union is pushing for AstraZeneca to supply more doses of its Covid-19 vaccine after announcing on Wednesday that it would cut deliveries by 60 percent due to manufacturing issues. Not being able to ensure manufacturing capacity is against the letter and the spirit of our agreement. We reject the logic of first come, first served. That may work at the neighborhood butcher's, but not in contracts, and not in our advanced purchase agreements. There's no priority clause in the advance purchase agreement, and also there's also no hierarchy of the full production plants named in the advance purchase agreement. In the contracts, there are four, I think, four factories listed, but it does not differentiate between the U.K. and the Europe — the U.K. factories are part of our advance purchase agreements, and this is why they have to deliver. Pharmaceutical companies, vaccine developers have moral, societal and contractual responsibilities, which they need to uphold. The view that the company is not obliged to deliver because we signed a best effort agreement is neither correct nor is it acceptable.

And he actually does much worse in general among those voters who describe themselves as very conservative. Now, we all have a distorted picture of this because of some obvious aspects of Trump, the Trump's racial politics, and Trump's nationalism, being the key aspect to this. But then also, because over the course of his presidency it was the very conservatives who became his strongest supporters, and the Republicans who defected, or became lukewarm supporters, were the moderate Republicans. But that wasn't the way it was all through 2016. And to get back to the question you're raising, it does strike me that a lot of the people who are trying to be Trumpist candidates, for the post-Trump party, whether it's Senator Cotton or Hawley or Cruz or Rubio. They seem to be under the impression that you can build a successful intra-party coalition from the right, in. And maybe they're right. They're professional politicians and I'm not. But even with the bizarre campaign of 2016, it has not worked for any post-1984 Republican presidential candidate.
On my way to work each morning, I pass a building with the inscription: The highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being.

One parallel Senator Warren has used in her plans for breaking up Facebook is the government's antitrust case against Microsoft in 1998, which Senator Richard Blumenthal and Tim Wu wrote in The Times made Microsoft a gentler giant.
Senator Warren has argued that the sheer size of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon pose a real threat to innovation and competition in the technology industry. Mr. Yang has argued that her diagnosis is 100 percent correct but that her solution isn't fully effective because competition doesn't solve all of the problems.

In an alienated America, efforts to decentralize power are more effective and realistic than efforts to concentrate it in the Washington elite. The great paradox of progressive populism is that it leads to elitism in its purist form.
They have spent, at this point, several days on the defensive about some of the claims that they made about what was likely to be in Robert Mueller's report. They are desperate to get away from their own divisive fights about the nature of liberal health care policy. You have had, in the presidential primaries, in the House of Representatives, even in the Senate where Democrats aren't in control, just endless tugs of war between moderate liberals, very liberal Democrats, far-left Democrats over what kind of health care system the country ought to have in an ideal world. Should it be European-style single-payer health care? Should it be a system that just totally does away with private health insurance? All these kinds of divisive debates on the left that have had Democrats tripping over each other. But President Trump weighs in the way he does on the Affordable Care Act, and all of a sudden all those conflicts hit pause.
You know, this is a hard hypothetical to take on until you actually know what's happening. Again, you've got to back this one up on where we should have started. When the unrest first started unfolding in Hong Kong, for Donald Trump to step back and say in effect, gee, I think China's going to crack down on Hong Kong, and effectively inviting it, I think is the wrong place for the United States to be. I think that we should have been in a position from the beginning, saying to China, we support these efforts in Hong Kong. That's part one.
BA: Would you reduce existing access in order to achieve that goal?
Over several decades, it's become increasingly clear that how immigration debates are framed is important. One of the more subtle anti-immigration tactics — employed by the Trump, Kennedy and Johnson administrations, as well as some on the political left — is to suggest that reducing immigration could preserve more jobs for American workers and lead to higher wages, but economic research has consistently disputed the notion that limiting immigration would increase domestic employment or raise average wages. The prevailing view of economists is that immigration increases economic growth; while some workers might benefit from immigration restrictions, more would suffer.
LK: There's a growing problem of harassment and trespassing at abortion clinics.
So let me push back on what your theory of change is, because the way the Affordable Care Act worked is we passed it, and then it was four years later when the benefits came in, and they kind of bumped into place, right? Look at it the other way around. What I propose is as many people can get into it as want to get into it, and then once they're in, try taking it away from them, because that's what the fight then shifts to. How did we end up hanging on to the Affordable Care Act when the Republicans had the House, the Senate and the White House? The answer was we ended up hanging on to it because enough people across this country said, You're not going to take this away from me.
The other big question hanging over us is about the continued spread, especially in the South and West, of coronavirus cases. Can the country afford to shut down again? Or is the right question whether it can afford not to shut down?
It's not whether he apologizes or not. It's abhorrent, Mr. Biden said of the policy, adding, Let's get something straight. The reason that stop and frisk changed is because Barack Obama sent moderators to see what was going on.
This isn't about how it turned out, Ms. Warren said to Mr. Bloomberg. This is about what it was designed to do to begin with. It targeted communities of color. It targeted black and brown men from the beginning. And if you want to issue a real apology, then the apology has to start with the intent of the plan as it was put together.
On the other hand, I do have some insight into how Ryan — who has always been an obvious con man, to anyone willing to see — came to become speaker of the House. And that's a story that reflects badly not just on Ryan himself, not just on his party, but also on self-proclaimed centrists and the news media, who boosted his career through their malfeasance. Furthermore, the forces that brought Ryan to a position of power are the same forces that have brought America to the edge of a constitutional crisis.
Meanwhile, the thing that the bill's centrist critics are most incensed about, the fiscal irresponsibility of cutting taxes without offsets, just doesn't look like that big a deal in the context of continued low interest rates and bond market unconcern. Like many people I accepted the arguments of fiscal hawks in the early Obama years, but few-to-none of their predictions have come to pass. I don't think Republicans have really learned from this experience and become less alarmist about deficits; they're mostly just being opportunists and hypocrites. But the experience is still real, and the lesson that the deficit is not, in fact, our major near-term problem seems convincing.

But I would argue that the best option we have on the table is to seize the moment that we have right now to try to fix some of these structural problems that you're talking about. And I do think things like DC statehood and Puerto Rico statehood, if Puerto Rico wants it, would help rebalance the Senate's tilt towards rural states. That would be very significant and help create a more level playing field. Passing a John Lewis Voting Rights Act would take away some of the enormous advantage the Republicans are staked to in every single election. If we don't pass any of those things, Republicans are going to still hold all of the cards that you described. And then they're going to have the option to get rid of the filibuster whenever they want to. So we have to seize the moment. In my book, I talk about an effort to get rid of the electoral college in 1970, which might sound fantastical now, but was actually very realistic at the time and came very close to happening. The reason for it was that both parties wanted to get rid of it. The 1968 election was weird. George Wallace almost denied Nixon an electoral vote majority. So both the Republicans and the Democrats had an incentive to get rid of the electoral college. They came extremely close to doing it.
But it's to work with nations and say, you want access to the American consumer, you've got to start raising your standards in a meaningful way. And here's where the long-term goals are, here's where you are, here's what constitutes moving toward those. And I think that's where a lot of folks would like to go, and frankly we should be working with other nations on helping, not just those who lag way behind, but those who have good standards to be using the same kind of approach to trade. The idea that trade is just about tariffs is just old 20th century. Trade today in the 21st century is about regulation. It's about who's going to have to meet what regulatory standards.
But I tell you, that's a lot of money. This idea is a bunch of malarkey, what we're talking about here. ... that puts working people first. Protester: Fire Pantaleo! Thank you, Mayor de Blasio. The— Fire Pantaleo! Fire Pantaleo! Protester: Three million deportations! Please be respectful. Please be respectful in the crowd. I think that folks are making a mistake by not pursuing impeachment. I just want to make sure whatever we do doesn't end up with an acquittal by Mitch McConnell in the Senate, which it surely would. And then President Trump would be running saying that he had been acquitted by the United States Congress. When we look back in history at what happened when a president of the United States started acting more like an authoritarian leader than the leader of the free world, the question is, what will we have done? And I believe the Congress should do its job. We have a predator living in the White House. We can no longer allow a white nationalist to be in the White House. The first thing that I'm going to do when I'm president is I'm going to Clorox the Oval Office. Adios to Donald Trump.
Violent repression helped drive the Great Migration, the movement of millions of blacks from the South to Northern cities, which began five years before the Tulsa massacre and continued until around 1970.
In between, administration lawyers told a receptive panel of judges in New Orleans that the entire Affordable Care Act should be overturned.
Health Insurance Innovations says it was never involved in Simple Health's activities. While the company said it had relied on Simple Health brokers to sell policies and collected the premium payments, it required all brokers to provide clear disclosure of the information necessary for consumers to understand the policies they purchase, according to its statement.
What book that you've read in the last year would you recommend most to the audience?
He appears to have warmer feelings for Kim Jong-un, the thug who starves his own people — We fell in love, Trump once said of North Korea's dictator — than for a majority of citizens under his rule on the West Coast. He has higher praise for a traitor and slaveholder, Robert E. Lee — a great general — than for the states working under a hostile administration without seceding from the union.
The amendment makes other changes to Medicaid: It would prevent any additional states from expanding the program to cover more poor, childless adults. It would take away extra funding from states that cover adults over a certain income threshold.
I'm sorry, say it again. Facebook?
In the end, the repeal effort's biggest hurdle may have been loss aversion, one of the most robust findings in behavioral science. As numerous studies have shown, the pain of losing something you already have is much greater than the pleasure of having gained it in the first place. And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that Mr. Ryan's American Health Care Act (A.H.C.A.) would have caused more than 14 million people to lose coverage in the first year alone, with total losses rising to 24 million over the next decade. Many Republicans in Congress were nervous about the political firestorm already provoked by the mere prospect of such losses.
We know that slaveholders in the American South used Scripture to justify keeping their fellow humans in bondage. They could find no words from Christ on this, for there are no words from him. Just a line in the New Testament from mere mortals presuming to speak for him.
He said he was proud of the progress of the last six years, especially the fact that 20 million people had gained coverage because of the law. But he acknowledged that — despite the title of the law — health care and health insurance were still unaffordable for some people.
Many Oklahomans have too much income to qualify for Medicaid under state rules, but not enough to qualify for subsidies to help them buy private insurance in the federal marketplace.
The crowd was relatively tame as it stood and listened to Mr. Gaetz criticize Ms. Cheney's mean girl-style politics, and erupted in cheers as the congressman described how he had recently spoken to Mr. Trump. President Trump is going to keep fighting for this country with each breath that he has, Mr. Gaetz said. He then played a recording of Donald Trump Jr. from his phone, who told the crowd, It's time to have change at the top. Ms. Cheney already has one opponent in the state legislature, Anthony Bouchard, who says he will run against her in the 2022 primary. The signs calling for her impeachment on Thursday were paid for by Mr. Bouchard's campaign.
KK: But this isn't expanding the arsenal at all. These are existing weapons that may or may not be in southern Turkey.
A white liberal progressive — as this reviewer would be labeled — confronts the issue of race in America with beliefs that make it difficult to face a reality that their fellow citizens of black or Hispanic origin take for granted. Basic to the liberal creed, for example, is the idea, as Barack Obama liked to say, echoing Martin Luther King Jr., that the arc of history bends toward justice. For many Americans, the arc never bends in any direction, least of all toward justice. Likewise, liberals believe that we can empathize, truly understand the racial pain of Americans of color and the racial resentments of an abandoned white working class that thinks their salvation lies with Donald Trump. If any moral quality has been strained to the breaking point in the polarization of our era, it is empathy, ours included.

Serge Schmemann: Let me ask you about the Middle East. In the October debate you said, I think we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. Did you mean nowhere in the Middle East? Do you think — for example, who should control the Persian Gulf, freedom of navigation, should we close down the air base in Qatar?
So John McCain passes away in August. And then just a few weeks later, you had the crescendo of the Brett Kavanaugh hearings. I mean, we all remember a very, very powerful day where there was a sense for about maybe two-thirds of the day that Justice Kavanaugh was in real trouble, that Dr. Ford's story was extremely compelling. Then all of a sudden, Republicans on the committee were speaking, and Lindsey Graham gave this real show-stopping speech.
We just undercut ourselves when we do that.
Consider the television markets across Texas; though they are heavily Republican areas, Mr. Bloomberg has often had the airwaves all to himself. He has been the only candidate on air in seven markets in Texas, spending a total of $4.3 million in those areas, though Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Mr. Steyer recently began advertising in a few. Still, he remains the only candidate consistently on air in Amarillo, Tyler, Sherman and Wichita Falls.
What is your position on reparations? I do believe that it's impossible for any rational person not to understand the cost of 400 years of slavery and then another century of Jim Crow. We have to find ways to compensate for that cost. Affirmative action, to me, is a form of reparations. So is health care — Obamacare or a variant. And there's reform of public education. One of the most radical things we could do to reform public-school education would be to equalize the amount of money spent per student in every school. That is never going to happen, but that would constitute a radical shift. Those are my three big principles of reparations, and two of the three affect poor people in general. But I'm a scholar of African and African-American history. There were palpable costs to antiblack racism that have had profound effects on the state of black America. These effects are cumulative, and somebody has to do something about it.
Consistent with whatever is revealed. You can't do speed independently of facts, right? But if that's what we've got and it's enough information for a charge of impeachment, then I think they can go forward and I think they should.
Who are you guys here to see?
BA: What is the right stance?
The authors of this fantasy are right that we need to do something about global warming and inequality. But simple attempts to realign incentives, like the carbon tax, would be more effective and more realistic than government efforts to reorganize vast industries.
Was conciliatory thinking along the lines of racists aren't ready for that in your head in 2009 when you were dealing with the incident with the Cambridge police? Oh, yeah. President Obama made an innocent comment that the arrest was stupid, which it was. Then all of a sudden all these racists are beating up on him. My whole attitude was channeled through the desire to protect our first black president. But there was another motivation. I thought that it would be hubristic and dishonest if I compared what happened to me to what happens to black people in the inner city. I thought, If I didn't have the protections of class and status —
JI: But one of the premises for massive health care reform is that the Affordable Care Act is not working in a lot of ways, right? So you support Medicare for all presumably because you think the Affordable Care Act has a lot of holes in it, and we need to do something different, so you'll be defending that.
And you may start out with modest increments and increase them over time, but there's no reason that we should be treating a country that is producing goods through prison labor or child labor or unsafe working standards or by polluting the earth, that we should treat a country that produces goods in that way the same way we're treating a country that produces goods with standards that are much closer to ours. We simply put our own businesses and our own workers at a competitive disadvantage, so we end up doing things like exporting pollution. Can't pollute here in the United States, but move this polluting industry. This way that you're going to paint dolls or produce chips, move it somewhere else where they have no environmental standards and then resell, and then sell those goods back in the United States.
So I actually disagree with a lot of what Farhad said, even though, Farhad, I think you and I come from a pretty similar place ideologically. I agree with you both about the prison of gender expectations and about the need for they to refer to people who don't want to identify with a gender. So I'm old enough that the word still trips me up a little bit. But you know, I use it, and you need it for the people who want it. Where I disagree is the idea that it should be universalized, for a couple of reasons. I mean, first of all, I think there is a real difference between changing language to adapt to an underlying changing reality and trying to use language to change the underlying reality. I think the second is very fraught. It enrages people. It makes them feel like they're being forced to participate in a lie or in propaganda. I think that people's attachment to the gender binary is extremely deep. And different societies and different cultures attribute different qualities to men and women. So these qualities aren't essential. They're extremely historically contingent. And this can be changed when they don't suit us anymore. There might be an argument to make for rooting this out altogether. But it's very hard, for at least me, to picture what that society would look like.
Manufacturing jobs described by Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders as lost to China cannot be found there, or anywhere. As Charles Kenny of the nonpartisan Center for Global Development has shown, technology is causing factory-floor employment to diminish worldwide, even as loading docks hum with activity. This transition is jarring to say the least — but it was always inevitable. The evolution of the heavy-manufacturing sector away from workers and toward machines will not stop, even if international trade is cut off completely.
It's got to be Master of the Senate. I mean, there's just no — no one holds a candle to Caro. And the reason I like it is that he is not reverent for the institution in a way that I think a lot of people who write about the Senate are. And he is very good about showing how the individuals who have come through the institution have shaped it. And I think his work — I mean, I don't want to seem presumptuous to say, but was hugely influential on my own.
Ms. Korey gave up her C.E.O. title after former employees told The Verge that she oversaw an abusive management system at Away, which created a firestorm on social media. She quickly apologized and said she would become executive chairman.
The stimulus package funds these extra subsidies for two years. Any extension after 2022 will require new legislation.
And am I right to think that both of you expect that, however it happens at the appeals court level or the Supreme Court level, Obamacare will survive?
Earlier, he set the tone for the pro-Obama messaging in his AFSCME appearance Saturday morning.

The House on Thursday passed a new version of a healthcare bill after the first one in March failed to get enough Republican support. This time, the debate hinged on Americans with pre-existing conditions. Here's a look at how the whole dynamic played out over the last few days: Republican leaders scrambled to scrape up support from two house republican factions: the conservative Freedom Caucus, and the more moderate Tuesday Group. Two new amendments were tacked on, making it palatable to both. The first amendment includes a waiver for states to opt out of covering patients with pre-existing conditions, a win for the Freedom Caucus. Democrats were quick to jump on this. Pelosi: This is deadly. Trumpcare means heart-stopping premium increases from anything from asthma to cancer and the list goes on along the alphabet and no Band-aid amendment will fix it. And then it was the moderates' turn to balk. They made it clear they wouldn't vote for it. Fred Upton (radio intv on Tuesday): I've supported the practice of not allowing pre-existing illnesses to be discriminated against from the very get-go. This amendment torpedoes that. It's not going to get my Yes vote the way that it is. (assuming we'll ID him and party affiliation w/ L3) Billy Long: I was always for the underlying bill. When they made what I consider the change to pre-existing conditions, that's when I said I'm a no. But by Wednesday, they had a solution.
In an effort to demonstrate a commitment to investing in health care, Mr. Biden also said at one point, What I'm proposing is something that costs an excess of a trillion dollars and we're going to get it done.
— Lindsey Graham was extremely outspoken about how the president should not have spoken out seemingly in favor of the white nationalists.
Here is a transcript, with annotations in blue, of the 80-minute discussion, which was filmed for a special episode of The Weekly, The Times's TV show on FX and Hulu. The transcript is unedited. [Related: Learn more about The Choice, or meet the editorial board members]
I have not finished reading the report, but they look like they've laid out their ducks. The Trump administration evidently does not wish to put up a defense and call its own witnesses. In fact, it seems to be still in the process of trying to block witnesses from coming and block documents from exposure. Yeah. And look, I think they've got enough. And if they've got enough, it can't be that the House impeachment process is the tail that gets wagged by Donald Trump based on when he's willing to allow access to various witnesses or various documents. Not even Richard Nixon tried to stop people from testifying or tried to stop the House from getting access to documentation. So they've got what they've got. If it's enough, then go forward.
BA: I appreciate that the toaster is still your preferred consumer appliance.
In December, former Vice President Joe Biden said that he would consider choosing Senator Warren as his running mate and wondered whether she would choose him. The Senator, for her part, has suggested she might prefer a woman.
Senator Warren frequently refers to Frances Perkins, who was Franklin Roosevelt's labor secretary. In The Atlantic, the former Obama speechwriter Susannah Jacob wrote that Senator Warren's campaign slogan Dream big, fight hard echoes a sentence in Ms. Perkins's memoir, in which she wrote that her heart sank when President Roosevelt questioned the public works program, because Ms. Perkins realized we must fight hard now.
Tres días después, Trump vuelve a CNN, ahora para hablar con Jake Tapper, y niega que él esté de acuerdo con un programa de salud pública.
But let me finish my point. If you fight on ground where I think you've got lots of bipartisan support and you lead a damn fight — and then — just — if you can deliver a 2-cent wealth tax, which has wide popularity, when I get to sign the piece of paper that cancels student loan debt for 43 million Americans, that's Democrats and Republicans. I think at that moment, the world starts to shift. I think at that moment, a whole generation of people who have only seen the government as debt collector starts to shift. Will we get 100 percent of the folks on board? No. But will we get a lot more? Will we begin to talk about a democracy that doesn't just work increasingly for a thinner and thinner slice of the top, or will we start to talk about a democracy that works for all of us? That 2-cent wealth tax is about child care. It's about things that touch people's lives. It's about universal pre-K for 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds. It's about a $50 billion investment in historically black colleges and universities, tuition-free. Technical school, two-year college, four-year college. You just deliver on something that matters to people. Now they've got a stake in democracy. It feels like it pays off, that it's not just marching in the street over and over and over, and the next day you wake up and it's a little bit worse than it was today.
Look, we can work — and this is what we should have done. We should have been pushing for negotiations with Turkey, with our allies, in order to protect the Kurds. And we could do that or could have done this as part of withdrawal. We could use economic pressure, we can use diplomatic pressure. We can use coalescing with our allies in order to bring pressure to protect the Kurds, and I think that's what we should have done. We've already abandoned the Kurds in the worst possible way and sent a huge signal to the rest of the world that the United States, at least under the Trump administration, is not a reliable ally.
CW: You previously suggested that Facebook intends to use their influence in this election. What did you mean by that and did you think ——
It still makes major changes to health care programs, including several that would tend to lower federal spending on Medicaid, by reducing the share of medical bills the federal government will pay for the Obamacare expansion population and imposing new requirements on beneficiaries who wish to enroll. All together, it proposed combined cuts to spending in Medicaid and Affordable Care Act subsidies that equal a trillion dollars — cuts that would mean substantial program changes.
Senator Warren visited Beijing in 2018, as Mr. Trump was waging a tariff war on China. She criticized his chaotic foreign policy, while arguing that America cannot support an economic system more integrated with China's while it fails to respect basic human rights.
Glenn Thrush of The New York Times reported, Mr. Trump, aides said, refers to nearly every program that provides benefits to poor people as welfare, a term he regards as derogatory. And I guess you can see where that comes from. After all, he's a self-made man who can't attribute any of his own success to, say, inherited wealth. Oh, wait.
And let them try it for a little while, I guess. But quickly, it's going to become clear that that's not just a fantasy, but an outright delusion. And then they're going to start to need to find ways to get to yes. And I think that shifting from saying, I'm not going eliminate it, but we have to find ways to reform it, to update it, to stop its abuse, all those things become on the table. I also think the blaming Republican option is always there. And that is a tried and true method. I mean, my former boss, Harry Reid, was similarly Shermanesque in his denials that he would ever change the filibuster. You know this very well, having covered it through this whole process. And then he changed it. And what he did was he said, rightfully, that the obstruction that Republicans waged against Obama was unprecedented, and that we'd never seen anything like it before. And they forced the issue. So I do think that, ultimately, the blame Republicans option is on the table because Republicans are going to put it on the table. They're going to obstruct pretty much everything that Biden wants to do. And Manchin and Sinema will have to choose between reforming the rules or getting nothing done.
A public option, supporters say, is the logical next step in the expansion of access begun under the Affordable Care Act, passed while Mr. Biden was in office. We have to protect and build on Obamacare, he said.
Mr. de León, 51, represents what many party members see as one of the leading faces of the next generation of California Democratic leadership amid calls for Ms. Feinstein to step aside to make room for the next class of leaders.
It's 5 percent of the pay for. Give me a break. No, we have passed it, and actually ——
That's a nice one. I like that. So look, I think it's one of the things that, as a country, it's time for us to take it on.
The importance of a grass-roots movement is there is one thing that beats fake news, and actually the data showed this, and that's somebody you know. It's somebody who actually talks to you. It's somebody who does the face to face. It's somebody who reaches out. It's somebody who knocks on your door. It's your neighbor. It's the person who talks to you in line at the grocery store. That's part of it. It's why you have to build — when I did inside/outside, it's also about the importance of building grass roots, building it from the ground up. It's why I made the decisions I made in running for president right from the beginning, which we can talk about in a minute. But for me, that's at the heart of it, and then there's a second part. I'll push first to get the anti-corruption bill through. I'll push to deliver on a meaningful anti-corruption deal. I think you can get a lot of people on board for that, Democrats and Republicans to push for it. I dare you to vote against it, right? That is a fight I will have, and it will be a fight.
Yeah, I'm not sure if that's true either. I mean, I do think that he's able to take certain extremely fringe ideas and mainstream them. But, yeah, we shouldn't forget about the fact that he is extremely unpopular.
James E. Cooksey, 54, visited the Health Department here last week and left with nine prescriptions for drugs to treat very high blood pressure and diabetes. Mr. Cooksey said his minimal income came from work as a Salvation Army bell-ringer in the holiday season and from odd jobs like mowing lawns. But he does not qualify for Medicaid because he lives alone and has no dependent children.
Second, a more McCain-like Republican Party would understand that racism is both immoral and, in the long term, politically ruinous. McCain had a multiracial family — the kind that is increasingly America's future. Rather than scapegoat immigrants, he took risks to pass immigration reform. After Charlottesville, he declared, White supremacists aren't patriots, they're traitors.
Senator Warren, then a Harvard professor, first introduced the idea of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in a 2007 paper in the journal Democracy. President Obama assigned her to build the agency after the 2008 financial crisis.
Democrats are on average more responsive to their less affluent constituents than they are to their more affluent constituents, while for Republicans the reverse is true.
MC: And there is a good question. How do you do that if Mitch McConnell still holds that Senate?
And Trump's tariffs suffer politically because some Americans are already being hurt, while the supposed beneficiaries have good reason to doubt whether they will be helped. In fact, even as Trump boasts that his steel tariffs have revived the industry, two major steelworker unions have voted to go on strike — because while corporate profits have surged, workers' wages haven't.
Having failed in their repeal effort, Republicans are now in something of an arranged marriage with the health care law. These alterations are being made in a predictably haphazard fashion, with little in the way of guiding theory, but the cumulative effect is to turn Obamacare into a law that they can, if not love, at least learn to live with.
But we need, it seems to me, better language for what we're dealing with here because I think we keep having and then rebutting arguments that don't actually get at what is worth being concerned about, which is simply that these groups have too much power. At the same time, I'll often hear on the left, well, just break them up. But if you actually look at the ways people would do that, if you split up Amazon Web Services from Amazon and you split Instagram off of Facebook, I don't think the situation would actually change in any significant way or people would be any less concerned about it. So I think there's some conversation that needs to be had, but I'm actually struck by how insufficient our current vocabulary is at least in politics. I'm sure there are people in academia and elsewhere debating this at a much higher level of sophistication.
Perhaps the most consequential issues at stake in this Supreme Court vacancy are affordable health care and a woman's freedom to make the most sensitive medical decisions about her body. The views of President Trump's next court nominee on these issues could well determine whether the Senate approves or rejects them.
AK: O.K. No, I mean, it's not my critique. This is a critique on the left as well, you know, that going about forgiving student debt in this way puts a lot of money in households that are going to make a lot of money.
The Fourth of July is upon us, so it's time once again to sing what is arguably our most baffling national ditty, Yankee Doodle Dandy. Maybe you've noticed: Some of the lyrics seem like the work of a prankster on acid. Who else could have conceived a vignette as bizarre as a man riding a pony into town, then sticking a feather in his cap that, for unknown reasons, he insists on calling macaroni?
Zucker's last TV job, as president and chief executive of NBC Universal, came with a huge corner office atop Rockefeller Center. At CNN, his setup is comparatively modest but seems to suit his metabolism and inclination toward micromanagement: His small office opens onto the newsroom, his desk positioned to face a wall of 11 television screens, so he can constantly monitor his network and its competitors. Zucker was met with a mixture of enthusiasm and wariness when he arrived at CNN in 2013. He had a reputation for intensity and competitiveness, which were both in short supply at CNN. But he was also known for being obsessed with ratings. You could feel the ground shaking, one former CNN producer told me. This iconic television producer was coming.
So I'd like to offer an opinion that will probably anger everyone: In terms of actual policy, it probably doesn't matter much who the Democrats nominate — as long as he or she wins, and Democrats take the Senate too.
And you may start out with modest increments and increase them over time, but there's no reason that we should be treating a country that is producing goods through prison labor or child labor or unsafe working standards or by polluting the earth, that we should treat a country that produces goods in that way the same way we're treating a country that produces goods with standards that are much closer to ours. We simply put our own businesses and our own workers at a competitive disadvantage, so we end up doing things like exporting pollution. Can't pollute here in the United States, but move this polluting industry. This way that you're going to paint dolls or produce chips, move it somewhere else where they have no environmental standards and then resell, and then sell those goods back in the United States.
So, Romney's idea is for a child allowance, which is a monthly payment, to nearly all parents in the US for each child that they have. If I remember correctly, it's between the age of zero and six, it would be $4,200 a year. And then thereafter, until they're 17, $3,300 a year.
The Defense Department then halted disclosure of data about specific installations. Lack of vaccinations has been a major obstacle to resuming war crimes hearings at the base's Camp Justice compound. It was not immediately known whether the defendants in the Sept. 11 case, including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, would consent to be vaccinated. An Army judge has scheduled an arraignment on Feb. 22 for three prisoners accused of conspiring in deadly terrorist attacks in Indonesia in 2002 and 2003. Under the timeline described by Mr. Trivett, prisoners who agree to be vaccinated could receive their second dose on the eve of the arraignment, the first at Guantánamo's war court since 2014. The arraignment hearing would be the first court appearance for the three detainees — Encep Nurjaman, who is known as Hambali; Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep; and Mohammed Farik Bin Amin — who have been in U.S. custody since they were captured in Thailand in 2003. Mr. Hambali, who is Indonesian, is held at Guantánamo as the former leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, a Southeast Asian extremist group that became an Al Qaeda affiliate before the Sept. 11 attacks. The other two men are Malaysians accused of being Mr. Hambali's accomplices in the 2002 nightclub bombings in Bali, which killed 202 people, and the 2003 Marriott hotel bombing in Jakarta, which killed at least 11 people and wounded at least 80. Lawyers for several of the detainees said they would need to consult with their clients by letter about whether to consent to be vaccinated.
Gail: Brett Kavanaugh seems to be a competent jurist but there's every reason to believe that if he's on the bench he'll vote to limit abortion rights. That's a very big deal to me. And it should be for people like Susan Collins, whose reputation as a champion of reproductive rights is absolutely going to go down the drain if she votes for this nominee.
What's remarkable about those top three is that they have radically different systems. Britain has true socialized medicine — direct government provision of health care. Australia has single-payer — it's basically Bernie down under . But the Dutch rely on private insurance companies — heavily regulated, with lots of subsidies, but looking more like a better-funded version of Obamacare than like Medicare for All. And the Netherlands actually tops the Commonwealth Fund rankings.
People tend to vote with their pocketbooks, and the strong economic performance will be at the forefront of every discussion this fall, said Jesse Hunt , a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee , adding, A contrast between single-payer health care and our ideas — a more patient-centered approach — is a debate we fully welcome.
So that is the political backdrop, you're saying, for this current battle over how to hold a primary in the middle of a pandemic?
Asian-American identity is in vogue, and Ross Douthat is the latest to offer his thoughts. But Mr. Douthat, focusing on the film Crazy Rich Asians and Harvard admissions, misses the complexity of today's Asian-Americans.
Let's be honest: Despite his reputation as a maverick, John McCain spent most of his last decade being a very orthodox Republican, toeing the party line no matter how irresponsible it became. Think of the way he abandoned his onetime advocacy of action to limit climate change.
Look what Frances Perkins got accomplished, first in Albany, but then when she went down to Washington. So here's a woman, she goes to Albany at a time when women don't even have the vote and gets herself appointed the head of a fire commission. And by the way, every time you see one of those lit-up fire exit signs, thank Frances Perkins, O.K.? But she not only does that, she then immediately expands it into labor law and workers and worker safety and worker protection overall. As you know, she then goes down to Washington, becomes the first woman cabinet official, and look at what she gets done in a short period of time. Social security, minimum wage, right to join a union, end of child labor, the weekend, my personal favorite [LAUGHTER], that Saturdays and Sundays are not treated like Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. But think about it that way. So we start with the corruption. That's what Perkins started with. She started by outing the corruption.
But the other half, let's say you have a complaint because the trade agreement had said that some other country would permit unionization or would not use low-wage workers beyond a certain point. Do you get a path like that? A quick resolution? And by the way, I should point out: That quick resolution? There's no appeal from it. It is immediately enforceable against a government. So you can go straight against Canada for raising its environmental standards. You can go straight against a South American country for raising its standards to protect its children's health from smoking.
During a 10-day break for the Supreme Court in April 2012, several justices left Washington to give lectures or take short vacations. But both John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy remained in Washington, and Roberts used the time to try to win over Kennedy on Obamacare.
Many presidents have done in spades what Donald Trump is only talking about doing. The article mentions Mr. Trump's attacks on the press, complaints about the judicial system and bold claims of presidential power.
Every one of the Romney campaign's major themes, from the attacks on President Obama for going around the world apologizing for America (he didn't), to the insistence that Romneycare and Obamacare are very different (they're virtually identical), to the claim that Mr. Obama has lost millions of jobs (which is only true if you count the first few months of his administration, before any of his policies had taken effect), is either an outright falsehood or deeply deceptive. Why the nonstop mendacity?
Senator Warren frequently refers to Frances Perkins, who was Franklin Roosevelt's labor secretary. In The Atlantic, the former Obama speechwriter Susannah Jacob wrote that Senator Warren's campaign slogan Dream big, fight hard echoes a sentence in Ms. Perkins's memoir, in which she wrote that her heart sank when President Roosevelt questioned the public works program, because Ms. Perkins realized we must fight hard now.
Did anybody ask Bernie to come in? he said. It doesn't mean he's a bad guy. It means it's going to be hard holding on to the United States Congress and the United States Senate.
On Tuesday, Marilyn Tavenner, the chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans, a leading industry trade group, warned that the state marketplaces were already on unstable financial footing. Failing to continue the funding aimed at low-income Americans, she said, would have far-reaching consequences because the business would become much tougher for insurers.
This was not the first time that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez had engaged in a much-watched Twitter tussle since she defeated Mr. Crowley, who had been a contender for House speaker if Democrats managed to flip the chamber in November.
Trump will probably accomplish at least part of the short-term goal and take insurance away from some people. But it is possible to minimize the damage, through an effective political response. Whether you're a Democrat, Republican or independent — whether you have already been part of the citizen activism or not — I encourage you to get involved.
Inside the White House, strict rules aim to slow the spread of the coronavirus. President Biden swore in members of the White House staff remotely on Jan. 20. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Senior staff members in West Wing offices are prohibited from meeting together in an office for more than a total of 15 minutes in a day, according to a senior Biden administration official. No more than six people are allowed to gather in the Oval Office at a time, and a maximum of five staff members are allowed to meet together in the spacious office of the chief of staff, Ron Klain, the official said. That means that both the morning and afternoon senior staff meetings in the White House are conducted on video calls, even though many of the participants are working in offices near one another. In the Roosevelt Room, gatherings are limited to 10 people. And when staff members remove their masks to eat lunch at their desks, they are required to close their doors. Visitors are not allowed without approval, and West Wing staff members generally do not intermingle with the team working in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building across the street. As the new administration finds its footing, life in the West Wing has become incredibly disciplined, partly because of the way President Biden's team wants to work, but mostly because of the strict rules the administration has put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
That he's up front about what this is and what it isn't and the degree to which this is an opportunistic transactional relationship.
Here's what else you need to know today.
New health insurance options aren't the only thing that has changed since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. A strengthening economy has nudged more Americans into the work force, increasing people's access to health insurance at work.
Facing perhaps the most difficult re-election of his career, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, is getting an early start against Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, the likely Democratic candidate in the race, with a new television ad hitting her for her strong support of the Affordable Care Act.
Senator Warren frequently refers to Frances Perkins, who was Franklin Roosevelt's labor secretary. In The Atlantic, the former Obama speechwriter Susannah Jacob wrote that Senator Warren's campaign slogan Dream big, fight hard echoes a sentence in Ms. Perkins's memoir, in which she wrote that her heart sank when President Roosevelt questioned the public works program, because Ms. Perkins realized we must fight hard now.
The story in Arizona was very different. The utility there, Arizona Public Service, is powerful and aggressive, and it fought hard against the initiative. Crucially, the office of the state's attorney general, who has received campaign donations from the utility, added five words to the ballot question: irrespective of cost to consumers. They basically placed an ad against the measure in the measure, Steyer said. It failed to pass, 69 percent to 31 percent.
So the way I see this is I think the old left-right division, yeah, there's a lot of that. But I think there's a very different division in America, and that is an America that's working for a thinner and thinner slice at the top and not working for much of anyone else. And there are a lot of Democrats, a lot of independents and a lot of Republicans who see that.
In the case of social media, Begala declared:
There are certainly bills that have been killed by Democratic filibusters in this Congress — just as there was legislation torpedoed by Republican obstruction during the Obama administration. The need to overcome a filibuster in the Senate on spending bills, and the influence that gives Democrats, was a primary cause of the protracted budget conflict that produced a brief government shutdown in January.
The Republicans make clear that that is not what they're interested in.
CW: Andrew Yang said in one of the debates that you're applying a 20th-century framework to antitrust when it comes to Big Tech. Why is he wrong on that, and what makes your proposal to break up Big Tech adequate for the unprecedented profits of Silicon Valley?
He reflexionado mucho y simplemente no puedo encontrar otro caso en la historia reciente de Estados Unidos en el que un nuevo gobierno estuviera tan empeñado en echar para atrás los logros de su predecesor, dijo Russell Riley, historiador presidencial del Centro Miller de la Universidad de Virginia. Mientras otros presidentes se concentran en lo que van a construir, este es diferente: está mucho más cómodo usando una bola de demolición que elaborando modelos para lo que venga después.
Binyamin Appelbaum: Would you reduce existing —
It's going to cost a fortune, he said in an interview at the time.
So I start with trying to understand the problem, what it means that tens of millions of people don't have prescriptions filled, don't go to the doctor. People with health insurance who are being sued by their hospitals for medical bills. I think of this as offering the most help to the greatest number of people as quickly as possible. So in terms of priorities, day one, there's a lot a president could do all by herself, and I'll do it.
Vietnam reports 82 cases, its first local transmissions in nearly two months. A street in Hanoi, Vietnam, on Thursday. The country reported 82 cases on Thursday, mostly in the northern province of Hai Duong. Credit... Luong Thai Linh/EPA, via Shutterstock Vietnam reported 82 coronavirus infections on Thursday, the first cases of local transmission in nearly two months, and the government said that some may be connected to the new variant that has been spreading rapidly in Britain. Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc has called on the two northern provinces where the cases were reported to close their borders to prevent people from leaving, the state-run news media reported on Thursday. Vietnam has been relatively successful in containing the virus. Before the latest outbreak in the northern provinces, Hai Duong and Quang Ninh, the country had reported only about 1,550 cases and 35 deaths. The new cases arrived at an inconvenient time. Officials from the governing Communist Party are meeting this week in Hanoi, the capital, to select their next leaders, an event that takes place once every five years. And people across the country are preparing to celebrate the Lunar New Year, Vietnam's biggest holiday. Vietnam's largest outbreak occurred in July in the central city of Danang, sickening hundreds and causing all 35 of the country's reported deaths before it was contained. Health officials initially reported two new cases Thursday morning. But the number rose to 82 by the afternoon, after health workers began tracing and isolating the first patients' contacts.
So the way I see this is I think the old left-right division, yeah, there's a lot of that.

President Biden yesterday continued his rat-a-tat run through the major policy areas he focused on during the campaign, issuing a range of executive actions and directives on health care. He ordered the Affordable Care Act's health insurance marketplaces reopened to let people buffeted by the coronavirus pandemic find coverage.
Clinton is right that we need leverage to get ceasefire in Syria. That has been Obama's problem. My column on it https://t.co/kPGV6dO0KP — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
The company's main focus has been selling private insurance under Medicare. Humana released word of its withdrawal on Tuesday after it announced that it would no longer pursue a merger with Aetna, another large insurer. The Justice Department won a legal challenge against the combination last month.
Recently I've been looking for examples of national comebacks — nations that were plagued by turmoil, inequality and polarization, but that managed to get their act together and emerge stronger than before.
BS: Right. You have a lot of people in this country who actually, if you asked them about Obamacare, they hate it. These are the same people who are being wounded by the constant diminution of medical care under the Trump administration. How do you convince those people? That's the issue, because he's talking about fake news and disbelief. We had the whole discussion about death committees.
Well, it's not good for them and in a dozen different ways. Wages are part of it, but they are only part of it. It's about unsafe working conditions, for example. If you can hire somebody for cash and not meet current labor standards on safety, that someone needs a safety belt or needs training to go up high on a building, you not only put that person at risk, you reward employers who continue not to follow the law and to undermine safety standards for everyone.
Mr. Trump had other ideas. Are there any other stupid letters that were sent to you folks? he asked in a conference call high-profile Republicans on Monday. You guys are getting sometimes stupid information from people that aren't so smart.
I was not a great admirer, as you can no doubt tell. Like most conservatives, I favor a more limited role for our robed archons, I admired Scalia's originalism precisely because it establishes plausible (if, of course, debatable) limits on judicial activism, and I regard Kennedy's Casey ruling as a vapid Emersonian effusion, whose paean to individualism was really a license to kill inconvenient innocents. Even when he was right on the merits of an issue, he was still too aggrandizing, too eager to impose his own judgment, too quick to short-circuit legislative debates.
I like markets. I believe that capitalism can produce enormous value. But capitalism without rules is theft, and one of those rules should be progressive taxation. Everybody pays their fair share. And one of those rules should be you don't get to crush the opposition. That's not how markets work. And that's a battle we had at the end of the 1800s and into the early 1900s, and it's a battle we need to have again. The giants have grown and they exercise so much economic power, but they also exercise too much political power.
America regularly renegotiates its defense cost-sharing agreements with host countries. In November, Mr. Trump asked Japan to quadruple its payments for the American troop presence.
— that they were finally able to pass legislation that established the program that we now call Medicare.
In a remarkable public break with one of his earliest political supporters, Mr. Trump complained that Mr. Sessions's decision ultimately led to the appointment of a special counsel that should not have happened. Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else, Mr. Trump said.
Actually, I've done 175 stump speeches and I've talked about it in every one of them. You all haven't covered it. I talk about three things that I think we need to do ——
— Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, conveyed in no uncertain terms to the White House that this was a non-starter in the Senate, that the president was free to do what he wanted to do on health care, but that Senate Republicans were not going to be taking the lead on this. It was not a fight they wanted, period, full stop.
So Evers would not have the power to make key appointments.
JI: So you have, on one hand, the boldest public option that's probably been offered by any of the Democratic candidates. On the other hand, you have the most aggressive Medicare for all universal plan that's been offered. You'll be, if I understand it correctly, starting with this aggressive public option hoping to segue to a Medicare for all by year three, and in the middle of all that, you will probably be called upon to defend the Affordable Care Act at the Supreme Court level. How do you think about those three — and of distinct — that just seems like an awful lot of health care reform.
Senator Warren frequently refers to Frances Perkins, who was Franklin Roosevelt's labor secretary. In The Atlantic, the former Obama speechwriter Susannah Jacob wrote that Senator Warren's campaign slogan Dream big, fight hard echoes a sentence in Ms. Perkins's memoir, in which she wrote that her heart sank when President Roosevelt questioned the public works program, because Ms. Perkins realized we must fight hard now.
The testimonials could counter negative publicity generated by rising premiums, the withdrawal of major insurers like Aetna, Humana and UnitedHealth from many counties, and the collapse of insurance cooperatives in at least a dozen states. The effort could also raise protests from Republicans in Congress.
MG: Your standing in some of the polls in the swing states is not as competitive as some of the other candidates'. Do you think that this issue is hurting you in the swing states like Michigan? If not, what do you make of the discrepancy in swing states?
Or three. I mean, how do you want to count it? [LAUGHTER] One is to reduce the cost for families on the first day. I mean, the cost savings doesn't come in on the first day, but you sign the papers that need to be done, so you reduce costs on the first day. The second is to give people the opportunity to be in Medicare if they want, anyone who's 50 or older, and expand the coverage for Medicare. It's to offer Medicare for all complete health care coverage to everyone else who wants it.
So, Mark, where did you start your conversation with Graham?
Well, I have to commend some of my colleagues at National Review, like Michael Brendan Dougherty and Robert VerBruggen. I'd mention Joshua Hammer, Helen Andrews, Coleman Hughes. There are a lot of voices, I find that they are increasingly people who are younger than me, which is a little dismaying. One of the plus sides of the lack of coherence and definition in Republicanism is there's a lot of interesting voices out there.
The United Automobile Workers has nearly one million members. Along with the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Teachers, it has yet not taken a stance on Medicare for all.
This has produced some fiery clashes, as when, in the October debate, Ms. Klobuchar suggested that Ms. Warren didn't know the difference between a plan and a pipe dream. But more broadly, it is miring the Democrats in an unnecessary fight over a policy proposal that is divisive and that would require a political miracle to achieve without a progressive takeover of the Senate. And even then, it would most likely be difficult — remember how hard it was to pass Obamacare even with Democrats controlling both chambers?
Specifically, critics of Mr. Biden's plan to invest $1.7 trillion in order to achieve net-zero emissions before 2050 had complained that his platform included few details on how it would achieve that faraway goal. The recommendations set a number of specific near-term benchmarks that Democrats would promise to reach. They include moving all electric power off fossil fuels by 2035; achieving carbon-neutrality in all new buildings by 2030; and installing 500 million solar panels in the next five years.
Perhaps the most encouraging example for carbon-tax advocates has been Canada. The province of British Columbia enacted a carbon tax in 2008, and it has worked well. It includes a clever provision to reduce political opposition: Every dollar that is raised is returned to families and businesses through tax credits. An all-star roster of Nobel laureates and former Republican and Democratic presidential appointees — including Treasury Secretaries George Shultz and Lawrence Summers and the Federal Reserve chiefs Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke and Alan Greenspan — recently signed a joint statement in favor of a similar carbon tax for the United States. But it remains a long shot in this era of government distrust. Even in Canada, the politics have become trickier. A nationwide carbon-pricing plan went into effect this year, and conservative leaders are fighting it intensely.
The investment giant announced this morning that it is converting to a corporation from a publicly traded partnership, following peers in making the move. The company also made another huge change: It is giving shareholders more say in how it's run.
So what happens in the last 24 hours or so to this Trump-led project to try to strike down, repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act?
Who knows? I mean, we are so vague right now. I think when Bernie Sanders says Medicare for all, we know what he means because he talked about it in 2016 and he has a legislative proposal. I think with a lot of these other candidates, they are kind of latching onto a brand name that seems to be pretty popular with the public, that reminds them of Medicare, which a lot of people like. But we're not in the phase of the campaign yet where we have really specific proposals that tell us exactly what it is that they want to do.
Trump says Syrian refugees coming in by the hundreds of thousands. Huh? Just 11,000 so far. Canada has admitted 35,000. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
Michelle Cottle: So here's a question about ——
Right, this bill is going to pass with, like, 51 votes or 52 votes because you get all the Democrats plus Romney. No, this is one of the biggest misconceptions about the filibuster. The misconception is the idea that it promotes bipartisanship, when, in fact, it does the opposite. Because it gives the party that's out of power the means, motive, and opportunity to block the party that's in power from getting anything done. And when the party that's in power doesn't get anything done, when voters see nothing but gridlock from Washington, they turn to the party that's out of power and try to put them back in office. And Republicans are well poised to take back majorities in both the House and Senate. All they need is a handful of seats to do so. So they have every rational political incentive to block Biden from achieving any victories. A program that, as you say, would cut child poverty massively would be a huge victory for Biden. The ability for Biden to pass it on a bipartisan basis would be a huge victory for his campaign promise to restore bipartisanship and unity. So Republicans collectively don't want to see President Biden standing at a signing ceremony with Mitt Romney, signing a bill that is going to massively slash child poverty because that's not good for their political interests and their desire to take back their majorities in the 2022 midterms.
And I don't think that's the right model.
More than one-third of Medicare beneficiaries are covered by private insurers, in what is known as the Medicare Advantage program. Many of the remaining beneficiaries have private insurance coverage, through Medigap and Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage or their former employers, to help offset the health care costs not covered by Medicare Parts A and B, which amount to almost half of the overall cost of their care. In fact, 44 percent of Medicare dollars goes through private insurance plans and a majority of Medicare beneficiaries must interact with private insurers.
This appears to be a misrepresented statistic. A 2019 report from the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University found that the median white student borrower has paid back 94 percent of his or her student debt, while the median black student borrower has paid back 5 percent. Read the report here.

That doesn't mean a Democratic candidate should stand for nothing, just keep it simple: Focus on building national unity and good jobs.
2. Did you spend at least one hour per week in 2017 engaging in any of the following activities: texting Congress; signing petitions; writing a Facebook post ending with then unfriend me right now; hoping to wake up from the nightmare; or pointing out that photos of Barack Obama's dog smoking marijuana are fake news?
The 2016 Vice President Apprentice would feature half a dozen V.P. hopefuls, such as Mary Fallin, Chris Christie, Scott Brown, Newt Gingrich, Bob Corker and Sarah Palin, all vying for the position. One could imagine teams competing to design the best wall along our Mexican border, developing alternatives to Obamacare and defining strategies to defeat ISIS.
Most of the changes will appeal to the party's right flank, including the Freedom Caucus – which has voiced concern that the bill does not go far enough to undo Obamacare – but there are also concessions to more moderate Republicans, many of them in the Senate. A vote is expected in the House on Thursday.
Elizabeth Warren, in her interview with the Times editorial board [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] on Dec. 4, largely stuck to her polished script — which the senior senator from Massachusetts said she has delivered 175 times — calling for big structural change to right the imbalances in the current American economy and end what she sees as endemic corruption in business and politics. She famously has a plan for that and had a (lengthy) answer for nearly every question.
After Senator Warren said during the October debate that the United States should get out of the Middle East, her campaign clarified that she was referring just to combat troops. Noncombat troops have long been stationed in the region for a variety of reasons including ensuring a free flow of oil.
KK: Should it be against the law for the children of sitting presidents and vice presidents to serve on the boards of foreign companies or otherwise profit from their parents' service?
By giving people the choice to buy insurance, Republicans could end up dangerously skewing the health insurance market, Obama administration officials and insurance executives say. Sick people are more likely to sign up, they say, and there may not be enough healthy people paying premiums to cover the costs for those who are less healthy.
Gabriel's family, who live in rural southwestern Pennsylvania, have private health insurance but rely on Medicaid to pay for treatments for Abby that her insurance doesn't cover. A lot of our life is dependent on policy, Medicaid policy in particular, she said. So she's always paid close attention to politics, but her involvement was necessarily limited.
The Justice Department said that the protections for people with pre-existing conditions were inseparable from the individual mandate and must also be struck down.
Gail: Brett Kavanaugh seems to be a competent jurist but there's every reason to believe that if he's on the bench he'll vote to limit abortion rights. That's a very big deal to me. And it should be for people like Susan Collins, whose reputation as a champion of reproductive rights is absolutely going to go down the drain if she votes for this nominee.
The Obama rule has been tied up in litigation for several years, and the Trump administration has declined to enforce it, citing a court ruling from a judge in Fort Worth. That means that the final rule does not have any immediate practical effects. Other courts that considered identical legal questions found in favor of the Obama administration's interpretation.
SALT LAKE CITY — From the moment the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, most elected officials in this sturdily Republican state have been eager to squash it.
A White House spokesman would not confirm the number of people allowed in meetings, or the time limits on such gatherings. But he said that in-person meetings were limited and that colleagues were socially distancing. So far, officials said, the measures appear to be working. But they concede that it's a difficult way to run a White House, just as it was a difficult way to run a campaign and a difficult way to run a transition. Adjusting to doing most meetings via video and doing most of our work with colleagues remotely has not been a massive leap, said Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary. It has been a long adjustment as humans to not being able to hug old colleagues or shake hands with new ones, but so far we don't feel that it has prevented us from doing our jobs.
Yet so chaotic was his first year in office that in January, after publication of the Michael Wolff tell-all, Fire and Fury, the president had to publicly defend himself as a stable genius.

That's the question of the hour, since they could try as early as next week. Republican senators have been meeting behind closed doors to draft their bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. We took a look at where key G.O.P. senators stand on the issue.
That sure gets a lot done.
Senator Warren's campaign ads pitch a 2-cent wealth tax to cover $700 billion in universal child care, $1.25 trillion in universal free college and student debt forgiveness, and more. But Senator Warren's tax would really be more than 2 cents on the dollar for the ultrarich, because you have to add the 2 cents to additional taxes she has promised on assets above $1 billion along with taxes on income and capital gains. Two University of California economists recently calculated that the Microsoft founder Bill Gates's net worth would be more than halved if Senator Warren's wealth tax in its original form had been enacted in 1982.
What stands between Democrats and this progressive wish list? One of the party's biggest weaknesses does.
KK: Well, it has to come to the Senate floor. I mean, Mitch McConnell already has an anti-corruption, election reform bill [passed by the House].
That loss was bigger than most experts anticipated, and led to a round of predictable laments from congressional Democrats — and less predictable ones from Republican senators, including Bill Cassidy of Louisiana and John Thune of South Dakota, who told reporters that the bill needed to be more helpful to low-income people who wanted insurance.
Some Senate Democrats said the GameStop hubbub — with a stock's value being inflated with little regard to the functional value of the company — showed that far stricter regulations on Wall Street trading were needed.
I said there were going to be two parts to this. So I've done part one about the inside/outside theory of change, but the second part, that's why we've got to do this through grass roots movement. We cannot do this through television commercials. If winning the presidency, and I'll speak only to the Democratic side, is about who comes in, and oh, let's see, drops $37 million in one week on TV ads, and that's what it takes to win a Democratic primary, then we have a democracy that's just our TV ads versus their TV ads, and at that point, they're fake news. They claim ours is fake news, right? Everybody just gets farther and farther and farther into their corners.
Aviva Aron-Dine, the vice president of health policy at the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former Obama administration budget and health care official, said that she found the magnitude of cuts difficult to square with the budget's language.
Asked for details on the proposal Mr. Biden was referring to, a campaign official said that his health care plan, when combined with related forthcoming proposals, would amount to more than $1 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Biden has already called to build on the Affordable Care Act and add a public option.
And the leader job was very much, what have you done for me lately? The Tea Party was on the rise. Ted Cruz, in the summer of 2015, came to the Senate floor, and in a moment of shocking violation of Senate decorum, called Mitch McConnell a liar in front of the entire world. That fall of 2015, the Tea Party successfully ousted Speaker Boehner and were very explicit about the fact that they were turning their sights on Mitch McConnell next and trying to take him out. And then you had the rise of Donald Trump, who McConnell opposed. And so when Scalia died in February, the day that Scalia died, there was a Republican debate that night, and it was sort of widely suspected that Ted Cruz and probably also Donald Trump were going to use that debate to come out and demand that Mitch McConnell block any Obama nominee. So McConnell didn't want to be responding to a demand by Cruz or Trump. He wanted to get out in front of them. So literally, before Scalia's body was cold, he issued a statement, getting out ahead of Cruz and getting out ahead of Trump, saying that he would block anyone Obama opposed.
The demands are a sort of warning shot to Republicans. While the party is eager to repeal the law as quickly as possible, and many have promised a replacement, its members are sharply divided over what shape any new plan should take. If they do not come up with an alternative, more than 22 million people would be left uninsured, including the more than 10 million who have bought individual plans on state marketplaces.
Under the Affordable Care Act, people who go without insurance are subject to tax penalties. The Internal Revenue Service says that more than eight million tax returns included penalty payments for people who went without coverage in 2014.
PhRMA disputes the suggestion that it backs particular actions by the recipients of its donations. PhRMA engages with groups and organizations that have a wide array of health care opinions and policy priorities, said its spokesman, Robert Zirkelbach. It is inaccurate and would be inappropriate for you to attribute those grants to a specific campaign.
And I think that if we are going to commit to the political project of eliminating gender as a social organizing principle, we should be really clear about the amount of political resources that you would have to devote to a project of that magnitude. And then, I guess, the final thing I would say is that my own relationship to femininity is pretty fraught. But I could easily imagine my trolls calling me they to call into question whether or not I am a real woman. That's probably true, I would guess, certainly not all but for some trans people who have gone through a lot of trouble to identify as a man or a woman as opposed to a person of indeterminate gender. And so we have to do a lot more thinking and arguing about what we believe about gender before we go off and try to impose it on everyone else.

She urged shoppers to consider costs beyond the monthly premium, especially if family members have chronic health conditions like diabetes. Human nature is to pick the cheapest one, she said. But lower monthly premiums typically mean higher out-of-pocket costs, which can add up if someone needs regular medication and treatments.
It drives me crazy. But this gets to something, and I want to talk a little bit about solutions here. So one of the things you will hear people come up with very quickly in this debate is, well, in the past, in order to filibuster, you really did have to hold the floor for long periods of time. We had to sit there and read from the phone book and bring your lunch and get tired and pass things off to other senators. So all we need to do to fix this is to restore the debate dimension of the filibuster. Now people just tell the leader's office they're going to filibuster, and the leader doesn't bring anything up. What we need to do is make them hold the floor. That's not the approach you would go for a solution here. Tell me why that wouldn't fix it.
This perceived decline and fall of the United States has inspired a 21st-century cottage industry of books devoted to how things went off course. They range from the journalistic (George Packer's The Unwinding) to the sociological (Robert Putnam's Our Kids) to the economic (Thomas Piketty's Capital in the 21st Century) to the political (Jacob Hacker and Paul Pierson's Winner-Take-All Politics). Many of these books tackle similar themes: the rise of economic inequality, the increase in political polarization and the erosion of the mid-20th-century social contract that existed for white men. We are living in a golden age of authors telling Americans that we no longer live in a golden age.
You know, when I put together my anti-corruption plan, which is a big plan about the influence of money, I didn't put the provision in, but it was mostly because it's like so many things, I hadn't actually seen the implications of it. I think it's actually a very bad idea, and I would like to see it as part of an anti-corruption —

The subject line of the email reads: Late note. Save for the occasional holiday flourish, it opens in nearly identical fashion each night: Good morning, all.
The House of Representatives passed H.R. 1, to strengthen voting rights and ethics provisions, in March 2019 and sent it to the Senate. It is now awaiting a vote there.
Will my yawning internal pit of desire ever be full? Is there any amount of cash that's enough to fully satiate this ravenous beast? Will Netflix and Spotify and HBO ever stop providing me with unlimited access to hours upon hours of entertainment to distract from the ennui that awaits me in real life? How many lipsticks is too many?
SS: The Obama administration tried that, Trump administration tried that in different ways, but no results. What kind of leverage would you use? What would you do?
Senator Warren has proposed using the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice to undo anti-competitive mergers currently in place, then passing legislation designating companies worth more than $25 billion in revenue as platform utilities.
The other day, Mr. Ammiano, who is 79, received a note in the mail from his alma mater, Immaculate Conception High School in Montclair, N.J., that contained some unexpected news — he would finally be getting his varsity letter.
Both Trump and Clinton have bad answers on taxes. A starting point: End step-up basis and tax capital gains & earned income equally. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
The other big question hanging over us is about the continued spread, especially in the South and West, of coronavirus cases. Can the country afford to shut down again? Or is the right question whether it can afford not to shut down?
WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Tuesday that he was never a fan of the late Senator John McCain, and I never will be.
Mark Leibovich wrote about Graham for The New York Times Magazine.
I'm sorry. And who's fighting Mitch McConnell right now and from what platform?
With the primary season winding down and the midterms soon upon us, it's time to point out that this election is not about what you may think it's about. It is not a choice between the particular basket of policies offered by the candidates for House or Senate in your district or state — policies like gun control, right to choose, free trade or fiscal discipline. No, what this election is about is your first chance since 2016 to vote against Donald Trump.
And it was very effective. They took over a lot of seats in the House that had previously been held by Republicans. But I think the exact message that they drew from this is a little bit mixed. I think a lot of them felt, oh, people really just want me to protect what they already have — that we have a very good message in protecting the Affordable Care Act. But some of these Democrats who won running on health care felt like this is a reason to go forward, to push further than the Affordable Care Act because the electorate really responds to this issue. And I think you can really see this now as the 2020 presidential field is starting to heat up. Senator Sanders, obviously, continues to support it. Cory Booker, the senator from New Jersey, is in favor of the Sanders proposal. Elizabeth Warren was a co-sponsor of Senator Sanders' bill in the last Congress. But it is not universal among Democratic candidates. We saw Amy Klobuchar, a Democratic senator from Minnesota, who said, this is too aspirational. It's too pie in the sky. We need to focus on more incremental changes that are more politically possible. They all want to make some increase for the role of government — try to have there be more health care available for more people, to make it more affordable. But there is this range from little technocratic fixes to let's do single-payer.
You're asking the fundamental question about how you break them up. This was the question for Standard Oil. How did they break up Standard Oil? They ended up doing it actually by geography back in those days, but that's obviously a very different world from the world we live in right now.
Senator Warren, then a Harvard professor, first introduced the idea of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in a 2007 paper in the journal Democracy. President Obama assigned her to build the agency after the 2008 financial crisis.
During a 10-day break for the Supreme Court in April 2012, several justices left Washington to give lectures or take short vacations. But both John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy remained in Washington, and Roberts used the time to try to win over Kennedy on Obamacare.
Their efforts foundered in March, when a House health bill had to be pulled from the floor after it failed to attract enough support. But now, the bill appears back from the dead, because of a compromise meant to attract votes from the conservative Freedom Caucus. The proposed changes would effectively cast aside the Affordable Care Act's protection of people with pre-existing conditions.
In the end, the repeal effort's biggest hurdle may have been loss aversion, one of the most robust findings in behavioral science. As numerous studies have shown, the pain of losing something you already have is much greater than the pleasure of having gained it in the first place. And the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that Mr. Ryan's American Health Care Act (A.H.C.A.) would have caused more than 14 million people to lose coverage in the first year alone, with total losses rising to 24 million over the next decade. Many Republicans in Congress were nervous about the political firestorm already provoked by the mere prospect of such losses.
Meanwhile, the great dealmaker at the White House was completely ineffectual. Mr. Trump spent a few days cajoling and threatening lawmakers, then threw up his hands and said he had done all he could and was now moving on to other matters. Groups representing doctors and hospitals, as well as public interest groups like AARP and the American Civil Liberties Union, fought hard, and even Republican governors like John Kasich of Ohio and Brian Sandoval of Nevada opposed the bill.
It was a very pitched and partisan setting, obviously. I think the collateral damage there is what it did to his reputation across the aisle, which has not been repaired yet. But in a sense, that sort of played to some very, very strong suits that Lindsey Graham had, beginning with being something that was delightful to the president of the United States and his base.
Reconciliation right now sort of gives them an out because there's a way to do it by majority vote and get things done without technically changing the filibuster rules. But it's not going to take too long to exhaust all of the things that are possible through reconciliation. And as you say, important things are getting carved out as we speak. And so you're quickly going to face a choice between essentially giving up on the Biden administration and admitting failure or having to reform the rules. And I think that when they're faced with that binary choice, I do have faith that they will come around and make the right decision.
Another gap in funding the following year, when President Jimmy Carter took issue with a costly public works bill and defense spending, lasted 17 days.
Jesse Wegman: Senator, I want to just take you back for a moment to Mara's question about swing states and swing state voters and your point about large structural changes that people warn you off. The other day, you repeated your argument that you wanted to be the last president to win the Electoral College and the first to win the national popular vote. How do you expect — I'm assuming you're not talking about a constitutional amendment. How do you expect to get there in five years, unless you're the president, unless you win the Electoral College and Donald Trump wins the popular vote in 2020?
Before the China Virus invaded our shores, we built the world's most prosperous economy, it begins. America gained 7 million new jobs — more than three times government experts' projections. Middle-Class family income increased nearly $6,000 — more than five times the gains during the entire previous administration.
I mean, I think, it's hard to deny that it has happened. You can certainly see that in the way Republicans have conducted recent elections and not just in the way that the Republican politicians have behaved, but the way the various factions of the party have responded to that. It's not as though you've got significant actors in the Republican Party who are demanding that Republicans run different kinds of campaigns that have more of a policy focus on it. And I think to a large extent, Republican voters are behind this. The Republican voters themselves have become post-policy. So, it's not as though Republican politicians are being punished for not running on policy agendas and then delivering on those agendas. If anything, they feel as though they're being rewarded for doing something different. Just look over the course of the last 30 years, right? So Republicans in 1994 run on a contract with America, which has granted quite a lot of slogans in there. But there is some policy substance to it. There is a felt need to say we have some ideas about what we want to do if we take power. And then in the Obama years, the opposition party is much, much less eager to run on that idea-based platform. There's a deliberate decision not to have an Obamacare replacement plan in the run up to the 2014 elections, for example.
So I want to push on this just a little bit, which is what would make it go differently next time? What lessons need to be learned by the kinds of politicians you would like to see triumph from their more recent losses?
My favorite book of all time is Double Indemnity by James Cain. It's a noir classic, and I'm sort of obsessed with noir. It's short. It packs a massive wallop. And I read it a lot.
When President Trump was elected, his party's long-cherished goal of dismantling the Affordable Care Act seemed all but assured. But eight months later, Republicans seem to have done what the Democrats who passed the law never could: make it popular among a majority of Americans.
Jesse Wegman: Senator, I want to just take you back for a moment to Mara's question about swing states and swing state voters and your point about large structural changes that people warn you off. The other day, you repeated your argument that you wanted to be the last president to win the Electoral College and the first to win the national popular vote. How do you expect — I'm assuming you're not talking about a constitutional amendment. How do you expect to get there in five years, unless you're the president, unless you win the Electoral College and Donald Trump wins the popular vote in 2020?
Opinion Debate What should the Biden administration prioritize? Mitt Romney writes that the right answer to human rights violations is an economic and diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics that would still allow American athletes to participate.
Gail: Sorry, the theory about president-gets-to-pick was demolished by Mitch McConnell in 2016 when he refused to allow President Obama's nominee, the totally qualified Merrick Garland, to even come up for a vote — or even, really, a discussion. In fact McConnell bragged that telling the president you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy was one of the proudest days of his life.
I've been especially interested in the way Britain revived itself between 1820 and 1848. Its comeback has some humbling lessons for us today.
End Citizens United, a group with more than four million members and half a million donors around the country, has voiced support for Senator Warren's proposed anti-corruption plans. The group has noted that both President Obama and President Trump won election in part by portraying themselves as tougher on opponents. Read more in The Times.
KK: But you have to admit, many of the things you're saying are the same pitch Obama gave us in 2008, and Obama, of course, got health care done, but with a lot of compromises and left a law that I think by everyone's estimation is flawed. So what's different in 2020 — excuse me, I don't know what year it is, 2019 — than it was in 2008?
Elizabeth Warren, in her interview with the Times editorial board [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] on Dec. 4, largely stuck to her polished script — which the senior senator from Massachusetts said she has delivered 175 times — calling for big structural change to right the imbalances in the current American economy and end what she sees as endemic corruption in business and politics. She famously has a plan for that and had a (lengthy) answer for nearly every question.
What Is the First Issue for Your Presidency?

When even a bipartisan agreement on immigration reform, focused on employment-based green cards, died on the Senate floor in September, it demonstrated just how difficult it has become to get any immigration reform legislation through Congress.
—— in this country. And the first one is attack corruption. And the second is to make some structural change in the economy. And the third is to protect our democracy. And it may — that the —
THE REPUBLICAN ANSWER The Congressional Budget Office said that premiums would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher under the House bill than under current law in 2018 and 2019, but would then fall, so that average premiums in 2026 would be about 10 percent lower than under current law. Under the House bill, the federal government would offer grants to the states — $100 billion from 2018 to 2026 — and they could use the money to stabilize premiums by paying some of the cost of very large claims.
Notice that I said related to rather than caused by climate change. This is a distinction that has flummoxed many people over the years. Any individual weather event has multiple causes, which was one reason news reports used to avoid mentioning the possible role of climate change in natural disasters.
Mr. Spicer demurred when asked to provide proof that anyone other than Russia attempted to sway the election. He also declined to say whether Mr. Trump accepted the finding that the Russians were not merely trying to meddle but were actively working on his behalf in an effort to defeat Mrs. Clinton.
The problem as I see it in the housing market, just picking that one, is we have a supply problem. The two big providers of housing from half a century ago just aren't there. So the developer that built the two-bedroom, one-bath house, garage converted to hold my three brothers for their bedroom, that developer is building McMansions today. And I'm not mad at him. That's where the profits are. And the federal government, as you know, now under current federal law, can't expand federal housing. It can only do replacement when it's taking it off the market. And if it takes it off the market and it doesn't replace it, then it shrinks even more. Housing deteriorates like anything else.
That can cut either way in terms of a president's economic legacy. Critics of Obama, including the new House speaker, Paul Ryan, credit Ben Bernanke, the former Federal Reserve chairman, and Janet Yellen, the current chairwoman, for whatever recovery we've had since the crisis, contending it happened in spite of the president. I think the Federal Reserve has done more, Ryan said at a January news conference. Frank, for his part, almost jumped through the phone when I mentioned that argument during an interview. And Bernanke and Yellen were appointed by whom? Neither Bernanke or Yellen would have been able to do what they were doing without his full backing.
The reason I'm interested in this counterfactual — to your point, there are many things Donald Trump could have done differently. But many of them he didn't want to do differently. He didn't want to stop being a maniac on Twitter, he didn't want to stop giving his press conferences. But this is one where Donald Trump, certainly at times, wanted to do a bigger stimulus and it seemed like the Republican Party's incentives were aligned to do it. But they didn't. So why do you think they didn't? Why didn't Mitch McConnell and Trump come together on this one given their electoral interests?
By contrast, the department said, the Supreme Court held that the individual mandate was closely intertwined with the requirement for insurers to offer coverage to all consumers at the same basic prices, regardless of their health status.
The sad truth is that climate politics are probably not going remain as they are today. The future will almost certainly bring increasing harm, through more extreme weather. Eventually, some Republican politicians, especially in coastal states, may be willing to break with party leaders on the issue. Eventually, Americans may decide to punish politicians who deny or play down climate change. By the time a price on carbon took effect, it might not be so unpopular anymore. But we can't wait for the politics to change to begin taking action.
Yet while context varies, the reception to the bill described in these local news reports is almost uniformly unhappy, a sentiment reflected in the polling numbers for the health care bill approved by House Republicans and in many of the interviews.
Ms. Smith could at least appeal to Republican legislators willing to put reason, compassion, and country ahead of party. Trumpist Republicans have no room for such niceties — they care only about winning. Which is why only losing the Senate can get their attention, and slow the party's extremism.

Many of us are sitting ducks who are still susceptible to second waves, he said.
This appears to be a misrepresented statistic. A 2019 report from the Institute on Assets and Social Policy at Brandeis University found that the median white student borrower has paid back 94 percent of his or her student debt, while the median black student borrower has paid back 5 percent. Read the report here.
That's the Scalia approach, Mr. Bush added. He was very consistent on his interpretation and his rulings. And that's what we need.
No. I thought you were talking about undocumented workers.
Republicans including Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Senator Mike Lee of Utah joined Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and other progressive Democrats in condemning Robinhood's decision. By the afternoon, the company had committed to allowing limited buys of these securities.
It provides $14 billion for vaccine distribution and another $48 billion for testing and contact tracing. There's also close to $8 billion for state and local public health departments to help them beef up their public health work force and infrastructure.

Which helps explain why climate activists have recently begun to change their political strategy. The cherished idea of economists, carbon pricing, is losing favor and being supplanted by ideas that seek to invert the political logic. Rather than broadcast the necessary sacrifices, as taxes and cap-and-trade schemes do, the alternatives try to play them down and instead emphasize the benefits of less pollution. These alternatives — like clean-energy mandates and subsidies — are less efficient than carbon pricing, as skeptics like Nordhaus point out. They don't harness market forces to the same degree, and they don't necessarily affect the entire economy. But they still have the potential to make a real difference, and in some places, like California, they already have. The question is whether any policy is both big enough to matter and popular enough to happen.
So let me explain what the plan is. The plan is the employer has to keep paying in as the employer does right now. The one exception to that is if you have a collective bargaining agreement, and the employer is paying in more than whatever is the standard minimal that employers are paying in. That difference goes to the workers in cash.
Senator Warren's support among young people — the Gen Z and millennial voters she describes, saddled with debt — has been on the rise. A November poll from Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics found that 22 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds support her, up from 4 percent in March.
— when Walker loses his re-election bid to Tony Evers —
So now, we are basically back where we started. The Affordable Care Act is likely to remain the law of the land. So what did we learn from this weeklong ordeal?
Last year, Senator Warren introduced a bill called the No First Use Act, which would declare that the United States would never be the first to use a nuclear weapon. Opponents say it could drive arms races in smaller countries that depend on America for protection.
Well, I think part of it is how much you're willing to do two things: how much you are willing to push and how much you're willing to be creative about the various ways in which it's done. You know, we did the same thing in Asia with South Korea, with Japan, about which costs the South Koreans pick up and which costs the Americans pick up. The cost of moving, the cost of consolidating the land, the cost of maintaining security around the perimeter. There are a lot of different ways that we can do this, and I think we should be doing this much more in partnership. I think hectoring them and putting their leaders in an embarrassing position domestically, for each of them, do you cave in to the United States president who is trying to throw his weight around by picking up a bigger share of the defense budget? I don't think that's a way to further success in this area.
But it did not go as far as Texas and the other states, which argued that all of the Affordable Care Act and the regulations issued under it were now invalid.
Senator Warren's campaign ads pitch a 2-cent wealth tax to cover $700 billion in universal child care, $1.25 trillion in universal free college and student debt forgiveness, and more. But Senator Warren's tax would really be more than 2 cents on the dollar for the ultrarich, because you have to add the 2 cents to additional taxes she has promised on assets above $1 billion along with taxes on income and capital gains. Two University of California economists recently calculated that the Microsoft founder Bill Gates's net worth would be more than halved if Senator Warren's wealth tax in its original form had been enacted in 1982.
Ross, I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that you're not a big fan of getting rid of the pronouns he and she.
But the people who want to take away your health care haven't given up.
In October 2019, Senator Warren tweeted: Facebook has incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. Mark Zuckerberg is telling employees that he views a Warren administration as an 'existential' threat to Facebook. The public deserves to know how Facebook intends to use their influence in this election.
The court had heard arguments on the law a month earlier, and Kennedy had already told the other justices he considered it unconstitutional. He wanted to strike it down. Roberts had a different view, wanting to invalidate some of the law and keep other parts. During their conversations that April, the two of them talked through the substantive issues that the case involved, like the law's health insurance mandate, the cost of insurance premiums and so on.
No, but I think this is important.
I was not a great admirer, as you can no doubt tell. Like most conservatives, I favor a more limited role for our robed archons, I admired Scalia's originalism precisely because it establishes plausible (if, of course, debatable) limits on judicial activism, and I regard Kennedy's Casey ruling as a vapid Emersonian effusion, whose paean to individualism was really a license to kill inconvenient innocents. Even when he was right on the merits of an issue, he was still too aggrandizing, too eager to impose his own judgment, too quick to short-circuit legislative debates.
Her groove, if she even has one, is not as groovy as that of her prospective sister-in-law, a supermodel who has become the First Daughter of the Resistance.
Why attacking corruption and getting some structural change in our economy that actually is about not just the wealth gap top to bottom, but this fact that more and more and more of our value is being sucked up to the top, and more and more people are sliding back behind it. And not having power at the polls. How those three things are tied to each other.
No, you don't have to support the president's tweet storms. But you do have to defend his policy accomplishments. If the election is only a personality contest — rather than about the president's policies — a historic defeat awaits.
KK: Why? Do you mind telling?
A growing divide has emerged among unions over whether to support Medicare for all. Roughly 95 percent of union workers had health care access in 2019, while just 68 percent of nonunion workers did.
It would substantially cut funding for Medicaid, which covers low-income Americans, and reduce the value of tax credits that individuals use to buy health insurance, pricing many out of the market.
I think you're overlooking the places where we're not divided. I have three brothers back in Oklahoma. One is a Democrat. Do the math, the other two are not. And yet, all three of my brothers and tens of millions of people around this country get furious over the fact that Amazon reports $11 billion in profits last year and paid zero in taxes. All three of my brothers understand that we have an America that works great for giant drug companies, just not for people trying to fill a prescription. Works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for people who are worried about climate change.
What that means is that the door is open for a responsible Republican plan to improve the nation's mixed public-private health system. If the party's leaders were so inclined, they could take advantage of the Democratic overreach by embracing reforms that would build upon what exists and make it work better. Such a conservative reform plan would look something like this:
The result is likely to be big differences in health insurance options and coverage, depending on where you live. States that lean into the changes might have more health insurance offerings with small price tags, but ones that are inaccessible to people with health problems and don't cover major health services, like prescription drugs. States pushing back may see more robust Obamacare markets of highly regulated plans, but the price of those plans is likely to remain higher.
The problem as I see it in the housing market, just picking that one, is we have a supply problem. The two big providers of housing from half a century ago just aren't there. So the developer that built the two-bedroom, one-bath house, garage converted to hold my three brothers for their bedroom, that developer is building McMansions today. And I'm not mad at him. That's where the profits are. And the federal government, as you know, now under current federal law, can't expand federal housing. It can only do replacement when it's taking it off the market. And if it takes it off the market and it doesn't replace it, then it shrinks even more. Housing deteriorates like anything else.
Its brief made two arguments. One is that the recent Republican tax bill, rather than eliminating the individual mandate, actually made the mandate more onerous by imposing on individuals a legal obligation to purchase health insurance.
— who, before he was a member of the Trump administration, was a hardliner in the House of Representatives waging war on the Affordable Care Act from Capitol Hill.
Several states would like to expand Medicaid in a more limited way, capping eligibility at the poverty level, or $12,140 for an individual. In states that have not expanded Medicaid, eligibility varies. Parents with incomes over half the poverty level are often ineligible, and most adults without dependent children are ineligible, no matter how poor they are.
NATO members agreed, in 2014, to a goal of spending 2 percent of their G.D.P. on defense, but in 2017 the only countries to meet that goal were America, Britain, Greece, Poland and Estonia. Mr. Trump chastised fellow member states at a 2017 summit, declaring that 23 of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should.
BA: What is the right stance?
it's fair to say that few elected Democrats at the national level are contemplating major departures from prevailing economic and political arrangements. There's little evidence that most elected Democrats want an economic revolution.
In a July 17 article in The American Prospect, Can the Democrats Define Their Own Cause? Or will Trump define it for them? Paul Starr, a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton, warned:
But also to complement the robust action we have consistently taken at the border. And while these new measures are being operationalized, I would just like to remind anyone seeking to enter our country to comply with the rules. Hoping to reduce the spread of the coronavirus variant, Britain announced on Wednesday it will require citizens arriving home from high-risk countries to quarantine in hotels for 10 days at their own expense. Credit Credit... Chris J Ratcliffe/Getty Images Swamped by a fast-spreading coronavirus variant and desperate to keep other mutations out of the country, Britain tightened its international travel restrictions on Wednesday. British citizens arriving from any of 22 high-risk countries will now be required to quarantine in hotels for 10 days at their own expense. The new policy edges Britain closer to the strict hotel quarantines imposed by Australia and several Asian countries. But it falls short of a blanket requirement, drawing criticism that it will not seal off the country from dangerous new variants, even as it inflicts more harm on the already wounded travel and aviation industries. There are still too many people coming in and out of our country every day, Priti Patel, the home secretary, said in Parliament as she announced the new measures, which are also intended to deter Britons from going abroad. People should not be traveling without a valid reason, she said, and going on holiday is not a valid reason.
I think it's certainly been a function of the Trump era that this has happened. The Trump era has been incredibly devoid of policy substance. And that's partly a function of the president himself having had no interest in it, and the party becoming so tied around the axle of his personality that it's become just impossible to have policy conversations. You have people who just don't want to get on the wrong side of Trump. So where does that mean you ought to be on health care? I don't think any of them really knew, and they just didn't want to touch it. And it's absolutely right that there just hasn't been a lot of interest in conservative policy work. Look, I work, as you say, at a conservative think tank. The work we do is public policy work. I was brought on at AEI in 2019. I'd been at another think tank before that for about a dozen years. But I was brought on, really, in part to start a project that would make the health of American institutions, you might say the infrastructure of our political life, an explicit subject of inquiry of think tank work.
The Affordable Care Act continued to grow in popularity after Republican efforts to repeal the legislation in 2017 — a recent poll found that over half of the public favors the legislation.
James E. Cooksey, 54, visited the Health Department here last week and left with nine prescriptions for drugs to treat very high blood pressure and diabetes. Mr. Cooksey said his minimal income came from work as a Salvation Army bell-ringer in the holiday season and from odd jobs like mowing lawns. But he does not qualify for Medicaid because he lives alone and has no dependent children.
The American government's antitrust battle with the oil industry perhaps epitomizes a 20th-century approach to antitrust — in 1911, the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of Standard Oil. Of course, many would argue that the country's dependence on oil and its addiction to Facebook aren't totally comparable.
But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it? And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough. They want to look good. He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes. That's why we have the great migration. But she wanted to look good for the election. So they're going in.
It is hard, at least for me, to do justice to how sinister, in a way that sort of builds slowly, but she is such a monster. She does it not in a scenery-chewing way but in this very subtle, incisive way. I don't know. I'm very much looking forward to the final episode in which they've contrived to put her on trial as a mother. I think there's such a hunger at this point to see her unmasked. It'll be interesting to see if the show can give the people what they want.
The measure would overhaul the role of the Education Department, reducing its staff and administrative costs, and empower states and districts to decide how to best use federal funds to meet the needs of their students, the department's budget said.

She offered no sourcing for this assertion, as is the case for vaporous claims that rise from the rot of the Trump presidency on a daily basis. But in blaming God for Trump, Sanders echoed a widespread Republican belief that the most outwardly amoral man ever to occupy the White House is an instrument of divine power. He's part of the master plan.
Senator Warren's support among young people — the Gen Z and millennial voters she describes, saddled with debt — has been on the rise. A November poll from Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics found that 22 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds support her, up from 4 percent in March.
WASHINGTON — Paul Ryan, the House speaker, is by all accounts a man of integrity and intelligence. When it came to the failed attempt by House Republicans to scrap President Obama's legacy health care law and replace it with something that better reflected their conservative values, Mr. Ryan did as well as could be expected given the sharp divisions within his party's ranks. But it may be time for him to quit his post as speaker. It is a position for which, thus far, he has proved remarkably unsuited and in which he has allowed the House to suffer a series of humiliations.

Both Democratic and Republican members of Congress had also urged the administration to consider a special enrollment period. But Congress declined to require such an enrollment period in its last round of coronavirus legislation, instead leaving the decision to federal officials.
The change would require states to define their own package of essential health benefits, so that people who shop will be eligible for federal subsidies to help them pay their premiums. That means that the benefits in a standard plan are likely to vary by state. Before Obamacare, fewer than 10 states required insurers to cover maternity care, for example.
Senator Warren said in an interview with Vox's Ezra Klein that many other economic policies should be accomplished before the government starts sending out checks to every American, as Mr. Yang's Freedom Dividend proposes.
The tax law overhaul of late 2019 eliminated the home office deduction for employees from 2018 through 2025. Employees who receive a paycheck or a W-2 exclusively from an employer are not eligible for the deduction, even if they are currently working from home, the I.R.S. said. Read more. How does the family leave credit work? Self-employed people can take paid caregiving leave if their child's school is closed or their usual child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak. This works similarly to the smaller sick leave credit — 67 percent of average daily earnings (for either 2020 or 2019), up to $200 a day. But the caregiving leave can be taken for 50 days. Read more. Have rules changed on charitable giving? Yes. This year, you can deduct up to $300 for charitable contributions, even if you use the standard deduction. Previously, only people who itemized could claim these deductions. Donations must be made in cash (for these purposes, this includes check, credit card or debit card), and can't include securities, household items or other property. For 2021, the deduction limit will double to $600 for joint filers. Rules for itemizers became more generous as well. The limit on charitable donations has been suspended, so individuals can contribute up to 100 percent of their adjusted gross income, up from 60 percent. But these donations must be made to public charities in cash; the old rules apply to contributions made to donor-advised funds, for example. Both provisions are available through 2021. Read more.
In Nevada, the measure did get on the ballot, and the campaign in favor of it has some lessons for winning future fights. The messages were simple and powerful. They focused on the immediate benefits from clean-energy use, like fewer health problems, lower medical costs and more jobs that pay well. As Steyer said to me, If you don't talk about health issues and jobs, then you've got nothing to talk about. In one ad, a white-coat-clad doctor in Carson City describes the damage air pollution does to the lungs and brains of her patients in northern Nevada. It's just a disaster, health-wise, she says. In another ad, a woman named Jennifer Cantley becomes teary-eyed when talking about having to check the air quality each day before letting her son, who has asthma, go outside to play with his friends.
Critics of Senator Warren's student debt plan say it would unfairly benefit those on the path to becoming highly paid professionals.
The result: Older Americans with low incomes in high-cost areas would lose very big. This is a group that tended to vote for President Trump. This reality worried some moderate G.O.P. politicians, particularly those from rural districts, where prices for health insurance are the highest.
A German health body advises against using the AstraZeneca shot in people over 65. Preparing a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Credit... Silvia Izquierdo/Associated Press Germany's vaccination advisory committee, which provides recommendations to the government, is cautioning against using the AstraZeneca shot on adults age 65 and above, saying in a draft report released on Thursday that there currently is not sufficient data to assess the vaccination effectiveness above 65 years. The German Health Ministry, which usually follows the advice of the committee, declined to comment. The European Medicines Agency, the regulatory body for the European Union, is expected to announce on Friday whether the vaccine will be approved for use in the bloc. Britain has been administering the AstraZeneca shots to all age groups after it became the first country to give the vaccine emergency authorization, in December. British regulators have said that data on the efficacy and safety of the vaccine are currently limited in people age 65 and older. But concerns about the scarce data on older people could limit the use of the AstraZeneca shot: European regulators are considering authorizing it only for people under 65, two E.U. officials said. Neither AstraZeneca nor Oxford University, which helped develop the vaccine, has released figures on how effective the shot is in older people. But data on older people's immune responses have suggested that the vaccine will help protect them from the virus, the company has said.
You know on part of this, I think part of the answer is current law enforcement. You correctly describe it, in harassing people, in trespassing. And we need to make sure at federal, state, and local levels that people who are seeking health care of any kind have access to that health care and are not denied that opportunity. I think our laws are there. I think the weakness is our failure to enforce. That's how I see now. If there are gaps in that, I'm certainly open to understanding them better, but that's how I see it.
Lindell is a Fox celebrity, a big Trump donor, and the president would like to see him run for governor of Minnesota. No way right now of knowing whether his political future will be affected by a 2017 Better Business Bureau decision to revoke MyPillow's accreditation.
One House member from the state, Scott Perry, was instrumental in promoting a plan in which Mr. Trump would fire the acting attorney general in an effort to stay in office. And a majority of Republicans in the General Assembly urged its congressional delegation in December to reject the commonwealth's 20 electoral votes for Mr. Biden after the results were legally certified. Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania have also plunged into a lengthy examination of the November election, even though no evidence of more than trivial fraud has surfaced, and courts rejected claims that election officials had overstepped their legal mandates.
And he actually got a fair amount of Dodd-Frank. And — that he did, but ——
The breadth of Mr. Bloomberg's broadcast campaign is numbing. The roughly $410 million on television ads alone — $370 million spent, and another $41 million reserved through Super Tuesday — is more than Hillary Clinton and President Trump spent on television ads during their entire 2016 presidential campaigns, primary and general elections combined, according to Advertising Analytics, an ad tracking firm. And Mr. Bloomberg, who entered the race in November, did it in four months.
Look at the example. He said, I will take your money to lie about other candidates. What does that mean for our democracy? Not even meet the minimal standard that TV ads run, right?
I was also very unhappy, in real time, when Obama began echoing Republican arguments for fiscal austerity despite continuing high unemployment.
It was unclear who leaked the documents and how The Mail obtained them. But the British news outlet identified only one recipient in Britain: Mark Sedwill, a longtime British diplomat who succeeded Mr. Darroch as national security adviser and became cabinet secretary in 2018.
The report concluded that after 10 years, the Republican plan would create 24 million additional uninsured people — the difference between the number of uninsured under the proposed plan and the number if the Affordable Care Act is not repealed.
Well, that's a hard question. I don't know the answer to that. I'm sure there's a range. I've been reading Mike Konczal's Freedom from the Market, which I'm finding very interesting. I disagree with it, but it's learned and thoughtful and smart. But I bet you could recommend some books to me that I wouldn't think of.
The Affordable Care Act continued to grow in popularity after Republican efforts to repeal the legislation in 2017 — a recent poll found that over half of the public favors the legislation.
Thomas Jefferson was not a founding father of equality. He was a founding father of the heartbeat of denial that lives through both Mr. Trump's denials and the assertion that his racial views are abnormal for America and its presidents.
House Republicans will be unveiling their replacement for the Affordable Care Act (a/k/a Obamacare) next week and the White House has been signaling that it may reveal its thoughts not long after.
I still, on occasion, want to pick up the phone and call him. So it was a relationship that was like a political marriage.
MG: Your standing in some of the polls in the swing states is not as competitive as some of the other candidates'. Do you think that this issue is hurting you in the swing states like Michigan? If not, what do you make of the discrepancy in swing states?
CW: Sure. And they have too much power, not just in an economy, they have too much power in a democracy, and they keep consolidating and expanding — are you worried about individual employees there? You know, Mark Zuckerberg, Peter Thiel.
At the same time, he accused the pharmaceutical industry of trying to protect its profits by opposing any constraints on drug prices.
Good afternoon, everyone. The House of Representatives will soon begin voting on the American Health Care Act, the Republican plan to repeal parts of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. This vote is shaping up to be an extraordinary moment in President Trump's young tenure and a true nail-biter on the floor of the House. Speaker Paul D. Ryan went to the White House earlier in the day to tell Mr. Trump that, because of a wave of Republican defections, the bill did not have the votes to pass. But the president has insisted that he wants to have lawmakers on the record through a vote.
A lawsuit brought by several states imperils the health law's protections for people with pre-existing health conditions, the law's most popular provision. Recent polls show growing numbers of Americans rank health care as a top issue, and coverage for pre-existing conditions as an important policy.
Under the current health care law, 31 states and the District of Columbia expanded Medicaid to cover low-income Americans without children, a group that previously found it difficult to afford insurance.
The first presidency is mostly real; the second presidency has been mostly imaginary ever since the failure of Obamacare repeal left Ryanism neutered. Trump hasn't done some of the biggest heterodox things he promised (an infrastructure bill, most notably). But he has ended austerity budgeting, ignored entitlement reform, reformed Obamacare around the edges while leaving its coverage guarantee intact, embraced protectionism and jawboned the Federal Reserve to be more inflationary.
Well, that's a hard question. I'm inclined, at first, to riff a little bit on The Lord of the Rings, but that's better as a book, really, than a movie. I think my answer, oddly enough, would be Groundhog Day. Groundhog Day is an incredibly rich movie. It's not just a conservative movie. But it makes an argument that, ultimately, we find our fulfillment not by expressing ourselves and drawing our true meaning out of our own will, but by meeting higher external standards of virtue. And I think that's a profound case for what conservatism stands for, from my point of view. It's a beautiful way to make that argument without being off-putting. It's a wonderful movie.
Pregnant women receive conflicting advice on vaccines. The world's leading health organizations are giving conflicting advice regarding vaccinations for pregnant women. Credit... Callaghan O'Hare/Reuters Pregnant women looking for guidance on Covid-19 vaccines are facing confusion of the sort that has dogged the pandemic from the start: The world's leading public health organizations — the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization — are offering contradictory advice. The C.D.C. 's advisory committee urged pregnant women to consult with their doctors before rolling up their sleeves — a decision applauded by several women's health organizations because it kept decision-making in the hands of the expecting mothers. But the W.H.O. is recommending that pregnant women not receive the vaccines, unless they are at high risk from Covid-19 because of work exposures or chronic conditions. It issued guidance on the Moderna vaccine on Tuesday, stirring uncertainty among women and doctors on social media. (Earlier this month, it had published similar guidance on the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.) Several experts expressed dismay at the W.H.O. 's stance, saying the risks to pregnant women from Covid were far greater than any theoretical harm from the vaccines. There are no documented risks to the fetus, there's no theoretical risks, there's no risk in animal studies, from the vaccines, said Dr. Anne Lyerly, a bioethicist at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. The difference of opinion between the C.D.C. and the W.H.O.
If you believe in abortion rights, and tragically, you do, follow the lead of the state's senior senator, Jon Tester, a Democrat and third-generation farmer from Big Sandy. Frame the issue as the rugged individualism of a woman's right to make her own health care decisions, preferably while seated on a tractor. All Democratic officials in the Central and Mountain time zones surely envy the rural romance of Mr. Tester, whose three missing fingers, mangled in a meat grinder on the family farm, are the Montana electoral equivalent of being a Kennedy. A good rule for politicians still shackled with all 10 fingers is to trust Senator Tester's instincts on everything but haircuts. He understands that a westward conscience (and a passing interest in re-election) sometimes compels a Montana Democrat to question coastal leftist groupthink — just ask Bernie Sanders about Max Baucus, but not if there are ladies present.
And as he often does, Mr. Biden expressed confidence that if he is the presidential nominee, he would help Democrats who are running in a wide range of competitive contests. He noted his efforts to do just that by campaigning in districts and states across the country in 2018, when his party recaptured the House of Representatives.

Cholera follows cyclone: A vaccination campaign is set to start today in Mozambique after a devastating storm two weeks ago that displaced about two million people. Malaria is a threat, too, but aid agencies are optimistic.
Having failed in their repeal effort, Republicans are now in something of an arranged marriage with the health care law. These alterations are being made in a predictably haphazard fashion, with little in the way of guiding theory, but the cumulative effect is to turn Obamacare into a law that they can, if not love, at least learn to live with.
That history still seemed fresh in 2010, when Palin backed another Republican, Joe Miller, a friend of Palin's husband and a Tea Party favorite, in his challenge to Lisa Murkowski in the Republican Senate primary. I think she's out for her own self-interest, Murkowski said of Palin on the evening of the election. To the surprise of many Alaskans, Miller won. Do you believe in miracles? Palin tweeted to her followers.
I think it includes anti-competitiveness and unfair trade practices. I think we need to resuscitate the old tying concept that we use.
Because it is a flat benefit, the idea at least is that you don't have the situation which you can sometimes have with government benefit programs, where if you earn more income or if your household earns more income, you lose benefits and so you're being punished for moving up the ladder. And then one of the things that particularly conservatives, although not only conservatives have been talking about for the last few years is that America's birth rate has gotten lower. And that there's long been a gap between the number of kids that Americans say they want to have and the number of kids that they actually end up having and to the extent that economic constraints are a reason for that. Maybe something should be done to enable people to hit their family related goals? So these are some of the reasons why people are in favor of this idea, but there's also some opposition. And a lot of the opposition is along the lines of what Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Mike Lee have said, although they themselves have been advocates of an expanded child credit and taken some flak from their own right on that, they think that the Romney proposal is a bridge too far. That it's a resurrection of the old welfare system, where you're handing out money to parents and not requiring work. I'd say that this is a debate that's still percolating on the right.
But he didn't try to do some things like stick with his old pro-choice position on abortion, or really stick to his occasional advocacy of gun control, or tax increases. If he did that, I think, you would have found that there were large numbers of Republican voters who cared about those particular issues. And so we have to stick with them on those. You have to stick with them on religious liberty and lots of other stuff. Republican voters, don't in large numbers, have strong views on trade and he could do what he wanted to do on that. So that was one element of policy substance to Trump, or to Trumpism. A second, he was very good at using a policy issue to communicate a value, or communicate something he wanted people to know about him. Whether it's, I'm strong, or I'm on your side, I'm tough, et cetera. So, the wall being an aspect of that. The trade stuff being an aspect of that, too. Maybe he could have found different policies, more serious policies, more effective ones that would have communicated some of the same things, but there is some policy substance there. The thing about Senator Graham saying, we need Trump's policies, but presumably not some of Trump's personality, or Trump's negatives.
If a plan looks too good to be true, be skeptical, she said.

Andrew M. Cuomo of New York announced on Wednesday that officials were assessing whether indoor dining could soon return with limited capacity in New York City, after he barred it last month. He also eased coronavirus-related restrictions on nonessential businesses and restaurants in several areas across the state, including parts of the city. The city's restaurant industry, however, has been hit particularly hard during the pandemic, relegated mostly to outdoor dining for months, and Mr. Cuomo said officials were looking at going back to the 25 percent capacity limit that was set citywide when indoor dining briefly restarted in September. He did not specify additional details, but said that a plan would come by the end of the week. I fully understand how difficult it is that they're closed, not just for the restaurants, but all the people who are employed there, Mr. Cuomo said. On the flip side is how fast this virus can take off, but we'll have a plan. It was a stark difference in tone from remarks made by Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City on Tuesday, when he expressed concerns at a news conference over restarting indoor dining because of the high number of virus cases and the potential spread of new variants of the virus. I want to see indoor dining reopened when it's safe, Mr. de Blasio said on Tuesday. So, when the numbers come down, and we're confident that they're staying down, that is a great time to do it.
Think of what that means. Do — you know that the top — just one quick — one number. I've resisted numbers while I'm in here. The 99 percent America pays 7.2 percent of your total income in taxes. Not total income. Total wealth. The top one-tenth of 1 percent, the part I want to hit with a 2-cent wealth tax, 3.2 percent. 3.2 percent. They have wealth managers who are managing these huge funds that are growing at what rate? Six percent a year, 8 percent a year, 10 percent a year?
You know, this is a hard hypothetical to take on until you actually know what's happening. Again, you've got to back this one up on where we should have started. When the unrest first started unfolding in Hong Kong, for Donald Trump to step back and say in effect, gee, I think China's going to crack down on Hong Kong, and effectively inviting it, I think is the wrong place for the United States to be. I think that we should have been in a position from the beginning, saying to China, we support these efforts in Hong Kong. That's part one.
A 2018 Gallup poll found that a record-high 75 percent of Americans say immigration is a positive, including majorities of all parties. Yet immigration reform has become a wedge issue in Congress, with the government brought to a shutdown multiple times over issues like the treatment of Dreamers and the funding for Mr. Trump's border wall.
We don't have to speculate about how these systems would work in practice, because every advanced country except the U.S. has some form of universal coverage. Some, like Canada and Britain, use single-payer (in Britain the government also operates the hospitals and pays the doctors). Others, like Switzerland and the Netherlands, have a large role for private insurers.
Health care unions amplify the voices of frontline workers overwhelmed by pandemic conditions. Registered nurses demonstrated against unsafe staffing practices at Good Samaritan Hospital in San Jose, Calif., in December. Credit... Sarahbeth Maney for The New York Times The unions representing the nation's health care workers have emerged as increasingly powerful voices during the still-raging pandemic. With more than 100,000 Americans hospitalized and many among their ranks infected, nurses and other health workers remain in a precarious frontline against the coronavirus and have turned again and again to unions for help. Nurses across the country from various unions are participating in dozens of strikes and protests. National Nurses United, the country's largest union of registered nurses, held a day of action on Wednesday with demonstrations in more than a dozen states and Washington, D.C., as it starts negotiations at hospitals owned by big systems like HCA, Sutter Health and CommonSpirit Health. It's so overwhelming. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before, said Erin McIntosh, a nurse at Riverside Community Hospital in Southern California, a part of the country that has been among the hardest hit by a surge in cases. Every day I'm waist-deep in death and dying. Hospitals said the unions are playing politics during a public health emergency and say they have no choice but to ask more of their workers. But health care workers say they have been bitterly disappointed by their employers' and government agencies' response to the pandemic.
Some conservatives were still concerned that the bill was too costly and did not do enough to roll back federal health insurance mandates. Moderates and others, meanwhile, were grappling with worries of their states' governors and fretted that the loss of benefits would be too much for their constituents to bear.
No. I thought you were talking about undocumented workers.
I mean, what happened to Lindsey Graham?
In a democracy, how is it that they have so much political influence that one-tenth of 1 percent can say, I rather your kid have to deal with $50,000 in student loan debt, and I'd rather you never get a chance to get a child into day care, which means you either piece stuff together in crazy ways or quit your job. And I'd rather your public schools still have tiles falling out of the ceiling and textbooks that are 11 years old than that the top one-tenth of 1 percent has to pitch in 2 cents.
And the timing on the Democratic side is sort of comical in that it is literally Nancy Pelosi's 79th birthday —
It's really interesting. Medicare for all gets more popular than ever. So, you know, it's not just that Sanders loses the primary to Hillary Clinton, who wants to do something much more moderate on health care, but also Hillary Clinton loses the election to Donald Trump.
He was a flawed person but also a great man, and showing him in his full complexity would make for a better film than pretending he was a walking saint. But the historian who was involved in this project said: Too many racists. They're not ready for that.
SS: Well, speaking of using leverage, you've argued that nations that want to trade with the United States should be held to higher standards.
In their ardor to undermine and abolish the Affordable Care Act, Republicans in Congress are causing inestimable damage. Specifically, they are damaging the United States' reputation for reliability among private companies looking to do business with the government.

Perhaps nowhere is the Bloomberg financial might more prevalent than in Los Angeles and San Diego. Mr. Bloomberg has spent a combined $31 million on broadcast alone in those two markets.
Such groups are often chartered under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax law, which grants a tax exemption to social welfare organizations. For those seeking to influence politics but stay in the background, 501(c)(4) designations offer two big advantages: tax exemption and no requirement to disclose donors.
Mr. Ammiano, who would grow up to become one of the country's pioneering gay leaders, an early openly gay comedian and a prominent California elected official, found that he loved running long distance. He helped his team win meets and in 1958, his junior year, he won his final one-mile run.
You start by disrupting. You start with some wins. You start with some places people want to be, and actually immigration reform is one of them. People don't like our immigration system, and our support for immigrants continues to go up. I can be in a room full of people who are three generations away from any immigration experience personally, and they want to see us get this done. It's not just liberals. What was the latest story? Utah wants more immigrants, right?
A 1974 law reorganized the budgeting process, shifting power from the executive branch to Congress. Tense disagreements quickly emerged.

Senator Warren's support among young people — the Gen Z and millennial voters she describes, saddled with debt — has been on the rise. A November poll from Harvard Kennedy School's Institute of Politics found that 22 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds support her, up from 4 percent in March.

Tying is an arrangement where to buy one product, a consumer also has to buy a different product from a separate market. An example the F.T.C. offers is a drugmaker that required all consumers buying its medicine for schizophrenia to also buy its blood-monitoring service. The Supreme Court has treated the practice as illegal in the past, but more recently lower courts have permitted it under the more flexible rule of reason.
The proposal would do two things: make upper-middle-income Americans newly eligible for premium subsidies on Obamacare marketplaces, and increase the financial help that already goes to lower-income enrollees. Taken together, some experts expect these changes to drive more sign-ups for Healthcare.gov plans after they fell in the Trump era.
Why attacking corruption and getting some structural change in our economy that actually is about not just the wealth gap top to bottom, but this fact that more and more and more of our value is being sucked up to the top, and more and more people are sliding back behind it.

But it's hard. It's a lot easier not to take on the drug industry. It's a lot easier not to take on the insurance industry. It's a lot easier not to take on the oil industry. But every single issue we care about, every single issue — think about it on climate. All across this country people are saying climate, climate, climate. If you're not willing to take on the corruption, we're going to get laws passed that are going to have great names: Save the World; Everything Is Green; Now Safe for Unicorns.
Doctors would have to transition. Salary losses would differ by specialty, but imagine you came out of med school saddled with debt and learn that your payments are going to be down by, say 30 percent. Similar shocks would ripple to other health care workers.
In one fight over scarce vaccines, it's Britain versus the European Union. A patient receiving an injection of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine on Tuesday in Brighton, Britain. Credit... Ben Stansall/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images For months, wealthy countries have been clearing the world's shelves of coronavirus vaccines, leaving poorer nations with little hope of exiting the pandemic in 2021. But a fresh skirmish this week has pitted the rich against the rich — Britain versus the European Union — in the scramble for vials, opening an unabashedly nationalist competition that could poison relations and set back collective efforts to end the pandemic. The European Union, stung by its slow progress on vaccinations, threatened this week to tighten rules on the shipment of Belgian-made shots to Britain. British lawmakers, in turn, have accused their European counterparts of a blackmail campaign that could embitter relations for a generation. And poorer countries, already at the back of the line for vaccines, could face even longer waits if the intense squabbling among rich countries drives up prices for everyone else. At the core of the problem are production delays at separate factories in Belgium that make the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and the one developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford. With a new and more contagious coronavirus variant fueling a surge of cases in several European countries, those delays have undermined efforts to get shots into millions of people's arms, ratcheting up the global competition. But the manufacturing of vaccines is only part of the problem.
Does pointing out the possibility of incremental progress mean giving up on a truly universal system? No. By all means let's make something more ambitious, such as Medicare for all, a long-term goal. But this goal shouldn't stand in the way of policies that would immediately benefit millions of Americans, and save thousands of lives.
Well, I'm not sure about that. I mean, so, obviously, I don't think that the racist tweets have majority support in this country. But we don't have majority rule in this country. And so does it fire up enough of the Trump supporters who came out for him in 2016, stayed home in 2018, enough of those to make a difference in the few unrepresentative states that end up deciding all of our fates in our system of minority rule? I hope not, but maybe.
KK: Well, we're going to start, if you don't mind, at America's borders and around foreign policy.
Under Senator Warren's plan to pay for Medicare for all, a substantial chunk of funds would come from an employer contribution into the health care fund. Senator Sanders has not released a detailed plan explaining how he would pay for the system.
Mr. Price, perhaps more than Mr. Trump, has long been committed to the Affordable Care Act's demise. But now he will have to manage the law's many programs. Obama administration officials called insurers, cajoling and reassuring them. If Mr. Trump wants the markets to be vigorous, he could use his self-described deal-making skills to woo insurance companies into the stabilizing markets.
KK: So who would be your running mate?
It would be an exaggeration to say that the Democratic primary race is entirely about health care, but only a little bit of one. The standout moment from the first evening was Elizabeth Warren's vociferous defense of eliminating private insurance companies, and much of the first half of last night's debate was consumed with the issue as well. The candidates onstage were eager to recommend their plans and elaborate on their differences: Perhaps more than any other issue, this was one on which the different policy ideas in play were clear. Democrats were offering voters choices.
He went on to suggest that in previous elections, Mr. Sanders made political calculations about how much to discuss gun control.

Well, I'm not sure I accept the premise of the question, that they actually tried what I was talking about. Look, our No. 1 leverage is everybody wants the American consumer. They want access to the American consumer. They want to be able to sell us all of their stuff because the American consumer is not only the engine of about 70 percent of our economy; it's a worldwide engine. So I think it's perfectly reasonable to say, if you want to be able to trade with United States on the best possible terms, then everybody needs to raise their standards just a little. Who wants to do that?
Sounds good to me, said Mr. Obama, barely glancing at the memo, according to two people familiar with the exchange.
And driving Donald Trump nuts. No holier a grail than that. Yet there's still one more little thing. Mitt can't bring himself to say that people should support Joe Biden. He's keeping his own voting plans secret. There's a lot of speculation he's going to write in his wife's name, like he did in 2016.
So, what is it that Rubio and Lee mean, in your view, when they say that the way to be pro-family is to be pro-paid-work, when what they are saying is that in the case of a single mother with three kids who believes there is a reason that it is better for her to stay home with her kids at this point in their development, they are saying, no, we here in Washington know better than you do what would be good for your family and that's to go to paid work. Like they're the heroes of their own story. You're in this movement more than I am. What is the case for why Rubio and Lee know better than that mother what's good for her family?
But these days, Mr. de León is struggling for a toehold as he tries to negotiate the fraught and complicated terrain of trying to topple someone widely seen as a California institution. At 84, Ms. Feinstein is a five-term senator who began her political career as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969, when Mr. de León was just 3 years old.
I will also fight to knock back the influence of money, because I think every time we do that, that's what that anti-corruption bill is about. It's about calling out the big drug companies. It's about calling out the big insurance companies and just disrupting the fabulous patterns they have right now to get their way in Washington. In the first 100 days, I'll go to Congress and try to get what we can get on 50 votes. What we can get on 50 votes is to offer Medicare to everybody who's 50 or older.
I don't need a poll to tell Donald Trump it's not good to say that John McCain is a loser because he was captured in a time of war.
You have to take the idea that the real victims here are Josh Hawley and Mitch McConnell. They're the ones who need defenses of minority rights, not people who are being systematically denied the right to vote.
No, It's fine. So I actually start with the big vision. You know, if you gave me a chance, I'd do a constitutional amendment to protect the right of every American citizen to vote and to make sure that vote gets counted so you put real federal muscle behind it. I also talk about that for a specific reason, because a lot of Americans are shocked to know that that's not already in the Constitution and that there is no federal muscle behind that.
Robinhood, a popular app that targets everyday users by offering no-fee trading and a user-friendly process, said yesterday morning that it was limiting purchases of the kinds of securities that prompted the GameStop rally. This caused GameStop's stock value to plummet (it later regained value in after-hours trading) and led to an outcry from politicians in both parties, who were eager to get on the right side of what they called obvious Wall Street hypocrisy.
Boy, you all want power. God, I hope you never get it.
Whew: Like watching a duel with axes at three paces! Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump battled tonight in their second presidential debate, and here's my play-by-play commentary in the form of selected tweets. This isn't a column or even a formal blog post; just journalism on the fly. Here goes!
On Tuesday, he took another step, telling gleeful banking executives that he was interested in shutting down a public database where people can lodge complaints against financial companies. Bureau officials had used the database to figure out when they needed to investigate a company and to gather evidence. Mulvaney dismissively referred to it as a Yelp for financial services sponsored by the federal government. Aaron Klein of the Brookings Institution told The Wall Street Journal's Yuka Hayashi that the database was an incredibly important tool that empowers consumers.
O.K., it's not news that politicians make misleading claims, some more than others. According to a running tally kept by Daniel Dale of The Toronto Star, as of Monday morning, Donald Trump had said 4,682 false things as president.
The bill, which will most likely go to the House for a final vote on Wednesday, includes a significant, albeit temporary, expansion of subsidies for health insurance purchased under the act. Under the changes, the signature domestic achievement of the Obama administration will reach middle-income families who have been discouraged from buying health plans on the federal marketplace because they come with high premiums and little or no help from the government.
The first thing you need to understand is that Obamacare has been a highly successful program. When the legislation was passed, Republicans insisted it would fail to cut the number of uninsured and would blow a huge hole in the federal budget. In fact, it led to major gains in coverage, reducing the uninsured rate to its lowest level in history, at relatively low cost.
In 2001, George W. Bush's tax cut was supported by 12 Democrats in the Senate and 28 in the House. His education bill also received significant Democratic support, as did multiple virus relief bills during Donald Trump's presidency. Some Democrats saw these bills as opportunities to win policy concessions.
I've already made the pitch, and I actually had several unions say that it's a really good approach. I don't remember if the U.A.W. was one of them.
So I start with trying to understand the problem, what it means that tens of millions of people don't have prescriptions filled, don't go to the doctor. People with health insurance who are being sued by their hospitals for medical bills. I think of this as offering the most help to the greatest number of people as quickly as possible. So in terms of priorities, day one, there's a lot a president could do all by herself, and I'll do it.
Among other things, right? And it's why though I've tried so hard for 11 months and four days now to talk about the vision of what we can actually do and to try to make it real. Not vision in a — I'm not really a big, you know, talk about this in soaring terms. But in real terms, a 2-cent wealth tax.
But instead, the more blockage we have, the less compromise we seem to get.
And I wonder, did you ask Graham about how McCain felt about this developing relationship between Graham and Trump, considering their past and McCain's place in it?
But the other half, let's say you have a complaint because the trade agreement had said that some other country would permit unionization or would not use low-wage workers beyond a certain point. Do you get a path like that? A quick resolution? And by the way, I should point out: That quick resolution? There's no appeal from it. It is immediately enforceable against a government. So you can go straight against Canada for raising its environmental standards. You can go straight against a South American country for raising its standards to protect its children's health from smoking.
Researchers found more evidence that the variant from South Africa can evade antibodies. Vials of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' antibody treatment Credit... Regeneron, via Associated Press The monoclonal antibody treatment made by Eli Lilly is powerless against a variant of the coronavirus discovered in South Africa, according to a new study posted online on Tuesday. In addition, one of two monoclonal antibodies in a cocktail treatment made by Regeneron also is significantly less effective against that variant, although the combination still works, researchers at Columbia University reported. The findings underscore growing concerns that because of new mutations in its genetic material, this variant, called B.1.351, may be able to resist antibodies contained in these treatments and perhaps those created by the body following vaccination. Dr. David Ho, an infectious disease expert at Columbia University, and his colleagues also tested the monoclonal antibody therapies against the coronavirus variant discovered in Britain. The therapies were reported to be just as effective as they had been against earlier versions of the virus. But the variant in South Africa was a different story. Activity of the monoclonal antibody made by Eli Lilly, and one of the two made by Regeneron, was completely or markedly abolished when tested against the variant, Dr. Ho and his colleagues found. A third variant identified in Brazil shares many mutations with B.1.351 and is expected to behave similarly, Dr. Ho said.
Why attacking corruption and getting some structural change in our economy that actually is about not just the wealth gap top to bottom, but this fact that more and more and more of our value is being sucked up to the top, and more and more people are sliding back behind it. And not having power at the polls. How those three things are tied to each other.
Right. I mean, I just want to say obviously I don't disagree with you about all of this being extremely stifling. I guess, to me, it's just the question of, do you try to expand the social definition of what women can do and what men can do? Or do you try to erase the idea that male and female has any inherent meaning? And I guess, you know, I know people for whom the idea of doing that seems utopian. And I guess, for me, it just — it doesn't speak to me. It's not something that I particularly aspire to, even though, obviously I don't want to live by the traditional limitations of femininity. And I don't want my kids to be subject to those. I mean, I've had the same experience as you both, to a certain extent. And I think that it's always a temptation, especially if you have one boy and one girl, or in Ross's case is two girls and one boy, to overinterpret a very small sample size.
I'm going to get, in honor of my friends, full funding of $300 million for the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, which you have been trying to get for over 30 years.
But experts say that tax credits for those earning more won't have a meaningful effect in reducing the number of uninsured because most high-earners are already insured anyway.
There are too many flaws in Jamie Daw's case to enumerate in a short letter, but let me take just one: Dr. Daw states, In Germany, sickness funds leverage market power to secure lower prices, coming together regionally to negotiate contracts with doctors and hospitals . In the United States, health insurance companies — which are much larger and have much more market power than German sickness funds — have had the ability to negotiate for lower prices for the better part of a century. The result has been what we have — by far the most expensive health care system in the world.
In a rural district like that, retail campaigning in a packed presidential primary schedule can be difficult, and the airwaves become even more important. So Mr. Bloomberg has put roughly $900,000 on air in Duluth, compared with just $17,000 by Ms. Klobuchar and $19,000 by Mr. Sanders.
Mr. Trump seems oblivious to these trends. His sparse health care proposal is built around a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, without any regard for the millions of people who would be hurt by that change. Twenty million Americans have gained health care coverage in the six years since the law was passed, bringing the uninsured rate to a record low. The law has problems — for example, there are too few insurers offering coverage on the health exchanges in rural and suburban areas — that the next president and Congress will need to fix. But it is generally working effectively and has cost the government less than expected, according to the Congressional Budget Office and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.
WASHINGTON — President Trump singled him out for praise even while attacking other members of the Supreme Court. The White House nominated people close to him to important judicial posts. And members of the Trump family forged personal connections.
But the main split, Brill says, isn't Democrats versus Republicans; it's the protected versus the unprotected, or the self-preservationist elite versus everyone else. He dates the beginning of the tailspin to the 1960s, when school reformers set out to replace the old-boy aristocracy with a system more open, more fair, more meritocratic.

They principally try to appeal to voters using small d democratic ideals — the general, basic American principle that everyone should be given the easiest access to vote. They try to appeal to people through public health measures, noting how unsafe it is for people to gather at polls. But when you ask folks in Democratic circles, they know that when the electorate expands, particularly in national and statewide elections, that's usually good news for Democrats.

The question is not that far-fetched. The current economic expansion is already the third longest since the middle of the 19th century, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research. If it makes it past June of next year it will be the longest on record.
This appears to be a misrepresented statistic.

Well, what may seem like an anomaly right now might actually just be a pacesetter. And this could be a preview as to what comes for state after state. If you are a place like Georgia or Louisiana or Ohio that has functionally delayed its election by three, four weeks, and if this virus persists to that time, there will still be questions about whether it is safe to hold in-person balloting then.
Yet while they may seem similar if you think of everything as left versus right, they're very different on another dimension, which you might call purity versus pragmatism. And that difference is why I believe progressives should enthusiastically embrace the G.N.D. while being much more cautious about M4A.
Well, you know, it obviously depends on the program, but I worry about — for example, increasing the dollar payment on Section 8 vouchers, it doesn't seem to increase the supply of housing. Instead, it seems to make a segment of landlords richer. So I'd rather take that money and put it directly into increasing housing supply.
Ms. DiCola's father, a solo-practice lawyer, is also a Trump supporter, but she is a liberal Democrat and uneasily aware of the anger and frustration that unsubsidized Obamacare customers are feeling — so much so that at first, she worried about sharing her story with The New York Times and being dragged through the mud on some 24-hour news channel for being on Medicaid.
You do what you can with 50 votes to offer people what's possible. And then when lots of people get experience with it and they say, I like this, this works for me, then we vote on it and everybody gets better off and gets to try it. I think that's what's going to happen on Medicare for all. In fact, I think that is the way that we can solve our health care problems.
And I thought I would see a larger social conservative core saying he's right and we've gotten this wrong. I've been a little bit surprised that there hasn't been more support for him, or do you think I'm misreading this?
So in a special session that happens before Evers takes office, Republicans do a kind of classic power grab.
Just a few weeks ago, Donald J. Trump and Republicans in Congress were talking about how Obamacare's insurance markets were floundering, and how insurance companies were fleeing while prices were spiraling out of control.
And so, after he left, he spent a few years researching the Senate's history to understand how it led to this grim present. And his new book, Kill Switch: The Rise of the Modern Senate and the Crippling of American Democracy, it is, in my view, the essential book on the modern Senate. It is excellent. Now it's not particularly uplifting, but one thing it is not is without hope, because the Senate, unlike a lot of other things in American politics, can be changed. And so I wanted Adam to come on the show to talk about how the Senate became what it is today, talk about what it means for Joe Biden's agenda, to talk about what really drives senators like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, what it really feels like to be in there, legislating at this moment in this institution at this time, and of course, about how to fix it. As always, my email is ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. I'm always interested to know who you'd like to see on the show, so send me your guest suggestions. Here's Adam Jentleson. So I want to start with the real sexy stuff, the stuff that gets the audience excited. What is the budget reconciliation process, and why am I hearing so much about it right now?
Well, the biggest thing we learned is that the politics of health care have been turned on their head in the last couple of years, and that the Affordable Care Act is no longer a liability for Democrats, and that Republicans, whether they want to acknowledge it or not, have largely abandoned the fight.

For people that are eligible but not buying insurance it's a financial issue, and so upping the subsidies is going to make the price point come down, said Ezekiel Emanuel, a health policy expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania who advised Mr. Biden during his transition. The bill, he said, would make a big dent in the number of the uninsured.
The bill is still subject to amendments and debate. The two House committees that wrote the legislation have scheduled hearings in the coming days. But the legislation was drafted in consultation with House leadership and Republicans on the other committees that oversee health care. President Trump, in a tweet and a brief statement from his press office Monday, signaled his general support for the plan.
KK: Simultaneously though, all of the things that you've suggested you would need to do in order to afford Medicare for all, a wealth tax, cutting the defense budget, comprehensive immigration reform, would require the Senate's approval.
Mr. Trump sent mixed signals from the White House lectern, agreeing at one point with his surgeon general and saying, It's going to be bad, then suggesting that the response to the virus may have been overblown.
But it's hard. It's a lot easier not to take on the drug industry. It's a lot easier not to take on the insurance industry. It's a lot easier not to take on the oil industry. But every single issue we care about, every single issue — think about it on climate. All across this country people are saying climate, climate, climate. If you're not willing to take on the corruption, we're going to get laws passed that are going to have great names: Save the World; Everything Is Green; Now Safe for Unicorns.
WASHINGTON — In an unusual letter to the Supreme Court in a case already argued, the Biden administration told the justices on Wednesday that the federal government was switching sides in a challenge to the Affordable Care Act. Disavowing the position of the Trump administration, a Justice Department official urged the court to uphold the law.
In October, Senator Warren's campaign bought ads that read: Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election. The campaign was intended as a critique of Facebook's decision not to fact-check or remove political ads. (Updated) Facebook did not remove from the social network the ad falsely endorsing Mr. Trump.
KK: We have time for, I think, one or two more questions.
There's a wooing going on, David French warned in National Review in March under the headline The Temptation of John Roberts. His focus was not the census case but abortion and the Mueller report. According to this construct, Mr. French wrote, it's Roberts the ideologue who would vote to restrict abortion rights. It's Roberts the conservative who would back the Trump administration. But a chief justice who cared about the institution of the Supreme Court? Well, he guards Roe. He checks Trump.
He said he was proud of the progress of the last six years, especially the fact that 20 million people had gained coverage because of the law. But he acknowledged that — despite the title of the law — health care and health insurance were still unaffordable for some people.
He was not a war hero.

Mr. Strange's demise, senior party strategists and conservative activists said Wednesday, makes it likelier that Republican incumbents in the House and Senate will face serious primary challenges in 2018, fueled by anger at the party's apparent ineptitude at wielding power in Washington. Stephen K. Bannon, Mr. Trump's former chief strategist and a vehement antagonist of the party establishment, said on Tuesday night that he intends to target Republican senators in Mississippi, Arizona and Nevada for defeat.

This is a mistake. There's no doubt that the judicial system must examine the accusations against Mr. Epstein, and that the Justice Department will have many questions about Mr. Acosta's apparent leniency toward him. Congress digging into this case, however, is a poor use of lawmakers' limited time and resources. More dangerous, in the midst of the Trump administration's war on congressional oversight in general , such hearings carry a high risk of turning the Epstein case into a partisan battle — and Mr. Acosta into a political martyr around whom the president and his followers feel moved to rally.
Mr. Barr did not favor the move but did not object to the White House decision once it had been made, people familiar with what took place said. And one White House official said the administration faced a deadline imposed by the court if it wanted to support the suit.
The Trumpian call to duty, however, is a particularly bold — even counterintuitive — choice for a president whose core message has always been that he can save anxious Americans from having to make tough choices, to adapt to economic changes or to face scary cultural shifts. His pledge to Make America Great Again has never been about helping move the nation into the future, but about easing it back into a more comforting past. In his capacity as Strong Leader, he has vowed to take care of everything, and it is all going to be so easy.
He was a flawed person but also a great man, and showing him in his full complexity would make for a better film than pretending he was a walking saint. But the historian who was involved in this project said: Too many racists. They're not ready for that.
Polling has consistently shown Senator Warren to be in the top tier of candidates, but not the front of the pack. She trails Joe Biden — and Donald Trump — in key swing states.
Despite all that, however, the act has vastly improved many Americans' lives — and in many cases, saved lives that would otherwise have been lost due to inadequate care. The progress has been most dramatic in states that have tried to make the law work. Before the A.C.A. went into effect, 24 percent of California adults too young for Medicare were uninsured. Today that number is down to 10 percent. In West Virginia, uninsurance fell from 21 percent to 9. In Kentucky, it fell from 21 to 7.
There are a couple of places to start, but I think that a nice place to go first is one of Roger Scruton's books about conservatism. He wrote a couple of books, all of which are basically called conservatism, more or less. They're short. They're accessible. And Scruton, because he, himself, had traveled from the left to the right, really had a sense that the concerns that people on the left have about the right are serious concerns and needed to be spoken to in a serious way. And I think he does it wonderfully. He's a wonderful writer. Scruton is probably underappreciated in America. He's an English conservative. He just died last year. And there's a lot of work of his it's worth reading, but I think his several short books about conservatism are a great place to begin.
In 2012, Massachusetts Democrats, worried about a tough fight against Republican Senator Scott Brown, coalesced around Ms. Warren, knocking her only primary challenger, an immigration attorney, Marisa DeFranco, off the ballot. Winning in November is more important to Democrats than standing behind one woman who wanted to challenge another one for the right to run for U.S. Senate, Boston Globe columnist Joan Vennochi wrote at the time. Whether Ms. Warren could beat Mr. Brown, the incumbent, was more of a tossup, though by late summer 2012 most polls had her ahead.
First, we are giving the opportunity of employment to a quarter of a million of the unemployed.
And you had an African-American president who was seen as an outsider by a lot of older white Americans. And into that mix stepped Trump with this mix of superficial economic populism, and birtherism, and bigotry. Was it inevitable that Trump was going to be the Republican nominee? I don't think, in hindsight, it actually was. Is it inevitable that the party has to be Trumpified permanently? I don't think it is. I mean, I think the failure of Republican politicians right now is their failure to say, what can we offer to our voters instead of America, love it or leave it? That as much as the failure to condemn Trump more forcefully is the problem for the Republican Party going forward. It has to figure out what it makes of the Trumpist turn.
KK: So who would be your running mate?

Mr. Trump released his short list of potential Supreme Court nominees in May 2016. In September 2016, he released a second list with several more women and people of color, following criticisms of the white and male bias in his first.
They failed multiple attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and its popularity got higher than ever. And there was kind of this boost among Democratic activists over health care — that they started to really care about the issue, and get organized, and get angry.
So, Romney's idea is for a child allowance, which is a monthly payment, to nearly all parents in the US for each child that they have. If I remember correctly, it's between the age of zero and six, it would be $4,200 a year. And then thereafter, until they're 17, $3,300 a year.
Could be. But the neuralgic reaction to his bid says something about the ideological drift of the Democratic Party — and of its vulnerabilities against a historically weak president.
The case argues that changes made to the Affordable Care Act in 2017 make its requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance unconstitutional — and that the provision is so essential to the health care law that the rest of it should be invalidated as well.
There is a big inconvenient fact about conservative health care proposals, as Ross Douthat notes in his latest column: Virtually no real-world successful example exists.
Right. Even though it does redouble the loyalty of his base.
The measure would overhaul the role of the Education Department, reducing its staff and administrative costs, and empower states and districts to decide how to best use federal funds to meet the needs of their students, the department's budget said.

Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist, argued that two factors — fund-raising demands and the effect of the social media on candidates and their staff — are turning the nomination contest into some kind of purity game to see who can be the most leftist.
JI: I want to just pivot very quickly to health care. It seemed like a good moment. With respect to what you will fight for, can you talk a little bit about Medicare for all and where it ranks in terms of your priorities, and then to kind of sort of reiterate the question, how do you convince people who are wary of massive health care overhaul yet again that that's the right approach to that problem basically?
You need a different apology, she concluded
Since that failure, some progressives have wondered if Obama and other party leaders could have passed the bill if only they had tried harder. The answer is unknowable, but I think the evidence suggests that the bill died for more fundamental reasons. Spending federal money to prevent a depression is popular. So are cracking down on Wall Street and expanding health insurance. Raising the price of energy is not.
My view on that one is that really you can be the umpire in the baseball game or you can have a team in the baseball game, but you don't get to do both at the same time. So breaking the platform off from the competitive business, yeah, that would give a lot of small businesses a much more level playing field and ability to compete.
In a remarkable public break with one of his earliest political supporters, Mr. Trump complained that Mr. Sessions's decision ultimately led to the appointment of a special counsel that should not have happened. Sessions should have never recused himself, and if he was going to recuse himself, he should have told me before he took the job and I would have picked somebody else, Mr. Trump said.
Unfortunately, for many African-Americans Northern cities turned into a socioeconomic trap. The opportunities that lured migrants disappeared as blue-collar jobs moved first to the suburbs, then overseas. Chicago, for example, lost 60 percent of its manufacturing employment between 1967 and 1987.
She offered no sourcing for this assertion, as is the case for vaporous claims that rise from the rot of the Trump presidency on a daily basis. But in blaming God for Trump, Sanders echoed a widespread Republican belief that the most outwardly amoral man ever to occupy the White House is an instrument of divine power. He's part of the master plan.
Both proposals offered far less money to fight Zika than the $1.9 billion requested by the Obama administration. Still, Senate Democrats and the White House had indicated some willingness to go along with the Senate plan.
But that is the specific, right? This is the place where Democrats have fired on Democrats about how we're going to do health care. And I'll make two pitches on that. One is I think the best way we're going to do health care — this is just what I believe — is you do what you can to bring down costs. You got a little success on the table. It's a lot of success. It's hundreds of millions of dollars of success. You've got that on the table. You start to offer people what's possible.
And then there are people who are willing to call themselves socialists, even, in some cases, but in any case, who have much greater ambitions for what public policy should be doing and what government should do. And both parties have some divisions along these lines. And in fact, those socialist Democrats probably agree with Josh Hawley about more than they would imagine. But the parties are very divided on social issues. And not only the traditional ones — abortion and so on — but they've broadened the definition of social issues so that immigration is now almost entirely a social issue and questions of culture and the rest of it are really what divides the parties now. There's much more room for compromise on economics and much less on social issues than there used to be.
The results confirm what some scientists have warned about for months: that without wider testing, scores of infected people would go undetected and continue to circulate the virus.

In his struggle to overcome his stutter, Biden famously recited the poems of William Butler Yeats in front of a mirror. He has used Heaney's aspirational lines again and again — in a viral campaign video, and his acceptance speech last summer at the Democratic National Convention, and at a 2013 meeting on the U.S.-Korea relationship in Seoul.
Times reporting from Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley found that Senator Warren's wealth tax plan has broad support, including from 77 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of Republicans, with the exception of one demographic: Republican men with college degrees.
The high level of medical debt among young adults, Ms. McKernan said, is an argument for buying health insurance, even if you feel you don't need it. Get health insurance, even if you're young, she said. A health plan may not cover every cost incurred, she said, but it sure helps.
If the nation's pharmaceutical executives thought Donald J. Trump would grant them a reprieve from scrutiny over high drug prices, he made them reconsider that idea in the last few days.
But I think you could also say — and this is where I disagree with you, David. I think you could say that we have exaggerated, as Michelle says, the extent to which male-female differences require some form of patriarchy. But that doesn't mean that we've actually exaggerated male-female differences. That just might mean that we haven't appreciated what women can do as much as we've should. And there's, in fact, plenty of evidence that in gender egalitarian societies, including the paradises of Scandinavia, male and female differences actually increase further. I think there are places and situations where male-female differences still get exaggerated. I think in the world of New York Times readers, at this point in our history, it's the opposite and that we've moved to a place of telling people that they need to deny realities in front of their face.

The nickname for the plan is repeal and delay, and the assumption underlying it is that the current system will be sustainable for as long as it takes Congress to pass and the White House to install a new health plan.
Several members of the Trump family have come under fire for profiting from Donald Trump's administration in possible violation of the emoluments clause, including Ivanka Trump, who was paid more than $1 million from her ties to the Trump Organization last year. And former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter held a lucrative position on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. In late September, Ms. Warren was, in the words of one reporter, uncharacteristically flustered when asked about the Biden matter.
A coalition of consumers and liberal advocacy groups is spending more than $2 million on television advertisements urging Congress to stop its attack on the law. The ads, by the Alliance for Healthcare Security, are aimed at a handful of Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Jeff Flake and John McCain of Arizona, Susan Collins of Maine, Dean Heller of Nevada, Lamar Alexander and Mr. Corker of Tennessee, and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia.
MC: No, I'm just saying ——
If Republican leaders still believe that, they're not acting like it.
The notes recorded the deaths of so many, from Covid-19 and other illnesses and acts of violence. The emails document, frequently with just a few words, the work of firefighters and doctors and school cafeteria cooks — or, more often, the harrowing work they were about to face.
President Joko Widodo of Indonesia received on Wednesday his second shot of a vaccine made by the Chinese company Sinovac, a day after the country of 270 million people surpassed one million reported infections. Mr. Joko said that 250,000 health workers in Indonesia had already received their first shot. About 50,000 people are now being vaccinated each day, he said, adding that he hoped to raise that number to one million.
I admit I have never quite understood the hatred Reagan had for Medicare, nor the hatred today's Republicans have for Obamacare (itself modeled on Romneycare, a Republican idea). Is it just that they cannot abide the idea that government sometimes — even if only as a last resort — does good things?
I think that the Biden administration is benefiting from the refusal of Trump to go away and to let others let him go away. It seems to me that there's this disjunction between the expectations that a lot of Democrats, and particularly progressives, have of this presidency. And what seems to be likely, as an outcome, I think, are maybe beginning to see some of the letdown happen with the apparent sinking of the Neera Tanden nomination for OMB. But it seems to me that you're going to be six or seven months into this administration and they're going to be a lot of Democratic voters who are going to say, look, we've got the house, we've got the Senate, we've got the White House and there isn't a big minimum wage increase, there isn't any election reform, there isn't much in the way of a Green New Deal, probably, there isn't a public option on health care. Just keep going down the list. No Puerto Rican or D.C. statehood. And that the hopes have just really outstripped the capacity of the Biden Administration to deliver.
But look at the difference it makes if there are multiple Facebooks out there. If you can get to anybody's page regardless of who they go through, it becomes like the phone company, right? You can have any different brand of phone, but as long as I hit the same set of numbers, I will reach you. If you could do that through Facebook, then you've got competitors offering, hey, I tell you what. You come use my site, and I won't be sharing your personal data with anybody. I will offer better security than those other yahoos offer. I will offer you a 2-cent rebate for all of the advertising. I will offer you the option to click out of ads, or you'll only get one ad every minute. That's what competitive markets do.
So, during a private lunch in February 2009, Mr. Biden slid a memo across the table to Mr. Obama, outlining a role to erase those doubts: quarterbacking the implementation of the $787 billion economic stimulus that had been rammed through Congress a few days earlier in the depths of recession.
The spike in premiums is a sign that not enough healthy people are signing up for the exchanges. Without healthy people to balance out the sick, insurance stops being insurance and becomes terribly expensive.
The higher proportion of younger adults with medical debt was a bit surprising, Ms. McKernan said, because they tend to have fewer health problems. But they are less likely to have health insurance, she noted, and have not been accumulating wealth as quickly as earlier generations.
I have a plan to build about 3.2 million new housing units across this country to make money available for changing zoning and working together across municipal boundaries on joint projects that increase density and trying to use the federal government as a partner to move forward in bringing down the cost overall for housing.
Mr. Biden, who has a habit of going on tangents and fumbling his lines, gave among the most fluent and forceful remarks of his candidacy as he vigorously defended the Affordable Care Act, Mr. Obama's signature health care law, and advocated for strengthening it, rather than embracing a new system — like, he implied, Medicare for All.
A new survey of the Democratic candidates by The New York Times finds that many of them prefer less sweeping changes than the Medicare for All Act, the single-payer bill introduced by Senator Bernie Sanders and supported by Senator Elizabeth Warren and several other presidential hopefuls. A majority of candidates in the survey — including former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., the leader in early polls — said they would rather add a public option in the health care system that would compete with private plans.
Critics of Senator Warren's student debt plan say it would unfairly benefit those on the path to becoming highly paid professionals.
At 37, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., is the youngest of the candidates to jump into the 2020 presidential race, and he is trying to turn his age to his advantage, arguing that he grew up with mass shootings in schools and that his generation will inherit the full consequences of climate change.
• Ms. Sanger-Katz on why even some Republicans are rejecting President Trump's replacement health care bill.
You know, when I put together my anti-corruption plan, which is a big plan about the influence of money, I didn't put the provision in, but it was mostly because it's like so many things, I hadn't actually seen the implications of it. I think it's actually a very bad idea, and I would like to see it as part of an anti-corruption —

Ties between some Republican lawmakers and extremist groups are under scrutiny after the Capitol riot. Representative Paul Gosar, Republican of Arizona, speaking to protesters in November outside the Maricopa County Tabulation and Election Center in Phoenix. Credit... Jim Urquhart/Reuters Nearly 150 House Republicans supported President Donald J. Trump's baseless claims that the election had been stolen from him. But a handful of the chamber's Republicans had deeper ties to extremist groups who pushed violent ideas and conspiracy theories and whose members were prominent among those who stormed the halls of Congress in an effort to stop certification of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s victory. Their ranks include Representatives Andy Biggs and Paul Gosar, both of Arizona, as well as Representatives Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and Matt Gaetz of Florida. It is not clear whether any elected officials played a role in directly facilitating the attack on the Capitol, other than helping to incite violence through false statements about the election being stolen from Mr. Trump. Officials have said they are investigating reports from Democrats that a number of House Republicans provided tours of the Capitol and other information to people who might have gone on to be part of the mob on Jan. 6. No evidence has surfaced publicly to back up those claims.
Senator Warren's campaign ads pitch a 2-cent wealth tax to cover $700 billion in universal child care, $1.25 trillion in universal free college and student debt forgiveness, and more. But Senator Warren's tax would really be more than 2 cents on the dollar for the ultrarich, because you have to add the 2 cents to additional taxes she has promised on assets above $1 billion along with taxes on income and capital gains. Two University of California economists recently calculated that the Microsoft founder Bill Gates's net worth would be more than halved if Senator Warren's wealth tax in its original form had been enacted in 1982.
Can I just say quickly we've exaggerated them very specifically to put women in a subservient position. Right? So that's the problem, I mean, basically saying that women aren't fit, weren't fit to vote, then weren't fit to run for office, or basically only fit to be a sort of live-in maid, and concubine, and nanny, and are built to do all of the drudgery that men don't want to do but that then kind of makes men's lives easier. That wasn't an accident. But in a way, I think you kind of have to be cognizant of gender in order to see the way that it still functions to women's detriment.
These guessing-game questions about congressional intent are irrelevant in this context because it was Congress, not a court, that did the eliminating. Moreover, in doing so, Congress expressly left the rest of the statute in place — including the insurance protections the Justice Department now says, in the name of congressional intent, must fall. We don't have to ask what Congress intended because we can see what Congress did. Game over.
So how does that play out when all of a sudden there is a Democratic governor in Evers, who I assume wants to start making compromises with the Republican legislature?
We have so little time together, and yet our system forces us to waste it with bills and bureaucracy, he told the committee in his opening statement, noting that the fast progress of his disease had impressed upon him the urgency of reform. That is why I am here today, urging you to build a more rational, fair, efficient and effective system.
The pandemic becomes more acutely felt in the Midwest and particularly in Wisconsin.
Obamacare has shown other signs of hardiness. This year, the Trump administration slashed the program's advertising budget by 90 percent, and withdrew key subsidies from insurance companies, leading to premium increases for some customers. But every market had at least one insurer that continued to offer plans on the Obamacare marketplaces, and sign-ups dipped only slightly.
At the end of the year, your subsidies will be settled once you file your taxes. If you miscalculated and received too much in subsidies, you will have to repay the difference then.

Along similar lines, the liberal, pro-Democratic Center for American Progress issued a report on Monday warning that progressive supporters of liberalized immigration have ceded powerful rhetorical ground to immigration restrictionists, who are happy to masquerade as the sole defenders of America as a nation of laws.
Oklahoma is an awfully red state, said Adam Searing, an associate professor at Georgetown University who has tracked the state's ballot effort. It's very conservative, very rural. To have it pass there is quite significant.

The government would also have to transition. Medicare for all works only if politicians ruthlessly enforce those spending cuts. But in our system of government, members of Congress are terrible at fiscal discipline. They are quick to cater to special interest groups, terrible at saying no. To make single-payer really work, we'd probably have to scrap the U.S. Congress and move to a more centralized parliamentary system.
and other critical materials. We need emergency funds in order to make sure that we have those materials. The briefing comes as Mr. Biden is under intense pressure to speed up the pace of coronavirus vaccinations. A C.D.C. advisory committee met on Wednesday to discuss vaccine safety, as well as a new vaccine being developed by AstraZeneca. The C.D.C. said Wednesday that about 20.7 million people have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and that about 3.8 million people have been fully vaccinated. More than a million people a day, on average, have received a shot to help protect them against Covid-19 in the United States over the last week. As the vaccine rollout accelerates, the number of daily new cases in the United States, which has the worst outbreak in the world, has been on the decline in recent weeks. U.S. deaths, though, remain high, numbering more than 3,000 per day on average in recent days.
He is a war hero —
When told that former Vice President Biden criticized her health care plans, Senator Warren answered with a critique of moderate Democrats: Democrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies. She also suggested Mr. Biden is running in the wrong primary.

During oral arguments, two of the three judges expressed some openness to the argument from the states. Of course, any ruling that invalidated the health law would be appealed to the Supreme Court, where the five justices who voted to uphold it in 2012 remain.
The Fed cut its benchmark rate by a quarter of a percentage point yesterday, matching analyst expectations. Jay Powell, the Fed chairman, cited slowing global economic growth and the uncertainty wrought by Mr. Trump's trade war with China. He also announced another move to bolster growth: an early end to the central bank's effort to shrink its balance sheet.
The health care bill, whatever its merits, was not a budget, or a central component of anyone's conception of what a budget should be. But that's what the budget resolution was used for. And that is, in many ways, the problem: The budget process is not really about budgeting anymore.
This approach does not eliminate opposition. A conservative coalition ran a campaign against the measure, claiming that it would increase energy costs. But the state's largest utility, NV Energy, mostly stayed out of the fight. It will still be able to earn big profits from renewable energy, albeit probably not quite as big. In the end, the initiative passed, 59 percent to 41 percent.
I am in this fight because my daddy ended up as a janitor. I got my big chance at a commuter college that cost $50 a semester, because a bunch of taxpayers had invested in that college. That opportunity is not there today. That same college costs $15,000 now. Kids have to load up on debt to go there today. That's not expanding opportunity in this country. We've got a choice to make as a nation and the good news about 2020, the door has opened just a crack, that all the things that have been broken for so long, Donald Trump has made so much worse and gotten so many people off the sidelines, we actually have a chance. Not just to nibble, but to make big change.
Yeah. I think it's an enormously important question, obviously, a very challenging one. But I think that when you think about it in those terms, there is a terribly important role for elected leaders in the party who need to see themselves in more active terms and less passive terms, as people with something to say about where the party goes and not just as conduits for public sentiment. Obviously, that's part of what our elected officials need to do. But people who make politics their profession, their life have a particular role in shaping the direction of our political institutions. Part of what we've seen in the Trump era, as opposed to, say, the Reagan era, is that a leader who wants to take the energy of the party and turn it in a destructive direction can do that all too easily. I think you can also see, if you look at the Reagan era, if you look at others, that a leader that wants to take some of those same energies and turn them in more practical, constructive directions can achieve that, too. And that means that Republican leaders have to think about, what of the things they're hearing from voters do they take to be constructive and productive and they want to make something of? And focus on those. A party has to be united by what it's for together and not just by who it's against together.
Climate change. I mean, he was a big dealmaker. He, to this day, is remembered — and remembered is sort of a key word, because it's very past tense — as someone who could speak some truth to power and someone who was seen as a reasonable independent conservative.
No, It's fine. So I actually start with the big vision. You know, if you gave me a chance, I'd do a constitutional amendment to protect the right of every American citizen to vote and to make sure that vote gets counted so you put real federal muscle behind it. I also talk about that for a specific reason, because a lot of Americans are shocked to know that that's not already in the Constitution and that there is no federal muscle behind that.
I would encourage someone who is looking for coverage just for a catastrophic need to really read the fine print, said Claire McAndrew, the director of campaigns and partnerships at Families USA. They often contain complicated exclusions that your average consumer could never predict.
The deaths reported to the attorney general's office at most of those facilities totaled 1,914, compared to the state's much lower count of 1,229. Ms. James said that her office was investigating those circumstances where the discrepancies cannot reasonably be accounted for by error or the difference in the question posed. The attorney general said she was continuing to conduct investigations of more than 20 nursing homes across the state that presented particular concern, noting that other law enforcement agencies also have ongoing investigations relating to nursing homes.

During a 10-day break for the Supreme Court in April 2012, several justices left Washington to give lectures or take short vacations. But both John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy remained in Washington, and Roberts used the time to try to win over Kennedy on Obamacare.
You know, Astead, I'm struck by the fact that earlier on, you told us that Democrats and Republicans in the state, they had basically been on the same page about this primary until the virus gets worse and the governor advocates for a different kind of voting system through absentee ballots. And then it all breaks down, and Republicans are attempting at every turn to block him now in court. And how do you explain that? I mean, how do Republicans in the state legislature explain that?
This debate exploded into the open during Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential announcement speech. The address is now remembered for Goldwater's promise to offer a choice, not an echo. Less well-known, but perhaps more telling, is the rationale for his candidacy that comes a few paragraphs earlier. Goldwater says, with some disgust, I have not heard from any announced Republican candidate a declaration of conscience or of political position that could possibly offer to the American people a clear choice in the next presidential election. This was Goldwater's promise: if Republicans nominated him, the election would not be an engagement of personalities. It will be an engagement of principles. Goldwater, of course, won the nomination and got destroyed by Lyndon Johnson.
JW: So you think a constitutional amendment?
In a system where the plans would need to cover expensive drugs for H.I.V. or inpatient treatment for schizophrenia, they might be more leery of taking on any customers at risk of needing such services. I would think that insurers would end up being stricter in their exclusions of people because they couldn't limit benefits, said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a health research group.
Health care was always going to be a big issue in the general election, and the coronavirus epidemic will put health care even more top of mind for voters, said Larry Levitt, the executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan research organization. Sometimes these health care debates can get a bit abstract, but when it's an immediate threat to the health of you and your family, it becomes a lot more real.

Now we are at another hugely plastic moment — a moment when the world is experiencing four climate changes at once: There's a change in the climate of the climate — the hots are getting hotter, the wets wetter, the droughts drier, the forest fires fiercer. There's been a change in the climate of globalization — we are going from an interconnected world to an interdependent one. There's been a change in the climate of work — machines can think, reason and manipulate as fast, and increasingly better, than human beings.
It redoubles the loyalty of some part of his base. But if we assume his base is 45 percent of the country, then after Charlottesville his approval rating went down into the mid- to low 30s. So there's a big chunk of his base that I think believes in the Trump is a populist fighting for you message, and doesn't like the bigotry, and doesn't like the racism. So I think it's a big mistake to attribute these sort of multidimensional, chess-move brilliance to Trump's move here. What actually happened was that the Democratic Party was tearing itself apart because Nancy Pelosi and the leftward fringe in Congress can't get along with each other. And Trump saw a political scrum and wanted to jump in it because that's what he does. I expect his approval ratings to go down after this. We'll see what happens.

During the conversation, the two disagreed over Medicare for all and Mr. Biden defended the option of private insurance. But he also outlined his own plans for health care, nodded at more ideas to come and raised proposals like providing for the option to have home care paid for and elder care paid for, not as part of Medicare, as just a basic right.

But anyway, let's talk about what I said about Romney. (By the way, I don't think I referred to him as a charlatan — I used that word to refer to supply-side economists, because that's what Greg Mankiw, who was advising his campaign, called them.) Here's a key passage:
Lindsey Graham was not shy at all about speaking out.
And his response was to go onto Twitter and to declare that they are totally going to do all the things that he said they were going to do, but at a much later date, after the 2020 election.
The First Congressional District in the southern strip of the state, similarly rural and Republican leaning, is also worth five delegates. The district is split among multiple media markets, including one of the smallest in the country, Mankato. Mr. Bloomberg is the only candidate spending money in Mankato, with $850,000 on air. He is similarly alone in La Crosse, a Wisconsin media market that seeps into the southeastern corner of Minnesota, spending $780,000 there.
The health law included a permanent legal authorization for the Indian Health Service, which runs hospitals, employs physicians and provides health services to more than two million Native Americans. Repealing the law would invalidate the legal basis for that program.
Michael Oreskes, NPR's senior president for news, supported the decision. In an article on the NPR website, Mr. Oreskes said that the minute you start branding things with a word like 'lie,' you push people away from you. The inherent risk, he suggested, was that news organizations would be seen as taking sides.
I have to say, you almost have to admire the sheer brazenness of the dishonesty here . For the bill Hawley touts is a fraud: It's full of loopholes allowing insurers to discriminate in ways that would end up making essential health care unaffordable for those who need it most. For example, while it would require that they offer insurance to, say, cancer patients, it would allow them to sell policies that don't cover cancer treatment — which would mean that policies that did cover such treatment would become prohibitively expensive.
And so we saw a government that targeted teachers unions, that seized power on key boards, and really kind of had a wish list of conservative ideas nationally playing out in the state.

Excellent agenda. Sitting in disgraced, double-impeached political purgatory, Trump has been trying to retrain the world to refer to him as the 45th president during his unwelcome retirement. (If you are lucky enough to get a mass email from him, the return address will be 45 office.) How cool would it be if he had to sit in front of the TV listening to people talk about the former guy?
On Thursday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said he would remain in the job as long as that is appropriate after Mr. Trump criticized him for recusing himself in the Russia investigation.
G.O.P. opposition to programs helping the less fortunate, from food stamps to Medicaid, is usually framed in monetary terms. For example, Senator Orrin Hatch, challenged about Congress's failure to take action on the Children's Health Insurance Program, a part of Medicaid that covers nearly nine million children — and whose federal funding expired back in September — declared that the reason CHIP's having trouble is that we don't have money anymore.

A recent op-ed in The Times argued that Carrie Lam's decision to characterize the Hong Kong protests as a riot echoed a moment in 1989 when The People's Daily, the newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, referred to a gathering of students in Tiananmen Square as turmoil. Protesters in Hong Kong demanded that the term riot be retracted.
But we agree that the circus atmosphere surrounding the Affordable Care Act — exemplified this week by the abrupt decision by the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to delay the vote on the Senate's replacement bill — is generating uncertainty, which in turn is jeopardizing the future of public-private partnerships.
In total, there have been 21 gaps in government funding since 1976, though the level of shutdown has varied. The current federal shutdown is a partial one, as many agencies were already funded through this fiscal year, which ends in September.
In a democracy, how is it that they have so much political influence that one-tenth of 1 percent can say, I rather your kid have to deal with $50,000 in student loan debt, and I'd rather you never get a chance to get a child into day care, which means you either piece stuff together in crazy ways or quit your job. And I'd rather your public schools still have tiles falling out of the ceiling and textbooks that are 11 years old than that the top one-tenth of 1 percent has to pitch in 2 cents.
There are also smaller categories of care that may be left off these plans. Research from Kaiser and the consumer advocacy group Families USA found that limitations on specific treatments were common. Details differ by plan, but examples include:

It is hard to overstate just how down-is-up this argument is. Courts determine whether to invalidate other provisions in a law based on their assessment of Congress's intent and whether Congress would have wanted other provisions to go into effect if one provision did not. The department's argument is that without the mandate, Congress would not have wanted the guaranteed-issue and community-rating provisions.
Zucker's last TV job, as president and chief executive of NBC Universal, came with a huge corner office atop Rockefeller Center. At CNN, his setup is comparatively modest but seems to suit his metabolism and inclination toward micromanagement: His small office opens onto the newsroom, his desk positioned to face a wall of 11 television screens, so he can constantly monitor his network and its competitors. Zucker was met with a mixture of enthusiasm and wariness when he arrived at CNN in 2013. He had a reputation for intensity and competitiveness, which were both in short supply at CNN. But he was also known for being obsessed with ratings. You could feel the ground shaking, one former CNN producer told me. This iconic television producer was coming.
In one sense, it offers Democrats an advantage. The party is far more engaged with the details of health care policy, and far more willing to promise to extend coverage to those who don't have it. The debate over the last two nights has not been about whether to expand health coverage, but by how much, and by what policy mechanism.

Madison Hardee, a lawyer at Legal Services of Southern Piedmont, in Charlotte, N.C., said that enrollment stories can be an incredibly powerful tool to connect with consumers. Such testimonials are urgently needed, she said, because consumers in North Carolina are already starting to get notices about health insurance companies leaving the marketplace, and they fear the changes will reduce their ability to get quality, affordable coverage.

The stock market tumble after the government reported an uptick in wages last month suggests just how worried investors on Wall Street are that the Federal Reserve might start increasing interest rates more aggressively to forestall inflation.

Vice President Biden has cast the Medicare for all plan as anti-labor, arguing that unions have already painstakingly negotiated health care benefits, progress that could be undone by a single-payer system. But Senators Warren and Sanders argue that the plan is pro-labor because it would mean union members are guaranteed health care and can focus their negotiations on wage increases, family leave and other benefits.

The implications? Senator Susan Collins, the Maine Republican who voted against repealing Obamacare, put it best: The decision not to defend key provisions of Obamacare — in a suit filed by Texas' attorney general and 19 other states — creates further uncertainty that could ultimately result in higher costs for millions of Americans and undermine essential protections for people with pre-existing conditions, such as asthma, cancer, heart disease, arthritis and diabetes.
The Affordable Care Act continued to grow in popularity after Republican efforts to repeal the legislation in 2017 — a recent poll found that over half of the public favors the legislation.
# #4 Medicaid block grants New change States have an option to receive lump-sum Medicaid payments. Previously States received a flat per-beneficiary payment for Medicaid patients. Who's happy with this change Conservatives, particularly members of the Republican Study Committee
I'm sort of interested that both of you seem to think that both the health care case and the racist tweets are basically bad for Trump from a political perspective.
Polls suggest that the public considers health care the most important issue in the midterm elections. This immediately raises the question: Do voters understand what's at stake? In particular, do they realize that if Republicans hold Congress, they will strip away protections for the 52 million Americans — more than a quarter of nonelderly adults — who have pre-existing conditions that, before passage of the Affordable Care Act, could have led insurers to deny them coverage?
Asked if he would support the measure today, he said that times have changed — but that such a standard should not apply to Mr. Sanders's votes on guns.
Look, we can work — and this is what we should have done. We should have been pushing for negotiations with Turkey, with our allies, in order to protect the Kurds. And we could do that or could have done this as part of withdrawal. We could use economic pressure, we can use diplomatic pressure. We can use coalescing with our allies in order to bring pressure to protect the Kurds, and I think that's what we should have done. We've already abandoned the Kurds in the worst possible way and sent a huge signal to the rest of the world that the United States, at least under the Trump administration, is not a reliable ally.
I talk about rolling back every racist voter suppression law in America. We could do that at the federal level. I talk about outlawing political gerrymandering. We could do that at the federal level.
Yet while they may seem similar if you think of everything as left versus right, they're very different on another dimension, which you might call purity versus pragmatism.

Henry Louis Gates Jr. is one of a handful of academics who have crossed over into something approaching true celebrity. Which is apparently what happens when you've written and edited dozens of books of popular history; had a guiding hand in 18 major documentaries on black history, the most recent of which was Who Killed Malcom X?; and spent six seasons uncovering the genealogical mysteries of famous people as host of PBS's Finding Your Roots. Gates's desire to reach beyond the ivory tower — in addition to writing landmark works of literary criticism like The Signifying Monkey, he's the director of Harvard's Hutchins Center for African and African-American Research — was motivated by some very personal feelings. My brother asked me once, says Gates, 69, recalling a time when he and his work were less well known, 'When are you going to write a book that Daddy and Mama can read?'

These are the fights we need to have. These are the fights we should be bringing forward. We don't bring those fights forward. We — oh, well, we could — around the edge a little bit. Then we're just going to be the ones who stood by while America became fundamentally a country that lost even a hope that all the kids would have opportunity. That we just extinguish that and say, Nope. Better be born into it, because that's the only way to make it in America. That's not the America I want to see.

And you're saying you didn't get that vibe from Sgt. Crowley? I didn't get that vibe from him. When we were called into the Oval Office, I said to the president, Mr. President, we had a great conversation in the library. He said, Oh, it sounds like it's all settled. The actual beer summit was us doing small talk. And the reason Joe Biden was there is that the Cambridge police had insisted that because there were going to be two black guys at the table, they wanted two white guys at the table! They had sent somebody involved in the Cambridge police structure to be there. As we were walking out to the Rose Garden, somehow that guy got pushed to the side, and Joe Biden jumped in the line. That's what nobody ever figured out: Why is Biden at the table? He was there to be the second white guy.
Over several decades, it's become increasingly clear that how immigration debates are framed is important. One of the more subtle anti-immigration tactics — employed by the Trump, Kennedy and Johnson administrations, as well as some on the political left — is to suggest that reducing immigration could preserve more jobs for American workers and lead to higher wages, but economic research has consistently disputed the notion that limiting immigration would increase domestic employment or raise average wages. The prevailing view of economists is that immigration increases economic growth; while some workers might benefit from immigration restrictions, more would suffer.
So I would say the next big thing that happens in this timeline is that we get the Affordable Care Act in 2010.

And Republicans are contending with retirements of incumbents in crucial states, including Senators Patrick Toomey of Pennsylvania and Rob Portman of Ohio, that could make their task more difficult. Mr. Peters, 62, is also the incoming chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. He won his Senate seat handily in 2014, but his re-election fight was a grind, and he ultimately eked out victory by a margin of less than 2 percent. Along the way, Mr. Peters raised more than $50 million, a key metric for the campaign post. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the majority leader, called him battle-tested on Thursday. Republicans had a less flattering assessment, resurfacing one of their leading digs against Mr. Peters in his re-election campaign: that he is so bland and unrecognizable that voters forget his name. We are thrilled that Senator Peters was chosen for this position, Chris Hartline, a spokesman for Senate Republicans' campaign arm, said in a statement. It is an inspiration to uninspiring people everywhere that even Jerry Peters can reach a leadership position in the Democrat Party. Republicans selected Senator Rick Scott of Florida, the ambitious former governor, to lead their campaign team. Mr. Scott has jumped into the job enthusiastically, campaigning in a pair of runoff elections in Georgia earlier this month that cost his party the Senate.
Most Americans would still be able to get coverage under a plan provided by an employer or under a federal program, as they did before the law was passed, but protections for pre-existing conditions are particularly important to those who want to start their own businesses or retire early. Employers would sometimes refuse to cover certain conditions, and companies would have to decide if they would drop any of the conditions they are now required to cover.

WASHINGTON — The House is expected to give final approval on Friday to a measure that would allow Republicans to speedily gut the Affordable Care Act with no threat of a Senate filibuster, a move that would thrust the question of what health law would come next front and center even before President-elect Donald J.

PhRMA has always been very aggressive and very effective in their influence efforts, said Michael Beckel, research manager at Issue One, a nonprofit devoted to campaign-finance transparency. That includes using these new, dark-money vehicles to influence policy and elections.
Bigger changes are coming. The administration has proposed regulations that would allow so-called short-term health plans to be offered for nearly a year of coverage. Those plans aren't subject to any Obamacare rules in most states, and are likely to be marketed aggressively. They are likely to cover fewer health services and be available only to the healthy — but at a lower price. Another pending rule would expand the availability of association health plans, a form of group insurance purchasing that may be attractive to small businesses looking for cheaper, less comprehensive options.
Whether we're talking about workers or we're talking about the environment, who has to meet what standards? And there are big corporations who figured out how to game the system. Where standards are high, then move that part of the operation somewhere else where standards are low and save a nickel. Because these corporations, they don't have any loyalty to a country, they just have loyalty to their own bottom line. And they play this all around the world.
Insurers are supposed to submit their proposals to the federal government by June 21 and have already filed rate requests with several states. Loss of the cost-sharing subsidies, they say, could lead them to increase premiums by 15 percent to 20 percent or more, on top of any increases they might seek for other reasons.

It's true that some calculations indicate that means-tested programs — programs available only to those with sufficiently low incomes — can create disincentives for working and earning. But the evidence suggests that while safety net programs have some adverse effect on incentives, it's a much smaller effect than many policymakers believe.
Mr. Gaetz, who appeared at an event last year that was also attended by members of the Proud Boys, another extremist organization, said on his podcast that the group's members were there to provide security, and that just because you take a picture with someone, it does not mean you're tied to every viewpoint they've ever had or that they will ever have in the future.

Five. Five percent. We are widening racial wealth gaps in this country right now. Opportunity is shrinking for our children, and people see this. It's 12 years later. It's 20 years later from a whole set of promises that this was going to get better, and it hasn't gotten better, but people watch at the same moment. They don't look around and see a country that's getting poor. Look out your window, right? They don't look around and say, God, America's really on a downslide. They look out and they say, America is doing great. G.D.P. keeps going up. The stock market keeps going up, unemployment is down, but my family is stretched to the breaking point. My debt load is bigger than ever, and I look over the edge and see where my children are headed. I don't even see my children able to replicate what I have. I don't see them able to buy my house. I don't see them having even the job stability I had. I see them carrying more debt at 19 than I carried at 35.
While I've earned no college credits here, I've had a lesson in hypocrisy.
Mr. Trump isn't the first to mount a pressure campaign on NATO member states to increase their contributions. President Bush used a summit in Latvia in 2006 to urge other nations to raise their military spending, and President Obama echoed the plea at a 2014 conference in Brussels. Mr. Trump, though, has made spending levels a more central issue.
I am in this fight because my daddy ended up as a janitor. I got my big chance at a commuter college that cost $50 a semester, because a bunch of taxpayers had invested in that college. That opportunity is not there today. That same college costs $15,000 now. Kids have to load up on debt to go there today. That's not expanding opportunity in this country. We've got a choice to make as a nation and the good news about 2020, the door has opened just a crack, that all the things that have been broken for so long, Donald Trump has made so much worse and gotten so many people off the sidelines, we actually have a chance. Not just to nibble, but to make big change.
I grew up to the beat of racist denial in Queens, not far from where Mr. Trump grew up. I was raised in the urban hell of neighborhoods he probably avoided, alongside immigrants from countries he derided last week. In school or elsewhere, we all heard recitals of the American ideal of equality, especially on the day we celebrate the life of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Those events often feature recitals of the words all men are created equal, which were written by a slaveholder who once declared that black people are inferior to the whites in the endowments both of body and mind.
Let me tell you about Senator McCain.
The president compounded the problem by saying Republicans are going to become the party of health care without having any plan, let alone a coherent proposal that would produce better results and could get through Congress. Republicans are now deeply divided on what should be done, and the president is no help in setting a course for the party.
Exactly. This is not just about public health. This is about access to power and the kind of most basic fundamental principles of democracy. If the system that we have been traditionally used to can't hold, what replaces it? And we've seen real resistance to that in this state, and we may see that resistance all across the country.

Why are Republican policy ideas falling so flat? At one level, the answer is obvious: G.O.P. policies are unpopular because they hurt far more Americans than they help. Why should anyone expect cutting taxes on the rich while taking health care away from the sick to be popular?

My answer, as you might guess, is that they shouldn't, that they should seek incremental change on health care (Bring back the public option!) and focus their main efforts on other issues — that is, that Bernie Sanders is wrong about this and Hillary Clinton is right. But the main point is that we should think clearly about why health reform looks the way it does.

The threat of repeal appears to have been particularly galvanizing for Democratic activists, who came out to protest and contact their legislators during the debate.
It is hard, at least for me, to do justice to how sinister, in a way that sort of builds slowly, but she is such a monster. She does it not in a scenery-chewing way but in this very subtle, incisive way. I don't know. I'm very much looking forward to the final episode in which they've contrived to put her on trial as a mother. I think there's such a hunger at this point to see her unmasked. It'll be interesting to see if the show can give the people what they want.
In fairness, President Trump has not yet provided details of how he would like to see the replacement crafted. But the House Republican leadership has been circulating a draft of their ideas for helping those without employer-based health insurance, and it is not a pretty picture.

Biden Jr.'s primary rally at the Baldwin Hills Recreation Center in Los Angeles. Credit... Josh Haner/The New York Times LOS ANGELES — At the Biden party in Baldwin Hills, Nicole Duquette, a public school principal dressed in red, white, and blue, was streaming election returns on her phone as people came over to pet her spaniel, wearing a Joe Biden sweater. Biden has the experience to get to work on day one, Ms. Duquette, 40, said. He's a statesman, he's centered and grounded with a good moral and ethical compass, which is not something that could be said about the current president. It's time to take back our country and restore its reputation. The music cut and the crowd started chanting, We want Joe! and United for Biden! Julia Mervis, 20, and Brett Chody, 19, made up the college student contingent at the event. Both attend University of Southern California. Ms. Chody said she was passionate about gun control, but she preferred Mr. Biden because she thought he was more well-rounded as a candidate. Nobody's perfect, but I do think Bloomberg has a lot of flaws that will keep him from getting the nomination at the end of the day, she said. Ms. Mervis made a face when asked if she thought Mr. Sanders was electable.

I asked Lindsey Graham how he was getting along without John McCain.
You can also only do a limited number of budget reconciliation packages each fiscal year. That forces legislators to craft giant bills that jam every legislative priority into one rushed package, rather than crafting one bill, debating and modifying it, and then passing it and moving onto the next.
So my plan to forgive student loan debt is capped at $50,000 and an income of $250,000. And the reason for that is because it is the best way, not only to give maximum forgiveness to a lot of people who are struggling, but it also helps close the black-white wealth gap, and is part of the reason that the N.A.A.C.P. endorsed it along with the other parts I was doing about investment in our colleges. But I really worked through hard on these numbers to deal with exactly that question and that's why I got the numbers where they are. I don't think they raise that same issue. I'm not ——
Hillary's weak points aside, Trump also has one main advantage, which is that he'd be probably the most moderate nominee in decades. Now, Trump is not normally what we think of when we think of moderates – reactionary moderate is perhaps the best term to describe him. But border walls and Muslim bans aside, Trump really most closely resembles an old-school northeastern centrist Republican. Trump likes the welfare state. He's made protecting entitlements central to his pitch. It's safe to say that he's likely, at heart, socially liberal — the story of how he became anti-abortion, for example, doesn't make a great deal of sense. … And given the milieu he's always existed in, it's hard to believe he really opposes gay marriage, either. Trump has had the benefit of never really fleshing out what he believes about specific policies; nearly a year into his campaign, we still don't know what he'd replace Obamacare with. He is, as his longtime advisor Roger Stone says, a big picture guy: pro-business, pro-military, pro-America. The rest is all open to negotiation, to making the best deal. And, as Jim Antle notes over at The Washington Examiner, that puts him pretty squarely into the vast middle of the American electorate … Now, there are still plenty of reasons why someone who agrees with Trump on a whole mess of issues might still be unwilling to vote for him. But it's a mistake to assume that the man doesn't have a natural constituency outside the GOP.

Some of the Democratic candidates have been more forthright in their criticism of Hunter Biden's role at the Ukrainian gas concern; others have been cagier. Senator Cory Booker, when asked about the controversy, said I just don't think children of vice presidents, presidents, during the administration should be out there doing that. Senator Warren, on the other hand, has said: I don't know. I mean I'd have to go back and look at the details.
The Republican plan, however, changes the way premium subsidies are calculated: they would be distributed by age, instead of income.
Here's why the prongs are crucial to the effort to roll back Obamacare: Republicans have chosen to pass their health reform bill using a special budget procedure that limits the policy changes they can make. That means that many of their key policy promises made over the past few years — and even days — can't be achieved in the bill.
The worry now among advocates for lower-income Americans and the sick is that the Trump administration might seek to undermine the health care law through administrative steps. For example, officials could seek to reduce subsidies that help people earning just above the federal poverty line pay for out-of-pocket costs. Republicans in the House sued the Obama administration in 2014 to block those subsidies. That case is still pending, and the Trump administration could decide to stop defending the subsidies. Such a move would only compound the mistakes it made by trying to rush a half-baked bill through the House.

Mr. Trump promoted the small-business health plans as a way to save people from the nightmare of Obamacare. He told small-business owners in June that you're going to save massive amounts of money and have much better health care.
Obamacare looks the way it does because it has to: You can't cover Americans with pre-existing conditions without requiring healthy people to sign up, and you can't do that without subsidies to make insurance affordable.

He continued: If we can't puncture some of the mythology around austerity, politics or tax cuts or the mythology that's been built up around the Reagan revolution, where somehow people genuinely think that he slashed government and slashed the deficit and that the recovery was because of all these massive tax cuts, as opposed to a shift in interest-rate policy — if we can't describe that effectively, then we're doomed to keep on making more and more mistakes.
At three congressional hearings in 36 hours this week, Mr. Azar also explained his portion of Mr. Trump's budget, which seeks $1.1 trillion for the Department of Health and Human Services in the fiscal year that starts on Oct. 1.
And he actually does much worse in general among those voters who describe themselves as very conservative. Now, we all have a distorted picture of this because of some obvious aspects of Trump, the Trump's racial politics, and Trump's nationalism, being the key aspect to this. But then also, because over the course of his presidency it was the very conservatives who became his strongest supporters, and the Republicans who defected, or became lukewarm supporters, were the moderate Republicans. But that wasn't the way it was all through 2016. And to get back to the question you're raising, it does strike me that a lot of the people who are trying to be Trumpist candidates, for the post-Trump party, whether it's Senator Cotton or Hawley or Cruz or Rubio. They seem to be under the impression that you can build a successful intra-party coalition from the right, in. And maybe they're right. They're professional politicians and I'm not. But even with the bizarre campaign of 2016, it has not worked for any post-1984 Republican presidential candidate.
JD: Do you think it's better, then, that the Senate finish a trial as early as possible next year?
I think what's propelling Donald Trump's success more than anything is the feeling of many Americans that our politics are totally stuck. There is an overwhelming sense of stuckness — and the fantasy that Trump plays to, and plays up, is that he can pull the sword from the stone and do deals. No one was more responsible for this stuckness, though, than today's Republican Party. When Mitch McConnell, the G.O.P. leader in the Senate, said in October 2010 that the single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president, he described the Republicans' dominant strategy since 2008. The party stopped thinking seriously about market-based alternatives. Into that emptiness entered Trump, like an invasive species.
Climate change: New near-term targets, but no fracking ban
The new sign-ups — an increase of 400,000 over a similar point last year — mean the health care coverage of millions of consumers could be imperiled by one of the first legislative actions of Donald J. Trump's presidency. Hundreds of thousands of other people who took no action will be automatically re-enrolled by the federal government in the same or similar plans, officials said, and their coverage could be threatened as well. Consumers still have until the end of January to enroll.
Well, I'll start with 43 million Americans who are dealing with student loan debt. And not all of them are having trouble, but a whole, whole bunch of them are. Or how about the parents of 12 million children who are struggling to find child care? And I'm not just talking about one narrow slice. I'm talking about a whole bunch of parents across a wide range of ZIP codes and income categories who are struggling. I'm talking about the 36 million Americans last year who didn't have prescriptions filled because they simply couldn't afford it. Or the 35 million Americans who didn't go have a lump checked out at the doctor, or some other medical condition, because they were afraid they couldn't afford the — and these are people, most of them, many of them, with insurance, right? Couldn't afford the co-pay, couldn't afford the deductible. I think people are feeling this in their lives right now. And what is the spark, which is what I hear your question to be? It's you show them a path out. It doesn't have to be this way. Can I just say, the first time I think I came to The New York Times was during the financial crisis.

Ronny L. Jackson, the veterans affairs nominee, certainly looks good on TV, as we saw when he gave Trump an excellent bill of health, including a declaration that the president, while overweight, is just shy of being officially obese — thanks to having apparently grown an inch in office.
Even before President-elect Donald J. Trump is sworn in on Jan. 20, giving their party full control of the government, Republicans plan quick action on several of their top priorities — most notably a measure to clear a path for the Affordable Care Act's repeal. Perhaps the first thing that will happen in the new Congress is the push for deregulation. Also up early: filling a long-vacant Supreme Court seat, which is sure to set off a pitched showdown, and starting confirmation hearings for Mr. Trump's cabinet nominees.

Yeah. I think we need to bring our combat troops home.
President-elect Donald J. Trump demanded on Tuesday that Congress immediately repeal the Affordable Care Act and pass another health law quickly. His remarks put Republicans in the nearly impossible position of having only weeks to replace a health law that took nearly two years to pass.
If your monthly income is low enough to qualify for Medicaid but you expect your annual income to be higher than the above income thresholds, you could also choose to buy an Obamacare marketplace plan, probably with substantial subsidies. See below.
No, but I think this is important.
That's right. It was less of a thank you to Democrats than a punishment for Republicans, that Democrats never got the political boost back in 2010, 2012, 2014 that they hoped they would get for passing a big new social benefit. But what they did ultimately get was the benefit of voters turning against Republicans who wanted to take those benefits away. So Obamacare as a term, as a law, still kind of a mixed bag politically, but there are elements in that law, like protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions, that are enormously popular. And Republicans look back on the last campaign, the one that ended really rather badly for them, and see that as, more than anything else, the fatal political mistake they made.
Look, this is very personal to me. When my wife and daughter were killed in an automobile accident, my two boys were really very badly injured, I couldn't imagine what it'd be like if I had not had adequate healthcare immediately. I had prostate cancer recently, as you may know, and it's why I was a little late getting in the race. The same week my kid had her appendectomy out, and I feel very strongly that families ought to be able to have this choice.
That contrasts with how other tech chief executives have addressed crises at their firms.
Yeah, I'm not sure if that's true either. I mean, I do think that he's able to take certain extremely fringe ideas and mainstream them. But, yeah, we shouldn't forget about the fact that he is extremely unpopular.
But he made clear to associates in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack that he viewed Mr. Trump's actions around the riot as impeachable and saw a Senate trial as an opportunity to purge him from the party. In a letter to colleagues, Mr. McConnell signaled that he was open to conviction. And then last week, he flatly said the president had provoked the mob that sent the vice president and lawmakers fleeing. They were striking moves for Mr. McConnell, who for four years consistently supported and enabled Mr. Trump. But in the wake of the mob assault and a pair of Senate losses in Georgia, Mr. McConnell had come to view the former president as a dangerous political liability. In the week since Mr. Trump decamped to his private club in Florida, it has become increasingly clear that his departure has done little to loosen his grip on rank-and-file Republicans in Congress. While few have defended his conduct, many fewer have dared to back the impeachment push. The 10 House Republicans who did join Democrats in voting to impeach him faced fierce backlash.

Trump accused the moderators of siding with Clinton. They did only in the sense that refs call out a boxer who's cheating. He seems angry. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
Democrats have also failed to build a strong bench of candidates. This year, Democrats did not even field a candidate in some districts. In others, the Democratic candidate seems too weak to create a competitive race. The Republican group that oversees its House campaigns recently chortled about the Democrats' embarrassing recruiting failures and primary losses for their chosen candidates.

The outcome would've been very different. Right. When the policeman, Sgt. Crowley, and I met, I said, Why did you arrest me? He said, I was afraid that I wasn't going to be able to go home to my wife, because I was convinced that your partner was upstairs and he was going to come down and blow me away. He told me he had gotten a call: Two black guys are breaking into this house. One of them answers the door — me — when he rang the bell, and I'm stepping over suitcases, because I'd just come back from a trip. Unbeknown to me, one pattern of thievery is bringing empty suitcases to a house. So the officer saw a black face, he saw the suitcases: That's part of a profile. I was what Barbara Johnson calls an already-read text. He couldn't hear me, couldn't see me. Well, that might be related to police excesses and abuses, but it's a far end of the scale, and I was able to reverse what happened to me, unlike an Eric Garner. So my whole reaction to my arrest was determined by two things: The attacks on President Obama and my own determination not to claim too much for my own victimization.
United States troops have recently resumed counterterrorism operations in Syria, suggesting that President Trump intends to leave most of the 500 troops currently stationed there (many of them in combat). Mr. Trump has been inconsistent in his strategy on troops in Syria; Senator Warren has been firm in her stance that all combat troops should come home.

A 'bunch of kids' ran a major vaccination site for Philadelphia. Then the city cut its ties. The vaccination site at the Pennsylvania Convention Center in Philadelphia earlier this month. Credit... Kimberly Paynter/WHYY With pressure mounting to get Covid-19 vaccine doses into arms as quickly as possible, many overburdened city health departments across the country have turned to partnerships with hospitals, nonprofit organizations and pharmacies. In Philadelphia this week, one such deal went awry after the city leaned on a start-up led by college students who were eager to get involved but had little experience. The start-up is an organization called Philly Fighting Covid, which was founded last year by a 22-year-old graduate student, Andrei Doroshin. The group quickly won plaudits for volunteering to run free testing sites, and for using 3-D printers to make face shields that it supplied free to health care workers. So when Philadelphia began receiving shipments of vaccine and needed help administering doses on a large scale, the city health department turned to Philly Fighting Covid to operate what would be the largest vaccination site in the state, at the Pennsylvania Convention Center. It took less than three weeks after vaccinations began for the partnership to sour. Since it opened on Jan. 8, the site has vaccinated nearly 7,000 people, though there were reports in local media that appointments had been overbooked and some people were turned away.
These are times when the party was not able to contain the populist energies that emanated from its base. The Republican Party has had the same challenge, and we're almost distracted by Reaganism. If you told a history of the Republican Party now, you'd probably put Reagan at its center and sort of think about that as a rise and fall. But I think Reagan is better understood as a kind of detour from a history that is otherwise a story of a constant struggle between populism and conservatism — populism, inherently, a kind of bottom-up, democratic force. Conservatism is almost inherently elite driven, or at least elite minded. And the party has seen itself as a fight between these two for a very long time. Ronald Reagan was able to harness the energy of the Republican populist base in ways that I think were quite constructive and that were also a decent fit for what the more elite-minded conservative side of the party wanted to do. And so it was able to put this fight to the side for a little while, or at least to kind of take over its form, its shape. That also had to do, I think, with the rise of supply-side economics, which actually began as a populist response to more elite-minded, libertarian kind of fiscal consciousness. It's a little hard to remember now, but it was very much that. And Reagan, in a lot of ways, was a populist figure.
The bot introduces you to some interesting characters. Take the Floridian white man in his 40s who recently sprouted onto our feed. He says he's conservative, but doesn't feel like he fits with either party. He thinks women should always have the right to choose when to have an abortion, is pro-Obamacare, and wants the federal minimum wage to be $12 an hour. But curiously enough, he's a Trump voter. Why? Well, he opposes the Clean Air Act — might he have a job in a fossil fuel industry and feel threatened by Democrats' quick embrace of radical environmental policy in light of climate change?
KK: Senator, a number of your opponents have proposed in various ways either new entitlements or other programs that would give cash directly to low-income families.
This syndrome demands an explanation, and I'll get there eventually. Before I do, however, let's document the things that make G.O.P. health care lies unique.
Democrats are on average more responsive to their less affluent constituents than they are to their more affluent constituents, while for Republicans the reverse is true.
Treatment for any injury incurred while the patient was intoxicated
So one way to understand why the leadership of the Culinary Union is fighting so hard against Medicare-for-all proposals is to look back to the 1990s.
O.K., well, what is the response to this announcement?
BA: What is the specific standard that you would apply in antitrust? Right now we basically have a consumer pricing setup.
AK: But the Obama administration tried, past presidents have tried — how would you do it?
There is, according to the center's report,
It's not totally clear that Texans who buy their own coverage are actually paying more, either. In Texas, 91 percent of Obamacare enrollees receive federal subsidies that lower the cost of their monthly premiums, and 59 percent get financial help that reduces their deductibles and co-payments.
Mr. Doroshin attributed those problems to issues with an online sign-up system that allowed thousands of ineligible people to register for appointments. Then on Tuesday, the city health commissioner, Thomas Farley, said at a news conference that the health department would no longer work with Philly Fighting Covid. The city learned, he said, that the group had unexpectedly canceled its testing efforts to focus on vaccination; that it planned to change from nonprofit status to a for-profit company; and that it had changed its data privacy policy to allow it to potentially sell data about patients to third parties, a step first reported by the public radio station WHYY. We did not think that was appropriate, Dr. Farley said about the data policy. We thought, 'If there's any attempt to do this, even the possibility, then people won't trust this organization.' In an interview, Mr. Doroshin said his group had only the best intentions, but he acknowledged its inexperience. We're a bunch of kids, Mr. Doroshin said. I didn't know anything about legal structure before this. I didn't care. I'm not a lawyer, I'm a nerd. People are trying to make me out to be this nefarious thing. I'm like, 'Dude, I didn't know all the rules of a nonprofit organization until I did this.' He said that the company had decided to switch to a for-profit structure in order to expand quickly, and that it had not hid its intentions from the city.
I think the idea has always been pretty politically controversial. There are a couple of different threads of it. One is that industry doesn't like it. So doctors are the kind of most vocal group in this period. But over time, we also have hospitals, and drug companies, and other parts of the health care industry that are wary of the government getting involved and maybe taking their dollars away from them. I think also, especially in this period, there is a real resistance to socialism and this idea that it's not American to have the government providing these basic benefits, that the free market should work to do it instead.
You should send me the link to that AEI project, and I'll put it in the show notes here. But now that I've got you recommending AEI projects, I think it's a good time to move to the final section here, Recommendation Engine. So I'm going to throw a couple recommendation questions at you. You can always skip, but I'm interested to hear what you come up with. So I'll start with this. What is your favorite conservative movie?
No. I thought you were talking about undocumented workers.
Short-term is getting longer! one insurance marketing company advised clients this week.
But that's not even close to all there is. The states also argue that if the individual mandate is unconstitutional, the rest of the A.C.A. must fall, too. They audaciously claim that the mandate is too central to the act for the rest of it — including provisions as disparate as requiring restaurant owners to post calorie counts and expanding drug coverage under Medicare — to operate without it.
The way I think we get something done in Washington, it's the Frances Perkins story. It's not enough to organize on the outside and have the marches in the street. Before the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire, there had been dozens of marches, right? Lots of high profile. But the guys who ran the factories figured out it was a lot cheaper just to grease palms in Albany than it was to actually change their practices and put up adequate fire escapes and fire preventive measures. So just pushing from the outside, it's not enough to get it done. Just fighting it from the inside is not enough to get it done. But the one-two punch of pushing from the outside and leading it from the inside is where you see real difference.
I was against the war in Iraq. Yes, after the war became unpopular, Trump became against it from the beginning. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
And so, where the Republican Party is going right now is a mush. Do you think that's right?
MC: So as you're out there trying to convince people to join you on this mission, at certain times, and certainly in the debates it's come up that people who do not embrace your path lack the political courage or will, or they're scared, as you've said, to embrace big change. Now, certainly this will appeal to a lot of Democratic voters, but there are also a lot of more moderate swing voters, Democratic voters who will be put off by the idea that just because they don't embrace your particular policies, they somehow are not courageous or that they're wrong in their ideas. So how do you reach out to these people, because you can't win the nomination just with the progressive base. You've got to kind of convince these people who are nervous about the big ideas. For instance, Medicare for all that you're pitching is not a overwhelmingly popular idea.
Along with a slow and steady course on oversight — no impeachment talk, please! — the speaker is pressing a policy agenda more evolutionary than revolutionary. Democrats dominated the midterms, she said, with a simple message of better health care, better jobs and less swampy politics. We did not engage in some of the other exuberances that exist in our party.
I don't know what happened to the Lindsey Graham that I knew, because he hasn't been showing up lately.
If it is sold like any other product, people with pre-existing or chronic conditions will be turned down or will not be able to afford it. If exceptions are made, insurance companies will struggle to make a profit. None of the ideas being trotted out for the replace portion of the repeal and replace have much effect on the basic problem. This is not to say Obamacare is great; it isn't. As one example, the penalty for not buying insurance was much too low. However, the idea of repealing before knowing exactly what will replace it is a recipe for chaos for everyone involved.
What about the idea that anti-poverty programs create a poverty trap, reducing the incentive for people to work their way to a better life? That's a very popular notion on the right. But the reality is that there are very few Americans getting food stamps or Medicaid who could and should be working but aren't.
You almost got the restaurant analogy right, but not quite. The actual analogy is that patients are diners who are given a menu with no prices on it. You don't know the cost or value of what you're buying. Doctors know the more they order for you, the more money they make. You don't really care because you think your insurance company is going to pay for it.
It doesn't go to a doctor making $1 million a year who also has $1 million in student loan debt.
The chief sponsor of the bill, Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington, said it would cure a deep sickness within our for-profit system of health care.
But at the very moment he was called upon to teach the American people of the value of their republican Constitution, Chief Justice Roberts asserted the judicial restraint of the democratic constitution and turned them away. And that, my friends, was the end of our constitutional moment. That was the beginning of the end of constitutional conservatism as a political movement. And it kindled the resentment and populism that led to Donald Trump.
Elizabeth Warren, in her interview with the Times editorial board [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] on Dec. 4, largely stuck to her polished script — which the senior senator from Massachusetts said she has delivered 175 times — calling for big structural change to right the imbalances in the current American economy and end what she sees as endemic corruption in business and politics. She famously has a plan for that and had a (lengthy) answer for nearly every question.
If people participate in different numbers, in bigger numbers, if it changes the type of people who want to participate in the spring election that's not necessarily always seen the biggest turnout, that changes who can win.
I will say, so in the second part of your argument about the importance of gender pronouns for people who feel that it very strongly represents them, I think that that universalizing they could well be used as a way to kind of — I heard from people in comments, for example, that they felt that this could lead to something like a erasure for them. And I think that is a danger. I mean, the way that I — the thing that I come back to though is that when people use they, they are very consciously using it as a neutral pronoun. And I don't think that — I think that there would be instances where you might have it used in this trolly way. But that happens with all language. The more pernicious thing you notice all the time is people deliberately misgendering others — and then kind of inadvertently because you don't know or you don't know how to say it. And for those things, I think they takes care of it. You know, one thing I worried about in writing this, and I think it was one of the main criticisms from the left and especially for trans and non-binary people, is that what I was doing here was a kind of appropriation of what they need to do, me doing it from a position of privilege, and that I'm a cisgender man and don't really have a need for this pronoun.
Mr. Trump's allies said his stewardship of the economy, even after the pandemic, was his greatest legacy, an opinion shared by his aides who put together a list of about 1,000 accomplishments that has subsequently been scrubbed from the White House website.
After the law passed forcing insurers to accept anyone without raising premiums, Mr. Dailey was able to enroll in a Blue Cross plan in Texas, which covered his medical care that at times approached $200,000 a year. His income was low enough that he also qualified for generous federal subsidies under the law that kept his monthly premiums at no more than $235, and his out-of-pocket costs capped at around $1,000 a year.
We share the same goal, universal health care for every single American, Mrs. Clinton said of her rival Mr. Sanders. But we have a real difference about how to get there.
Right. So I've identified pay-fors, and I lay out that if you want, you can get into it, and you've got a three-year period to be able to do it at a deeply subsidized price or at no price at all.
While President Obama himself didn't personally appear in court to defend the Affordable Care Act, the legal challenges hurled at the legislation demanded years of government and legal resources, not to mention public attention — so the legal dimension of the health care fight can't be discounted.
Yet none of those went as viral as a 26-minute video called Plandemic, a slickly produced narration that wrongly claimed a shadowy cabal of elites was using the virus and a potential vaccine to profit and gain power. The video featured a discredited scientist, Judy Mikovits, who said her research about the harm from vaccines had been buried.

Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, another moderate, had similar thoughts. I'm here getting votes, Ms. Klobuchar said in an interview on Sunday. It's not something where I can just — what would be the word — transport in a bunch of ads. She called on Mr. Bloomberg to go on the shows that every other candidate goes on, on the Sunday shows and the like.
And it's even more naïve now than it was a few decades ago, because, as Irwin points out, large economic players are dominating more and more of the economy. It's increasingly clear, for example, that monopsony power is depressing wages; but that's not all it does. Concentration of hiring among a few firms, plus things like noncompete clauses and tacit collusion that reinforce their market power, don't just reduce your wage if you're hired. They also reduce or eliminate your options if you're mistreated: quit because you have an abusive boss or have problems with company policy, and you may have real trouble getting a new job.
Kushner also exemplifies the degree to which Trump not only prizes the fresh eyes of people from outside of politics, which is sensible, but downright fetishizes them, which isn't. To the extent that the administration is staffed, it teems with government naïfs, and that has been apparent in the botched composition and rollout of executive orders and in the failed attempt to undo Obamacare.
Economists and other policy experts have long focused on this idea of carbon pricing. It can take the form of a carbon tax, as Nordhaus prefers. Or the pricing can be embedded in a system of permits known as cap-and-trade, as President Barack Obama and other Democrats proposed in their 2009 bill to address climate change. Either way, the underlying concept is simple. When a product becomes more expensive, people use less of it. Carbon pricing is an elegant mechanism by which market economics can work on behalf of the climate rather than against it.
In 2012, Massachusetts Democrats, worried about a tough fight against Republican Senator Scott Brown, coalesced around Ms. Warren, knocking her only primary challenger, an immigration attorney, Marisa DeFranco, off the ballot. Winning in November is more important to Democrats than standing behind one woman who wanted to challenge another one for the right to run for U.S. Senate, Boston Globe columnist Joan Vennochi wrote at the time. Whether Ms. Warren could beat Mr. Brown, the incumbent, was more of a tossup, though by late summer 2012 most polls had her ahead.
And so, let's think about this also in terms of like — I mean if we're talking about the value of work. I mean, one of the harms of unemployment, or prolonged spells of unemployment, involuntary unemployment is what I'm talking about here, is its effect on kids and not just the material effect on them. Although that's obviously an important severe one, but also I do think it is good for kids to see their parents making a living and setting that example. It's not the only important thing in the world. It's not always something that has to happen. It depends on the particular situation and the trade offs that a particular household confronts and we can and should do some things to make it easier for households to negotiate these things.
But Mr. Powell made clear that this was an intentionally small step. He said the move was not the beginning of a long series of rate cuts, disappointing those who either wanted a bigger rate cut or the hint of future reductions this year.
You should send me the link to that AEI project, and I'll put it in the show notes here.

Medicare for all has created deep divisions on the left, particularly over questions like: How much would it really cost? Is Senator Warren's plan for raising the money for it progressive enough? Is it politically prudent to debate the issue now?
And Evers knows that state law does not allow him to kind of unilaterally make huge changes in how Wisconsin runs the election.
Since that day, as Trump's presidency has confirmed many of her fears, Gabriel has transformed her life. She used to be at home most nights, watching TV. Now she goes to political meetings three or four evenings a week, sometimes with Abby in tow. I could go every night — there's always something going on, she told me. Besides volunteering on local Democratic campaigns, she's working to coordinate volunteers across campaigns, to make sure they're deployed to the candidates who most need help.
I think you're overlooking the places where we're not divided. I have three brothers back in Oklahoma. One is a Democrat. Do the math, the other two are not. And yet, all three of my brothers and tens of millions of people around this country get furious over the fact that Amazon reports $11 billion in profits last year and paid zero in taxes. All three of my brothers understand that we have an America that works great for giant drug companies, just not for people trying to fill a prescription. Works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for people who are worried about climate change.
If Mr. Trump and Mr. Price can make peace with the health law, there are opportunities to steer it in a more conservative direction. The law gives broad authority to the executive branch to shape health care policy. So far, the health law has been driven by Obama administration priorities, but that could change.
The administration may not use amounts collected for the Treasury to make payments to insurance companies, said the ruling, signed by Susan A. Poling, the general counsel of the G.A.O.
He also moved to reinstitute coverage mandates that former President Donald Trump had undermined, including those for people with certain medical conditions. And he rolled back Trump-era restrictions on Medicaid and took steps to restore federal support to clinics that counsel patients on abortion.
But I take your question seriously. The place I might be most likely to fail is to get only part. Now, part's better than none, right? But only part. And that's a deeply worrisome thought.
A Senate no longer in the Republican grip could rescue women's reproductive rights on multiple fronts: maternity coverage, access to contraception, teen-pregnancy prevention, breast-cancer treatment. It could protect us from planned eviscerations of Social Security and Medicare, and stop the gutting of Obamacare, the greenlighting of partisan gerrymandering, and the enshrining of an ethically shameless kleptocracy. It would thwart the authoritarian dream of seamless one-party rule across all three branches of government. Even a threat of leaving would send a salutary shock through the party.
So let me do both of these, because I think there are two answers. There are two pieces in this answer. One is, I think attacking the corruption in Washington brings a lot more people together than most folks recognize, and that it really does reach across party lines.
Opinion: Michelle Goldberg writes that Mr. Epstein's case reveals a deep corruption among mostly male elites across parties, and the way the very rich can often purchase impunity for even the most loathsome of crimes.
These tensions lasted well into the New Deal, the crowning years of America's enthusiasm for reform. New Dealers held on to progressive ideas while sloughing off some of the moralizing. Over time, though, their economic policies ushered in what the historian Alan Brinkley has described, in the title of a 1995 book, as The End of Reform. The New Deal, he wrote, grew from a complex tradition of progressive reform, then attached the word 'liberalism' to it, and set about transforming it. The new liberals ultimately pinned their hopes on economic growth and Keynesian tinkering, not the trickier task of actively redistributing wealth and power. Over the decades that followed, they would orient themselves increasingly toward civil and social rights rather than sweeping economic reform, a subtle but important shift.
In an era of growing income and wealth inequality, Obamacare was a starkly redistributive law. Not only did it subsidize health insurance for those with low and middle incomes, but it also raised taxes on high earners. This mix of policies made the law controversial, but it also furthered the Obama administration's goals of narrowing the gap between rich and poor Americans.

Peter Thiel, an early Facebook investor, called Senator Warren dangerous, to which Senator Warren responded good. Mr. Zuckerberg said a Warren presidency would suck for the company, according to audio leaked and reported in The Verge.
Some conservatives were still concerned that the bill was too costly and did not do enough to roll back federal health insurance mandates. Moderates and others, meanwhile, were grappling with worries of their states' governors and fretted that the loss of benefits would be too much for their constituents to bear.
That said, we can and should acknowledge that this bill is, as Biden once said of Obamacare, a very big deal for the country. And we can marvel, at least a little, at the trajectory of his political career, as this consummate centrist and proud bipartisan dealmaker begins to move in somewhat unexpected directions.
Now successful is a relative term: Our president is still deeply unpopular, still under investigation and embroiled in scandal, still unable to push a substantial agenda through the Congress, still likely to see his party lose the House of the Representatives in November.
We understand the Redemption era now as a white response to the gains black people made during Reconstruction. Is it too simplistic to say that the energy driving the current moment is also a reaction to black progress and Obama's becoming president? I've spent a lot of time thinking about your question, and I don't know the answer. If we're sitting around in a bar with a bunch of black people, they could say, Barack and Michelle drove all the white people totally out of their minds. I think that's partly true. The other thing, though, is that between Martin Luther King's death and now, the black middle class has doubled and the black upper-middle class has quadrupled. But simultaneously, if you look at the wages of white workers — the chance of your kids doing better than you if you were in the white working class, that's over. So you might look at a black family in the White House, all these black people who joined the upper-middle class, and there's a kind of collective What the [expletive]?
And when something becomes inevitable, and it seems inevitable this is never going to happen, it's very hard to keep the issue alive. So who knows? I think probably the safe bet here is that McConnell, even if it was only three votes he had to keep in line, he would have found a way to keep them in line. But there is a big difference in the group dynamics when you have that majority threshold versus a supermajority threshold. [MUSIC PLAYING]

Trade wars are good, and easy to win. So declared Donald Trump a few weeks ago, after announcing tariffs on steel and aluminum. Actually, trade wars are rarely good, and not at all easy to win — especially if you have no idea what you're doing. And boy, do these people not know what they're doing.
Ads that ran in Texas media markets
MC: —— that requires you to pass comprehensive immigration reform.
And so that had already happened by that point. We have not had something like a Souter in a long time. Whatever people say about John Roberts, who's not gone as far as some of the crazier conservatives would like him to go, he's a quite conservative justice, who has done exactly what he was expected to do. And so, by the time you get to Merrick Garland and Mitch McConnell, you're operating in this weird mismatch between this idea that a vote for a Supreme Court justice should depend on whether they are qualified, not whether or not they are ideological, and this reality that ideological parties have constructed an ideological vetting system to get highly ideological justices to give them lifetime appointments to one of the most powerful bodies in the land. And yet, as we expect them to vote ideologically on everything else, we were still expecting somehow the other party to treat this one vote different. And Mitch McConnell just comes along and says, there is nothing different about this. We do not want Democrats to take over the Supreme Court with a more liberal justice. And so we will not let them. He didn't invent a new power. He just treated it like an ideological vote. And it feels to me that so much of the Senate is like that, that we have rules built, traditions built, norms built.
It's true that some Republican lawmakers have cobbled together proposals of varying degrees of specificity over the year: During his 2016 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida sketched out a mostly forgotten health care plan that would have set up a broad-based system of refundable tax credits intended to subsidize the purchase of insurance in hopes of helping people buy coverage. And during the 2017 Obamacare repeal effort, Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy offered a plan to give states far more flexibility, eliminating many of Obamacare's provisions at the national level while essentially turning the program into a block grant to the states.
I think it tells you that a lot of G.O.P. elected officials still have this sense that the bigoted strain in Trumpism can just sort of go away when Trump does.
MC: And nobody does well at this question.
Critics of the wealth tax point out that only four European countries now have one, down from 12 in 1990. In France, the wealth tax triggered an exodus of the ultrarich and didn't raise as much revenue as anticipated.
The 156 million Americans who get coverage through an employer, as well as the roughly 15 million enrolled in Obamacare and other plans in the individual insurance market, are protected from caps that insurers and employers used to limit how much they had to pay out in coverage each year or over a lifetime. Before the A.C.A., people with conditions like cancer or hemophilia that were very expensive to treat often faced enormous out-of-pocket costs once their medical bills reached these caps.
LK: And a growing concern during the Trump era about violence. And I'm just wondering how you would address that, if that is in fact something that's not going to go away once the Trump era ends, which I think is a safe assumption.
Idaho's new state-based health benefit plans will have to carry a disclaimer: The policy is not fully compliant with federal health insurance requirements.
In contrast, in the Republican formulation, the size of the tax credits is coupled only to the age of the recipient; older Americans get more, on the principle that the cost of insurance is higher for those of more advanced years.
I mean, I feel like I see in my children a response to society in sort of everything they do. I mean, they're incredibly molded by their friends, by what they hear in school, by us parents. And my worry is not for them at their age right now. As I said, they're eight and six. It's like how they think about gender and the role of gender, and how they think about, especially, their preferences and their interests, how those are shaped by society at large. At an early age, they're being pushed in these directions that I don't know accurately reflects how they would live in another kind of society. This is all just a little bit academic though. Because changing pronouns or just my writing a column about changing pronouns isn't going to effect any of this. But it's the larger backdrop to my feeling that the importance that we put on gender and the kind of almost invisible role in our day-to-day lives that gender plays on what we do is just too high. And much of my desire in writing this or in talking about pronouns is to just point out how stifling some of this can be.

The largest group of people to be affected by the Republican plan would be those with Medicaid coverage. Most of the declines would start in 2020, when the changes to the program would take effect.
Senator Warren said in an interview with Vox's Ezra Klein that many other economic policies should be accomplished before the government starts sending out checks to every American, as Mr. Yang's Freedom Dividend proposes.
On my way to work each morning, I pass a building with the inscription: The highest attainable standard of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being. If Harvard believes this, why is the administration asking dining hall workers to pay even more for our health care even though some of us pay as much as $4,000 a year in premiums alone?
ROBERT S. NUSSBAUM, Fort Lee, N.J.
But the main split, Brill says, isn't Democrats versus Republicans; it's the protected versus the unprotected, or the self-preservationist elite versus everyone else. He dates the beginning of the tailspin to the 1960s, when school reformers set out to replace the old-boy aristocracy with a system more open, more fair, more meritocratic.
So just make the brief case for us about why you think it's important for us to start using they on an everyday basis more often and he or she less often.
I cynically said, and also good for Lindsey Graham's re-election.
I think Robert Bork narrowed the standards we use for antitrust and for breaking up big companies. Market dominance by itself, when you totally dominate a market, that is anti-competitive. Then the platforms — this new — you want to go to the new part. The platforms themselves create a new kind of problem that we haven't seen. We can only do this by analogy, which is what we always do in law, but think of it this way. There's Amazon that owns the marketplace where people go and buy toasters and sell toasters, but they also are scraping bits of information off every one of those purchases. When they decide that your toaster business is getting very profitable, and they might like to crowd in on that, they take all that information they took from you without your consent and they go into the 2.0 version of your toaster business and move you back to page seven on the search.
The guy is president of the United States. This stuff is coming at him at Mach 2 and 3. He feels completely under siege from the Mueller stuff. And he is trying to navigate all the things that come with being Donald Trump. But there is a side to him that — I'm pulling for him now. Does that make sense?
President-elect Donald Trump and other Republican leaders may be determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act immediately, but a few more sensible members of the party are now trying to slow down this runaway train. They recognize the danger in destroying a program that directly benefits 22 million Americans — and indirectly millions more by controlling costs — without a plan to replace it.
Mr. Azar did announce one policy that is likely to help consumers and insurers. He said the administration would, in effect, allow insurers to continue shifting certain costs to the federal government — because officials did not have time to issue rules banning the practice in 2019.

A 2017 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that generic competition has weakened in recent decades, leading to higher prices for generics. EpiPen and insulin prices, in particular, have skyrocketed. Senator Warren's Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would authorize the government to manufacture active ingredients for medications or contract outside entities to manufacture generic drugs and lower prices. But Senator McConnell has railed against socialist price controls in the health care system.
Some of the leading 2020 Democratic presidential candidates didn't help their cause in the June debates by taking a series of unpopular positions, such as banning private health insurance, providing insurance to the undocumented, and decriminalizing border entry. They're giving Trump and the Republicans plenty to work with.
Trump ha dicho que no le gusta la palabra mandato, utilizada para definir el Obamacare, porque eso significa que es obligatorio.
KK: But this isn't expanding the arsenal at all. These are existing weapons that may or may not be in southern Turkey.
At this point, the Democratic presidential nomination is very much up in the air. Not only is it unclear who will be the nominee; it's unclear whether the nominee will be a centrist like Joe Biden or Amy Klobuchar, or a representative of the party's left like Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren. Whoever wins, there will be much wailing and gnashing of teeth from the other side.
It seems a simple enough proposition: Give people the choice to buy into Medicare, the popular federal insurance program for those over 65.
It is possible that regulators could devise a new way to calculate the subsidies. But in my conversations with several experts on the law, no one was quite sure how. When Congress considered repealing the Affordable Care Act last year, most of the plans changed rather than eliminated those subsidies. Taking them away altogether would mean millions fewer people would have health insurance, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. Severino, who attained prominence as a social conservative before joining the Trump administration, said that health providers were still free to adopt their own gender identity policies, as were health insurers.
And when the loss of economic opportunity led, as it usually does, to social dysfunction — to broken families and despair — all too many whites were ready to blame the victims. The problem, many asserted, lay in black culture — or, some hinted, in racial inferiority.
I wrote the number down. I don't know if it's the right number. Let's try it. 202 —
There were no direct efforts to pressure or lobby Justice Kennedy to announce his resignation on Wednesday, and it was hardly the first time a president had done his best to create a court opening. In the past half-century, presidents have repeatedly been dying to take advantage of timely vacancies, said Laura Kalman, a historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
No, but look. All right, so what do you want to do? You want just give up? Say, Aw, gee, Mitch McConnell ….  Let's go get the begging bowl and say give me a crumb or two, and I will say thank you. That's what it means now to be a Democrat to the party in opposition.
That's what makes it all the more surprising that his administration decided to dive right back into one of the most politically damaging fights of his whole presidency, which is health care.
KK: Should it be against the law for the children of sitting presidents and vice presidents to serve on the boards of foreign companies or otherwise profit from their parents' service?
The Justice Department's argument is based on an established legal principle called severability, under which courts ask whether if one provision of a statute is struck down, the rest should fall with it. But in this case, the Justice Department gets that principle exactly backward. An unbroken line of Supreme Court cases makes clear that the touchstone of severability is congressional intent. In a decision handed down by the Supreme Court just months ago, Justice Samuel Alito explained — quoting a long-established precedent for severability — that for a court to conclude that other provisions of a statute must fall, it must be clear that Congress would not have enacted those provisions which are within its power, independently of those that are to be struck down. In other words, what would Congress have done had it known a provision of the statute would be eliminated?
I'll defend the Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the Trump administration. That I can do all by myself.
So the Republicans do not grant the governor his wish for a mail-in balloting system?
Well, I'll start with 43 million Americans who are dealing with student loan debt. And not all of them are having trouble, but a whole, whole bunch of them are. Or how about the parents of 12 million children who are struggling to find child care? And I'm not just talking about one narrow slice. I'm talking about a whole bunch of parents across a wide range of ZIP codes and income categories who are struggling. I'm talking about the 36 million Americans last year who didn't have prescriptions filled because they simply couldn't afford it. Or the 35 million Americans who didn't go have a lump checked out at the doctor, or some other medical condition, because they were afraid they couldn't afford the — and these are people, most of them, many of them, with insurance, right? Couldn't afford the co-pay, couldn't afford the deductible. I think people are feeling this in their lives right now. And what is the spark, which is what I hear your question to be? It's you show them a path out. It doesn't have to be this way. Can I just say, the first time I think I came to The New York Times was during the financial crisis.
The decline by itself isn't that meaningful, but several snapshots over previous months had shown that sign-ups were on track to overtake last year's enrollment. It was only in the final two weeks of enrollment, when there's typically a deadline-driven surge, that the numbers dropped. Fewer than 400,000 people signed up for Obamacare plans over the last two weeks. Last year, more than 700,000 people signed up in the last week alone.
And in the U.S., the death toll surpassed 10,000 people and congressional leaders began talks about a second economic relief package that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi predicted could cost more than $1 trillion.
Part two is again, we should be working more with our allies. Donald Trump seems to think somehow that we are stronger alone and I think that's fundamentally wrong. If you want to bring economic pressure on China, if you want to bring diplomatic pressure on China, it makes a lot more sense to do that if we're doing it with our allies, if we're doing it in conjunction with others. And I think that provides potentially much better protection for Hong Kong. The idea that this is going to be a direct military conflict between China and the United States, that would be deeply destabilizing to the entire world. So I want to see us use our diplomatic tools. I want to see us use our economic tools, and I want to see us leverage everything that we want to do by working much more tightly in conjunction with our allies. We just haven't been doing that. None of the above.
A lawsuit brought by several states imperils the health law's protections for people with pre-existing health conditions, the law's most popular provision. Recent polls show growing numbers of Americans rank health care as a top issue, and coverage for pre-existing conditions as an important policy.
Two Republican governors, John Kasich of Ohio and Rick Snyder of Michigan, have said that Congress ought to preserve parts of the law, like its expansion of Medicaid, which has improved care for the poor and reduced the heavy burden of charity care at hospitals. About 665,000 people in Ohio and 614,000 in Michigan gained coverage under Medicaid expansion as of December 2015, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.
Finally, patient expectations would have to transition. Today, getting a doctor's appointment is annoying but not onerous. In Canada, the median wait time between seeing a general practitioner and a specialist is 8.7 weeks; between a G.P. referral and an orthopedic surgeon, it's nine months. That would take some adjusting.
Donald Trump acaba de retirar a Estados Unidos del Acuerdo de París sin tener una buena razón. No digo que su decisión sea errónea. Lo que digo es que literalmente no nos dio ninguna justificación de peso que sustente esa decisión (bueno, sí mencionó algunas cifras sobre la supuesta pérdida de empleos, pero nadie cree que sepa, o le importe, de dónde sacó esos números). Solo fue algo que se le ocurrió.
Yeah. I think we need to bring our combat troops home.
In conversations with some unions, Senator Warren has dodged the question of how she would protect existing coverage. At a recent town hall with the Culinary Workers Union, for example, she said their health care is not supposed to change but sidestepped details.
But it seems like your case is not only about people who don't consider themselves gender binary. It's also for someone who says, I am a woman, or I am a man. You don't think it's necessary to have that part of their identity be front and center in a conversation constantly. Right?
Fighting corruption is, indeed, an issue with cross-party support. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last year, people ranked as the country's second most important issue reducing the influence of special interests and corruption in Washington.
People understand this is good for our economy. It's good for our worldwide security. If you're not willing to get out there and fight, nothing is going to change. And yeah, the fights have to be realistic. It's why I start everything with, Here's how I'm going to pay for it. You may not like how I did, but at least I laid it out there. You don't have any doubt, and I show you where every single nickel comes from because I want it to be realistic. I didn't start with free college. I started with a 2-cent wealth tax, because we can do a 2-cent wealth tax. I started with it and said, and here's how much revenue it produces. It produces a staggering amount of revenue, far more than raising income taxes, because that's what the wealth curve looks like.

Matt Gaetz rallied against Liz Cheney in her own state. Representative Matt Gaetz, Republican of Florida, has been campaigning to oust Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, from House G.O.P. leadership after she voted for former President Donald J. Trump's impeachment. Credit... Erin Scott/Reuters CHEYENNE, Wyo. — Representative Matt Gaetz of Florida took his campaign to remove Representative Liz Cheney from the House Republican leadership on the road on Thursday, telling several hundred people who gathered outside the Wyoming State Capitol that they were on the front lines of a battle against the party's entrenched interests. We can stop them, and it starts right here in Wyoming, Mr. Gaetz, a Republican, said to an enthusiastic, mostly maskless crowd where people waved signs and wore stickers that said Impeach Liz Cheney! One person waved a Confederate flag. And at least one came with an AR-15-style rifle slung over his shoulder. Supporters of former President Donald J. Trump have singled out Ms. Cheney, the third-ranking Republican in the House, for her vote to impeach the president earlier this month. Mr. Gaetz has been the most visible and vocal among them, declaring that he is waging a war for the soul of the Republican Party. Ms. Cheney's allies criticized Mr. Gaetz for holding the event in her home state, which they said was unnecessary and reckless, coming just three weeks after a mob of violent Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington to protest his electoral loss.
But on the other hand, we have other diplomatic initiatives and it's really important that we're trying to work with this country, and they're important to us strategically for this reason and we have this ongoing negotiation in that political thing. Drag your heels, drag your heels, drag your heels, until the jobs have disappeared here. And then once you go forward, you've got to go forward through a different kind of court that's much slower.
This comes on the heels of reports that Mr. Trump lacks anything resembling a conventional campaign apparatus. Benjy Sarlin, Katy Tur and Ali Vitali write at MSNBC that while most campaigns have staff members ready to respond quickly to criticisms, Mr. Trump has largely failed to build such a team. The campaign's meager response to the Trump University scandal, the writers explain, left the candidate to fill the vacuum with a torrent of demagoguery. According to one Republican strategist, no one is really allowed to speak on behalf of the candidate except the candidate.
Well, I'm actually not sure that's true for everyone. Sometimes people are here because they want to become Twitter celebrities, which I think has actually become a more common route in the Republican congressional conference. But you hit something there that I think is really deep that I want to focus on for a minute, which is, who controls the Republican Party? And I think if you talk to a liberal about this five years ago, 10 years ago, the model they have of the Republican Party is it is controlled by corporations, the Chamber of Commerce. That whatever those players want, they get. And I don't think that's entirely wrong even now. They got their tax cuts, even after Donald Trump ran as a quasi-populist. There was the Obamacare repeal effort. So the congressional wing of the Republican Party has still been pretty responsive there. But what that wing of the party wants is pretty different than what the base of the party wants. The base of the party does not want the kinds of immigration reforms the Chamber of Commerce wants. The base of the party does want a lot more cultural grievance fighting than the Chamber of Commerce wants. And I think a reasonable model of the Republican Party over the past 10 years is that those institutional players have not dissolved, but they're weakening. And the base is getting much more of what it wants and there's actually a pretty big conflict between what the two sides want.
President Obama has published an essay on Obamacare in The Journal of the American Medical Association. While it hit a lot of the Affordable Care Act's high points, it was also pretty frank that the health law has some weaknesses that need to be fixed. Margot Sanger-Katz and Reed Abelson, two New York Times reporters who have been covering Obamacare, discuss the policy changes that the president wants.
But now McCain is gone, and with him, as far as we can tell, the only Republican in Congress with anything resembling a spine. As a result, if Republicans hold Congress in November, they will indeed repeal Obamacare. That's not a guess: It's an explicit promise, made by Vice President Mike Pence last week.
That sure gets a lot done.

United States troops have recently resumed counterterrorism operations in Syria, suggesting that President Trump intends to leave most of the 500 troops currently stationed there (many of them in combat). Mr. Trump has been inconsistent in his strategy on troops in Syria; Senator Warren has been firm in her stance that all combat troops should come home.
So this could be what some Republican voters, especially moderate-ish Republican voters, are thinking when they imagine that Trump is more electable than his more ideologically conservative rivals. And if the pundits are all proven wrong one more time and Trump makes a real race of it, this will be the reason why.
The writer is emeritus professor of political science at York University.
The question is why such policies were ever popular. The answer, I think, is that in the past, voters didn't see the connections.
SS: Well, speaking of using leverage, you've argued that nations that want to trade with the United States should be held to higher standards.
It's a mistake to doubt the sincerity of Ms. Collins's and Ms. Murkowski's dedication to questions of women's health. Ms. Collins was one of only three Republican senators to vote against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act. Last year, she and Ms. Murkowski broke ranks to cast the deciding votes against defunding Planned Parenthood. And this year, the two senators again voted with the majority of Senate Democrats to oppose a ban of abortion after 20 weeks. Both have been solid defenders of family planning and birth control. Both have earned high ratings with pro-choice groups — Ms. Collins has been rated higher than 90 percent by groups like NARAL in multiple years. To cave on this particular issue would be a tragic abrogation of personal, as well as political, conviction. Which is why the Supreme Court battle may at last compel both women to abandon the party they should have abandoned already.

SS: The Obama administration tried that, Trump administration tried that in different ways, but no results. What kind of leverage would you use? What would you do?
Robert Bork was President Ronald Reagan's failed Supreme Court nominee in 1987. He wrote extensively on antitrust legislation and redefined it from a focus on helping small businesses to promoting economic efficiency, according to Barak Orbach, professor of law at the University of Arizona.
The law has also played an important role in keeping care affordable for the 160 million Americans who get coverage from an employer, including by requiring those plans to cover the children of beneficiaries until age 26.
After the total disaster of Trumpism, America needs and deserves the empathy, compassion and fair-mindedness that only a woman can bring to the Oval Office. While I would vote for a ham sandwich over Donald Trump, 2020 and beyond will be the era of powerful women with governing experience and the patience and understanding it takes to lead the nation.
With Nixon, it was the Southern Strategy, raising alarms about the dismantling of Jim Crow laws.

My guess, however, is that Trump's trade policy has been motivated less by any substantive goals than by the desire to look like a tough guy. And while establishment Republicans headed off any important changes in NAFTA, which would have been really bad for business — Trump basically took the existing agreement and stuck his name on it — they have been willing to indulge his posturing on other, less critical fronts.
Revenues caught up with the underlying risk of the population, said Kurt J. Wrobel, the chief actuary of the Geisinger Health Plan in Pennsylvania. With more experience, we can better estimate the expected cost of health claims.
Insurance markets stabilized after Mr. Trump tried to upend them. That does not necessarily mean that they are more stable because of his policies.
One note I want to put here is, we talk all the time in politics about liberal bias or conservative bias or partisan bias. And people really underestimate how dangerous status quo bias is. And particularly, this is very true in the Senate, that people get used to the way they have done things. And so the fact that the way they do things doesn't make any sense and has become an illogical, as you put it, Kafkaesque nightmare — as I put it in a column recently, a Dadaist nightmare — stops reading to them is clear. So I want to go back to something you were saying earlier. The Senate has a filibuster, which we are going to talk about here in some detail. But just as a shorthand right now, the filibuster says things require 60 votes. And there is a coterie of senators, including, at this point, Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, who say that is good. It forces bipartisanship. It's how the Senate should work. So you might say, OK, everybody's going to demand everything requires 60 votes. But then they vote for budget reconciliation, which end runs the filibuster in this weird way. Because I mean, of course, you can't really run a Senate where you can never get anything done. So the Senate exists, and this is, by the way, true of everybody. The two major legislative packages of the Trump era were budget reconciliation packages, the Tax Cuts, and Obamacare repeal.
The second change came more recently, when the Trump administration decided not to defend Obamacare from a lawsuit brought by the Republican attorneys general of 20 states. The lawsuit argues that the entire law should be invalidated as unconstitutional. The Trump administration's position is that most of the law should remain on the books, but that its protections for people with pre-existing illnesses should be stripped away.
Your opponent was famously anti-abortion and against Obamacare. Was your victory an embrace of your progressive agenda, or is this a case of a kind of out-of-step Democrat just losing?
The law very clearly directs the secretary of health and human services to deposit certain amounts in the Treasury, Ms. Poling said. The fact that H.H.S.'s collections ultimately fell short of the projected amounts does not alter the meaning of the statute, she added.
He sits at the nexus of an immensely influential but largely unseen network of conservative organizations, donors and lawyers who all share a common goal: Fill the federal courts with scores of judges who are committed to the narrow interpretation of the Constitution that they believe the founders intended.
A pre-existing condition may disqualify you
Once upon a time there was a program called Aid to Families With Dependent Children — the program people usually had in mind when they talked about welfare. It was originally intended to support white widows while they raised their children, and it was effectively denied to both Black and unwed mothers. Over time, however, these restrictions were eroded, and the program rapidly expanded from the early 1960s to the early 1970s.
MG: Sorry. You think it has — go ahead. I'll let you finish.
The G.O.P. plan would also limit funding for all enrollees by giving states a fixed sum per enrollee, rather than making an open-ended commitment to provide funding based on need.
Deductibles for individual coverage increased 63 percent on average, to $1,221 per year, from 2011 to 2016 for people who get health insurance through their employers, according to a report released last week by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust. Workers' contributions to premiums grew more slowly than in previous five-year periods but still jumped 23 percent, to $1,129 a year. By contrast, average incomes were up just 11 percent, which means many people are being forced to cut back elsewhere to pay for care. And some people are choosing to forgo or delay going to doctors and hospitals when they are sick.
So I start with trying to understand the problem, what it means that tens of millions of people don't have prescriptions filled, don't go to the doctor. People with health insurance who are being sued by their hospitals for medical bills. I think of this as offering the most help to the greatest number of people as quickly as possible. So in terms of priorities, day one, there's a lot a president could do all by herself, and I'll do it.
No, but look. All right, so what do you want to do? You want just give up? Say, Aw, gee, Mitch McConnell ….  Let's go get the begging bowl and say give me a crumb or two, and I will say thank you. That's what it means now to be a Democrat to the party in opposition.

After apparently seizing the state broadcaster, ZBC, two uniformed officers said in a short, predawn announcement that the situation in our country has moved to another level.
The amendment doesn't do anything to help that population in particular, but it adds a provision that would allow everyone to deduct more health care expenses from taxes. The change is intended as a placeholder, expected to cost about $85 billion over a decade, that could be turned by the Senate into targeted tax assistance for older insurance buyers, according to a Republican aide. What the Senate would do with the money is still unclear. But $85 billion would go only part of the way toward filling the gap between subsidies offered under this bill and the Affordable Care Act for older insurance shoppers.
The proposal would allow small business owners, their employees, sole proprietors and other self-employed people to join together as a single group to buy insurance in the large-group market. The new health plans could be exempt from some requirements of the Affordable Care Act. They would, for example, not have to provide certain essential health benefits like mental health care, emergency services, maternity and newborn care and prescription drugs.
It is possible that regulators could devise a new way to calculate the subsidies. But in my conversations with several experts on the law, no one was quite sure how. When Congress considered repealing the Affordable Care Act last year, most of the plans changed rather than eliminated those subsidies. Taking them away altogether would mean millions fewer people would have health insurance, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office.
Under Obamacare, Medicaid was available for Americans with low incomes whether they were employed or not. The Obama administration refused to allow work requirements, saying they were not consistent with the goals of Medicaid. Several Republican governors would like to give states the right to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients who have no young children and are not old or disabled. The Republicans' proposal would allow states to decide for themselves between the two systems.
The full impact of the executive orders will be hard to predict, but there is no doubt that they will damage health care markets and will harm the poor and the chronically ill.

Instead of the traditional closed-door selection process for vice president, with Donald Trump's ascendancy there is an opportunity to create an entertainment spectacle worthy of the Trump candidacy — a political version of The Celebrity Apprentice.
There is, unfortunately, no evidence to support this political theory; in particular, the promised surge in young voters failed to materialize on Super Tuesday. So Sandersism is looking more than a bit like Green Lanternism — a belief that political miracles can be achieved by sheer force of will.
There have been plenty of jaw-dropping digital moments during the coronavirus pandemic.
Last year, the average proposed rate increase for preferred provider organizations for the largest carrier was 14.5 percent. But the approved increase was 4.6 percent. Also, our customers who shopped saved an average of 5 percent on their premiums.
That warning came from Josep Maria Argimon, a health official in Catalonia, and he was referring not to food but to the dwindling supplies of something almost as precious: the coronavirus vaccine. On Wednesday, Spain became the first European country to partly suspend immunizations because of a lack of doses. It did so first in Madrid, for two weeks, and said that Catalonia, the northeastern region that includes Barcelona, could soon follow. It has not gone easily for the European Union since it approved its first vaccine in late December and rushed to begin a vast immunization campaign across its 27 member states. But the early problems have snowballed into a full-blown crisis. Countries across the bloc have felt the pain of vaccine shortages even as a new wave of the virus rages. The pandemic has prompted prolonged lockdowns in most member countries, and there is also anxiety over the spread of at least two highly infectious variants that are straining national health systems. It is unclear when the supply might improve. The bloc is also in an escalating dispute with AstraZeneca over the drug maker's announcement that it would cut deliveries by 60 percent because of production shortfalls. And Pfizer informed the European Union this month that it had to drastically cut its vaccine deliveries until mid-February while it upgraded its plants to ramp up output, adding to the supply problems.
In the months to come, I hope that every other 2020 candidate offers answers to the questions that Warren has taken on: How can corporate America again help create a prosperous, growing middle class, as it did from the 1940s through the 1970s? How can the power of giant corporations — over consumers, workers and smaller businesses — be constrained? How can the radical levels of wealth inequality be reversed? How can the yawning opportunity gaps for children of different backgrounds be reduced? How can the next president make changes that will endure, rather than be undone by a future president, as both Obama's and Clinton's top-end tax increases were?
But now that defenders of the law have asked the Supreme Court to settle the case quickly, the president's lawyers say they are in no particular hurry. The case, which seeks to invalidate the entire health care law, can wait for the lower courts to consider certain questions more carefully, they said in a filing to the Supreme Court on Friday. There is no present, real-world emergency, the brief says, that would require the court to rush the case's progress.
It seems a simple enough proposition: Give people the choice to buy into Medicare, the popular federal insurance program for those over 65.
Republicans in the State House of Representatives followed suit, offering a Covid-19 relief plan that would withhold $2.1 billion in federal funding meant to help schools cope with the pandemic until Ms. Whitmer relinquished her authority to shut down in-person learning and sports during a health crisis. That power would shift to local health departments under the Republican plan. The public — and pointed — rejections of the governor's appointments and authority come as Ms. Whitmer is preparing to run for re-election in 2022. No top-tier Republican has come forward to challenge her. Forced to speak remotely instead of in front of both chambers of the Legislature because of pandemic protocols, Ms. Whitmer offered plans to fix roads, provide extra hazard pay to teachers and allocate state resources to help residents who have lost their jobs during the pandemic find employment. But it was the coronavirus, which has infected more than 600,000 Michigan residents and killed more than 15,000 since it was first reported in the state in March, that dominated her address. Ms. Whitmer said she planned to start a statewide tour to encourage Michiganders, Republicans and Democrats alike, to try and find common ground as the state emerges from the pandemic. The tour is designed to focus on what unites us, improve how we talk to each other, she said. My mission is to find common ground so we can emerge from this crisis stronger than ever.
BS: Well, you had your fire.
Look what Frances Perkins got accomplished, first in Albany, but then when she went down to Washington. So here's a woman, she goes to Albany at a time when women don't even have the vote and gets herself appointed the head of a fire commission. And by the way, every time you see one of those lit-up fire exit signs, thank Frances Perkins, O.K.? But she not only does that, she then immediately expands it into labor law and workers and worker safety and worker protection overall. As you know, she then goes down to Washington, becomes the first woman cabinet official, and look at what she gets done in a short period of time. Social security, minimum wage, right to join a union, end of child labor, the weekend, my personal favorite [LAUGHTER], that Saturdays and Sundays are not treated like Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. But think about it that way. So we start with the corruption. That's what Perkins started with. She started by outing the corruption.
My guess, however, is that Trump's trade policy has been motivated less by any substantive goals than by the desire to look like a tough guy. And while establishment Republicans headed off any important changes in NAFTA, which would have been really bad for business — Trump basically took the existing agreement and stuck his name on it — they have been willing to indulge his posturing on other, less critical fronts.
I mean, one way I think about it is it's almost certainly the case that there are real differences between boys and girls and men and women that extend beyond the ones that you can see. And yet it also seems to me likely that we've exaggerated how big those differences are. And, Farhad, I think that's part of your point, that, Ross, your point about there being real differences can be true, but it can also be the case that they're not nearly as big as we think.
Now, control of the White House and a slim majority in Congress mean the first real prospect of significantly strengthening Obamacare since it became law in 2010. President-elect Biden's inclusion of policies to shore up the health law in his first major legislative package has raised those hopes further.
NATO members agreed, in 2014, to a goal of spending 2 percent of their G.D.P. on defense, but in 2017 the only countries to meet that goal were America, Britain, Greece, Poland and Estonia. Mr. Trump chastised fellow member states at a 2017 summit, declaring that 23 of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should.
Likewise, federal officials could be more receptive to state requests for waivers under Medicaid, the federal-state program that covers more than 70 million low-income people. A number of Republican governors and state legislators would like to charge higher premiums or co-payments than are now allowed. Some states want to provide a less generous, less expensive package of benefits, or require some able-bodied adults to engage in work activities as a condition of receiving Medicaid.
It'll be free for anybody who's under 18. It'll be free for a family of four making less than $50,000 a year, and it will have a small price for everyone else. This is the advantage to having already identified how you can pay for this.
Excuse me, where did that right come from, in your mind?
Lauren Kelley: Sure. I wanted to ask about reproductive rights.
Mr. Manchin stopped to give her a hug. After he passed, she said she feared that Republicans in Washington will continue to try to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law. If they can't overturn that, then they hope they can at least favor their big-insurance buddies by allowing them to block pre-existing conditions, said Ms. Miller, a nurse educator. I have a pre-existing condition.
The auditors found that the Obama administration had flouted this requirement. Under the law, the government was supposed to collect a total of $25 billion from 2014 to 2016 and deposit $5 billion of that in the Treasury.
Mr. Trump's statement last week that a replacement plan should go hand in hand with repeal efforts had already ignited a sense of urgency among Republicans on Capitol Hill. Over the weekend Mr. Trump said he was close to completing a plan to replace the Affordable Care Act with the goal of insurance for everybody, but congressional aides said Tuesday that they had not seen an actual proposal.

On Friday, I watched yet another bizarre scene from an already bizarre election cycle: The affable but hopelessly vacant Ben Carson endorsing the demagogic real estate developer who once said of Carson that he had a pathological temper as a child and compared him to a child molester.

Mr. Doroshin attributed those problems to issues with an online sign-up system that allowed thousands of ineligible people to register for appointments. Then on Tuesday, the city health commissioner, Thomas Farley, said at a news conference that the health department would no longer work with Philly Fighting Covid. The city learned, he said, that the group had unexpectedly canceled its testing efforts to focus on vaccination; that it planned to change from nonprofit status to a for-profit company; and that it had changed its data privacy policy to allow it to potentially sell data about patients to third parties, a step first reported by the public radio station WHYY. We did not think that was appropriate, Dr. Farley said about the data policy. We thought, 'If there's any attempt to do this, even the possibility, then people won't trust this organization.' In an interview, Mr. Doroshin said his group had only the best intentions, but he acknowledged its inexperience. We're a bunch of kids, Mr. Doroshin said. I didn't know anything about legal structure before this. I didn't care. I'm not a lawyer, I'm a nerd. People are trying to make me out to be this nefarious thing. I'm like, 'Dude, I didn't know all the rules of a nonprofit organization until I did this.' He said that the company had decided to switch to a for-profit structure in order to expand quickly, and that it had not hid its intentions from the city.
Even some candidates who back the single-payer approach of Medicare for All told The Times they would also be willing to support a choice between some kind of public option and private insurance , an acknowledgment that many Americans like their private coverage and want the choice to keep it.
But the bill highlights Democrats' split over health policy going into the 2020 elections.
— but also kind of morally and democratically wrong.

Mr. Doroshin did acknowledge that there were problems with the organization's privacy policy, which he said was posted in haste. But he said that the group had not sold or otherwise disseminated any of the patient data it collected, and that the posted policy was frankly just a mistake. Katrina Lipinsky, a registered nurse who volunteered at the group's vaccination site, said in an interview that at the end of one day, after the group tried to find takers for a number of leftover doses, she saw Mr. Doroshin put a few in his backpack, along with the vaccination cards that are used to track vaccination timelines. She said she had reported it to city investigators. Obviously, that didn't seem right, she said. Dr. Farley, the health commissioner, told reporters that any leftover vaccine doses should have been given back to the health department. He said the department was looking into the matter. If that's true, that's very disturbing, he said. They shouldn't have done that. In the interview, Mr. Doroshin acknowledged that he took four doses home with him and administered them to friends. He said that he should have had a nurse present when he gave the shots, but that he did not regret making use of doses that would otherwise have expired that night. I'm OK with being a person that broke a rule to not have any vaccine left over, he said. If that's the final word I have in my book, then that's OK. I'm OK with dying with that.
That, in turn, prompted an increased frequency of small shutdowns as politicians struggled with deadlines, said Roy T. Meyers, a political science professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, who has written about the history of shutdowns.
And the reason democracy is threatened in a way it never was under Nixon is not simply that Trump is a worse human being than Nixon ever was; it is the fact that he has so many enablers.

When the president's motorcade left Saft to head back to Air Force One, I noticed something unusual: The plant's parking lot was extremely small. It dawned on me that Obama's tour of the factory, filled with photo ops and handshakes, had included very little interaction with workers. Instead, he was shown machine after machine, mostly operated by computers. At one point, he was introduced to WALL-E, a robot named after the Pixar film that takes battery components from a tray. No employees necessary. This giant mecca of innovation, a physical marvel that if built several decades ago would have easily employed a few thousand people, employs only 300.
Right. So I've identified pay-fors, and I lay out that if you want, you can get into it, and you've got a three-year period to be able to do it at a deeply subsidized price or at no price at all.
Why is defending the Affordable Care Act in the Supreme Court hard? That's what lawyers are for, sure. That's a legal issue, and they've got a whole bunch of lawyers in the federal government.
Trump says that Aleppo basically has fallen. What does he say to the 250,000 people in east Aleppo, including 7-year-old @AlabedBana? — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
KK: But you have to admit, many of the things you're saying are the same pitch Obama gave us in 2008, and Obama, of course, got health care done, but with a lot of compromises and left a law that I think by everyone's estimation is flawed. So what's different in 2020 — excuse me, I don't know what year it is, 2019 — than it was in 2008?
But I get it. There are right now, Democrats against Democrats on this. But understand this, we'll get into a general election. Oh, I know what the insurance industry will want to do. I know what Donald Trump will want to do. But the truth is we're going to have the party who tried to take away health care from 35 million Americans, said it was O.K. to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions and is continuing to follow that right now, both in their lawsuits and in their agency practices, and millions of people have lost their health care.
In short, if this isn't the time to leave behind the hyperpartisanship that has made it nearly impossible for us to do anything big and hard for two decades, then when?
In particular, the Justice Department insists that two popular features of the Affordable Care Act must go, too. The first is the guaranteed issue provision, which prohibits insurers from charging more to people who have cancer, or any pre-existing condition, than to whose who do not. The second is the community rating provision, which prohibits insurers from refusing to sell a policy to someone who can pay the policy's listed price.
Finally there's immigration. Trump has made draconian border policies the centerpiece of his administration, at the cost of alienating much of the public. He is trapped in a bubble, unable to see the facts: that a large majority of Americans support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, oppose a wall along the southern border and disapprove of how the federal government has treated migrants attempting to cross into the United States. Most Americans, likewise, would allow refugees from Central American countries to continue to seek asylum.
To Nordhaus and some other economists, it remains the only policy powerful enough to be worth the effort. I understand where they're coming from. Carbon pricing would affect every industry and every household. It would have cascading benefits, giving the private sector an incentive to invest more in clean energy. But recent history offers reason to be skeptical that focusing entirely on pricing would make its achievement any more likely.
Well, look, I'm going to start. I don't want Mitch McConnell, obviously.
It is hard to analyze the skinny repeal proposal, because Republicans have provided few details about it. Presumably, it would still provide government subsidies to lower-income families, as the A.C.A. does. But many middle-class families who do not get coverage through employers would be left bearing the full cost of their now much more expensive policies.
Insurers are complaining loudly about the uncertainty surrounding what will happen in the coming years, even though many states' exchanges have showed some signs of stability. Several major insurers have said they cannot begin to decide whether to offer coverage next year until the government clarifies if and how it plans to change the rules.
So, the theory that the election was stolen is so amorphous, right? So, some of the people say yes to that mean, well those Facebook algorithms were unfairly twisted. And some of them mean, vote totals were altered and changed. And some of them just mean, well, The Washington Post, its coverage was not as evenhanded as we believe it should have been and was much too critical of Donald Trump and too soft on Biden. Now, different degrees of plausibility to different theories and also different degrees of severity. But that's, I think, the key of this. It's an umbrella. And you can be a Q nut or you can just be a standard issue Republican, who doesn't trust the media, and both of you can affirm this. And particularly at that level of abstraction, no wedge is being driven between the two of you. And so, a politician can get up and give a speech to you that you will be applauding for one reason and the guy next to you is applauding for a different reason. The guy next to you maybe believes in some totally insane conspiracy theory involving the ghost of Hugo Chavez and you basically, you've got a problem with Jake Tapper.
I am, like, the happiest dude in America right now. We've got a president and a national security team that I've been dreaming of for eight years. I like the president. I want to help him. I hope he's successful. He's been a friend to me. President Trump has the smarts and the moral courage to listen to his generals. I am all in. Keep it up, Donald. I'm sure you're watching. President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize and then some. If you don't like me working with President Trump to make the world a better place, I don't give a shit.
Yeah, and I like being relevant. And the way you stay relevant is you stay engaged. There's a lot of space here to take on tough issues, because most people shy away from them.
For people that are eligible but not buying insurance it's a financial issue, and so upping the subsidies is going to make the price point come down, said Ezekiel Emanuel, a health policy expert and professor at the University of Pennsylvania who advised Mr. Biden during his transition. The bill, he said, would make a big dent in the number of the uninsured.
In an off-camera briefing for reporters, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said only that Mr. Trump has long acknowledged that Russia probably tried to influence the election, adding that it was still possible that other countries were also involved.
But that's my point. It doesn't. That's what I just said.
The outcome would've been very different. Right. When the policeman, Sgt. Crowley, and I met, I said, Why did you arrest me? He said, I was afraid that I wasn't going to be able to go home to my wife, because I was convinced that your partner was upstairs and he was going to come down and blow me away. He told me he had gotten a call: Two black guys are breaking into this house. One of them answers the door — me — when he rang the bell, and I'm stepping over suitcases, because I'd just come back from a trip. Unbeknown to me, one pattern of thievery is bringing empty suitcases to a house. So the officer saw a black face, he saw the suitcases: That's part of a profile. I was what Barbara Johnson calls an already-read text. He couldn't hear me, couldn't see me. Well, that might be related to police excesses and abuses, but it's a far end of the scale, and I was able to reverse what happened to me, unlike an Eric Garner. So my whole reaction to my arrest was determined by two things: The attacks on President Obama and my own determination not to claim too much for my own victimization.
Times columnist David Brooks noted in The Road to Character that Ms. Perkins discovered her calling to service and organizing after witnessing the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist fire. The analogy to something like the student loan debt crisis or child care, of course, isn't perfect — the debt crisis, for instance, has been slow burning as tuition rates have risen far above the inflation rate since the 1970s.
Mr. Bloomberg gave a long answer about his support of stop-and-frisk during his mayoralty, saying he was embarrassed by it in hindsight.
I believe good transportation policy can play no less a role than making possible the American dream, Mr. Buttigieg said. But I also recognize that at their worst, misguided policies and missed opportunities in transportation can reinforce racial and economic inequality. Mr. Buttigieg's confirmation was described by a number of human rights groups as a symbolic moment for the L.G.B.T.Q. community. This confirmation breaks through a barrier that has existed for too long; where LGBTQ identity served as an impediment to nomination or confirmation at the highest level of government, Alphonso David, president of Human Rights Campaign, a group dedicated to advancing the interests of the L.G.B.T.Q. community, said in a statement. Let this important moment for our movement serve as a reminder to every L.G.B.T.Q. young person: you too can serve your country in any capacity you earn the qualifications to hold.
If you are a giant multinational corporation and any regulation comes along that you don't like, the local country raises the minimum — we've actually seen this — raises its environmental standards, you get to sue them to get them to drop those standards. And who will your case be heard by? It'll be heard by a handful of corporate lawyers, who when they're not sitting on this arbitration panel are working for big law firms that are doing work for you or other multinational corporations like you. That's one set of how the path will run.

Mr. Trump began his presidency with a promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but efforts to do so in 2017 were unsuccessful. Despite Republican control of both houses of Congress, legislators were unable to agree on an approach. The Senate tried and failed to pass several different bills that would have reshaped big parts of the 2010 health law.
Be still, my heart, but I see the latter. Some of the greatest advances in American history — liberation of slaves, Social Security, robust clean air and water mandates — were birthed by disaster.
The president compounded the problem by saying Republicans are going to become the party of health care without having any plan, let alone a coherent proposal that would produce better results and could get through Congress. Republicans are now deeply divided on what should be done, and the president is no help in setting a course for the party.
This doesn't mean that systemic racism is gone — far from it. But a majority of Americans are willing to acknowledge that racism is real and see it as a problem, which represents huge moral progress. Nixon's silent majority is now a noisy minority.
The administration will also have enormous power to allow states to reshape their Medicaid programs — and even their local insurance markets — through waivers to existing law. Seema Verma, the just-confirmed administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, was a consultant who helped states write pathbreaking conservative proposals for their Medicaid programs. She is ideally positioned to approve many more such waivers from Republican-led states, allowing them to impose premiums, cost-sharing and even work requirements for Medicaid beneficiaries.
KK: Well, the House Democrats are fighting Mitch McConnell. [WARREN APPEARS UNIMPRESSED]
In a democracy, how is it that they have so much political influence that one-tenth of 1 percent can say, I rather your kid have to deal with $50,000 in student loan debt, and I'd rather you never get a chance to get a child into day care, which means you either piece stuff together in crazy ways or quit your job. And I'd rather your public schools still have tiles falling out of the ceiling and textbooks that are 11 years old than that the top one-tenth of 1 percent has to pitch in 2 cents.
Protections for pre-existing conditions weren't the only rules for insurers established under Obamacare. Without it, health plans could also begin limiting the total amount of financial protection they offer customers, increasing deductibles, charging higher prices to older customers, and dropping expensive categories of benefits, like prescription drugs.
[Follow our live Trump vs Biden 2020 election updates and analysis.]
Insurers in some states, including Maryland, Minnesota, New Hampshire, New Jersey, Tennessee and Texas, have said they intend to charge lower rates in 2019. Price increases this year were exceptionally large because insurers developed the rates in the spring of 2017 in a sea of uncertainty: Republicans in Congress were determined to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and no one could be sure what might replace it. Mr. Trump cut off a crucial source of income for insurers — cost-sharing subsidy payments — in October 2017, just as state officials were approving final rates for 2018.
In the president's public statements, and as far as we can tell based on his personal thinking, he recognizes that health care is a huge political vulnerability for Republicans, that the last thing they did on health care, that big repeal drive, was politically devastating to them. And his proclamation that they need to become the party of health care clearly reflects an understanding that a problem needs to be fixed.
I would go further and argue that it is the Trump persona so vilified in the media that has in fact made bolder, more sweeping reforms possible than would have been conceivable under almost any other Republican who might have been elected.

Back in 2016 when Donald Trump was elected, the world was so upside down you might have believed almost any prediction of our strange future. But I'll bet you'd still have been skeptical if somebody told you Mitt Romney would turn into an inspirational political figure.
There is some debate among Senate experts about exactly what sorts of insurance regulations will be allowed in a bill passed through the special budget procedure. Such bills, which cannot be filibustered and thus can pass with only 50 Senate votes (along with Vice President Mike Pence's tiebreaking vote), must adhere to the so-called Byrd rule.
He also defended the Obama administration's record on health care and immigration, something he would continue to do, fiercely and energetically, throughout two other stops on Saturday, though speaking at AFSCME, he stopped short of accusing his opponents of criticizing Mr. Obama, an argument he had made following the debate. At AFSCME, he said that the administration's controversial deportation practices focused on felons.

If we're going to solve the issues of climate chaos, pass the torch. If we're going to solve the issue of student loan debt, pass the torch. If we're going to end gun violence for families who are fearful of sending their kids to school, pass the torch. We need a party that is diverse, but we need a party that has the guts to stand up to the powerful special interests who have so much power over the economic and political life of this country.
It is seen as a really long-shot challenge to the Affordable Care Act, something that, in all likelihood, will probably not result in the law being struck down as a whole, but the White House was going to have to decide at some point whether they were going to defend the A.C.A. at the highest levels of the legal system or whether they were going to take sides against a law that's on the books that Congress failed to repeal when it had the chance. And that's what they did.
I'm sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections, Mr. Biden said as he wrapped up his final answer, to a question about whether he supports the Endangered Species Act. (He does, he said. Oh, I love you, the questioner replied.) There's a lot more to say, but I've probably said too much to you, Mr. Biden added.
JI: But one of the premises for massive health care reform is that the Affordable Care Act is not working in a lot of ways, right? So you support Medicare for all presumably because you think the Affordable Care Act has a lot of holes in it, and we need to do something different, so you'll be defending that.

The governor and state Republicans keep holding this line that voting was something that was so essential, that the primary was something that was so important, that they would try to find some workarounds that included expanding access to absentee ballots and encouraging people to use that measure. It included counties taking precautionary measures which include maybe drive-through voting or socially distanced lines. But besides all of these creative measures, there is an increasing fear, particularly among poll workers, that the election would be unsafe for them to staff. These are people who, 90 percent of them are senior citizens.
Actually, I've done 175 stump speeches and I've talked about it in every one of them. You all haven't covered it. I talk about three things that I think we need to do ——
I do think there's an assumption that the legislation wouldn't actually have any real world effects that you need to care about. That it's just a political game, which, I think, was actually a pretty widespread assumption among Republicans. And then there's just the, we don't want to spend money, we'll spend money if we have to, but it's not our comfort zone.
I thought that my first responsibility was to give people the right to live, he said, while arguing he did begin phasing out the police tactic by the end of his administration.
The administration would drastically change the way states are allocated funding for programs that support disadvantaged K-12 students. The budget proposes consolidating 29 programs into a $19.4 billion block grant that would dispense funding to states, who would then determine how to use it. Among the programs that would be zeroed out to fund the grant are 21st Century Community Learning Centers, which funds after-school programs for low-income students; funding for programs in rural schools and magnet schools; and funding for homeless and migrant students.

But what's even worse, if you ask me, is hearing Republicans complain that food stamps and unemployment benefits reduce the incentive to seek work. There was never serious evidence for this claim, but right now — at a time when workers can't work, because doing their normal jobs would kill lots of people — I find it hard to understand how anyone can make this argument without gagging.

We need to encourage people by giving them a helping hand, but not allowing it to become an indefinitely giving hand, Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, said in a news release. Now, in the midst of the strongest economy in a generation, we need everyone who can work, to work. The change is projected to end SNAP benefits for nearly 700,000 adults, saving $5 billion over five years — or less than a third of the $19 billion the government has spent so far on farmers affected by the trade war.
At 37, Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Ind., is the youngest of the candidates to jump into the 2020 presidential race, and he is trying to turn his age to his advantage, arguing that he grew up with mass shootings in schools and that his generation will inherit the full consequences of climate change.
Yeah, he would call it politics.
So I think that what we're seeing is not Trumpification completed but Trumpification in progress and escalating, so that when Trump said that a judge of Mexican-American heritage was not fit to hear a case that he was involved in, you heard Paul Ryan come out and say that it was the textbook definition of racism. And you heard much more, I think, strenuous and immediate condemnations. And so what we are accustomed to, the amount of racial invective that it takes to even break into the news cycle, keeps increasing. You know, I've been reading Tim Alberta's book American Carnage about the G.O.P. civil war that led to Trump. And there's something he quotes that kind of everybody quotes when they're describing the evolution of the modern Republican Party. It's a famous Lee Atwater quote from an interview in the '80s. But he says, You start out in 1954 by saying n-word, n-word, n-word. By 1968, you can't say n-word. That hurts you— backfires. So you say stuff like forced busing, states' rights, and all that stuff, and you're getting so abstract. Now you're talking about cutting taxes. And all these things you're talking about are totally economic things. And a byproduct of them is blacks get hurt worse than whites.
But it's to work with nations and say, you want access to the American consumer, you've got to start raising your standards in a meaningful way. And here's where the long-term goals are, here's where you are, here's what constitutes moving toward those. And I think that's where a lot of folks would like to go, and frankly we should be working with other nations on helping, not just those who lag way behind, but those who have good standards to be using the same kind of approach to trade. The idea that trade is just about tariffs is just old 20th century. Trade today in the 21st century is about regulation. It's about who's going to have to meet what regulatory standards.

I would have to say the answer to that is probably the military, and it's not a coincidence that the military is also the one national institution that Americans say they trust in large numbers. I don't think that's just because the military is good at what it does, but because it takes men and women and turns them into soldiers and Marines and airmen and so forth. And we have a sense that they come out better than they came in. When somebody tells you that they went to Harvard, you might think, well, that's a smart person. She got into Harvard. When somebody tells you they went to the Naval Academy, you think, that's a serious person. And it's not because they got in but because the Navy somehow made them that way. I think we have a very strong sense that the military is in the business of forming people. And if more institutions thought about how they look in this respect — are we approaching the country in a way that says, we take people and make them better or our people or people you can trust — I think we'd be in better shape.
We got strong as a country through democracy and capitalism. We got rich as a country through trade. We got smart and powerful as a country through immigration. We got fair as a country through Social Security, Medicare and Obamacare. They all lead to vastly more winners than losers. This is no time to lose confidence in what got us here. If you're running for president and are not for all these things, you're wrong — and I hope you lose.
March 3, 2020, 11:58 p.m. ET March 3, 2020, 11:58 p.m. ET A setback for Jeff Sessions, who heads to a runoff in Alabama Senate race. MOBILE, Ala. — Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general who emerged from political exile and defied President Trump to run for the United States Senate in Alabama, suffered a setback on Tuesday in his fight to win back the seat he held for 20 years, falling well short of a majority and landing in a runoff election where he will compete with a Republican rival from a weakened position. Precincts across the state were still counting votes just before midnight. But Mr. Sessions was fending off a strong challenge from a political upstart, Tommy Tuberville, the former Auburn University football coach who clung closely to Mr. Trump in a relentlessly negative and personal campaign that turned the race into a contest of who was more loyal to the president. He will now face Mr. Sessions in a March 31 runoff. A third Republican, Bradley Byrne, a congressman from the Mobile area who tried to overcome his long association with the Republican Party establishment by also tethering himself to Mr. Trump, conceded defeat on Tuesday night.

Such restrictions are central to Republican efforts to profoundly change Medicaid, the safety net program that has provided free health insurance to tens of millions of low-income Americans for more than 50 years. The ballooning deficits created by the budget deal that President Trump signed into law Friday and the recent tax bill are likely to add urgency to the party's attempts to wring savings from entitlement programs.
— Republicans in the state legislature have already learned a lesson from the years prior, that it's more important to wield power than it is to be seen as a political compromiser.
Thank you, Michael. Great to be with you.
Presiding over the case is Judge Reed O'Connor of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas, who was appointed by President George W. Bush. The judge has previously blocked Obama-era efforts to extend medical leave protections to same-sex couples and to include gender-identity discrimination as a form of sex discrimination under the health law.
We would then have two Donalds to lead us, one a cartoon character, a product of the imagination, orange his dominant face color, known best for his semi-intelligible speech and often questionable logic. The other, a duck.
LK: There's a growing problem of harassment and trespassing at abortion clinics.
Some short-term plans also limit how much they will pay per day of care, like a Lifeshield plan sold in several states, which advertises its freedom to choose any doctor or hospital, but pays a maximum of $1,000 of hospital bills per day, or $250 for an ambulance ride.
The rapid reduction in the number of uninsured Americans has shifted the political debate about health reform. In 2009, many Republicans were comfortable with a status quo in which many Americans couldn't get health care. Now, Mr. Trump and Republican leaders in Congress have said their plans could cover as many people as the Affordable Care Act, although a recent C.B.O. analysis disagreed.
She ran as a Republican, but in both Alaska and Washington, the party seemed comfortable moving on without her. The National Republican Senatorial Committee spent more than $1 million funding Miller, with the Tea Party Express adding $600,000. Not long after she started the campaign, Murkowski learned, while she was in Alaska, that Senate Republicans were considering voting the next day to remove her from her position as the ranking member on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I have basically been written off by the senatorial committee, she said, recalling her state of mind in a memoir by Arlen Specter, the moderate former senator from Pennsylvania, and I'm not going back begging and pleading. My relationships will either stand on their own or not. In the end, she held on to her post.
Then we discuss pronouns. Instead of he and she, should we use the word they?
And the Republican Party has come to be defined far too much by its opposition to the left or to some idea of the left. And so I think Republican politicians have not had to think about what they're for and what they want to offer their voters enough. And the doing that would not only allow them to approach the public in a much more constructive way, it would also allow them to broaden their coalition beyond getting out every last base voter and by appealing to voters who are winnable, who might be persuadable in other ways. There's nothing insightful about this. I mean, that's just an obvious description of what a politician in a democracy ought to be doing. But I think the party needs to hear that and think about it. And in these years, when it is mostly out of power at the national level, needs to be thinking about the agenda that it needs to put before the public going forward, a future-oriented agenda that is not about who won or lost the fights that are the sources of the grudges we've had for decades, that are not about finishing to-do list of the early 1980s, but that are about what 21st century America needs. And I think there are some people in the party who see that and who are inclined in that direction, but there are a lot of people in the party who don't.
Well, it's not good for them and in a dozen different ways. Wages are part of it, but they are only part of it. It's about unsafe working conditions, for example. If you can hire somebody for cash and not meet current labor standards on safety, that someone needs a safety belt or needs training to go up high on a building, you not only put that person at risk, you reward employers who continue not to follow the law and to undermine safety standards for everyone.
A 2-cent wealth tax, and now let's talk about what kind of change we could make. Two cents, and we can do universal child care. We can put $800 billion into our public schools. We can make a federal commitment for the first time in history to public education K-12, and we can do the same thing for college, and we can cancel student loan debt, and an enormous boost to our economy.
In an effort to demonstrate a commitment to investing in health care, Mr. Biden also said at one point, What I'm proposing is something that costs an excess of a trillion dollars and we're going to get it done.
WASHINGTON — The House on Thursday passed a suite of health care bills that tied shoring up the Affordable Care Act to lowering drug prices, as Democrats tried to hold Republicans to their campaign promises to secure coverage for pre-existing medical conditions and rein in the cost of prescription medicine.
Its brief made two arguments. One is that the recent Republican tax bill, rather than eliminating the individual mandate, actually made the mandate more onerous by imposing on individuals a legal obligation to purchase health insurance.
Then came Nov. 8, 2016. It was terrifying, Gabriel said of Trump's victory. She worried about the repeal of the Affordable Care Act and the return of insurance discrimination against people with pre-existing conditions. Her older daughter, who is 11, had been excited to see a woman president, but was picked on by her classmates in their largely conservative area for supporting Hillary Clinton. It was awful to have to tell her the morning after, Gabriel said. She let her stay home from school Nov. 9.
You have already seen a reduction in economic inequality over the last few weeks because of the stock market, but there are potential longer-term effects for the 99 percent, said Mr. Scheidel, who wrote The Great Leveler: Violence and the History of Inequality From the Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century.
Joseph R. Biden Jr. speaks with Elizabeth Warren about once a week. They review the latest developments on the Covid-19 crisis and the collapsing economy. They trade ideas about how a Democratic president, like Mr. Biden, might rescue the country. They exchange tales about their lives sheltered in place, he in Wilmington, Del., and she in Cambridge, Mass.
In the end, I think a long shutdown was more likely to hurt the Dreamers than to help them. Congress would not have passed a law to protect them before reopening the government, and the Dreamers' allies in Congress — the Democrats — would be in a weaker position than they are now.
Trumpcare has begun, not through legislation but through executive action.
Our politicians can say our testing is awesome, but the fact is our testing is inadequate, said Scott Hensley, a viral immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved in the research.
There's no single explanation for the wave of right-wing populism across the world. But Rupert Murdoch's empire has done more than any other media company to enable it, promote it and profit from it.
There were no direct efforts to pressure or lobby Justice Kennedy to announce his resignation on Wednesday, and it was hardly the first time a president had done his best to create a court opening. In the past half-century, presidents have repeatedly been dying to take advantage of timely vacancies, said Laura Kalman, a historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara.
President-elect Donald J. Trump demanded on Tuesday that Congress immediately repeal the Affordable Care Act and pass another health law quickly. His remarks put Republicans in the nearly impossible position of having only weeks to replace a health law that took nearly two years to pass.
Not if you have a pre-existing medical condition and are relying on Obamacare to guarantee your treatment if you change health insurers. In case you missed it, in all the tumult Trump has churned up lately, his Justice Department quietly indicated last week that it would not defend major parts of the Affordable Care Act that pro-Trump forces, having failed to kill it in Congress, are now trying to kill through lower courts. And this includes the requirement that insurance companies guarantee access to coverage without bias against people with pre-existing medical conditions.
Then he went further, pointing to 100,000 deaths as the number against which to judge him.
And we should go back to a system like we had before on every other issue, where if you could secure a majority in the House, a majority in the Senate, get a president to sign it, and could sustain scrutiny from the courts, that's the system Madison designed. And that should be what makes a bill a law.
We just undercut ourselves when we do that.
Typically, Americans without a special circumstance can buy Obamacare insurance only during a six-week period in the fall, a restriction meant to encourage people to hold coverage even when they are healthy. The sign-up period for this year's coverage ended in mid-December, with enrollments only slightly higher than they were last year. But the Trump administration did little to advertise it. The Biden administration plans to have a large marketing campaign to announce the new opportunity and encourage people to enroll in health plans, two of the people said.
These are the fights we need to have. These are the fights we should be bringing forward. We don't bring those fights forward. We — oh, well, we could — around the edge a little bit. Then we're just going to be the ones who stood by while America became fundamentally a country that lost even a hope that all the kids would have opportunity. That we just extinguish that and say, Nope. Better be born into it, because that's the only way to make it in America. That's not the America I want to see.
President Obama has published an essay on Obamacare in The Journal of the American Medical Association. While it hit a lot of the Affordable Care Act's high points, it was also pretty frank that the health law has some weaknesses that need to be fixed. Margot Sanger-Katz and Reed Abelson, two New York Times reporters who have been covering Obamacare, discuss the policy changes that the president wants.
For Marque Dailey of Dallas, 35, who has multiple sclerosis, the Affordable Care Act was the only way to get private insurance. Before the law, insurance companies were allowed to deny coverage to people like him who had expensive medical conditions, or to charge such a high price that many could not afford the premiums. About half of all Americans had such pre-existing conditions, including high blood pressure or lung disease, that resulted in their being denied or potentially priced out of coverage, according to one federal estimate.
Medicare is a uniquely popular government program. People really love it. It provides them with a lot of financial security. People pay taxes into the program, so they feel like it's an earned benefit. It's something that they deserve. But meanwhile, everyone else is in a health insurance program that is getting a little bit more rickety. There are some people who get really great insurance through their work, but there are a lot of other people who are sort of falling through the cracks — if they're between jobs, if they work for a company that doesn't provide insurance. The system for people in Medicare is that everyone gets it and they all get the same thing. The system for the rest of us is, it really depends on who you are, and who you work for, and what your financial situation is.
Charlie Warzel: Senator, how do you first campaign in and then govern a country as polarized as the one that we're living in right now? Because this doesn't feel like a disagreement on a few policies. This is a situation where the cost of letting the other side wins seems almost too much to bear for the other side. And if you look at impeachment, you see politicians literally inventing alternate realities rather than compromise or disparage a party leader. How do you realistically navigate that and get things done? Because it doesn't feel like a divide that you can heal away.
One of the central Republican criticisms of the A.C.A., which helped 20 million people gain health insurance, is that premiums and deductibles for the policies sold under the law are too high. Skinny repeal, however, could force insurance companies to raise premiums by 20 percent, according to a C.B.O. analysis of a similar bill from 2015. It would eliminate the requirement, or mandate, that individuals buy insurance, and would also repeal a mandate that employers above a certain size provide it to their workers and get rid of a tax on medical devices.

About 10 million Americans lost their homes to foreclosure sales between 2006 and 2014, the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis.
But there is a lot of solidarity around issues of race and policing, around immigration, around gender and LGBTQ rights. And a lot of it is hollow, particularly from corporations. But that is a place where corporations are more willing to take a stand. And as that has become more the dividing line in our politics, I think that has pushed more of this realignment. I'm curious if that seems right to you.

MG: Your standing in some of the polls in the swing states is not as competitive as some of the other candidates'. Do you think that this issue is hurting you in the swing states like Michigan? If not, what do you make of the discrepancy in swing states?
The best-known example of his radically anti-worker views is his argument that SeaWorld shouldn't face any liability after a captive killer whale killed one of its workers, because the victim should have known the risks when she took the job. But there's much more anti-labor extremism in his record.
The throng that came out to celebrate Mr. Trump's announcement was big and boisterous. The president may be broadly unpopular, but to much of the Republican base, he is a cult idol — Justin Bieber with a faux tan and an unearthly combover.
Does President Obama deserve credit for these gains? No. In general, presidents and their policies matter much less for the economy's performance than most people imagine. Times of crisis are an exception, and the Obama stimulus plan enacted in 2009 made a big positive difference. But that stimulus faded out fast after 2010, and has very little to do with the economy's current situation.
For those of us who feared disaster from this presidency but saw the first year as a period when Trump was relatively constrained, his I'm in charge here! pivot was a worrying phenomenon. But it's the nature of the Trump era to confound all expectations, so naturally what followed the Cohn-Tillerson-McMaster exits and the tariff announcements and the stock market wobbles was … the most politically successful six weeks of Trump's presidency to date.
KK: As student loan debt has come up a couple of times, I want to make sure we have a question.
A graduate with a professional degree expects to earn $2.3 million more than a high school graduate. The Brookings Institution's Adam Looney estimated that under Senator Warren's plan the bottom 20 percent of borrowers by income get only 4 percent of the savings.
So the way I see this is I think the old left-right division, yeah, there's a lot of that. But I think there's a very different division in America, and that is an America that's working for a thinner and thinner slice at the top and not working for much of anyone else. And there are a lot of Democrats, a lot of independents and a lot of Republicans who see that.
It's true that, as Brad DeLong says, many of Robin's examples would actually apply in any complex economic system: I've wasted time dealing with both Verizon and the Social Security Administration, and in both cases my socioeconomic status surely made it a lot easier than it would have been for a minimum-wage worker. (I have, on the other hand, had consistently good experiences at the much-maligned DMV.) But the idea that free markets remove power relations from the equation is just naïve.
Listen, you know I hear you. You know I feel you on that. [LAUGHTER] So first, to the audience, the reason we need to talk about this in the detail we are is that this has become the way the Senate legislates. And it has unusual features that then change the laws that we all live under, change what problems we can and can't respond to, and change the way in which we respond to those problems. So in the '80s and then codified in 1990, there are a set of rules imposed on budget reconciliation to make sure that senates do not use it as an end run around the filibuster. Those rules are important. They're called the Byrd rules. What do they say?
Sometimes, though, one party really is doing a better job than the other. To refuse to admit it is to miss the story.
The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative, a program for restoring the ecosystem of the Great Lakes, was first implemented by the Obama administration in 2010. Federal funding ranged from nearly $300 million to $450 million every year under Mr. Obama.
Carl E. Schmid II, the deputy executive director of the AIDS Institute, a public policy and advocacy organization, said Mr. Trump's plan sounded very bold and could be one of his greatest achievements, if the president and Congress provide enough funds.
—— in this country. And the first one is attack corruption. And the second is to make some structural change in the economy. And the third is to protect our democracy. And it may — that the —
United States troops have recently resumed counterterrorism operations in Syria, suggesting that President Trump intends to leave most of the 500 troops currently stationed there (many of them in combat). Mr. Trump has been inconsistent in his strategy on troops in Syria; Senator Warren has been firm in her stance that all combat troops should come home.
It's sort of the Jewish definition of chutzpah, right? A kid who kills his parents, demanding sympathy because he's an orphan.
But you don't actually get there because so long as the filibuster is in place, you're never really playing with live ammunition. You're just talking on Twitter, as opposed to actually trying to figure out, OK, how does this become a bill? And if it became a bill that passed, would people actually like it in practice, which I think is a usefully disciplining system.
I've got to say I loved it when Joe Biden described Donald Trump as the former guy.
While some suggest a public option as a cure-all, shifting more responsibility from the private sector to the government does nothing to address the root of the problem. We would be better served to focus on promoting greater choice, transparency and value in our health care system for the benefit of all consumers.
It made health insurance more comprehensive.
And we had a black president.
But if your complaint is a labor complaint, that is, gee, here I am in America and I'm trying to compete against workers in a foreign country who are getting paid a dollar a day. What's your path? Well, first you've got to go to the U.S. government and persuade the U.S. government that they should go after this country, for which we know what has happened. U.S. government has repeatedly — and this is not just by — well, yeah, we get your point.
WASHINGTON — President Trump said on Wednesday that he never would have appointed Attorney General Jeff Sessions had he known Mr. Sessions would recuse himself from overseeing the Russia investigation that has dogged his presidency, calling the decision very unfair to the president.
No, but look. All right, so what do you want to do? You want just give up? Say, Aw, gee, Mitch McConnell ….  Let's go get the begging bowl and say give me a crumb or two, and I will say thank you. That's what it means now to be a Democrat to the party in opposition.
Under the current health care law, 31 states and the District of Columbia expanded Medicaid to cover low-income Americans without children, a group that previously found it difficult to afford insurance.

Robert Bork was President Ronald Reagan's failed Supreme Court nominee in 1987. He wrote extensively on antitrust legislation and redefined it from a focus on helping small businesses to promoting economic efficiency, according to Barak Orbach, professor of law at the University of Arizona.
Inside the White House, strict rules aim to slow the spread of the coronavirus. President Biden swore in members of the White House staff remotely on Jan. 20. Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times Senior staff members in West Wing offices are prohibited from meeting together in an office for more than a total of 15 minutes in a day, according to a senior Biden administration official. No more than six people are allowed to gather in the Oval Office at a time, and a maximum of five staff members are allowed to meet together in the spacious office of the chief of staff, Ron Klain, the official said. That means that both the morning and afternoon senior staff meetings in the White House are conducted on video calls, even though many of the participants are working in offices near one another. In the Roosevelt Room, gatherings are limited to 10 people. And when staff members remove their masks to eat lunch at their desks, they are required to close their doors. Visitors are not allowed without approval, and West Wing staff members generally do not intermingle with the team working in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building across the street. As the new administration finds its footing, life in the West Wing has become incredibly disciplined, partly because of the way President Biden's team wants to work, but mostly because of the strict rules the administration has put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.
And yet developing the postindustrial economy — while addressing issues such as inequality, greenhouse emissions and the condition of public schools — will require optimism. Pessimists think in terms of rear-guard actions to turn back the clock. Optimists understand that where the nation has faults, it's time to roll up our sleeves and get to work.
MC: And there is a good question. How do you do that if Mitch McConnell still holds that Senate?
The best hope for the Dreamers was not a shutdown that was somehow supposed to end differently from every other recent shutdown. The best hope, first, is to see if there is a solution over the next few weeks, away from the chaos and heat of a shuttered federal government.
A Washington Post tally of President Obama's campaign promises found that he kept 11 promises (expand hate crime statutes, insure more Americans, establish a credit-card Bill of Rights), compromised on 12 (end the war in Iraq in 16 months, increase the earned-income tax credit) and failed on 17 (raise the minimum wage and index it to inflation, create a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants).
• Ms. Sanger-Katz on why even some Republicans are rejecting President Trump's replacement health care bill.
The study's senior author, Dr. Tracy Beth Hoeg, a sports medicine physician with a doctorate in epidemiology, said the fact that no teachers or other staff members appeared to have been infected in school was very, very reassuring. But others, including allies of teachers' unions who oppose reopening before educators have been vaccinated, are already arguing that the study's findings should not be widely applied. The study setting was rural, and the students in the schools were mostly white. But it wasn't obvious that the conditions in the schools were very different than those in urban districts. Students ate and attended classes indoors. The students, who ranged from kindergartners to 12th graders, were in small, stable groupings of 11 to 20 students. Not all districts that have reopened created such small class settings. But in most urban districts that have reopened, only a fraction of students have returned in person, so class sizes are generally small — 9 to 12 students in New York City, for instance. On CNN on Tuesday night, President Biden's chief of staff, Ron Klain, said the study's take-home message was that schools could open safely when they had an infusion of money to do so. Mr. Biden has proposed a $1.9 trillion package, which needs Congressional approval, that includes funding for reopening schools. The president is a close ally of teachers unions, which have been calling for major government investments in making schools safer. The Wisconsin districts received a $150,000 grant to purchase cloth masks for all students.
Legislation to replace the individual mandate has already been introduced in Maryland and New Jersey with prominent sponsors. Political leaders in other states, including California, Washington, Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut as well as the District of Columbia, are weighing options for replacing the mandate this year, as Stephanie Armour reported in The Wall Street Journal. The mandate was designed to give healthier people an incentive to buy insurance before they fell ill, lowering the cost of insurance for everyone who buys it.
KK: You seem to have avoided that approach for the most part. Can you just explain why?
He responded to the Covid-19 threat first with denial, then with frantic efforts, not to control the pandemic, but to shift the blame for shambolic, ineffective policies to other people.

Mr. Looney, of the Brookings Institution, estimated that the benefits from Senator Warren's plans are skewed — he estimated that borrowers with advanced degrees will claim 37 percent of the annual benefits, while representing only 27 percent of borrowers overall.
Trump says if he were in charge, Hillary Clinton would be in jail. Donald, in America, we defeat election opponents, we don't jail them! — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
Actually, many prominent Republicans haven't even gotten to the point of trying to respond to criticism; they're just whining about how mean their constituents are being, and invoking conspiracy theories. Talk about snowflakes who can dish it out but can't take it!
The health law enabled the Food and Drug Administration to consider and approve biosimilars, drugs akin to generic versions of biologic drugs, which can't be copied as precisely as typical drugs. Twenty-one biosimilar medications have been approved by the F.D.A. with the new process. Eliminating the health law could jeopardize those approvals and discourage drugmakers from investing in new biosimilar drugs.
Thus, Representative Jason Chaffetz insisted that the public outcry is just a paid attempt to bully and intimidate; Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, calls all anti-Trump demonstrations a very paid, AstroTurf-type movement. And the tweeter in chief angrily declared that protests have been planned out by liberal activists — because what could be worse than political action by the politically active?
So let's spend at least a couple minutes on health care. There is a lawsuit that the Trump administration is supporting that says that Obamacare should just be invalidated. Conservative legal scholars, including ones who supported past challenges to Obamacare, have called the case absurd and shocking. And yet a Republican-appointed trial judge ruled with the Trump administration. I mean, I just find this really alarming.
KK: I guess do you understand why I keep harping on this? I don't mean to ——
We need to have Medicare for all.
To offset the loss of federal cost-sharing payments, many insurers increased premiums this year. State officials in many states told them to load all the increase onto midlevel silver plans, because the federal government uses the cost of such plans as a benchmark in calculating premium subsidies. Those subsidies made insurance much more affordable, because they covered most or all of the premiums for many people this year.
The health care law had promised the insurers that they would be protected, she wrote, and it did not matter that Congress later failed to appropriate money to cover the insurers' shortfalls.
For now, I'd only nominate him for the Ignoble Prize. It's given to the leader who uses his presidential prerogatives to undermine the personal security of his citizens and values of his nation in more ways in just one year than any leader before him.
But I lost. I mean, the people have spoken. So, O.K., let's see how we can help this guy be a good president.
I think Robert Bork narrowed the standards we use for antitrust and for breaking up big companies. Market dominance by itself, when you totally dominate a market, that is anti-competitive. Then the platforms — this new — you want to go to the new part. The platforms themselves create a new kind of problem that we haven't seen. We can only do this by analogy, which is what we always do in law, but think of it this way. There's Amazon that owns the marketplace where people go and buy toasters and sell toasters, but they also are scraping bits of information off every one of those purchases. When they decide that your toaster business is getting very profitable, and they might like to crowd in on that, they take all that information they took from you without your consent and they go into the 2.0 version of your toaster business and move you back to page seven on the search.
Mr. Azar described Idaho's plan as a cry for help by a state seeking more affordable coverage options for its residents. He said the Idaho program would be subject to searching review for compliance with federal law.
So why would President Trump, the leader of the Republican Party, who had to have watched that same midterm that you're describing, why would he do this if the takeaway of that midterm is that the Affordable Care Act is no longer toxic and might even be liked by a wide cross-section of Americans?
I think he knew intuitively that he needed to build a relationship fairly quickly, in part because of political realities in South Carolina and the fact of his re-election coming up in 2020. But —
Every crisis opens a course to the unknown. In an eye-blink, the impossible becomes possible. History in a sprint can mean a dark, lasting turn for the worse, or a new day of enlightened public policy.
Senator Warren called for the House of Representatives to begin impeachment inquiry proceedings against Mr. Trump as early as April 2019.
I mean, I hadn't seen him since John McCain had passed away, which would've been in August.
What I need to be, clearly, is rich. I need to invent an app or get hit by a city bus. I gotta start playing the lottery. Except, if I win, I definitely need a trustee or Britney Spears's dad to dispense a weekly allowance because I am not to be trusted. I would buy half a dozen pairs of glasses and legally download a bunch of movies I don't even like before the check even cleared. I would buy that Rainbow Brite doll I never got for Christmas 1986 and drive her around in my new car full of gasoline with my windows electronically rolled down and the air conditioner blasting, eating fistfuls of name-brand cereal and sipping an actual Capri Sun.
Or three. I mean, how do you want to count it? [LAUGHTER] One is to reduce the cost for families on the first day. I mean, the cost savings doesn't come in on the first day, but you sign the papers that need to be done, so you reduce costs on the first day. The second is to give people the opportunity to be in Medicare if they want, anyone who's 50 or older, and expand the coverage for Medicare. It's to offer Medicare for all complete health care coverage to everyone else who wants it.
NF: In the last month or so, your — I know you don't poll, but others do, and your poll numbers have gone down, and it seems to coincide with your major rollout of your health plan and the attacks you've gotten, basically painting you as extremist, going too far, both from Wall Street, from other candidates and elsewhere. And I'm wondering if that's because people are afraid of what you're proposing as much as others might like it?
So it took four presidents to pass a version of government-run health care. And even then, it is afforded to a narrow group of Americans.
But what is becoming increasingly clear is the extent to which Obamacare has become embedded in the American health care structure and how difficult it will be to craft an acceptable replacement.
Yes sir, that will be a revolution!

Without the mandate, many healthy people are expected to drop coverage, driving up prices for those who need it most, and ultimately causing even more people to drop out of the individual market.

Finally, McCain recognized that the military wasn't the only way that Washington could use its awesome power for good. When I interviewed him during the 2008 presidential campaign, he described his economic hero as Theodore Roosevelt — a free-enterprise, capitalist, full-bore guy who realized that prosperity depended on government agencies that need to do their job as well. The outlook led him to favor policies (albeit too sporadically) to fight climate change and expand community colleges.
Honestly, I'm really content to let Michelle play the reactionary in this conversation and just sort of sit back and listen. But, no, Farhad, I wanted to just challenge you a little bit on what you said about your feeling of disappointment in your children's adoption of gender roles. We have three kids, and our oldest two kids are girls. They're eight and six. And until my son was born, we had a very female-oriented domestic space in the sense that most of the books and toys and clothes and everything else were girl clothes— not in sort of a hyper-gendered way but in a sort of stereotypically gendered way. And I tried to interest my girls in Wiffle ball and various things, and they tended to be more interested in fairy tales and dolls and so on. And then my son was born. And so his experience of his childhood was of femininity as a norm. I mean, I read to him the girl books that I read to my daughters. And to the extent that it's possible, I think he had, at the very least, a sort of gender-neutral entry into consciousness. And when he was about two and a half, one of my girls brought home a book about Blackbeard the pirate. And he, entirely unbidden, picked it up and immediately became obsessed with it to the point where he would wear a pirate hat to school every day.
Half the consulting class on our side has spent half of their careers, if not more, running opposition campaigns. They have had the tailwind of resentment and grievance fueling popular anger. Now they have to flip the script. They have to learn to highlight accomplishments like tax reform, job creation and regulatory relief.
Part two is again, we should be working more with our allies. Donald Trump seems to think somehow that we are stronger alone and I think that's fundamentally wrong. If you want to bring economic pressure on China, if you want to bring diplomatic pressure on China, it makes a lot more sense to do that if we're doing it with our allies, if we're doing it in conjunction with others. And I think that provides potentially much better protection for Hong Kong. The idea that this is going to be a direct military conflict between China and the United States, that would be deeply destabilizing to the entire world. So I want to see us use our diplomatic tools. I want to see us use our economic tools, and I want to see us leverage everything that we want to do by working much more tightly in conjunction with our allies. We just haven't been doing that. None of the above.
Concerns about the degree to which Mr. Epstein received lenient treatment thanks to his affluence and connections have been percolating since November, when an investigative series by a Miami Herald reporter, Julie Brown, revived interest in the case. Mr. Acosta does not come off well as the United States attorney who worked hand-in-glove with Mr. Epstein's legal team on the secret nonprosecution agreement that shielded him from federal charges, ended a related F.B.I. investigation and granted immunity to any co-conspirators. When a new indictment against Mr. Epstein was unsealed in a federal court in New York on Monday, the resulting outcry spurred the White House to push the labor secretary to hold a news conference Wednesday to defend himself.
KK: Well, so you're going to kill the filibuster?
KK: Throughout America, many jobs that were once held by American union members have been replaced and are now held by undocumented immigrants. Does that drive down wages in the United States?
And the court agreed with him, ruling just hours later that the governor did not have the power to postpone the Tuesday primary, meaning the election will go on in person today.
They're spending a lot of time together.
The outlook after that is murky, to say the least. President Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress are working to dismantle former President Barack Obama's signature health law, known as Obamacare. But repealing and replacing the law, which has expanded health insurance to an estimated 20 million people through individual marketplace plans and the expansion of state Medicaid programs, is complicated. Several proposals have been floated, but it's not yet clear which, if any, will prevail. And Congress has yet to confirm Tom Price, Mr. Trump's nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Healthcare.gov.
individuals with Republican representatives experience an oligarchic mode of representation, in which wealthy individuals receive much more representation than those lower on the economic ladder.
As it stands, all of this is obviously unlikely. It's also striking to see how far the president is from the center of American politics. The most expansive Democratic proposals for strengthening the social safety net are far closer to the political mainstream than the great majority of Trump's actions as president. And he shows no sign of changing course. Trump is still committed to his base, still obsessed with mobilizing his strongest supporters. This may get big crowds in friendly territory, but it might not be enough to win a second term in 2020.
But immediate policy doesn't tell the whole story. You also want to look at Trump's appointments. When it comes to policies that affect workers, Trump has created a team of cronies: Almost every important position has gone to a lobbyist or someone with strong financial connections to industry. Labor interests have received no representation at all.
In a wide-ranging interview with The New York Times, the president also accused James B. Comey, the F.B.I. director he fired in May, of trying to leverage a dossier of compromising material to keep his job. Mr. Trump criticized both the acting F.B.I. director who has been filling in since Mr. Comey's dismissal and the deputy attorney general who recommended it. And he took on Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel now leading the investigation into Russian meddling in last year's election.
I'll — start — I want to lie about you, that's why I ran the ad that said Mark Zuckerberg endorses Donald Trump, and they said, We'll take your money for that one, until they discovered what it actually said and said: Wait a minute. Not if you're going to talk about Mark Zuckerberg. Whoa.
Health care unions amplify the voices of frontline workers overwhelmed by pandemic conditions. Registered nurses demonstrated against unsafe staffing practices at Good Samaritan Hospital in San Jose, Calif., in December. Credit... Sarahbeth Maney for The New York Times The unions representing the nation's health care workers have emerged as increasingly powerful voices during the still-raging pandemic. With more than 100,000 Americans hospitalized and many among their ranks infected, nurses and other health workers remain in a precarious frontline against the coronavirus and have turned again and again to unions for help. Nurses across the country from various unions are participating in dozens of strikes and protests. National Nurses United, the country's largest union of registered nurses, held a day of action on Wednesday with demonstrations in more than a dozen states and Washington, D.C., as it starts negotiations at hospitals owned by big systems like HCA, Sutter Health and CommonSpirit Health. It's so overwhelming. It's unlike anything I've ever seen before, said Erin McIntosh, a nurse at Riverside Community Hospital in Southern California, a part of the country that has been among the hardest hit by a surge in cases. Every day I'm waist-deep in death and dying. Hospitals said the unions are playing politics during a public health emergency and say they have no choice but to ask more of their workers. But health care workers say they have been bitterly disappointed by their employers' and government agencies' response to the pandemic.
All of these storylines have at least some truth to them. Like a stopped clock, they sometimes have a lot of truth. But they are indeed like a stopped clock. They never change.
Mr. Obama was already pivoting to health care reform, so why not encharge Mr. Biden? As it turned out, Mr. Biden's work on the rollout, implementation, oversight and selling of the 2009 stimulus — officially the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act — was the most sustained, and perhaps the most significant, assignment of his time in office.
When told that former Vice President Biden criticized her health care plans, Senator Warren answered with a critique of moderate Democrats: Democrats are not going to win by repeating Republican talking points and by dusting off the points of view of the giant insurance companies and the giant drug companies. She also suggested Mr. Biden is running in the wrong primary.
But Mr. Civiletti argued that it was illegal for the government to spend money without congressional appropriations. The few exceptions included work by federal employees to protect life and property, he wrote.
Indeed, the story of this bill may be the story of how Biden has repudiated the austerity politics of much of the last decade, as well as the anti-assistance paradigm he himself helped forge when, as a senator, he warned in 1988 of welfare mothers driving luxury cars and voted, in 1996, to make so-called welfare reform a reality.
I am in this fight because my daddy ended up as a janitor. I got my big chance at a commuter college that cost $50 a semester, because a bunch of taxpayers had invested in that college. That opportunity is not there today. That same college costs $15,000 now. Kids have to load up on debt to go there today. That's not expanding opportunity in this country. We've got a choice to make as a nation and the good news about 2020, the door has opened just a crack, that all the things that have been broken for so long, Donald Trump has made so much worse and gotten so many people off the sidelines, we actually have a chance. Not just to nibble, but to make big change.
Mr. Trump requested no funding at all for the initiative in his 2018 budget request, effectively eliminating the program, though Congress ended up appropriating nearly $300 million. His latest budget proposes a 90 percent cut to the program, reducing funding to $30 million.
We need to make sure that every American is able to get health care.
And who has benefited from those systems in the past, and who might benefit if they were to change along the lines of what Governor Evers is asking for?
You can also only do a limited number of budget reconciliation packages each fiscal year. That forces legislators to craft giant bills that jam every legislative priority into one rushed package, rather than crafting one bill, debating and modifying it, and then passing it and moving onto the next.
JI: I just want to pause here for one second. You'll have ——
KK: You seem to have avoided that approach for the most part. Can you just explain why?
Kushner also exemplifies the degree to which Trump not only prizes the fresh eyes of people from outside of politics, which is sensible, but downright fetishizes them, which isn't. To the extent that the administration is staffed, it teems with government naïfs, and that has been apparent in the botched composition and rollout of executive orders and in the failed attempt to undo Obamacare.
I'm sorry, say it again. Facebook?
The company cited an initial analysis of data about the type of customers who signed up for its plans this year, and it said that it saw no evidence that the market was improving but that it was seeing further signs of an unbalanced risk pool, as customers with expensive medical conditions continued to enroll as compared with healthy people.
It's true that some calculations indicate that means-tested programs — programs available only to those with sufficiently low incomes — can create disincentives for working and earning. But the evidence suggests that while safety net programs have some adverse effect on incentives, it's a much smaller effect than many policymakers believe.
I'm sorry this has been such a disjointed effort here because of the connections, Mr. Biden said as he wrapped up his final answer, to a question about whether he supports the Endangered Species Act. (He does, he said. Oh, I love you, the questioner replied.) There's a lot more to say, but I've probably said too much to you, Mr. Biden added.
If a plan looks too good to be true, be skeptical, she said.
A 2018 Gallup poll found that a record-high 75 percent of Americans say immigration is a positive, including majorities of all parties. Yet immigration reform has become a wedge issue in Congress, with the government brought to a shutdown multiple times over issues like the treatment of Dreamers and the funding for Mr. Trump's border wall.
In November 1981, President Ronald Reagan, in a fight with Congress over $8.5 billion in budget cuts he wanted, ordered the furlough of 241,000 government employees. It was the first time a shutdown of that size was ordered.
In his speech, Nordhaus explained that people use too much dirty energy because they don't have to pay the true costs it imposes on the world: pollution-related health problems in the short term and climate change in the long term. Economists refer to these costs as externalities, because they are not naturally part of the market system. We have a climate problem, Nordhaus said, because markets fail, and fail badly, in the energy sector. The only solution, he argued, was for governments to raise the price of emissions.
Well, kind of most clearly, the factors around the decision changed.
Both Democratic and Republican members of Congress had also urged the administration to consider a special enrollment period. But Congress declined to require such an enrollment period in its last round of coronavirus legislation, instead leaving the decision to federal officials.
And I say good jobs because when the wealth of the top 1 percent equals that of the bottom 90 percent, we do have to redivide the pie. I favor raising taxes on the wealthiest Americans to subsidize universal pre-K education and to reduce the burden of student loans. Let's give kids a head start and college grads a fresh start.
This week, as Republican efforts to repeal the law known as Obamacare appeared all but dead, Mr. Brahin, a 58-year-old lawyer and self-described fiscal hawk, said his feelings had evolved.
The House passed the bill, voting almost entirely along party lines, 234 to 179, just hours after the Trump administration announced it had secured 500,000 treatment courses of a newly approved drug to treat Covid-19, remdesivir, but at a price. The drug's maker, Gilead Sciences, will charge at least $2,340 per course, after weeks of donating the drug to hospitals with severely ill patients.
To me, then, Medicare for America — which lets people keep employment-based insurance — looks like a much better bet for actually getting universal coverage than Medicare for All. But I could be wrong! And it's fine to spend the next few months arguing the issue.
Does the administration really think that the very position it advanced just months ago is so untenable that it must now adopt one that is even more extreme?

Expanded use of short-term policies could further fragment the individual market, which would lead to higher premiums for many consumers, particularly those with pre-existing conditions, said Kristine Grow, a spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group for insurers.
Ms. Warren was likely referring to reporting by Sarah Kliff in The Times in November chronicling a rise in hospitals' suing patients over overdue bills.
A C.D.C. study in rural Wisconsin shows little in-school transmission. Elementary students in Wausau, Wis. A study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in one rural Wisconsin county showed that the rate of transmission in Wood County schools was well below the county's rate of infection. Credit... Jenn Ackerman for The New York Times Rigorous scientific studies tracing the transmission of coronavirus in schools have been few and far between during the pandemic. But on Tuesday, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention published a study of 17 rural schools in Wisconsin that found there was little in-school transmission, even though the virus was raging in the surrounding communities. Experts and advocates have pointed to the study as evidence that it is possible to keep schools open safely even when community transmission is high, provided that mitigation measures — including strongly enforced requirements to wear masks and keeping students in stable groups — are used. Among 5,530 students and staff members in Wood County, Wis., there were 191 coronavirus cases reported during the study, from Aug. 31 to Nov. 29. Only seven cases were attributed to in-school transmission, all among students. There was no surveillance testing, so some asymptomatic cases might have been missed. Overall, the rate of infection among students and staff was about one-third lower than in the county as a whole.
Same story for Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, who says she's struggling to figure out what to do. Last week Murkowski responded fervently in support of former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis's anti-Trump essay in which he urged Americans to unite without him and create a better world. There are, everybody knows, a great many things the country needs to do to make a brighter tomorrow. But the without him part does seem to be the critical priority.
But if there is ever going to be a viable claim along these lines, this is it. After all, no court has ever held that the president has the power to consciously aim, in bad faith, to destroy Congress' handiwork. Yet with his attacks on this law, that is precisely what Mr. Trump has been doing. No matter how you feel about Obamacare, we should all care about that.
Here's what you need to know:
All three health care taxes have been extensively discussed and debated by Congress since the passage of the Affordable Care Act.
Many readers seized the invitation to suggest running mates for Donald Trump as a chance to have some fun. Of the 100-plus names mentioned, more than half were in jest. Many were foreign, dead, fictional or in prison. They included cartoon characters (Donald Duck, Dory, Homer Simpson, Bozo, Ronald McDonald, Frito Bandito, Elmer Fudd); foreign politicians (Boris Johnson, Marine Le Pen, Vladimir Putin); reality-TV stars (Kim Kardashian, Snooki); sports figures (Tom Brady, Charles Barkley); comedians (Larry David, Don Rickles, Bill Cosby, Jerry Lewis, Groucho Marx); and convicts (Bernie Madoff, El Chapo, Whitey Bulger). Here's a small sampling.
The question is why such policies were ever popular. The answer, I think, is that in the past, voters didn't see the connections.
This is a campaign to help people meet their responsibility.
Alex Kingsbury: The Trump administration has made an effort to get Europeans to pay more for their own defense as being part of NATO. Is that a goal that you support even if you don't support the way he's going about it? And how might you achieve those goals?
As a young professor on a sabbatical in Vienna in the mid-1970s, Nordhaus happened to share an office with an environmental researcher, who helped spark his interest in the emerging issue. While there, Nordhaus came up with the target, now famous, of holding global warming to two degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. He chose the target, as he recently explained to me, because he believed that the earth has experienced similar fluctuations before and that humans had tolerated them.

Judge Rosemary M. Collyer sided with the House in its challenge to the administration's funding of a program to help as many as seven million lower-income people pay deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses under the law. Congress never provided explicit authority for the spending, she ruled.
Look what Frances Perkins got accomplished, first in Albany, but then when she went down to Washington. So here's a woman, she goes to Albany at a time when women don't even have the vote and gets herself appointed the head of a fire commission. And by the way, every time you see one of those lit-up fire exit signs, thank Frances Perkins, O.K.? But she not only does that, she then immediately expands it into labor law and workers and worker safety and worker protection overall. As you know, she then goes down to Washington, becomes the first woman cabinet official, and look at what she gets done in a short period of time. Social security, minimum wage, right to join a union, end of child labor, the weekend, my personal favorite [LAUGHTER], that Saturdays and Sundays are not treated like Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. But think about it that way. So we start with the corruption. That's what Perkins started with. She started by outing the corruption.
But what about the problems that sank the repeal effort in 2017? Surely Republicans have spent the past year rethinking their policy ideas, trying to come up with ways to undo the A.C.A. without inflicting enormous harm on ordinary Americans, especially those with pre-existing medical conditions. Right?

The way I think we get something done in Washington, it's the Frances Perkins story. It's not enough to organize on the outside and have the marches in the street. Before the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire, there had been dozens of marches, right? Lots of high profile. But the guys who ran the factories figured out it was a lot cheaper just to grease palms in Albany than it was to actually change their practices and put up adequate fire escapes and fire preventive measures. So just pushing from the outside, it's not enough to get it done. Just fighting it from the inside is not enough to get it done. But the one-two punch of pushing from the outside and leading it from the inside is where you see real difference.
Vietnam recorded nine more coronavirus cases on Friday, including one in the capital, Hanoi, as a new outbreak spread beyond the two northern provinces where infections had first been detected a day earlier. Officials put the number of cases from the latest outbreak at 93 as of Friday afternoon but said that it could reach 30,000, nearly 20 times the number of cases that Vietnam detected during the entire first year of the pandemic. Vietnam has been among the most successful countries in containing the virus, with strict border controls, mask-wearing, contact tracing and isolation of infected people. The latest outbreak comes as officials from the governing Communist Party meet to select the country's new leaders, an event held once every five years.

March 4, 2020, 1:15 a.m. ET March 4, 2020, 1:15 a.m. ET How the vote is shaping up in California. LOS ANGELES — California appeared poised to deliver a victory to Bernie Sanders Tuesday night, with Latinos and young people driving much of the support. With 415 pledged delegates, California is by far the biggest prize of Super Tuesday, and Mr. Sanders had been banking on a significant win there. Along with Mr. Sanders, both Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Michael R. Bloomberg seemed likely to receive delegates in the state, based on early returns. Mr. Bloomberg poured $66 million into television advertising there, far more than any other candidate. Mr. Sanders won more white and Asian-American voters but, reflecting a national trend, Mr. Biden won among black voters, according to exit polls. There was also a clear generational split, with Mr. Sanders winning decisively among voters under 49 but Mr. Biden winning handily with voters older than 50. Mr. Sanders appeared to win among voters at all education levels, according to exit polls. Read more
Here's what I told John. He's president, and I've seen you, once the election was over, embrace people.
And the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh for the Supreme Court deserves special attention. There's a lot we don't know about Kavanaugh, partly because Senate Republicans are blocking Democratic requests for more information. But we do know he's starkly, extremely, anti-labor — way to the right of the mainstream, and well to the right even of most Republicans.
Pero eso era antes. Ahora, cinco meses después de haber dejado el cargo, Obama básicamente observa en silencio cómo su sucesor lanza un martillo contra distintos pilares de su legado. Ladrillo por ladrillo, el presidente Donald Trump está tratando de destruir lo que Obama construyó. ¿El tratado comercial? Cancelado. ¿El acuerdo climático? Olvídenlo. ¿Cuba? Un retroceso. ¿El seguro médico? Su destino todavía no está decidido, pero va a ser revocado si Trump logra navegar por las contracorrientes en el congreso.

There's no deputy secretary of state, the official told me. There's no deputy secretary of defense. He ticked off an array of other unfilled positions, insisted that these gaps can't all be chalked up to some noble desire to shrink government and said that they pretty much prevent any meaningful follow-through on whatever bold ideas Kushner might hatch. Trump just thinks, 'Oh, yeah, Jared's in charge of that.' In charge of what? What's he running? You need a bureaucratic infrastructure.
Since entering the Democratic race in November, former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg has outspent almost all of his opponents in TV advertisements, spending over $100 million in just the first month.
So I actually disagree with a lot of what Farhad said, even though, Farhad, I think you and I come from a pretty similar place ideologically. I agree with you both about the prison of gender expectations and about the need for they to refer to people who don't want to identify with a gender. So I'm old enough that the word still trips me up a little bit. But you know, I use it, and you need it for the people who want it. Where I disagree is the idea that it should be universalized, for a couple of reasons. I mean, first of all, I think there is a real difference between changing language to adapt to an underlying changing reality and trying to use language to change the underlying reality. I think the second is very fraught. It enrages people. It makes them feel like they're being forced to participate in a lie or in propaganda. I think that people's attachment to the gender binary is extremely deep. And different societies and different cultures attribute different qualities to men and women. So these qualities aren't essential. They're extremely historically contingent. And this can be changed when they don't suit us anymore. There might be an argument to make for rooting this out altogether. But it's very hard, for at least me, to picture what that society would look like.
I'll defend the Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the Trump administration. That I can do all by myself.
Senator Warren, then a Harvard professor, first introduced the idea of a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in a 2007 paper in the journal Democracy. President Obama assigned her to build the agency after the 2008 financial crisis.
But allowing for the low bar, March and April brought a lot of good news for Donald Trump. For one thing, his basic political position has improved: He's up to 44 percent job approval in the RealClearPolitics average and 41 percent in FiveThirtyEight, some of the highest numbers since the beginning of his administration. And his party's situation has improved too, with the Democratic generic ballot lead no longer large enough to guarantee a wipeout of the G.O.P.
Americans remain divided over President Obama's most significant legislative achievement, even as 20 million people have gained coverage under the law and the percentage of those without insurance has dropped to record lows. Mr. Trump and Republican leaders of the House and the Senate have vowed to repeal the 2010 law as one of the first legislative actions of the Trump era.
A lot needs to get sorted out and it's complicated, Mr. Flentje replied.
I think that our politics has never really been intended to function as a pure majoritarian politics. One of the most important insights that are built into the constitutional system are that a functional republic, to be stable, has to not only enable enduring majorities to have their way, but also protect durable minorities, large ones. And that means that there are all kinds of structures in the system that compel accommodation, that require differing factions to work together, if they're going to achieve anything. And I think those are enormously important. I think a politics where a narrow majority — and the Democrats have narrow majorities in both houses now, in the Senate, barely even that — where a narrow majority could just advance its agenda and then see what the public says at the next election is not a good idea for American society in this moment. I think we are much better served by a politics that compels some work across party lines in order to get anywhere. And Congress has always been designed that way. Congress was not intended to be like the European parliament, where the majority rules for as long as the public will let it. It is a place where the country works out its differences. The weakening of Congress over decades now has, not by coincidence, brought with it a weakening of our capacity to work out differences in our politics.
In the senate, Mr. McCain was the Democrats' near-perfect instrument for hectoring Republicans. He relished his role as a gadfly, and Democrats were eager to encourage him because doing so made the Republican conference less united and less effective. Of course, the paeans to Mr. McCain ended briefly when he ran for president against Barack Obama.
The insurance exchanges were expected to be a major supplement to that system for people who do not have access to employer plans or government programs. But enrollment in the exchanges — 11 million at the end of March — is far below expectations, and insurers say it must increase to produce a better, more sustainable mix of healthy and less healthy consumers.
But an effective speech is not the same thing as an effective agenda, and right now there are no prospects for Trump's popular ideas getting enacted or even really considered on the Hill. His party's ideologues don't want them, the opposition party doesn't want to make a deal with Trump to get them, and his White House doesn't actually have any detail behind the rhetoric. The ideas are just things that the president would probably like to do but that someone will talk him out of, or that he'll forget about, or that he'll offer in a halfhearted way and that Congress will never bother to take up.
So what you have described is a pretty radical idea that would upend a huge segment of the U.S. economy. It would require major changes to the tax code. So I wonder if there's any practical chance that this actually could get through our legislative and political process to become the U.S. health care system.
You wrote a book arguing that the left-right divide is all there, or at least a version of it is all there, in the debates between Edmund Burke and Thomas Paine. So if someone has never read any primary sources from either person, where should they start?
The association rule is also likely to combine with other policy changes, as Mr. Trump notes. Congress recently repealed the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate, which means that Americans who decline to buy insurance won't face a penalty, beginning next year. Another regulation is expected soon that would permit insurers to offer short-term plans for longer periods, perhaps for a year. Mr. Trump is right that the associations are part of a larger set of policies meant to chip away at Obamacare, and are likely to destabilize its markets for individual and small business insurance.
Kathleen Kingsbury: So we don't have very much time together. We all know your résumé and your bio, and many of us have met you in the past, so you don't mind if we just jump right into questions?
These days, no less an authority than Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said recently that God wanted Donald Trump to become president.
Why would we want to plunge ourselves back into that situation?
Asked about the most important steps Mr. Biden could take to energize young progressive voters, Mr. Barkan replied that the presumptive nominee's biggest opportunity to excite young progressive voters is by selecting Elizabeth Warren to be his vice president.
So let me push back on what your theory of change is, because the way the Affordable Care Act worked is we passed it, and then it was four years later when the benefits came in, and they kind of bumped into place, right? Look at it the other way around. What I propose is as many people can get into it as want to get into it, and then once they're in, try taking it away from them, because that's what the fight then shifts to. How did we end up hanging on to the Affordable Care Act when the Republicans had the House, the Senate and the White House? The answer was we ended up hanging on to it because enough people across this country said, You're not going to take this away from me.
Why attacking corruption and getting some structural change in our economy that actually is about not just the wealth gap top to bottom, but this fact that more and more and more of our value is being sucked up to the top, and more and more people are sliding back behind it. And not having power at the polls. How those three things are tied to each other.
Fauci, addressing teachers, urges a speedy return to school. About a third of U.S. school are entirely remote. Credit... Bridget Bennett for The New York Times Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, addressing more than 6,000 American teachers in a video meeting, said Thursday evening that students need to return to the classroom for the country to begin recovering. We are not going to get back to normal until we get the children back in school, for the good of the children, the good of the parents and the good of the community, he said. Attending a meeting convened by the two national teachers unions, Dr. Fauci brought with him the message of the Biden administration: that all K-8 schools should aim to reopen within the next 100 days. He said they can expect support from Washington in the form of a new stimulus package to fund sanitation upgrades and other safety measures. As of last month, about one third of American school districts were operating entirely remotely, and Dr. Fauci acknowledged that mitigating factors may make the 100-day goal difficult to achieve in some places. Fielding questions submitted by educators, he did not hesitate to acknowledge potential dangers. He discussed the emergence of new variants of the coronavirus that appear more contagious and more resistant to vaccines. And he said that while he expected vaccines to prevent inoculated teachers from passing the virus onto their loved ones, there was not yet concrete evidence that would be the case.
The case was originally brought by Republican state officials, who argued that changes to the Affordable Care Act made by Congress in 2017 rendered the law's requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance unconstitutional. The Trump administration sided with the state officials, arguing that the rest of the health care law could not survive without the requirement, sometimes called the individual mandate.
I have not finished reading the report, but they look like they've laid out their ducks. The Trump administration evidently does not wish to put up a defense and call its own witnesses. In fact, it seems to be still in the process of trying to block witnesses from coming and block documents from exposure. Yeah. And look, I think they've got enough. And if they've got enough, it can't be that the House impeachment process is the tail that gets wagged by Donald Trump based on when he's willing to allow access to various witnesses or various documents. Not even Richard Nixon tried to stop people from testifying or tried to stop the House from getting access to documentation. So they've got what they've got. If it's enough, then go forward.
But it's not going to be real change because so long as the lobbyists are writing it, so long as they're the ones who are in the ears of the folks in the House and the Senate, we're just going to keep making little, tiny changes, and I just don't think we can keep doing that.
I've been especially interested in the way Britain revived itself between 1820 and 1848. Its comeback has some humbling lessons for us today.
Well, real dismay and surprise and sort of horror.
The Affordable Care Act established so-called risk corridors meant to help insurance companies cope with the risks they took when they decided to participate in the law's marketplaces without knowing who would sign up for coverage. Under the program, the federal government would limit insurance companies' gains and losses on insurance sold in the marketplaces from 2014 through 2016.
In other words, what would look to an outside observer — or skeptical judge — as a conspiracy to mislead the public about the reason for asking people about their citizenship status was really a conspiracy between the plaintiffs and the media. What was this doing in a court filing? Either the administration's witnesses lied to Judge Furman or they didn't. Either the real reason for asking about citizenship was to help minority communities or to hurt them. What did the reporting have to do with it?
MC: No, I'm just saying ——
In some ways, the development of the right vocabulary for this is the first challenge, and it is the kind of work that some people like us might do. And we, at AEI, have been trying to do this for a while. People can find on the AEI website a project over the past year that has tried to define the nature of the power being exercised. And it is extremely difficult to do. I think that it challenges us to think about the nature of the public square, to think about the nature of access to information. But we're going to have to find that vocabulary in a way that rings plausible to a majority of the American public, and we're pretty far away from that. It is certainly true that bad cases make bad law in this situation. Those bad cases often involve failures of restraint and self-control, which in some ways, these platforms invite, but which, nonetheless, they're not exactly responsible for. I think it is imperative for people who exercise power or who want to be taken seriously to be off these platforms, to not be on Twitter. I don't think journalists should be on Twitter. I don't think Joe Biden should be on Twitter. He should discourage any politician from being on Twitter. You lose something by that. You could lose a lot by that in the media.
That's right. Around the same time that Congress passed Medicare, they also created a program called Medicaid that served the very poor in America. But essentially, there was a huge group of Americans in the middle who were left out of both programs.
Several legal experts have identified trouble spots in the drafting of the provision that could cause conflicts with other parts of the law. Various other insurance regulations depend on the federal benefit package, including a rule preventing insurers from imposing annual limits on how much care they will cover. Experts also say that, because of the way the provision was written, it may, in fact, fail to eliminate the federal benefit rules for most purposes.
Senator Warren called for the House of Representatives to begin impeachment inquiry proceedings against Mr. Trump as early as April 2019.
It's one of the reasons that I pursued the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he said, bringing up the free-trade pact that, uniquely, has divided both parties, not because I'm not aware of all the failures of some past trade agreements and the disruptions to our economy that occurred as a consequence of globalization, but rather my assessment that most trends are irreversible given the nature of global supply chains, and so we better be out there shaping the rules in ways that allow for higher labor standards overseas, or try to export our environmental standards overseas so that we have more of a level playing field.
BA: Would you reduce existing access in order to achieve that goal?
So whenever people are being paid outside the legal system, it undercuts protection for everyone and gives an advantage to the employers who move outside the legal system. You know, look, it's part of the same basic principle. Everybody should follow the same set of rules. And if our labor standards are there's a $15-an-hour minimum wage, then everybody should pay it. If the labor standards are that you don't get to put somebody up working in an elevator shaft who has no training, then every employer should have to follow that. And any time an employer can get the work done by not following the rules, that employer gets an unfair advantage, and that unfair advantage undercuts the strength of everybody who follows the rules, undercuts the economy, undercuts workers.
Actually, I don't think of what I say that way. What I think of is the leadership possibilities that the candidates for president are offering. I don't know anybody who sits around and says, I want to make peace with corruption. I don't know where those people are in America who think it's O.K. that Amazon makes $11 billion and pays nothing in taxes. I haven't seen those people. Now, maybe they just stay away from me, but I don't think so. I think —
There we go. But the point is there are some things about tech that are special. I mean, that we're seeing for the first time. Ways that you can be anti-competitive that we hadn't seen before, just like that was true in the early 1900s about, you know — you had the oil supply, and you also owned all the gas stations and how that one worked. We broke that apart.
But though the discharge petition had stalled, King and Heritage Action could justifiably declare a victory of principle and, eventually, an I-told-you-so. Overall, those who pledged fealty to repealing Obamacare fared better that November than those who didn't. As King told me recently: The Barry Jacksons and the John Cornyns were clearly wrong. Look at what happened to the Blue Dogs in 2010. There were 53 of them when Obamacare passed. Now I don't know if you can count three of them. King was exaggerating, but not by much — there are 18 members of Congress's Blue Dog Coalition today. Pelosi made them walk the plank, and they fell like tenpins after that. Since then, I don't think there's been a freshman Republican who didn't run on the full repeal of Obamacare.
CW: Well, during the debate he said it was a 20th-century —
Well, what exactly does that path look like, then, from where we are in the minds of these Democratic candidates to a someday-world where Medicare for all, as envisioned by someone like Bernie Sanders, could ever be a reality?
WASHINGTON — The Trump administration asked a federal appeals court on Monday to delay ruling on a lawsuit that could determine whether the government will continue paying subsidies under the Affordable Care Act to health insurance companies for the benefit of low-income people — effectively prolonging uncertainty that is already rattling the health law.
KK: Why? Do you mind telling?
I'm Ezra Klein, and this is The Ezra Klein Show. So whether you're a new listener of the show or an old listener of the show, something you're probably catching on to is that a lot of the way I think about legislative politics is about the Senate. A project of this show is to try to get you and everyone else to care about Senate rules. Because no matter what it is you care about — a minimum wage, a Green New Deal, gun control, democracy reform — whether or not bills can pass the Senate is the debate upstream of that question. So many of our policy debates, we have and we fight them out and we care about them, and nobody ever seems to realize that they're moot because nothing passes the Senate. Obviously, the key reason nothing passes the Senate is the mutation of the filibuster into a 60-vote supermajority threshold for basically everything — not literally everything, but basically everything. And this is one of those places where you really need to convince people something has changed. Because we've had a filibuster for a long time. As you're going to hear in this episode, it used to be technically stronger. It used to be unbreakable. But it wasn't used very often. And so I want to begin with this statistic. From 1917 to 1970, the Senate took 49 votes to break filibusters — 49. Those are cloture votes. That is fewer than one each year.
Five. Five percent. We are widening racial wealth gaps in this country right now. Opportunity is shrinking for our children, and people see this. It's 12 years later. It's 20 years later from a whole set of promises that this was going to get better, and it hasn't gotten better, but people watch at the same moment. They don't look around and see a country that's getting poor. Look out your window, right? They don't look around and say, God, America's really on a downslide. They look out and they say, America is doing great. G.D.P. keeps going up. The stock market keeps going up, unemployment is down, but my family is stretched to the breaking point. My debt load is bigger than ever, and I look over the edge and see where my children are headed. I don't even see my children able to replicate what I have. I don't see them able to buy my house. I don't see them having even the job stability I had. I see them carrying more debt at 19 than I carried at 35.
In Oklahoma, parents with dependent children generally cannot obtain Medicaid if their household income is more than about half of the poverty level — higher than $9,240 for a three-person family. Adults generally cannot get Medicaid at all if they do not have dependent children and they are not elderly, disabled or pregnant.
So my plan to forgive student loan debt is capped at $50,000 and an income of $250,000. And the reason for that is because it is the best way, not only to give maximum forgiveness to a lot of people who are struggling, but it also helps close the black-white wealth gap, and is part of the reason that the N.A.A.C.P. endorsed it along with the other parts I was doing about investment in our colleges. But I really worked through hard on these numbers to deal with exactly that question and that's why I got the numbers where they are. I don't think they raise that same issue. I'm not ——
Senator Warren's anti-corruption plan includes provisions to extend conflict-of-interest laws to the president and vice president, compel government to divest from privately owned assets and restrict the ability of lobbyists to be hired for government jobs. It takes aim in particular at many of the practices that the Trump family has used to profit from office, which The Times has editorialized against.
O.K.? And I have seen the billionaire go on TV and cry about it.
Black leaders wanted me to issue an executive order, and proclaim this by presidential edict, said Mr. Johnson, speaking of the Fair Housing Act of 1968 — an approach that, he concluded, would not be very effective if the Congress had not legislated.
The argument that Mulvaney and others make is that if the president is going to run for re-election as a guy who made promises and kept his promises, especially to conservative voters who still care a lot about getting rid of Obamacare, he has got to take every chance he has to go against it.
After Trump won, Forbes said, Josh had to hold one-on-one meetings with nearly a hundred employees to say he is neither responsible for this administration nor able to get special favors.
So as your book demonstrates, the history of efforts to weaken the filibuster is a history of unintended consequences. Originally, the filibuster comes from a rules change that nobody quite recognizes what it's done, until, as you say, Calhoun and others understand what unlimited debate actually can mean. Then for a long time, there is no closure rule. That's until 1917, so filibuster in theory can never be broken, so long as the people doing it don't give up. Then it goes from two-thirds of the Senate down to three-fifths. And during this whole period, filibusters keep getting more and more and more frequent. The weaker it gets, the more it is used. There are a lot of reasons for this. We don't need to go into all of them. But from a liberal perspective, there is a way of worrying that getting rid of the filibuster will have an outcome they don't like, which is to say that because Republicans win rural areas and Democrats win urban ones, and the Senate is designed to overrepresent rural areas, there is somewhere between a three and seven-point Republican bias in the Senate. Democrats need to win a huge majority of the popular vote in order to win a Senate majority. Right now, 50 Democrats in the Senate represent 41 million more people than 50 Republicans in the Senate.
But you don't actually get there because so long as the filibuster is in place, you're never really playing with live ammunition. You're just talking on Twitter, as opposed to actually trying to figure out, OK, how does this become a bill? And if it became a bill that passed, would people actually like it in practice, which I think is a usefully disciplining system.
For Marque Dailey of Dallas, 35, who has multiple sclerosis, the Affordable Care Act was the only way to get private insurance. Before the law, insurance companies were allowed to deny coverage to people like him who had expensive medical conditions, or to charge such a high price that many could not afford the premiums. About half of all Americans had such pre-existing conditions, including high blood pressure or lung disease, that resulted in their being denied or potentially priced out of coverage, according to one federal estimate.
Well, Mr. Trump's base strategy is producing precisely that kind of enthusiasm gap in the polls I am conducting for Democracy Corps and its partners, the Women's Voices Women Vote Action Fund and the American Federation of Teachers. Mr. Trump's strategy is to continue to build support with the Tea Party supporters and evangelicals who make up a plurality of those who identify as Republicans, but they are by no means the whole of the party. And Mr. Trump shows as much interest in winning over those less enthusiastic Republicans as he does in winning independents and Democrats — which is to say, not much.
JI: People were opposed to it until ——
Former Gov. John Hickenlooper of Colorado was asked to address his criticism of Mr. Sanders' policies, and Ms. Gillbrand attempted to provide middle ground.
At a White House meeting with members of the hard-line Freedom Caucus earlier on Thursday, Mr. Trump had agreed to the conservatives' demands to strip federal health insurance requirements for basic benefits such as maternity care, emergency services, mental health and wellness visits from the bill. But that was not enough to placate the faction, part of the reason that Thursday's vote was placed on hold.
But you were backed by Justice Democrats, the national group that has been playing up that distinction between progressives and moderates. You did seem to benefit from your association with that national fight.
Sadly, all governors are not created equal. Ron DeSantis of Florida was still dithering about a shelter-in-place order when the state was hovering around 7,000 coronavirus cases. DeSantis said he'd make the call if the White House told him to, and Trump, even on Tuesday, was saying that it was up to DeSantis. On Wednesday DeSantis finally gave the order, but history is going to remember him as the guy who didn't see any point in banning partygoers from the beach during spring break.
Forty-two percent of Americans in that survey favored a single-payer system along the lines of what Mr. Sanders is proposing, while 31 percent opposed it and 25 percent did not take a position. Views of the Affordable Care Act are split right down the middle, with 50 percent approving of it and 48 percent disapproving of it in an April poll by Gallup.
So we have a shrinking supply and a growing population, and that means tens of millions of people are paying more to get less. So how can you turn that around? And the answer is to make a bigger investment in housing supply directly. And that includes housing for middle-class families, for working-class families, for the working poor, for the poor, for seniors who want to age in place, for people with disabilities, for people who've been incarcerated. Expanding housing supply directly, but also using federal dollars to help encourage cities and small towns and rural areas to adopt housing practices, that will lower costs even further. I just think that's a more effective way to get real structural change.
I said there were going to be two parts to this. So I've done part one about the inside/outside theory of change, but the second part, that's why we've got to do this through grass roots movement. We cannot do this through television commercials. If winning the presidency, and I'll speak only to the Democratic side, is about who comes in, and oh, let's see, drops $37 million in one week on TV ads, and that's what it takes to win a Democratic primary, then we have a democracy that's just our TV ads versus their TV ads, and at that point, they're fake news. They claim ours is fake news, right? Everybody just gets farther and farther and farther into their corners.
A CNN poll released Monday night found that 69 percent of Americans want the Senate to call new witnesses, while 26 percent do not.

I want to key in on that assumption that passing a big COVID relief bill would have just been a political game, because one of your big themes in pieces you've been writing recently, is that the Republican Party has detached itself from policy, from putting forward proactive agendas, and turned to focus on cultural grievance and conservative entertainment. Why do you think that's happened?
The health care taxes were all created as part of the Affordable Care Act, where they were designed to offset the cost of expanding insurance coverage to low- and middle-income Americans. But many of them, such as a tax on medical devices, have remained unpopular, and their implementation has been suspended or postponed before.
These instructions generally allow for exceptions, but they still alter life so fundamentally that some governors have been hesitant to order them. Here's a state-by-state look.
But it's hard. It's a lot easier not to take on the drug industry. It's a lot easier not to take on the insurance industry. It's a lot easier not to take on the oil industry. But every single issue we care about, every single issue — think about it on climate. All across this country people are saying climate, climate, climate. If you're not willing to take on the corruption, we're going to get laws passed that are going to have great names: Save the World; Everything Is Green; Now Safe for Unicorns.
She described her state's plan to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients as poor-shaming. Her friends show more empathy, she said.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Republicans are confronting an insurrection on the right that is angry enough to imperil their grip on Congress, and senior party strategists have concluded that the conservative base now loathes its leaders in Washington the same way it detested President Barack Obama.
A few early regulatory changes have begun that process. The Trump administration plans to make it harder for people to sign up for plans midyear. It has given insurers more wiggle room to raise their deductibles. It may be able to make alterations that loosen up benefit requirements — though it won't be able to completely eliminate them, as Republicans sought to do at the last minute in the failed bill.
In an off-camera briefing for reporters, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, said only that Mr. Trump has long acknowledged that Russia probably tried to influence the election, adding that it was still possible that other countries were also involved.
Mark Zuckerberg has held the line on Facebook's decision to allow political ads, even as Twitter banned them. The company's approach came under scrutiny after it said Mr. Trump's re-election campaign would be allowed to run an ad with false claims about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter. Mr. Zuckerberg said this is about free speech and not the profit motive.
The United Automobile Workers has nearly one million members. Along with the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Teachers, it has yet not taken a stance on Medicare for all.
KK: Senator, I think we need to move on.
Charlie Warzel: Senator, how do you first campaign in and then govern a country as polarized as the one that we're living in right now? Because this doesn't feel like a disagreement on a few policies. This is a situation where the cost of letting the other side wins seems almost too much to bear for the other side. And if you look at impeachment, you see politicians literally inventing alternate realities rather than compromise or disparage a party leader. How do you realistically navigate that and get things done? Because it doesn't feel like a divide that you can heal away.
And let them try it for a little while, I guess. But quickly, it's going to become clear that that's not just a fantasy, but an outright delusion. And then they're going to start to need to find ways to get to yes. And I think that shifting from saying, I'm not going eliminate it, but we have to find ways to reform it, to update it, to stop its abuse, all those things become on the table. I also think the blaming Republican option is always there. And that is a tried and true method. I mean, my former boss, Harry Reid, was similarly Shermanesque in his denials that he would ever change the filibuster. You know this very well, having covered it through this whole process. And then he changed it. And what he did was he said, rightfully, that the obstruction that Republicans waged against Obama was unprecedented, and that we'd never seen anything like it before. And they forced the issue. So I do think that, ultimately, the blame Republicans option is on the table because Republicans are going to put it on the table. They're going to obstruct pretty much everything that Biden wants to do. And Manchin and Sinema will have to choose between reforming the rules or getting nothing done.
But in subtle and not so subtle ways, the White House waged a quiet campaign to ensure that Mr. Trump had a second opportunity in his administration's first 18 months to fulfill one of his most important campaign promises to his conservative followers — that he would change the complexion and direction of the Supreme Court.
All the finger pointing has overshadowed the discussion about the actual substance of the budget deal, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, and many lawmakers don't even seem to care that the deal they are considering — which will almost certainly include even more tax cuts following the unaffordable tax bill Congress just passed, as well as new spending increases — will add tens of billions to the deficit. There is almost zero discussion of the ongoing damage on the nation's finances.

In conversations with some unions, Senator Warren has dodged the question of how she would protect existing coverage. At a recent town hall with the Culinary Workers Union, for example, she said their health care is not supposed to change but sidestepped details.
Major new programs are difficult to pass. The struggle to make them happen is almost always divisive. But if you fight that fight and win, then in addition to passing the program, you've also laid groundwork for future political victories. Despite being undermined by the Supreme Court, the Medicaid expansion has found a toehold in American politics, producing a powerful constituency for itself.

Ms. DiCola doesn't expect to need much health care this year — just a physical and a new pair of glasses, which Medicaid will cover, she said. Still, she added, You never know what could come up — my appendix could decide to burst tomorrow. In which case, Medicaid would cover the emergency room visit, surgery and hospital stay, a huge relief to Ms. DiCola, who became so anxious as Republicans in Congress tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act last summer that she felt physically ill.

Coverage gains were largest among people of middle income, older people and racial minorities. The insured rate for Hispanic Texans increased by 10.9 percentage points between 2013 and 2016, according to a study published in the American Journal of Public Health. Over that same period, coverage increased 12.1 percentage points for Texans between 50 and 64 years old, and 10.2 percentage points for those describing their health as fair or poor.
JI: So you have, on one hand, the boldest public option that's probably been offered by any of the Democratic candidates. On the other hand, you have the most aggressive Medicare for all universal plan that's been offered. You'll be, if I understand it correctly, starting with this aggressive public option hoping to segue to a Medicare for all by year three, and in the middle of all that, you will probably be called upon to defend the Affordable Care Act at the Supreme Court level. How do you think about those three — and of distinct — that just seems like an awful lot of health care reform.
At a campaign rally in Las Vegas, President Trump said that he and Republicans will protect patients with pre-existing conditions. But his Justice Department has said that those provisions under the Affordable Care Act should be overturned.
And that's when we really see the partisan pushback start.
A reporter read Mr. Trump's comment made last July in which he said that he hoped Russian intelligence services had successfully hacked Mrs. Clinton's email and encouraged them to publish whatever they may have stolen, and then the reporter asked Mr. Spicer how he could say the president took the threat of foreign meddling seriously.
Though candidates on the right are full of fire and brimstone this year, the trend away from optimism is most pronounced among liberals. A century ago Progressives were the optimists, believing society could be improved, while conservatism saw the end-times approaching. Today progressive thought embraces Judgment Day, too. Climate change, inequality and racial tension are viewed not as the next round of problems to be solved, but as proof that the United States is horrible.
So yeah, they won a bunch of seats. Medicare will pass with 55. And then because it is going to pass, a bunch of members of the Senate decide, better to be able to go home and brag about it and not get anybody running against you because you opposed Medicare than be on the wrong side of this one.
I just don't think that's Trumpification either. That is an example of a pre-existing pathology in the Republican Party where you have a hyperpartisan desire to use the courts as, basically, super legislators. But that predates Trump. I don't think anyone in Congress wants the judge to overrule Obamacare because it would be a huge mess for Republican legislators. And I think it's— I doubt that Trump himself wants it to happen. I suspect it's a faction within his administration. If the judge rules against Obamacare, it will be a partisan decision and a foolish one. But I think that's a problem with partisanship in general and Republicans in general, that it's only tangentially connected to Trump.
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected a request from Democratic state officials and the House of Representatives to quickly consider whether to hear an appeal of a decision with the potential to wipe out the entire Affordable Care Act. The move means the court will almost certainly not hear the case in its current term, which ends in June.
Medicare for all has created deep divisions on the left, particularly over questions like: How much would it really cost? Is Senator Warren's plan for raising the money for it progressive enough? Is it politically prudent to debate the issue now?
But Mr. Trump doubled down while talking to reporters in the Oval Office. He predicted that the Texas decision would be upheld by the appeals court, then go to the Supreme Court.
There really, I think, is also just a language problem here, something I've been reflecting on in this debate, because I'm uncomfortable with it. On the one hand, I support a lot of the decisions that were made. And I wrote a Twitter thread about this because everything is recursively eating its own tail in this conversation. Trump left people with no good choices. Hard cases make bad law, and Trump was a very, very hard case, as was Parler, by the way, in the way it was positioning itself in that aftermath moment. And for societies and systems to work well, you need people to abide by certain norms and disciplines and restraints, and they didn't. And so everybody was put in a position where there were no good options. But one thing I kept seeing in this is how much I think the free speech language ends up confusing both sides. So you'll see people on the right say, they're stifling free speech. And then somebody on left will say, this is not a First Amendment issue. It's not free speech. The First Amendment does not give you access to algorithmic lift on Facebook, and then kind of think they've rebutted the argument. But it was never a free speech issue, but it is an issue. It's a corporate power issue. To some degree, it got turned into a corporate social responsibility issue and an employee retention issue inside the companies themselves, if you look at their decision-making process.
BS: But I don't really hear the candidates talking about that. Why is that?
Along the way, the Justice Department has trashed the duty to defend. That's not to be taken lightly. The duty is a close cousin to the president's constitutional duty to enforce the law. If the Justice Department really thinks that Obamacare is so blatantly unconstitutional that it can't be defended, that implies that the president is violating the Constitution whenever he applies it.

The government would also have to transition. Medicare for all works only if politicians ruthlessly enforce those spending cuts. But in our system of government, members of Congress are terrible at fiscal discipline. They are quick to cater to special interest groups, terrible at saying no. To make single-payer really work, we'd probably have to scrap the U.S. Congress and move to a more centralized parliamentary system.
But a few questions caught her off guard: how to safeguard American nuclear weapons in Turkey; how to respond if China cracked down violently on protesters in Hong Kong; and what she was likely to fail at as president.
PhRMA's $6.1 million, unrestricted donation to AAN was its single-biggest grant in 2016, dwarfing its $130,000 contribution to the same group the year before. Closely associated with House Republicans — AAN has a former Republican senator and two former Republican House members on its board — the group backed the failed G.O.P. health bill intended to replace the Affordable Care Act. It also supported the successful Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which reduced corporate taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars over a decade.
One high point in the we-love-business Trumpathon came when the president brought up Mike Lindell, the head of MyPillow. (Boy do you sell those pillows.) Lindell then launched into a short infomercial for his company, followed by a eulogy to Trump as the man who had rescued a nation that had turned its back on God. It wasn't inspiring, but it was definitely a break in the routine.
The falloff suggests that Trump administration actions may have confused consumers, discouraged them from enrolling or simply made it easier to forget about the deadline.
It's odd, then, that so much of Brill's prose feels padded, as he mines his accumulated knowledge to deliver disquisitions on the Bayonne Bridge in Staten Island and the vagaries of the gas tax. (Strangely, there's no mention of a devastated post-hurricane Puerto Rico or the water crisis in Flint, Mich., except in an endnote.) He complains of lawyerly bloat in government, producing rules that were comically complicated and so long, though his own long book seems to suffer from a mild version of it. It is difficult to overstate the degree to which the ubiquity of arbitration clauses has un-leveled the playing field, he writes, as if to warn us, before giving it a try.
Is it cultural power? Is it political information power? What does that really mean? Something like the process by which American politics came to get its arms around an industrializing economy at the end of the 19th century is going to be necessary for us to get our arms around the digital economy and the tech giants, and I think we're only at the very beginning of that process. It's reasonably clear that there's going to be interest in doing some of that on both the left and the right in different ways for different reasons, and I think that's good. It's necessary. It doesn't seem to me that a pure laissez-faire approach to this is going to work because the power involved is enormous power over, as you say, the public square. And there's no solution that I've seen that strikes me as a comfortable path forward, so far.
KK: Senator, I think we need to move on.
The request could further destabilize insurance markets as insurers are developing rates and deciding whether to participate in 2018.
JW: So you think a constitutional amendment?
Even as the state voted for Barack Obama twice —
Right. Which to be clear, you do have at least one senator saying just that and some congressmen saying just that.
People understand this is good for our economy. It's good for our worldwide security. If you're not willing to get out there and fight, nothing is going to change. And yeah, the fights have to be realistic. It's why I start everything with, Here's how I'm going to pay for it. You may not like how I did, but at least I laid it out there. You don't have any doubt, and I show you where every single nickel comes from because I want it to be realistic. I didn't start with free college. I started with a 2-cent wealth tax, because we can do a 2-cent wealth tax. I started with it and said, and here's how much revenue it produces. It produces a staggering amount of revenue, far more than raising income taxes, because that's what the wealth curve looks like.
Whew: Like watching a duel with axes at three paces! Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump battled tonight in their second presidential debate, and here's my play-by-play commentary in the form of selected tweets. This isn't a column or even a formal blog post; just journalism on the fly. Here goes!
At the end of the competition, five candidates would be fired, and one lucky person would be crowned the 2016 Vice President Apprentice. This is what Americans who support Mr. Trump want to see, and, golly gee, this may also be how to make our vice presidency great again.
The biggest factors affecting what happens in November, according to political science research, are not things like the speaker of the House but so-called fundamentals, like presidential approval, the state of the economy and the number of seats the majority party is defending. And the president's party is almost always likely to take a beating; in only three midterm elections since 1934 has the party controlling the White House gained seats. Mr. Ryan's retirement is not likely to break these trends.
The new options will help people struggling to afford coverage under the 2010 law, said Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services. These plans aren't for everyone, he said, but they can provide a much more affordable option for millions of the forgotten men and women left out by the current system.
Forget the fight for the White House, if just for a moment. As the 2016 campaign rumbles into its final hours, there are other things going on around the country on Election Day that are just as important and engaging. Well, almost.
Which helps explain why climate activists have recently begun to change their political strategy. The cherished idea of economists, carbon pricing, is losing favor and being supplanted by ideas that seek to invert the political logic. Rather than broadcast the necessary sacrifices, as taxes and cap-and-trade schemes do, the alternatives try to play them down and instead emphasize the benefits of less pollution. These alternatives — like clean-energy mandates and subsidies — are less efficient than carbon pricing, as skeptics like Nordhaus point out. They don't harness market forces to the same degree, and they don't necessarily affect the entire economy. But they still have the potential to make a real difference, and in some places, like California, they already have. The question is whether any policy is both big enough to matter and popular enough to happen.
But what about speech that mentions candidates long before an election? Or ads that don't mention a candidate at all? For example, groups funded by the Koch family ran ads in the congressional elections of 2014 attacking Obamacare without ever mentioning a congressional candidate by name. When party and ideology are as tightly aligned as they are, an ad doesn't need to connect all the dots to push a voter who dislikes President Obama's health insurance program to vote Republican or an environmental activist to vote Democratic. But this kind of robust open debate about public issues is exactly what the First Amendment is intended to protect.
The whole question with climate is, What's your theory of political change? Tom Steyer, the billionaire hedge-fund manager and Democratic political donor, told me recently. We met for lunch at a cafe on Capitol Hill, ostensibly to talk about the issue for which he has become famous — advocating President Trump's impeachment. But the environment was Steyer's first political focus, and we spent most of the lunch discussing it.
They pass a number of bills that limit the power of the incoming Democratic governor and take away things that were available to his Republican predecessor.
archived recording So here's what we're watching. Breaking news. Louisiana officially could become the first state to postpone its Democratic primary election over the coronavirus pandemic.
Tell me where you fall on this. So I wrote this column about this. It's very much about this exact idea. I think that not only on the right, but actually on the left, we overstate the value of paid labor. I'll use myself as an example. We had a three day weekend recently and I will say that my Monday without childcare was a lot harder than my Mondays being a New York Times columnist. I mean, the idea that being a single parent of three kids is not labor, it's just a wild way that we have mentally constructed our perceptions of the economy. What is the value of saying, it is work to go work at a daycare center taking care of somebody else's child for $9 an hour, but it is not work to be at home taking care of your child or your children?
On Capitol Hill, conservatives declared that they are not about to accept a health law replacement that remotely resembles the Affordable Care Act. And the I.R.S. adopted a policy for the coming tax season that could weaken the requirement for people to have insurance. The tax agency said it was reversing one aspect of an Obama administration plan after Mr. Trump, on his first day in office, issued an executive order instructing agencies to reduce burdens imposed by compliance with the Affordable Care Act wherever legally possible.
This argument was always specious, but it looks especially absurd in light of the coronavirus tearing through the world. America's inadequate health care system, far from increasing liberty, is poised to make death panels more likely.
President Trump hates the West Coast. He has called California out of control and boasted about my sick idea to dump migrants into the progressive cities in this time zone. Worst of all, his administration is actively working to take away health care from more than five million people in California alone.
In the October Democratic debate, Times national editor Marc Lacey asked Mr. Yang to comment on Senator Warren's calls to break up companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google. Mr. Yang said Senator Warren is correct in her diagnosis of the problem but breaking up the companies isn't an adequate solution because using a 20th-century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new tool kit.
If the fear of that doesn't motivate the Democratic Party's base, then shame on those people. Not all elections are equal. Some elections are a vote for great changes — like the Great Society. Others are a vote to save the country. This election is the latter.
No, it's fine. It's just that look out there. People's financial circumstances have gotten worse. The amount of student loan debt has been going up at a rate of $100 billion a year. Oh, here's one. Just saw some data not long ago out of the Department of Education. Go take a look 20 years out on people who borrowed student loan debt. Ninety-four percent of whites have paid off their student loan debt. Want to guess what the percentage is for African-Americans is?
Mr. Trump isn't the first to mount a pressure campaign on NATO member states to increase their contributions. President Bush used a summit in Latvia in 2006 to urge other nations to raise their military spending, and President Obama echoed the plea at a 2014 conference in Brussels. Mr. Trump, though, has made spending levels a more central issue.
Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said there would be endless amendments if the procedural hurdle were cleared. He played down the significance of which substitute measure would come first.
This is kind of an extraordinary move by the legislature to really thumb their nose at the power of the executive and the governor. The biggest elected official in the state has called them into session and said, take up this issue. And they basically start the session and end it without doing what he asked.
March 3, 2020, 11:27 p.m. ET March 3, 2020, 11:27 p.m. ET Urging unity in San Francisco. SAN FRANCISCO — Although polling places throughout the state struggled to manage long lines, voters saw little to no wait times at major polling places in San Francisco. Hours before the polls closed, voters at San Francisco's City Hall filled out registration forms and went straight through to vote. The polling place had not yet released turnout numbers for Tuesday, but said it had processed 1,005 voters the day prior. Voters in the city gathered at Manny's, a cafe and political space, to watch as the results came in. Giffords, an organization founded by Gabby Giffords that advocates gun control, held a fund-raiser at the event. Good evening, San Francisco! Are we ready to take our country back? David Chiu, a Democrat who represents San Francisco in the State Assembly, asked the crowd. Mr. Chiu urged unity, saying that although he had backed Elizabeth Warren, Californians needed to come together to support whoever became the Democratic nominee. What's so important is that we come together after this night, Mr. Chiu said. We define who the Democratic Party is. As Manny Yekutiel, the owner of the cafe, announced that results for Texas were tipping the state toward Bernie Sanders, the crowd cheered. Leslie Matthews, 33, said that she had voted by mail on Saturday and backed Elizabeth Warren.
Trump just said he never tweeted that people should check out a sex tape. Ugh, oops. Or maybe Melania was tweeting… https://t.co/2WXq2Ii7ng — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
Third … whoops, I forgot the third.
Gilens, Page and their critics basically agree on the same set of facts. Their differences emerge from their conflicting interpretations of those facts.
The Trump administration has sent mixed signals, reflecting an internal debate about whether to stabilize insurance markets or let them deteriorate further. Mr. Trump has said he could cut off the subsidies at any time if he wanted to.
In this sense, and also in the canny and sometimes moving choices of inspirational figures in the balconies, I suspect the speech was effective, that it might help lift Trump temporarily upward from his mean of 38 percent approval toward the we're holding the House by our fingernails promised land of 44 percent.
So, I think that will be true. But let me argue it two ways. On the one hand, I think the generalized view among progressives correctly is that, Joe Biden, has shown himself in this iteration to be a much more progressive and ambitious president than anybody would have imagined, even two years ago, right? Not just 10 years ago, but two years ago. If you look at what's in the fiscal rescue bill, like that is a vast array of progressive parties, including, by the way $15 minimum wage. Even compared to where things were a couple of years ago, that's a pretty big victory for progressives. If you look at a lot of his appointments, particularly I would say his second tier appointments, have been very progressive. Huge, huge. We've talked a lot about the Romney child allowance, but the child allowance idea that Biden has in the bill and Senate Democrats are doing is as big or bigger, depending on how you want to think about it, than the Romney plan. So there's a lot in there and then that is supposed to be the first of a series of bills. The next one being a bigger reinvestment package in the economy. The question is how much of this can he do through Budget Reconciliation? And I mean, I've talked about this on the show before.
He was not a war hero.
The Justice Department's response may be even more audacious. In a court filing, the department refused to defend the statute — a rarity — and expressed its support for a ruling in the states' favor. Most shockingly, the Justice Department accepted part of the states' argument that other key parts of the A.C.A. must fall with the mandate. Specifically, the department argues that two key insurance reforms — the requirements that insurers must accept everyone regardless of health condition at relatively equal rates — must go down with the ship.
One of them is use march-in orders on prescription drugs. We can bring down the cost of EpiPens and insulin and other drugs, so that we save families literally hundreds of millions of dollars. It can be done without Mitch McConnell. The power is already there. You've just got to be willing to pick it up and use it. Nobody else has talked about picking it up and using it.
MG: Sorry. You think it has — go ahead. I'll let you finish.
We all do, chimed in four other women seated with her on a porch.
How Has the Pandemic Changed Your Taxes? Will stimulus payments be taxed? Nope. The so-called economic impact payments are not treated as income. In fact, they're technically an advance on a tax credit, known as the Recovery Rebate Credit. The payments could indirectly affect what you pay in state income taxes in a handful of states, where federal tax is deductible against state taxable income, as our colleague Ann Carrns wrote. Read more. Are my unemployment benefits taxable? Mostly. Unemployment insurance is generally subject to federal as well as state income tax, though there are exceptions (Nine states don't impose their own income taxes, and another six exempt unemployment payments from taxation, according to the Tax Foundation). But you won't owe so-called payroll taxes, which pay for Social Security and Medicare. The new relief bill will make the first $10,200 of benefits tax-free if your income is less than $150,000. This applies to 2020 only. (If you've already filed your taxes, watch for I.R.S. guidance.) Unlike paychecks from an employer, taxes for unemployment aren't automatically withheld. Recipients must opt in — and even when they do, federal taxes are withheld only at a flat rate of 10 percent of benefits. While the new tax break will provide a cushion, some people could still owe the I.R.S. or certain states money. Read more. I worked from home this year. Can I take the home office deduction? Probably not, unless you're self-employed, an independent contractor or a gig worker.
He loved the contest. He loved being relevant. He kept himself relevant.
Not a damn thing. And people kind of nodded knowingly. And what he was doing was sort of owning the question. He was sort of taking it as a part of his political identity. But at the same time, he was being defiant about it, too. And he kept talking about how, look, all the smart people in Washington, they hate us. The people in the media, they hate us. They hate him, him being Donald Trump. Essentially, it's sort of an old populist refrain, which is they don't — they look down on our way of life. Literally the next day in his office in Washington, he was talking about how you showcase your issues. This is what you do when you're running for re-election. He was —
BS: You speak of these people standing around at rallies, are a lot of these people you're talking about. A lot of people standing around at Trump rallies are the very people you're talking about.
Cholera follows cyclone: A vaccination campaign is set to start today in Mozambique after a devastating storm two weeks ago that displaced about two million people. Malaria is a threat, too, but aid agencies are optimistic.
Today that Grand Old Party has devolved into a personality cult surrounding a racist demagogue who incites a mob to chant about a Somali-American member of Congress: Send her back!
Mr. Trump had other ideas. Are there any other stupid letters that were sent to you folks? he asked in a conference call high-profile Republicans on Monday. You guys are getting sometimes stupid information from people that aren't so smart.
So my plan to forgive student loan debt is capped at $50,000 and an income of $250,000. And the reason for that is because it is the best way, not only to give maximum forgiveness to a lot of people who are struggling, but it also helps close the black-white wealth gap, and is part of the reason that the N.A.A.C.P. endorsed it along with the other parts I was doing about investment in our colleges. But I really worked through hard on these numbers to deal with exactly that question and that's why I got the numbers where they are. I don't think they raise that same issue. I'm not ——
Well, after days of other Republicans expressing public discomfort with where the president was headed —
The Trump administration has sent mixed signals, reflecting an internal debate about whether to stabilize insurance markets or let them deteriorate further. Mr. Trump has said he could cut off the subsidies at any time if he wanted to.
KK: We're running out of time here.
To be sure, we are better off with the A.C.A. than without it, Mr. Starr added, but we ought to be prepared to go beyond it and create a system that doesn't leave so many Americans in the lurch.
The bot introduces you to some interesting characters. Take the Floridian white man in his 40s who recently sprouted onto our feed. He says he's conservative, but doesn't feel like he fits with either party. He thinks women should always have the right to choose when to have an abortion, is pro-Obamacare, and wants the federal minimum wage to be $12 an hour. But curiously enough, he's a Trump voter. Why? Well, he opposes the Clean Air Act — might he have a job in a fossil fuel industry and feel threatened by Democrats' quick embrace of radical environmental policy in light of climate change?
OXNARD, Calif. — Kevin de León is one of the most prominent Democratic figures in the nation's most Democratic state. He has drawn national attention from the Democratic left for a spirited challenge to Senator Dianne Feinstein and for the aggressive legislative challenges to President Trump's policies advanced by the State Senate under his leadership.
A growing divide has emerged among unions over whether to support Medicare for all. Roughly 95 percent of union workers had health care access in 2019, while just 68 percent of nonunion workers did.
United States troops have recently resumed counterterrorism operations in Syria, suggesting that President Trump intends to leave most of the 500 troops currently stationed there (many of them in combat). Mr. Trump has been inconsistent in his strategy on troops in Syria; Senator Warren has been firm in her stance that all combat troops should come home.
To decode this very un-P.C. put-down, you first need to know that the song has only a nominal connection to pasta. The macaronis were members of a subculture of British fops in the 1760s and 1770s, who took their name from the Italian ingredient that would have seemed exotic and sophisticated in England at the time. The trend started with aristocrats, but caught on with middle- and working-class lads as well.
As Republican senators work to fix their troubled health care bill, there is one giant health insurance subsidy no one is talking about.
Clinton calls for universal background checks for firearms purchases. Yes! In 10 years, 300 Americans die from terrorism, 33,000 from guns. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
Because their cause is hate. It is un-American. They are domestic terrorists. And we need more from our president on this issue.
Eager to fuel this perception, Team Trump has been smearing Democrats as engaged in a campaign of presidential harassment. It's the president's signature move: attack anyone or anything that displeases him — the news media, the courts, the electoral process, insufficiently obsequious Republicans, his own Department of Justice, science — to undermine its legitimacy in the eyes of his base.
The most conservative House members are pushing for a fast repeal of the health law with only a bare-bones replacement to follow: possibly just bigger incentives for people to open health savings accounts to fund their own health needs. Other Republicans are more interested in taking their time to come up with a replacement plan that, as of now, they have failed to cobble together beyond a menu of options.
Medicare for all has created deep divisions on the left, particularly over questions like: How much would it really cost? Is Senator Warren's plan for raising the money for it progressive enough? Is it politically prudent to debate the issue now?

KK: Well, one more personal question for you. Who has broken your heart?
In an email, Rhodes noted that
Administration officials said they would try to sign up more young adults, with a special emphasis on those turning 26 and moving off their parents' plans. Officials said that they would, for the first time, send letters about marketplace coverage to people who had paid the tax penalty for being uninsured, a group in which young adults are overrepresented.
Exactly. A 2-cent wealth tax just means if you don't lift a finger, your fortune only grows at 4 percent, 6 percent, 8 percent. And yet how many people in this country who are so sophisticated and knowledgeable — right — say you could never get a wealth tax because the billionaires and millionaires won't let it happen? Well, what the hell? This is a democracy.
What book would you give a democratic socialist to read about conservatism?
I think having people here who are working under the table is both bad for American workers and bad for the American economy. One of the reasons I propose to create a pathway to citizenship for everyone who's here to stay, a pathway that is fair and achievable, is to stop the problem of two-tier hiring: those who are hired in the legal system and then those who are hired outside the legal system. People who are undocumented have no protection and are frequently subject to wage theft, to unsafe working conditions, and that's not good for anyone. It's not good for American workers. It's not good for the American economy.
Mr. Trump has unsettled markets with trade threats aimed at China, which The Times has editorialized against. He famously boasted Trade wars are good, and easy to win. But a recent Axios report noted that China's exports to the United States dropped 23.1 percent this year.
Senator Warren has argued that the sheer size of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon pose a real threat to innovation and competition in the technology industry. Mr. Yang has argued that her diagnosis is 100 percent correct but that her solution isn't fully effective because competition doesn't solve all of the problems.
The whole question with climate is, What's your theory of political change? Tom Steyer, the billionaire hedge-fund manager and Democratic political donor, told me recently.

Nick Fox: What did you think of the standards in the Trans-Pacific deal?
There's been a relentless campaign of sabotage by the Trump administration to deny people health care, and thankfully, the new Democratic majority in the House has taken action, Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at a Wednesday news conference to push the legislation. But the Republican-led Senate? No movement. Nothing.
Some of her most memorable moments on the national political stage have come as she has wielded her prosecutorial skills while questioning witnesses as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
KK: Simultaneously though, all of the things that you've suggested you would need to do in order to afford Medicare for all, a wealth tax, cutting the defense budget, comprehensive immigration reform, would require the Senate's approval.
All of them are supposed to be there for us, said JoAnn Johnson, 80, in an article on the front page of Sunday's Argus Leader in Sioux Falls, S.D., and we are lost in this.
Jesse Wegman: Senator, I want to just take you back for a moment to Mara's question about swing states and swing state voters and your point about large structural changes that people warn you off. The other day, you repeated your argument that you wanted to be the last president to win the Electoral College and the first to win the national popular vote. How do you expect — I'm assuming you're not talking about a constitutional amendment. How do you expect to get there in five years, unless you're the president, unless you win the Electoral College and Donald Trump wins the popular vote in 2020?
Well, I'm not sure I accept the premise of the question, that they actually tried what I was talking about. Look, our No. 1 leverage is everybody wants the American consumer. They want access to the American consumer. They want to be able to sell us all of their stuff because the American consumer is not only the engine of about 70 percent of our economy; it's a worldwide engine. So I think it's perfectly reasonable to say, if you want to be able to trade with United States on the best possible terms, then everybody needs to raise their standards just a little. Who wants to do that?
The case was originally brought by a group of Republican state officials, who argued that changes to the Affordable Care Act made by Congress in 2017 rendered the law's requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance unconstitutional. The Trump administration took the side of the state officials, and together they have argued in court that, without the so-called individual mandate, the rest of the major health care law should also be erased.
The case is being brought by a group of 20 Republican state attorneys general and the governors of Maine and Mississippi. They argue that the law is unconstitutional and should be struck down.
The one place where Trump has deviated from conservative orthodoxy is his trade war. But why is he a self-proclaimed Tariff Man?
Look, I have argued for a long time that we need not to expand our nuclear arsenal, and that is the direction the Trump administration has been taking us.
And am I right to think that both of you expect that, however it happens at the appeals court level or the Supreme Court level, Obamacare will survive?
In The Wall Street Journal last month, under the headline John Roberts's 'Illegitimate' Court, the newspaper's editorial columnist, William McGurn, wrote: For those not fluent in modern Beltway, let us translate: It's a threat, aimed at John Roberts. If the chief justice does not produce the desired progressive outcome, the Roberts court will find itself attacked as institutionally illegitimate. This week, The Journal's editorial board took aim at the new development in the census case under the headline Census Target: John Roberts. Whenever you read 'legitimacy' in a sentence about the court, you know it's a political missile aimed directly at Chief Justice John Roberts.
Right. We had talked about this with you during the midterms — that there had been this huge public shift on Obamacare and that voters who might have previously been against it now do not want it taken away.
And then by the time you're in the Trump Administration, Republicans really only attempt two major pieces of legislation, and then call it a day when the health care replacement fails and the tax cut doesn't seem to yield any political returns. Republicans basically draw the lesson, Well, I guess it's a waste of time to do anything on policy. And so they campaign in 2018 saying, or rather not saying, Look, if you give us continued control of Congress and the White House, we're going to do a couple of things for you. And in 2020, Trump doesn't campaign on the basis of, here's what I'm going to do in my second term, and Republican senators and House members don't campaign on, give us back control the government so we can do x, y, and z. And look, I'm somebody whose been arguing for years that conservatives should have that kind of an agenda. But the Republicans are in decent political health without having done any of that kind of work. And so, I think that there is an inclination on their part to just keep doing it. But among the reasons why that is still worth pushing back on is that at some point, if you're involved in politics and interested in office, it's because you want to accomplish something.
That's why I have been on strike with 750 co-workers for more than two weeks. That's why the other day, co-workers and I were arrested after we sat down in Harvard Square, blocking traffic, in an act of civil disobedience. And that's why the medical school students, in their white coats, have been walking the picket line with us in solidarity.
It is. And at one point, I just sort of blurted out, do you trust him? Meaning the president. And it took him a while to answer. He seemed taken aback by that. And what he said was, I trust him to want to be successful — which is kind of a non-answer. I mean, what president doesn't want to be successful, right? I mean, I think if I were to ask him, do you trust John McCain, he would say, I trust John McCain to love America and to always do what is right for America and to always work for a cause greater than himself. I remember asking him at one point, do you think Donald Trump believes in a cause greater than himself? And he said something to the effect that, well, Donald Trump's a showman. He's a larger-than-life figure. He wants to be successful. Look, there are a lot of people who say, Lindsey, you know better. How can you live with yourself? What are you doing? And he couches it in the virtue of, look, I believe very strongly in certain things around Syria, around Afghanistan, around judges.
In fact, let me quote you a New York Times article from just last week that I thought was terrific, and that's about a 2-cent wealth tax and how it is popular across political lines and it's popular, why? Because most of America gets that they're getting cheated in this game, and you get that wherever you are on that income scale until you get up to the very top.
Watch a special endorsement episode of The Weekly This video excerpt has been edited by The Weekly.
As a rough model, Mr. Hutchinson pointed to a work requirement for certain food stamp recipients — a federal policy that was part of the landmark 1996 welfare overhaul — that Arkansas reinstated last year. Under that rule, able-bodied adults without dependents cannot receive food stamps for longer than three months unless they are working, volunteering or getting job training for 20 hours a week.
You're asking the fundamental question about how you break them up. This was the question for Standard Oil. How did they break up Standard Oil? They ended up doing it actually by geography back in those days, but that's obviously a very different world from the world we live in right now.
From the beginning, Republicans hated Obamacare not because they expected it to fail, but because they feared that it would succeed, and thereby demonstrate that government actually can do things to make people's lives better. And their nightmare is gradually coming true: Although it took a long time, the Affordable Care Act is finally becoming popular, and the public's concern that the G.O.P. will kill it is becoming an important political liability.
BS: Last question. What are you likely to fail at as president?
Well, why would you say that? Because it's very tempting to see this story as an anomaly, right, in that the governor of Wisconsin waited a very long time to try to postpone the state's primary — perhaps too long — and the state legislature is this hyper-partisan, conservative, activist body that is trying to use its power for political advantage. So all those factors would seem to make Wisconsin a bit of an outlier.
But what is becoming increasingly clear is the extent to which Obamacare has become embedded in the American health care structure and how difficult it will be to craft an acceptable replacement.
Senator Warren's plan on trade, released in July, would change American trade policy by pushing the country's trade partners to abide by higher labor and environmental standards. Under her plan, more representatives from labor, environmental and consumer groups would be involved in trade negotiations, and the process would be more transparent through public disclosure of draft agreements.
I went to Washington. I came here to New York to talk to people about the idea for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and I heard two things over and over and over. Part one, that's a great idea. It would actually make a real difference. That would be structural change, or as I now say, big structural change, in financial services. And part two, don't even try, because you'll be up against the big banks. You'll be up against Wall Street. You'll be up against all of the Republicans. You'll be up against half the Democrats. You'll never get it done. But we did get it done.
Several members of the Trump family have come under fire for profiting from Donald Trump's administration in possible violation of the emoluments clause, including Ivanka Trump, who was paid more than $1 million from her ties to the Trump Organization last year. And former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter held a lucrative position on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. In late September, Ms. Warren was, in the words of one reporter, uncharacteristically flustered when asked about the Biden matter.
BA: Are tariffs the leverage that you use to secure those types —
Unlike an administration functioning during normal times, the Biden team can't simply add people to a meeting at the last minute, or run someone into the building. It couldn't be more different in feel and temperament from the opening weeks of the Trump administration, when the Oval Office was often compared to Grand Central Terminal. Former President Donald J. Trump's office served as a bustling focal point of all West Wing activity as aides wandered in and out and then simply hung about, once it was clear that there was no formal structure for meetings or policymaking, and that for Mr. Trump, out of sight was out of mind. All West Wing staff members are still tested daily even though a growing number of administration officials are getting vaccinated. There are also fewer people working in the building, and those who are there rarely leave the campus for lunch. There have been awkward moments in hallways, when staff members don't recognize each other because everyone is required to wear an N95 mask and many have opted to double-mask, officials said. The measures are in place because of a realization that while it may be impossible to prevent the coronavirus from entering the White House complex entirely, it is possible to reduce the risk of widespread infection if someone on the president's team gets sick. The rules have been put in place by Anne Filipic, the director of management and administration, and Jeff Wexler, the White House director of Covid-19 operations.
But it seems to me the real debate is whether the only way to make care affordable is for the government essentially to dictate prices. The hospitals and doctors are none too happy about that prospect.
How has this case managed to go so far? Jonathan Cohn of HuffPost has written a helpful summary.
Exactly. A 2-cent wealth tax just means if you don't lift a finger, your fortune only grows at 4 percent, 6 percent, 8 percent. And yet how many people in this country who are so sophisticated and knowledgeable — right — say you could never get a wealth tax because the billionaires and millionaires won't let it happen? Well, what the hell? This is a democracy.
Millions of voters are expected to go to the polls today, when about a third of the delegates in the Democratic presidential race will be allocated. Here are the latest updates.
Though Mr. Bloomberg averages a few in-person events per day and has a staff of 2,500 around the country, his sprawling campaign is powered by one of the most traditional weapons in a candidate's arsenal: the television ad.
Senator Warren has proposed using the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice to undo anti-competitive mergers currently in place, then passing legislation designating companies worth more than $25 billion in revenue as platform utilities.
The result has been that the population actually signing up for coverage is both smaller and sicker than it would otherwise have been, forcing insurers to charge higher premiums.
In a July 17 article in The American Prospect, Can the Democrats Define Their Own Cause? Or will Trump define it for them? Paul Starr, a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton, warned:
I've already made the pitch, and I actually had several unions say that it's a really good approach. I don't remember if the U.A.W. was one of them.
You obviously know where I stand on this political divide. But I'm starting to believe that I misjudged Republican motives.
That figure has grown to 37 states and the District of Columbia, as more Republican-controlled states have signed on. Many academic studies have found that the program increases enrollees' access to medical care. A more limited body of research shows that the program also reduces mortality rates.
It was Mr. Hutchinson's Democratic predecessor, Mike Beebe, who got the state's Republican-controlled legislature to expand Medicaid by using federal funds to buy private insurance for the poor. Mr. Hutchinson said in the interview that he wanted to continue the expansion here, but that if the federal government stopped paying most of the cost as the health law requires, we'll just have to look at it again.
His response to the Floyd killing was less about hammering Mr. Trump than about encouraging young people, who have been slow in embracing Mr. Biden, to vote. When he chose to speak publicly, it was to host an online forum highlighting a slate of policing reforms that went nowhere in Congress in his second term.
That was before more than 68,000 people in the United States tested positive for the coronavirus, grinding the country to a halt, upending lives from coast to coast, and postponing primary elections in many states. The virus has made the stakes, and the differing visions the two parties have for health care in America, that much clearer.
Mr. Biden and Ms. Warren are members of the same generation, Democrats shaped by modest upbringings who became United States senators and candidates for their party's presidential nomination. But with Mr. Biden now actively considering Ms. Warren to be his running mate, it's their ideological differences — and whether they can build a complementary, productive relationship — that will ultimately determine whether she emerges as No. 2 on the ticket.
Interestingly, the progressive wing of the Democratic Party faces another challenge from an unexpected source.

To the degree that Medicare for all is an actual, credible proposal like what has been offered by Senator Bernie Sanders, how practical is it? How expensive would it be to create? How disruptive would it be to the current health care system?
Senator Warren called for the House of Representatives to begin impeachment inquiry proceedings against Mr. Trump as early as April 2019.
DES MOINES — Less than 48 hours from now, hundreds of thousands of Iowans will gather in schools and churches and libraries and gymnasiums, from the Mississippi River to the Missouri, and participate in the first nominating contest of the 2020 election.
Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan opened her annual State of the State speech on Wednesday by pleading with lawmakers to find common ground in fighting the staggering effects of the coronavirus pandemic in the state. Based on the political environment this past year, you might think Republicans and Democrats in Lansing can't find common ground on much of anything, said Ms. Whitmer, a Democrat. She noted times when there had been bipartisan action in the Capitol. Let's tap into that same energy and end the pandemic, revitalize our economy and get our kids back in school. But Republicans were having none of it. Hours before Ms. Whitmer gave her speech, Republicans in the State Senate refused to approve 13 appointments she had proposed for slots in state government, such as the leader of the Children's Ombudsman Office, the Civil Rights Commission and members of agriculture boards. Republicans said they had rejected the appointments because Ms. Whitmer was not including them enough in decision-making surrounding restrictions on businesses to stop the spread of Covid-19. She has continued to circumvent the Legislature, said State Senator Aric Nesbitt, a Republican from Lawton. I understand it's not easy to compromise and try to work with 148 members of this Legislature. We have to use every tool available to compromise, and one of those tools is to not support her appointments.
The proposed rules signal the Trump administration's urgency in trying to keep other insurers from fleeing the market after Humana's departure. The company said on Tuesday that it was losing money by insuring too many sick people without enough healthy ones enrolling. Humana had already scaled back its participation to 11 states this year, from 19 in 2016.
Well, I never get to argue with anybody who wants to create a House filibuster. This is going to be wonderful. It makes my skin crawl. It's great. So let me push on that, a couple of things. One, we would not be a pure majoritarian political structure no matter what you did with the filibuster. We have more veto-generating political institutions than any other advanced democracy, and it's not even all that close. We have the Supreme Court. We have divided government, oftentimes, across the different branches. We have power distributed across the different branches. We have a system that was designed to be hard to do things in before the filibuster was ever a gleam in anybody's eye. As you know, of course, it was not a founding father idea, the filibuster, and they did not want a supermajority requirement in Congress. They thought about that and rejected it. So that's one thing. I always want to push that majoritarian thing to the side. And of course, we still have a Bill of Rights and all kinds of protections for individuals and minorities. That said, I think that one way of framing what you're saying here as a model is that a system in which you require more accommodation to get things done is going to be a system that encourages accommodation, compromise, understanding between the parties. And what I would say in response is, well, look around. We have more filibusters than ever and more polarized politics than ever.
For the most rational case for Trump's electability, though, and one that some Republicans have probably internalized, I recommend reading this Will Rahn piece touting Trump's chances against Hillary, and particularly these passages:
The health care law established so-called risk corridors meant to help insurance companies cope with the risks they took when they decided to participate in the law's marketplaces without knowing who would sign up for coverage. Under the program, the federal government would limit insurance companies' gains and losses on insurance sold in the marketplaces from 2014 through 2016.
Like Obamacare, the Republicans' proposal would help people who don't get insurance through work or the government buy their own coverage with tax credits. But the structure of the Republicans' tax credits is really different, handing them out on a flat basis according to age, for everyone earning up to around $75,000 a year. The bill would also allow insurers to charge older customers much higher prices than they can under Obamacare.
It's a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results, said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. And we intend to do it.
Carlyle is moving to a 'one share, one vote' model
Attempts to restart the economy even though the pandemic is far from controlled will lead to many more deaths, and will probably backfire even in purely economic terms as states are forced to lock down again.
Since scolding member nations at the 2017 summit, Mr. Trump has followed up with strongly worded letters to NATO nations advising that if they don't increase their payments, it will be increasingly hard to justify why American soldiers continue to sacrifice their lives overseas.
A reporter read Mr. Trump's comment made last July in which he said that he hoped Russian intelligence services had successfully hacked Mrs. Clinton's email and encouraged them to publish whatever they may have stolen, and then the reporter asked Mr. Spicer how he could say the president took the threat of foreign meddling seriously.
For a time when the parties weren't that ideological, but as a story I tell in my book goes, the parties became ideological. Then they began using the rules differently. And now we're just caught in this mismatch era between a Senate that worked for the non-polarized parties of the 20th century, but simply doesn't work for the highly polarized parties of the 21st. And so, we all get our fainting couches every time a new norm is broken. But they're not doing anything weird. They're just acting exactly as you would expect them to act, given the ideological stakes of the era. Is that wrong in some important respect?
Around the world, government rescue packages show that the pain will depend largely on where people live. The Netherlands will pay up to 90 percent of wages for companies hit hard by the pandemic, for instance, and Britain — which just announced its lockdown plan — is adopting a similar approach.
But I'm disturbed that so few of the Democratic candidates don't also talk about growing the pie, let alone celebrating American entrepreneurs and risk-takers. Where do they think jobs come from?
The reality is that Cuomo is desperately trying to run against Donald Trump because he doesn't have the progressive credentials to run against me, she said on Thursday.
Among other things, right? And it's why though I've tried so hard for 11 months and four days now to talk about the vision of what we can actually do and to try to make it real. Not vision in a — I'm not really a big, you know, talk about this in soaring terms. But in real terms, a 2-cent wealth tax.
Named after Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who was the longest-serving senator in history, the rule says that senators can stop a bill under this special procedure if it contains matter extraneous to the federal budget. There are many complex details, which is why there is uncertainty about what counts. The House staff members who wrote the American Health Care Act apparently felt that changing Obamacare's requirement that all plans cover 10 basic categories of benefits would break the rule. (But, for example, they believed that changing the rules for how much insurance companies could charge older customers was O.K.)
Well, I would take the combat troops out of there now. I see no immediate reason we'd send combat troops into the region, but I'd get the combat troops that are there now out.
The name of the game is California — and that's where our chances of winning are the best, said Ethan Nadelmann, the executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance, which has been pushing for legalization.
Both choices carry risks. If the Democrats pursue the former route and their base sees them as having capitulated, that might depress turnout in November. If they succeed at the latter, that might energize the Republican base. And if they fail to take back the Senate, Judge Kavanaugh will sail through after all, and the Democrats will look weaker still for having attempted a tactic that backfired.
And these policies have endeared him to the G.O.P.'s money men. Deep-pocketed Republicans who snubbed Donald Trump in 2016 are going all in for him in 2020, reports Politico.
80 percent of the people would like to see these kids have a better life. 80 percent of the people would like to begin to fix our broken immigration system.
And so, let's think about this also in terms of like — I mean if we're talking about the value of work. I mean, one of the harms of unemployment, or prolonged spells of unemployment, involuntary unemployment is what I'm talking about here, is its effect on kids and not just the material effect on them. Although that's obviously an important severe one, but also I do think it is good for kids to see their parents making a living and setting that example. It's not the only important thing in the world. It's not always something that has to happen. It depends on the particular situation and the trade offs that a particular household confronts and we can and should do some things to make it easier for households to negotiate these things.
You know on part of this, I think part of the answer is current law enforcement. You correctly describe it, in harassing people, in trespassing. And we need to make sure at federal, state, and local levels that people who are seeking health care of any kind have access to that health care and are not denied that opportunity. I think our laws are there. I think the weakness is our failure to enforce. That's how I see now. If there are gaps in that, I'm certainly open to understanding them better, but that's how I see it.
Quietly, a debate continues to rage in the Democratic Party over how far to push for a health care overhaul, including proposals such as a public option or so-called Medicare for all . With a number of pressing issues competing for priority, few lawmakers have expressed enthusiasm about diving back into a policy clash on one of the most politically complicated issues.
In short, if this isn't the time to leave behind the hyperpartisanship that has made it nearly impossible for us to do anything big and hard for two decades, then when?
Part two is again, we should be working more with our allies. Donald Trump seems to think somehow that we are stronger alone and I think that's fundamentally wrong. If you want to bring economic pressure on China, if you want to bring diplomatic pressure on China, it makes a lot more sense to do that if we're doing it with our allies, if we're doing it in conjunction with others. And I think that provides potentially much better protection for Hong Kong. The idea that this is going to be a direct military conflict between China and the United States, that would be deeply destabilizing to the entire world. So I want to see us use our diplomatic tools. I want to see us use our economic tools, and I want to see us leverage everything that we want to do by working much more tightly in conjunction with our allies. We just haven't been doing that. None of the above.
Consistent with whatever is revealed. You can't do speed independently of facts, right? But if that's what we've got and it's enough information for a charge of impeachment, then I think they can go forward and I think they should.
So Hawley has responded with ads claiming that he, too, wants to protect those with pre-existing conditions, as supposedly shown by his support for a bill that purports to provide such protection.
It's not just any insult, either. With Yankee Doodle, the Redcoats were delivering the most puerile, schoolyard insult in the schoolyard insult book. They were suggesting that American soldiers were gay.
There are some things that may change that, but, really, what we find is that people who have voted in the past are likely to vote, and people who have not voted in the past are not likely to vote, said Amos Budde, a data scientist at Civis.
I'm sorry, but you can do it if you roll back the filibuster. I stood on the floor of the Senate when we had those votes.
Because for me, they all are about a central question and that's: Who's going to get opportunity in this country going forward? Will opportunity be reserved just for those born into privilege? Or will opportunity be something that we say as a country, we're willing to make some hard choices to invest, so that all of our kids get those opportunities?
Mr. Trump's rosy reassurances that trade wars are good, and easy to win have proved equally hollow. Farmers are not the only ones suffering. Manufacturers are paying higher prices. The instability is disrupting markets. Small wonder the latest Quinnipiac poll shows only 39 percent of Americans approve of the president's trade policies.
And I don't think that's the right model.

Paine was easier, in a sense, because he always wrote for a popular audience. And there are two phases to Paine. There's the American Paine, where you could read Common Sense. I'd say start from The American Crisis, which is much more of a general reader, popular piece, series of essays written, really, as pep talks to soldiers, more or less, in the course of the Revolutionary War. But there's a lot of political philosophy in them and a very profound case for human liberty. And then there's Paine of the French Revolutionary period, where the thing to read is really The Rights of Man, which is a two-volume book that Paine wrote. You should read The Rights of Man after you read Burke's reflections on the revolution in France because The Rights of Man is actually a direct response to Burke, answers him in some wonderfully interesting ways, and engages, really, with some of the deepest questions of our political tradition.
KK: Should it be against the law for the children of sitting presidents and vice presidents to serve on the boards of foreign companies or otherwise profit from their parents' service?
It's sort of the Jewish definition of chutzpah, right? A kid who kills his parents, demanding sympathy because he's an orphan.
The new statistics come from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which monitors the number of Americans with and without health insurance every quarter. A smaller survey from Gallup had shown the uninsured rate rising last year. And a survey from the Commonwealth Fund showed a small rise, though it was statistically insignificant. But the C.D.C. research includes a larger sample size, and is generally regarded as a more definitive study. Tuesday's study contains data from the entire calendar year of 2017.
does seem consistently responsive to business preferences and its positions are more often associated with those of the affluent. On economic policy in particular, Republican leaders much better represent affluent and business preferences.
Over all, Obamacare has substantially reduced the number of Americans without insurance. According to the report, 19.3 million fewer people were living without health insurance in 2017 compared with 2010, when the Affordable Care Act passed Congress.
Margot: Maybe state legislatures in some states, but then we're not talking a Medicare-like program. Remember there are states — Vermont, Colorado, California — where there is an active and somewhat mainstream movement to get to a single-payer health care system. This is not exactly that, but it is a way of socializing more of health care, and I could see political support for the idea, especially if things get worse in the marketplaces. Of course, ironically, the most receptive states tend to be the ones with the most stable exchanges. If I were a legislator in California, I might think twice about voting for something with the potential to destabilize a functional market.
Attempting to hold this administration to account will be among the new Democratic majority's most vital, and most fraught, duties — especially after two years of cowed Republicans letting the president operate unchecked. A White House has perhaps never more vividly demonstrated the need for some countervailing force to check its corruption and incompetence, its disdain for the Constitution and its assault on democratic norms.
Trump's point seems to be that in a world of ISIS and terrorism, it doesn't matter if a guy grabs women by the genitals. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
Many readers seized the invitation to suggest running mates for Donald Trump as a chance to have some fun. Of the 100-plus names mentioned, more than half were in jest. Many were foreign, dead, fictional or in prison. They included cartoon characters (Donald Duck, Dory, Homer Simpson, Bozo, Ronald McDonald, Frito Bandito, Elmer Fudd); foreign politicians (Boris Johnson, Marine Le Pen, Vladimir Putin); reality-TV stars (Kim Kardashian, Snooki); sports figures (Tom Brady, Charles Barkley); comedians (Larry David, Don Rickles, Bill Cosby, Jerry Lewis, Groucho Marx); and convicts (Bernie Madoff, El Chapo, Whitey Bulger). Here's a small sampling.

With W. and Cheney, it was Qaeda terrorists coming back to kill us.
But it's hard. It's a lot easier not to take on the drug industry. It's a lot easier not to take on the insurance industry. It's a lot easier not to take on the oil industry. But every single issue we care about, every single issue — think about it on climate. All across this country people are saying climate, climate, climate. If you're not willing to take on the corruption, we're going to get laws passed that are going to have great names: Save the World; Everything Is Green; Now Safe for Unicorns.
There was a little girl in California who was a part of the second class to integrate her public schools and she was bused to school every day. And that little girl was me. So I will tell you that on this subject, it cannot be an intellectual debate among Democrats.
Mara Gay: Actually, that's a perfect point for me to just ask you a question that's related. My family is from Michigan, and U.A.W. workers. One of the last things that they really love, many of them, is their health care. So I guess my question is, is both a practical one and a political one, which is why not try and expand health care access without actually taking away programs that people already like? Is there a way to do that? Is there even a way to get to what you're talking about without talking about it in such dogmatic political terms, and how do you — this is I guess the most important part of the question, I think, is how do you make the pitch to a U.A.W. worker that what you can offer is actually better than what they already have?
It redoubles the loyalty of some part of his base. But if we assume his base is 45 percent of the country, then after Charlottesville his approval rating went down into the mid- to low 30s. So there's a big chunk of his base that I think believes in the Trump is a populist fighting for you message, and doesn't like the bigotry, and doesn't like the racism. So I think it's a big mistake to attribute these sort of multidimensional, chess-move brilliance to Trump's move here. What actually happened was that the Democratic Party was tearing itself apart because Nancy Pelosi and the leftward fringe in Congress can't get along with each other. And Trump saw a political scrum and wanted to jump in it because that's what he does. I expect his approval ratings to go down after this. We'll see what happens.
There's always a tension for presidents around whether to submit a specific proposal to Congress or let the legislative process play out, Mr. Levitt added. When it comes to health care, the challenge has been that the president has not only avoided proposing a specific plan, but has made promises that no plan could ever fulfill.
Instead, it projects that deficits will grow $7 trillion over the next decade as the United States continues borrowing huge sums of money — a number that could double if the administration turns out to be overestimating economic growth and if the $3 trillion in spending cuts the White House has floated do not materialize in Congress.
In a phone interview on Friday, Mr. Shapiro rejected that there was anything sexist about his offer, saying that he could see himself making a similar offer to an older, male ideological opponent.
Everyone likes to talk about the party in terms of two or three wings. I think there's probably 50 wings, if we're all being honest with one another. We've always been a mosaic and where we all connect is around working families and workers.
BA: I appreciate that the toaster is still your preferred consumer appliance.
House Republican leaders and the White House have restarted negotiations on legislation to repeal the Affordable Care Act, despite a similar bill being pulled because it did not have enough votes to pass.
That becomes the first real point of pressure to say, how can this election go forward?
Well, you know, it obviously depends on the program, but I worry about — for example, increasing the dollar payment on Section 8 vouchers, it doesn't seem to increase the supply of housing. Instead, it seems to make a segment of landlords richer. So I'd rather take that money and put it directly into increasing housing supply.
But that is the specific, right? This is the place where Democrats have fired on Democrats about how we're going to do health care. And I'll make two pitches on that. One is I think the best way we're going to do health care — this is just what I believe — is you do what you can to bring down costs. You got a little success on the table. It's a lot of success. It's hundreds of millions of dollars of success. You've got that on the table. You start to offer people what's possible.
He was always at his side. The two of them had sort of similar senses of humor.

The American government's antitrust battle with the oil industry perhaps epitomizes a 20th-century approach to antitrust — in 1911, the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of Standard Oil. Of course, many would argue that the country's dependence on oil and its addiction to Facebook aren't totally comparable.
His wealth also allows him to spend in states where he clearly will not win. Minnesota, for instance, has 75 delegates up for grabs, only the sixth-most on Super Tuesday and far less than the 415 delegates in California. It also has a popular home state senator, Amy Klobuchar, ahead in the polls, with the 2016 primary winner, Mr. Sanders, not far behind.
[ Return to the review of Why We're Polarized. ]
Perched on the window sill of Zucker's office, among the pictures of his family, is a framed cartoon of him shaking hands with Trump. Another Trump stooge on the payroll, Don Don! a plump-looking Zucker says. Big league move, Zucker, Trump replies. It was drawn by the political cartoonist Sean Corcoran last summer, when CNN hired the former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski as a contributor just days after he was fired by the campaign. I was surprised to find it in Zucker's office. His critics saw the hiring of Lewandowski — who was accused of assaulting a female reporter and was still getting paychecks from the campaign during his five-month stint at CNN — as emblematic of everything that was wrong with Zucker and CNN. Namely, that he was more interested in staging fights and creating spectacles than in producing journalism. But Zucker doesn't engage in second-guessing, let alone soul-searching.
BS: Right. You have a lot of people in this country who actually, if you asked them about Obamacare, they hate it. These are the same people who are being wounded by the constant diminution of medical care under the Trump administration. How do you convince those people? That's the issue, because he's talking about fake news and disbelief. We had the whole discussion about death committees.
Maybe his only chance, because Democrats now control the House. There is really no shot for Republicans to pass a bill repealing the Affordable Care Act. So if they're going to take it down, they're going to take it down in the courts.
Though the system in Texas is a little complicated, with some delegates being awarded based on state senate districts, Mr. Bloomberg's sole position on the airwaves there can help him win delegates with less competition than in Houston or Dallas.
Mr. Looney, of the Brookings Institution, estimated that the benefits from Senator Warren's plans are skewed — he estimated that borrowers with advanced degrees will claim 37 percent of the annual benefits, while representing only 27 percent of borrowers overall.
While the stimulus checks will be a boon to many struggling families, the package is also geared toward strengthening efforts to bring an end to the pandemic. To better understand how, I spoke to my colleague Abby Goodnough, a national heath care correspondent.
But the ceremony also marked the latest, and one of the most joyous, of the not-so-subtle ways in which the West Coast continues to live free and prosper under a president doing everything he can to hurt the 51 million Americans in the three lower-48 states that hug the Pacific shore.
On Tuesday, the focus of Mr. Trump's ire was Mr. McCain's historic vote on health care in 2017, when he went against his own party and opposed a Republican measure to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
Mamadi Doumbouya for The New York Times Talk Henry Louis Gates Jr. on What Really Happened at Obama's 'Beer Summit'
No wonder President-elect Trump realizes that repeal without replace is the real disaster, said Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. No wonder he has admonished the Congress not to do plain repeal.
Mr. Holder has few qualms about calling Mr. Trump a racist in the former president's presence. Mr. Obama has never contradicted him, but he avoids the term, even in private, preferring a more indirect accusation of racial demagoguery, according to several people close to both men.
But the other half, let's say you have a complaint because the trade agreement had said that some other country would permit unionization or would not use low-wage workers beyond a certain point. Do you get a path like that? A quick resolution? And by the way, I should point out: That quick resolution? There's no appeal from it. It is immediately enforceable against a government. So you can go straight against Canada for raising its environmental standards. You can go straight against a South American country for raising its standards to protect its children's health from smoking.
I'm sorry, but you can do it if you roll back the filibuster. I stood on the floor of the Senate when we had those votes.
WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court ruled Monday that the federal government must live up to its promise to shield insurance companies from some of the risks they took in participating in the exchanges established by President Barack Obama's health care law, the Affordable Care Act.
But then how do you read what happened at the beginning of the Senate session? So there's a 50/50 Senate split. Democrats are going to have the tie breaking vote because of Vice President Harris acting as the presiding officer. Mitch McConnell begins the session by filibustering the organizing resolution, literally the resolution to form the Senate. So he starts out by saying, I will let you do nothing. I will not even let you build a Senate. And Schumer doesn't give in to McConnell's demands, among which were a promise never to touch the filibuster. But Manchin and Sinema then have this choice to make. And there are two kind of obvious ways they could have gone to me. One is to say, we do not want to touch the filibuster. What we want to have is a bipartisan regular order process, where we work together with our beloved colleagues on the other side to get things done. But obviously, if you abuse it this way, and you will not even let us form an organizing resolution to create the Senate, we will have to do it. So please stop. Don't make us do this. Don't make us do this thing you don't want us to do. Or they could do what they actually did and give Mitch McConnell what he wanted and tell him, in no uncertain terms, they will never touch the filibuster.
In a state where approval of President Trump is near the country's highest, Mr. Manchin, a Democrat, was once thought to be deeply endangered in his re-election this year. But the 71-year-old incumbent, who likes to say Washington sucks, has a 7- to 10-point polling edge over his Republican opponent, Patrick Morrisey. A lot can happen before Election Day, but for now, he is the envy of other red-state Democrats as the parties wrestle over control of the Senate.
I want to key in on that assumption that passing a big COVID relief bill would have just been a political game, because one of your big themes in pieces you've been writing recently, is that the Republican Party has detached itself from policy, from putting forward proactive agendas, and turned to focus on cultural grievance and conservative entertainment. Why do you think that's happened?
BA: Would you reduce existing access in order to achieve that goal?
Michael Bloomberg's presidential campaign has aroused the passions of Democratic voters. Unfortunately for Bloomberg — a formerly Republican, Wall Street-friendly billionaire who, as New York City mayor, supported the racially discriminatory stop and frisk policing strategy — those passions are largely negative ones. These personal and ideological priors aside, many Democrats are angry that Bloomberg, who has indicated he is willing to spend as much as $1 billion of his estimated $50 billion fortune on his campaign, seems to be trying to purchase their party's nomination. The fear is that Bloomberg's campaign will prolong the Democratic contest and, in the end, produce a hobbled nominee — a nominee who almost certainly won't be Bloomberg.
The problem as I see it in the housing market, just picking that one, is we have a supply problem. The two big providers of housing from half a century ago just aren't there. So the developer that built the two-bedroom, one-bath house, garage converted to hold my three brothers for their bedroom, that developer is building McMansions today. And I'm not mad at him. That's where the profits are. And the federal government, as you know, now under current federal law, can't expand federal housing. It can only do replacement when it's taking it off the market. And if it takes it off the market and it doesn't replace it, then it shrinks even more. Housing deteriorates like anything else.
Here is a perhaps useful suggestion for Republicans in Congress. The next time they need to do an easy routine task, like naming a new post office, they should label the bill as The Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act.
You're asking the fundamental question about how you break them up. This was the question for Standard Oil. How did they break up Standard Oil? They ended up doing it actually by geography back in those days, but that's obviously a very different world from the world we live in right now.

That perhaps obvious insight has yet to penetrate Mr. Trump's reality distortion field. He said on Tuesday that Congress should vote to repeal the law as early as next week and replace it with new legislation very shortly thereafter. His statements once again demonstrated cluelessness or indifference to how laws are made, especially in a field as complicated as health care. Most experts think that it could well take years for lawmakers to replace a law that requires insurers to sell affordable policies to people with pre-existing medical conditions, provides subsidies to help people buy insurance and encourages doctors and hospitals to reduce unnecessary and expensive medical procedures.
BS: Last question. What are you likely to fail at as president?
Under Mr. Ryan's leadership, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, in the midst of conducting hearings looking into possible wrongdoing by the president or his advisers, briefed the president on the progress and findings of the investigation. The chairman, Devin Nunes, facing ethics complaints over his conduct, has temporarily stepped down, with Mr. Ryan's approval. But the speaker was under an obligation to have immediately removed Mr. Nunes from his chairmanship in order to assert the House's independence from the White House. Instead, for days — because he, too, apparently sees himself as one of Donald Trump's assistants — Mr. Ryan continued to back Mr. Nunes.
LK: And a growing concern during the Trump era about violence. And I'm just wondering how you would address that, if that is in fact something that's not going to go away once the Trump era ends, which I think is a safe assumption.
Andrew scooped this morning that Steph Korey, who stepped aside as the chief of the hip luggage maker last month amid controversy over her management style, will return as co-C.E.O.
Are there Hispanic swing voters who would vote for a Republican who promised to protect entitlements and avoid messy foreign wars? Sure. Are there upper-middle-class white women who would vote for a Republican who seemed to be friendly to gay rights and favorably disposed to Planned Parenthood? No doubt. Are there African-American voters who would support a candidate who wants to renegotiate trade deals, limit low-skilled immigration and spend more money on U.S. infrastructure? I'm certain there are.
Both Trump and Clinton are not credible on tax reform. Trump lobbied for real estate breaks. Clinton did not try to end carried interest. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
archived recording (scott fitzgerald) It was completely disingenuous for the governor to tape a video and post it as if this was reality. To float the idea that they were going to find enough outer envelopes, ballots themselves, inner envelopes with first class postage, and mail it out to 3.3 million people in Wisconsin is completely made up.
But isn't that why he simply never brought it to a vote? I mean, so much of the Senate, there are so many bills that could have an unusual coalition. But I think an undernoticed reason that you have very few bipartisan votes in the Senate is the leadership doesn't bring bills that split their own caucus to the floor. And in this case, one of McConnell's key moves that liberals are very angry about to this day, but he didn't provide Garland a hearing. And I always understood that as trying to forestall exactly the situation you're talking about. Whether it was 13 or three, he didn't ever want to be in a situation where Republicans were asking themselves, does Merrick Garland deserve the seat? So he never let it get to a point where it would matter if he lost anybody because he controlled the floor structure, which I'm not really sure I think is a good way for the Senate to work. And I'd be curious for your thoughts on it. But my understanding is that was the key playwright there. So it never would have had an opportunity for Murkowski to break on the vote, because there was never going to be a vote because McConnell's never going to hold a vote.
And it sounds like at the end of the day, he is being honest in the sense that nothing did happen to him. He is the same guy.
On Tuesday, he took another step, telling gleeful banking executives that he was interested in shutting down a public database where people can lodge complaints against financial companies. Bureau officials had used the database to figure out when they needed to investigate a company and to gather evidence. Mulvaney dismissively referred to it as a Yelp for financial services sponsored by the federal government. Aaron Klein of the Brookings Institution told The Wall Street Journal's Yuka Hayashi that the database was an incredibly important tool that empowers consumers.
The recipient said she believed she was offered a vaccine because she had donated and volunteered for the hospital. And in Jefferson City, widespread confusion led some Missouri lawmakers to scramble for shots that were not intended for them. Group texts among House members and staff said vaccines were available at an area hotel, but the shots were meant for the state's public safety and transportation employees. Mr. Inslee said during Tuesday's news conference that Washington State's biggest barrier to widespread vaccine distribution was supply. As of Thursday, 6.2 percent of the state's population had received their first dose. Just 1.2 percent had received the full two doses. After hearing of the prioritizing of donors, Mr. Inslee said he believed that the hospital had halted that practice. We have to maintain public credibility in this system, he said.
But the Trump administration has joined the suit and a partisan Republican judge has indeed ruled that the A.C.A. as a whole should be struck down.
March 3, 2020, 11:27 p.m. ET March 3, 2020, 11:27 p.m. ET Urging unity in San Francisco. SAN FRANCISCO — Although polling places throughout the state struggled to manage long lines, voters saw little to no wait times at major polling places in San Francisco. Hours before the polls closed, voters at San Francisco's City Hall filled out registration forms and went straight through to vote. The polling place had not yet released turnout numbers for Tuesday, but said it had processed 1,005 voters the day prior. Voters in the city gathered at Manny's, a cafe and political space, to watch as the results came in. Giffords, an organization founded by Gabby Giffords that advocates gun control, held a fund-raiser at the event. Good evening, San Francisco! Are we ready to take our country back? David Chiu, a Democrat who represents San Francisco in the State Assembly, asked the crowd. Mr. Chiu urged unity, saying that although he had backed Elizabeth Warren, Californians needed to come together to support whoever became the Democratic nominee. What's so important is that we come together after this night, Mr. Chiu said. We define who the Democratic Party is. As Manny Yekutiel, the owner of the cafe, announced that results for Texas were tipping the state toward Bernie Sanders, the crowd cheered. Leslie Matthews, 33, said that she had voted by mail on Saturday and backed Elizabeth Warren.
The vote was 51 to 48. During the roll call, Democrats staged a highly unusual protest on the Senate floor to express their dismay and anger at the prospect that millions of Americans could lose health insurance coverage.
Mark Zuckerberg has held the line on Facebook's decision to allow political ads, even as Twitter banned them. The company's approach came under scrutiny after it said Mr. Trump's re-election campaign would be allowed to run an ad with false claims about Mr. Biden and his son Hunter. Mr. Zuckerberg said this is about free speech and not the profit motive.
This denial of racism is the heartbeat of racism. Where there is suffering from racist policies, there are denials that those policies are racist. The beat of denial sounds the same across time and space.
Sensing opportunity, Mr. Trump has sought to portray himself as a wartime leader in daily televised news briefings. It has given him a bump in the polls, with his approval ratings creeping up toward 50 percent as independents and some Democrats rally behind him, while Mr. Biden, the likely Democratic nominee, is largely drowned out by the president and even Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York.
I'm sorry. And who's fighting Mitch McConnell right now and from what platform?

And I don't think that's the right model.
Did you feel like in any way you had an audience in the White House?
Obamacare looks the way it does because it has to: You can't cover Americans with pre-existing conditions without requiring healthy people to sign up, and you can't do that without subsidies to make insurance affordable.
But from there, he jumped immediately to how John McCain made him feel, which was relevant.
Of course, polls also showed Obamacare to be unpopular in 2013. More important, recent polls showed that most voters didn't believe the government should be shut down over the Dreamers. Most polls also showed support for the Democrats slipping as the debate dragged on. And as I explained in my column yesterday, there is abundant evidence that a prolonged debate over illegal immigration helps Republicans, not Democrats.
And yet, the fight goes on. Many observers have noted that the Democratic debates — especially the first ones, which felt like a rolling seminar on medical insurance policy — have devoted a disproportionate amount of time to the candidates slashing at each other over who has the political courage — or naïveté — to go big on health care.
Their goal was to assure Justice Anthony M. Kennedy that his judicial legacy would be in good hands should he step down at the end of the court's term this week, as he was rumored to be considering. Allies of the White House were more blunt, warning the 81-year-old justice that time was of the essence. There was no telling, they said, what would happen if Democrats gained control of the Senate after the November elections and had the power to block the president's choice as his successor.
After the endorsement interview, Senator Warren reached out to Mr. Warzel to clarify her response on 20th century antitrust. In that follow-up interview, she said: Antitrust law is a very valuable tool and breaking them up would have important effects but what I realized after I left in the room is that I was pulled in a different direction but I never finished to say that antitrust law is important but not the only tool we need. I don't believe that markets alone are going to fix all the problems we're facing on the tech side. Particularly the issues around privacy and the values that come from aggregation on platforms and how that value would be distributed. I don't believe only antitrust works but I do believe its a powerful tool we should be using in dealing with Big Tech.
[We tracked down the 2020 Democrats and asked them the same set of questions. Watch them answer.]
It was only when Lyndon Johnson became president afterwards and after the Democrats took big majorities of Congress —
Elizabeth Warren, in her interview with the Times editorial board [Related: What Is an Editorial Board?] on Dec. 4, largely stuck to her polished script — which the senior senator from Massachusetts said she has delivered 175 times — calling for big structural change to right the imbalances in the current American economy and end what she sees as endemic corruption in business and politics. She famously has a plan for that and had a (lengthy) answer for nearly every question.
I think having people here who are working under the table is both bad for American workers and bad for the American economy. One of the reasons I propose to create a pathway to citizenship for everyone who's here to stay, a pathway that is fair and achievable, is to stop the problem of two-tier hiring: those who are hired in the legal system and then those who are hired outside the legal system. People who are undocumented have no protection and are frequently subject to wage theft, to unsafe working conditions, and that's not good for anyone. It's not good for American workers. It's not good for the American economy.
Well, I think that's certainly true in part, but there's been another force, which I think has been a stronger force in driving these changes, which has come more from the left than from the right, it seems to me, which is a rising generation of employees in white-collar America, certainly in the media and cultural institutions, but also in corporate America, that I think, in some ways, because of the culture of the university, enter the world of work expecting their workplace to stand for what they stand for and expecting a company that's not in the business of anything political to express political views, to stand for a kind of political identity when things happen in the country that speaks to their core concerns. Often, these are well-motivated concerns about race, about justice, about other things. Sometimes, they're more radical social views. But whatever they are, you find young workers pressing companies to become more political and to do so on the left. And I think these CEOs, which I'm sure some of them would love to identify with Mitt Romney, I think most of them would love to just not be in the business of politics. Michael Jordan's old line that got him in so much trouble, that he doesn't talk about politics because Republicans buy sneakers, too, that's the logic of a lot of corporate America at the end of the day. And they just don't want to be in these fights.
An Elizabeth Warren fan brought a miniature of the candidate to an event in Rye, N.H. Elizabeth Frantz for The New York Times
For years, the same hedge funds, private equity firms, and wealthy investors dismayed by the GameStop trades have treated the stock market like their own personal casino while everyone else pays the price, Senator Elizabeth Warren wrote on Twitter. It's long past time for the SEC and other financial regulators to wake up and do their jobs — and with a new administration and Democrats running Congress, I intend to make sure they do.
The pandemic becomes more acutely felt in the Midwest and particularly in Wisconsin.
Well, I think the filibuster can be disciplining in a different way. I don't think it's true that nothing in HR1 couldn't get through the filibuster. It's certainly true that HR1 couldn't get through the filibuster, and what that calls for is some negotiation, is breaking it apart into pieces. I think you'd see the same thing about the immigration reform that the Biden team seems ready to propose. These things, if they were broken down into smaller pieces that could be negotiated as legislation in a more traditional way, some of them could get through. Whether they could get time on the floor, I don't know. That's a separate problem. But I don't think it's the case that the argument for social change has to be that these ideas that only the narrow majority party can get through and you can't even get one in five members of the other party to agree to them have to be pushed through for there to be any movement on any issue, I think that suggests to us something about how we're thinking about packaging these issues and how we're thinking about putting debates on the floor. I do expect the Democrats to expand the bounds of the reconciliation process. I think they will do that, even if they don't get rid of the filibuster, which they probably won't. And so to push a little more through that path, and social conservatives do hate the filibuster, generally speaking.
Other candidates who addressed the question said they preferred some kind of public option for a government-run plan while still maintaining the private insurance system, at least in the immediate future.
Look, the single animating principle of everything Ryan did and proposed was to comfort the comfortable while afflicting the afflicted. Can anyone name a single instance in which his supposed concern about the deficit made him willing to impose any burden on the wealthy, in which his supposed compassion made him willing to improve the lives of the poor? Remember, he voted against the Simpson-Bowles debt commission proposal not because of its real flaws, but because it would raise taxes and fail to repeal Obamacare.
And all of these catastrophes were related to climate change.
Oh, absolutely. And if the concern among folks like Mick Mulvaney is that walking away from the fight looks like surrender, the view from a lot of Republicans on the Hill is they've already lost. They can talk about how they lost, or they can talk about other stuff, and the president is choosing to talk about defeat.
Since entering the Democratic race in November, former New York Mayor Mike Bloomberg has outspent almost all of his opponents in TV advertisements, spending over $100 million in just the first month.
Because for me, they all are about a central question and that's: Who's going to get opportunity in this country going forward? Will opportunity be reserved just for those born into privilege? Or will opportunity be something that we say as a country, we're willing to make some hard choices to invest, so that all of our kids get those opportunities?
They're doing so even though they know that Trump was installed in office in part thanks to Russian aid, that his financial entanglements with foreign governments pose huge conflicts of interest and that he consistently shows a preference for dictatorships over our democratic allies.
Tell me where you fall on this. So I wrote this column about this. It's very much about this exact idea. I think that not only on the right, but actually on the left, we overstate the value of paid labor. I'll use myself as an example. We had a three day weekend recently and I will say that my Monday without childcare was a lot harder than my Mondays being a New York Times columnist. I mean, the idea that being a single parent of three kids is not labor, it's just a wild way that we have mentally constructed our perceptions of the economy. What is the value of saying, it is work to go work at a daycare center taking care of somebody else's child for $9 an hour, but it is not work to be at home taking care of your child or your children?
March 4, 2020, 1:21 a.m. ET March 4, 2020, 1:21 a.m. ET Gina Ortiz Jones, Wendy Davis and Pete Sessions win primaries in Texas. Three familiar faces in Texas politics have gotten closer to securing representation in the House as part of the Texas delegation. Wendy Davis, who lost a high-profile governor's race in 2014, won the Democratic primary in the 21st District, where she will face Representative Chip Roy, a freshman G.O.P. incumbent. Along the border, Gina Ortiz Jones clinched the nomination to run for Texas' 23rd Congressional District, which is open. In 2018, she lost to Representative Will Hurd, the retiring incumbent, by less than 2,000 votes. Both women are part of the Red to Blue program run by the House Democratic campaign arm, which singles out candidates that the organization feels has some of the strongest chances of flipping districts in favor of the Democratic Party. For the Republicans, Pete Sessions, who was defeated in 2018 by Colin Allred, is now vying to return to Congress in a different district. On Wednesday night, he secured a spot in the runoff in the race to replace Representative Bill Flores, the retiring incumbent, who tapped another candidate as his chosen successor. Read more
And on the socialism side, even though this was largely a private market program, it still was susceptible to those kinds of criticisms. And we heard Republicans talking about it as a government takeover, talking about as a socialist plot.
The budget reconciliation rules that would allow Republicans to dismantle the Affordable Care Act have strict limits. The rules are primarily intended to protect legislation that affects spending or revenues. The health law includes insurance market standards and other policies that do not directly affect the budget, and Senate Republicans would, in many cases, need 60 votes to change such provisions.
Named after Robert Byrd of West Virginia, who was the longest-serving senator in history, the rule says that senators can stop a bill under this special procedure if it contains matter extraneous to the federal budget. There are many complex details, which is why there is uncertainty about what counts. The House staff members who wrote the American Health Care Act apparently felt that changing Obamacare's requirement that all plans cover 10 basic categories of benefits would break the rule. (But, for example, they believed that changing the rules for how much insurance companies could charge older customers was O.K.)
This is our chance to turn that one around.
Humana's move could be a harbinger of things to come, said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at Georgetown University who studies the health insurance market and who has warned that the lack of clarity from Congress and the Trump administration could result an exodus by insurers.
KK: I'm trying to get a lot in here.
Ted Cruz had a teachable moment in Iowa, although he himself will learn nothing from it. A voter told Mr. Cruz the story of his brother-in-law, a barber who had never been able to afford health insurance. He finally got insurance thanks to Obamacare — and discovered that it was too late. He had terminal cancer, and nothing could be done.
I don't think this was the most efficient way to do this, said Pramila Jayapal, a Democratic congresswoman from Washington State, who is the lead sponsor of the House's Medicare for All bill. She proposed legislation that would have allowed unemployed Americans transition to Medicare rather than staying on their former employers' plans.
But he made clear to associates in the aftermath of the Jan. 6 attack that he viewed Mr. Trump's actions around the riot as impeachable and saw a Senate trial as an opportunity to purge him from the party. In a letter to colleagues, Mr. McConnell signaled that he was open to conviction. And then last week, he flatly said the president had provoked the mob that sent the vice president and lawmakers fleeing. They were striking moves for Mr. McConnell, who for four years consistently supported and enabled Mr. Trump. But in the wake of the mob assault and a pair of Senate losses in Georgia, Mr. McConnell had come to view the former president as a dangerous political liability. In the week since Mr. Trump decamped to his private club in Florida, it has become increasingly clear that his departure has done little to loosen his grip on rank-and-file Republicans in Congress. While few have defended his conduct, many fewer have dared to back the impeachment push. The 10 House Republicans who did join Democrats in voting to impeach him faced fierce backlash. Emily Cochrane and Luke Broadwater contributed reporting. Nicholas Fandos and
Unraveling the Affordable Care Act would deal a catastrophic blow to the safety net. The health exchanges and new insurance regulations? Gone. Medicaid expansion, which even in its truncated form has reached people in 36 states? Gone. The host of protections for people who get health care through jobs and private insurers? Gone. Republican elites might cheer this destruction, but soon enough they would face millions of voters who pulled levers in 2016 believing that Trump and the Republican Party would protect them.
In that sense, the role he is most comfortable occupying is the job he was once so over.
So why do I say the price increases are a real problem? Because those insurance exchanges are vital to the idea of universal coverage in this country. Without them, many people who don't qualify for government insurance or aren't covered through their job will be stuck without good medical care.
Clinton notes that as SecState she advocated for women's rights. True. On every trip, she raised issues of trafficking or child marriage. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
I am in this fight because my daddy ended up as a janitor. I got my big chance at a commuter college that cost $50 a semester, because a bunch of taxpayers had invested in that college. That opportunity is not there today. That same college costs $15,000 now. Kids have to load up on debt to go there today. That's not expanding opportunity in this country. We've got a choice to make as a nation and the good news about 2020, the door has opened just a crack, that all the things that have been broken for so long, Donald Trump has made so much worse and gotten so many people off the sidelines, we actually have a chance. Not just to nibble, but to make big change.
And in Oklahoma, voters narrowly approved expanding Medicaid coverage to at least 200,000 lower-income adults, according to The Associated Press, an affirmation of Obamacare in an overwhelmingly Republican state. The results, coming as the state battles the coronavirus pandemic, was a repudiation of President Trump and Republican state leaders who had opposed the Medicaid expansion and who supported a court case seeking to overturn President Barack Obama's signature health care plan.
O.K.? And I have seen the billionaire go on TV and cry about it.
You know, this is a hard hypothetical to take on until you actually know what's happening. Again, you've got to back this one up on where we should have started. When the unrest first started unfolding in Hong Kong, for Donald Trump to step back and say in effect, gee, I think China's going to crack down on Hong Kong, and effectively inviting it, I think is the wrong place for the United States to be. I think that we should have been in a position from the beginning, saying to China, we support these efforts in Hong Kong. That's part one.
March 3, 2020, 11:14 p.m. ET March 3, 2020, 11:14 p.m. ET In heavily Latino East Los Angeles, a bastion of support for Sanders. LOS ANGELES — Looked at one way, Lorena Vellanowth's family is the embodiment of the American dream. She came to Los Angeles from Mexico as a baby, and her daughter went on to study at the University of California, Los Angeles, and then to attend graduate school at the University of Southern California. But all that success came with a big caveat: Her daughter, who works in public administration for the city of Anaheim, is struggling under the weight of almost half a million dollars in student loans. Bigger than my mortgage, said Ms. Vellanowth, 43, who works in health care. She said her daughter is getting married this month, and she worries about how her daughter will be able to afford to raise children or buy a home. That reason alone was enough for Ms. Vellanowth, and many of her family members and friends in the Latino community, to support Bernie Sanders, she said, drawn by his message of fighting the type of inequality they feel every day in Los Angeles. I'm Latina, and you'd think that's not someone I'd vote for, an old white guy, she said on Monday afternoon outside a polling center at a park in the heavily Latino East Los Angeles. But she worries about her candidate's future, now that the Democratic establishment is coalescing around Joseph R. Biden Jr.
As much as I was against it, he said, at this point I'm against the repeal.
So the next American president to really make a go at this was Harry Truman —
Credit Credit... Doug Mills/The New York Times President Biden, seeking to expand access to health care and strengthen the Affordable Care Act, used his executive authority Thursday to order the reopening of enrollment in the health law's marketplaces and a re-examination of Trump administration policies that undermined protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. His aim, he said in a brief signing ceremony in the Oval Office, was to undo the damage Trump has done. Mr. Biden also moved to protect reproductive rights and expand access to abortion, and took separate executive action to overturn his predecessor's restrictions on the use of taxpayer dollars for clinics that refer or counsel patients to terminate pregnancies, both in the United States and overseas. Taken together, Mr. Biden is trying to put a quick stamp on health policies that have been critical to a Democratic resurgence, especially those that back the Affordable Care Act, which he helped secure as President Barack Obama's vice president. President Donald J. Trump failed to overturn the health law, but he spent four years undermining it with a series of executive actions, including allowing the sale of cheap, short-term and small-business health plans that do not meet the law's health coverage mandates. Mr. Biden's first step is to reopen enrollment for health coverage offered through the federal marketplace created under the health law, also known as Obamacare.
The Trump administration has not said whether the government will continue paying subsidies to keep costs down for people with Obamacare. If it doesn't, middle-income people could see their rates jump.
The idea of a single government health care system for all Americans has been treated with extreme caution by the Democratic leadership, which has stressed more modest improvements to the current health law. On Tuesday, Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office was pointing to the bills moving through the House Judiciary Committee that could lower the prices of prescription drugs.
In her latest attempt to rally support for Brexit after a series of embarrassing setbacks, British prime minister Theresa May said she would seek a new delay for leaving the European Union and would begin negotiating a Brexit plan with her political rivals in the Labour Party.
The amendment doesn't do anything to help that population in particular, but it adds a provision that would allow everyone to deduct more health care expenses from taxes. The change is intended as a placeholder, expected to cost about $85 billion over a decade, that could be turned by the Senate into targeted tax assistance for older insurance buyers, according to a Republican aide. What the Senate would do with the money is still unclear. But $85 billion would go only part of the way toward filling the gap between subsidies offered under this bill and the Affordable Care Act for older insurance shoppers.
I'm naturally a really quiet person, but if I sit and do nothing and they take it away, how can I live with that? asked Kim Nelson, 54, a Republican second-grade teacher who buys coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace and was recently treated for breast cancer. She has been calling and writing her congresswoman.
Health care, in other words, may have decided the midterm, and is certain to play a pivotal role in the primary. And next year, it could play a pivotal role in the general election, too. But will it help or hurt the Democratic candidate?
JI: But one of the premises for massive health care reform is that the Affordable Care Act is not working in a lot of ways, right? So you support Medicare for all presumably because you think the Affordable Care Act has a lot of holes in it, and we need to do something different, so you'll be defending that.
Well, look, I'm going to start. I don't want Mitch McConnell, obviously.
In the October Democratic debate, Times national editor Marc Lacey asked Mr. Yang to comment on Senator Warren's calls to break up companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google. Mr. Yang said Senator Warren is correct in her diagnosis of the problem but breaking up the companies isn't an adequate solution because using a 20th-century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new tool kit.
Critics of Senator Warren's student debt plan say it would unfairly benefit those on the path to becoming highly paid professionals.
A few early regulatory changes have begun that process. The Trump administration plans to make it harder for people to sign up for plans midyear. It has given insurers more wiggle room to raise their deductibles. It may be able to make alterations that loosen up benefit requirements — though it won't be able to completely eliminate them, as Republicans sought to do at the last minute in the failed bill.
You can take it through a constitutional amendment if you think it needs a constitutional amendment.
Ms. Pelosi's is a cautious prescription — one that, in addition to frustrating the less patient elements of her party, clashes with her longstanding image as a crusading San Francisco liberal. This incongruity flows partly from the fact that her caricature was always just that, a partisan construct Republicans used to fire up their base. But it also reflects the political landscape in which the speaker now finds herself the nation's most powerful Democrat.
Millennials also tend to have a lower level of financial knowledge, which may make them more vulnerable to medical debt, another institute analysis found.
But this year's budget will serve as a blueprint for Mr. Trump's priorities if he wins a second term. And some of the proposals can be achieved without the approval of Congress.
One thing I am struck by over the past however many days it's been, the banning of Trump from Twitter and Facebook really silenced him. There are other ways he could have gotten more attention. He could be calling into more shows. He could have, when he was still president, walked out in the briefing room. So there may be a part of him that is licking wounds, too. But he is quiet in a way that I think if he were still particularly on Twitter, he would not be. And so that worked. And at the same time, in part because it worked, you have to be a little unnerved by it. You have to be a little unnerved at that power being held by Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg. There's certainly a lot of fury on the right about that, certainly a lot of fury on the right about Parler and the way that was taken out of a lot of different kinds of web providers, from app stores to cloud hosting, given their moderation structure, because these places did not want to provide infrastructure for another insurrection to be planned. How do you think about that power of tech, on the one hand, to regulate access to what I think is best understood not as free speech, but a public square? And on the other hand, it has responsibilities as a company. It wants to keep people. It wants to keep staff.
KK: O.K., the Electoral College is really important to Jesse. So much of the biggest change in recent years has come through the Supreme Court. Who would be your Supreme Court nominees?
We would like to get to a point where we have what we call universal access, where everybody is able to access coverage to some degree or another, the aide said. Over the past six years, if you look at the experience we've had with the A.C.A. rollout, chasing coverage doesn't necessarily yield great outcomes. You can have people going into an exchange, finding out that their pediatrician is no longer available to them.
KK: Yes, I am, undocumented immigrants, excuse me.
At the very least it adds uncertainty at exactly the moment when plans are trying to set rates for next year, said Ceci Connolly, the chief executive of the Alliance of Community Health Plans. At the worst it could strip away guaranteed coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.
Not a damn thing. And people kind of nodded knowingly. And what he was doing was sort of owning the question. He was sort of taking it as a part of his political identity. But at the same time, he was being defiant about it, too. And he kept talking about how, look, all the smart people in Washington, they hate us. The people in the media, they hate us. They hate him, him being Donald Trump. Essentially, it's sort of an old populist refrain, which is they don't — they look down on our way of life. Literally the next day in his office in Washington, he was talking about how you showcase your issues. This is what you do when you're running for re-election. He was —
Mr. Trump released his short list of potential Supreme Court nominees in May 2016. In September 2016, he released a second list with several more women and people of color, following criticisms of the white and male bias in his first.
One of them is use march-in orders on prescription drugs. We can bring down the cost of EpiPens and insulin and other drugs, so that we save families literally hundreds of millions of dollars. It can be done without Mitch McConnell. The power is already there. You've just got to be willing to pick it up and use it. Nobody else has talked about picking it up and using it.
To that end, Trump had directed the Justice Department on Monday to seek the invalidation of the entire law, backing a federal district judge in Texas who declared it unconstitutional late last year.

It is the party that under Ronald Reagan welcomed refugees. It is the party of men who exemplified decency like George H.W. Bush and adherence to a moral compass like John McCain.
Well, I'm actually not sure that's true for everyone. Sometimes people are here because they want to become Twitter celebrities, which I think has actually become a more common route in the Republican congressional conference. But you hit something there that I think is really deep that I want to focus on for a minute, which is, who controls the Republican Party? And I think if you talk to a liberal about this five years ago, 10 years ago, the model they have of the Republican Party is it is controlled by corporations, the Chamber of Commerce. That whatever those players want, they get. And I don't think that's entirely wrong even now. They got their tax cuts, even after Donald Trump ran as a quasi-populist. There was the Obamacare repeal effort. So the congressional wing of the Republican Party has still been pretty responsive there. But what that wing of the party wants is pretty different than what the base of the party wants. The base of the party does not want the kinds of immigration reforms the Chamber of Commerce wants. The base of the party does want a lot more cultural grievance fighting than the Chamber of Commerce wants. And I think a reasonable model of the Republican Party over the past 10 years is that those institutional players have not dissolved, but they're weakening. And the base is getting much more of what it wants and there's actually a pretty big conflict between what the two sides want.
Michael Conway, who served as counsel for the house Judiciary Committee during the Nixon impeachment inquiry, said President Nixon also tried to deny the investigators access to key materials, but Mr. Trump has gone a step further. Mr. Conway said, Nixon was equally resistant to turning materials over and documents, but he did allow people to testify.
I have a plan to build about 3.2 million new housing units across this country to make money available for changing zoning and working together across municipal boundaries on joint projects that increase density and trying to use the federal government as a partner to move forward in bringing down the cost overall for housing.
Virtually every European government with 'universal' health care restricts access in one way or another to control costs, and it isn't pretty, said a Wall Street Journal editorial about the A.C.A. The Journal allowed that our system already rations health care according to people's ability to pay for it, but argued that that's how freedom works: This is true of every good or service in a free economy and a world of finite resources but infinite wants.
Republicans are also spending far too little time on trying to deal with the underlying problem of costs. A couple of suggestions: How about requiring hospitals to publish their prices, and allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices (which Donald Trump backed as a candidate)?
In other years, the budget process has become bogged down, and Congress has kept the government funded through temporary extensions known as continuing resolutions (C.R.s) that fund government operations based on current levels, or rolled everything into an omnibus — or in some cases, a CRomnibus, combining a budget omnibus bill and a continuing resolution. It's kludgy language to describe a kludgy process.
Clearly, this case is headed for the Supreme Court. But Trump doesn't want it heard until after the election.
AK: O.K. No, I mean, it's not my critique. This is a critique on the left as well, you know, that going about forgiving student debt in this way puts a lot of money in households that are going to make a lot of money.
And this wasn't just a Republican government that passed kind of conventional conservative bills. This was seen as really a laboratory of conservative ideas.
So the way I see this is all I can do is get out and tell you what I'll fight for, and I'll point out the difference between the two. I try not to get over my skis. No, I do. I've really tried hard not to be personally critical of other candidates. I got a little heated once, but once, and because I think this is the fundamental question. Do you think that this democracy, do you think that this economy, do you think this government is going to make it if all we're offering are little nibbles around the edges?

Since scolding member nations at the 2017 summit, Mr. Trump has followed up with strongly worded letters to NATO nations advising that if they don't increase their payments, it will be increasingly hard to justify why American soldiers continue to sacrifice their lives overseas.
His response to the Floyd killing was less about hammering Mr. Trump than about encouraging young people, who have been slow in embracing Mr. Biden, to vote. When he chose to speak publicly, it was to host an online forum highlighting a slate of policing reforms that went nowhere in Congress in his second term.
Yeah. I think we need to bring our combat troops home.
Well, I agree with that, but I think the question of what the public is asking for is a more complicated question than that would suggest. So that ultimately, the fact of our division, the fact of our roughly 50-50 country on most election days — not always — is, in some ways, the beginning here. And you're suggesting the parties could change that fact by virtue of what they get through Congress. And I think the question of whether that's quite right is related to the question of how we think about durable minorities and how we think about durable majorities. We are in a time, and we have been for now three decades, where there's not a dominant majority party. Generally speaking, in our history, there has been a dominant party, and the other party basically functions by pushing off it in one way or another, by being against this or for that, in relation to what the majority is doing. We've been living, since the 1990s, in a period where we have two minority parties, and each of them wins elections by getting the public just a little bit more frustrated with the other. And it's just a little bit, and it's generally in a negative way. Most people who win elections now win by not being the other person.
There was a court ruling that basically affirmed that the Republicans probably have control over when the election should be held, but the ruling expanded access to absentee voting. Republicans appealed that straight to the U.S. Supreme Court. And then on Monday —
WASHINGTON — Since the 2008 financial crisis, conservative economists and Republican politicians have claimed several policy errors were holding back economic growth and contributing to a painfully slow recovery, including lackluster wage growth. The government was spending too much, it was borrowing too much and it was sowing uncertainty in the business world with expiring tax cuts and other bitter policy battles, they said.
Evers would not have the power to regulate guns in the same way that existed for his predecessor. They also limit early voting, which is a kind of tool of access to the ballot box that has sometimes helped Democrats, because more people in bigger areas can get to the polls. These were all really nakedly partisan, and Republicans didn't really even try to hide it.
More likely, given the state of the G.O.P. under Trump, who is no one's idea of a wonk, is that Republicans will simply decline to pursue the issue with any force, and the shabbiness of the party's current non-position will become even more glaring. Indeed, just this month, Mr. Trump continued to predict Obamacare's demise, saying he believed that it's going to be terminated, possibly as a result of the Texas case, and that in the aftermath, a deal will be made for good health care in this country. What sort of deal? I suspect that even (perhaps especially) the president doesn't know.
First, some context: The 260 million or so Americans who receive health insurance through their employer, Medicare or Medicaid (including through Obamacare's Medicaid expansion) are unaffected by the prices increases. The increases instead apply to the 10 million people who buy coverage on one of the private-insurance exchanges established by the law. Even among those 10 million, the vast majority receives government subsidies that will largely or partly cancel out the price increase.
Well, you know, it obviously depends on the program, but I worry about — for example, increasing the dollar payment on Section 8 vouchers, it doesn't seem to increase the supply of housing. Instead, it seems to make a segment of landlords richer. So I'd rather take that money and put it directly into increasing housing supply.
Proponents want to sweep away our complex, confusing, profit-driven mess of a health care system and start fresh with a single government-run insurer that would cover everyone.
Coverage gains were largest among people of middle income, older people and racial minorities. The insured rate for Hispanic Texans increased by 10.9 percentage points between 2013 and 2016, according to a study published in the American Journal of Public Health. Over that same period, coverage increased 12.1 percentage points for Texans between 50 and 64 years old, and 10.2 percentage points for those describing their health as fair or poor.
No. Not — slightly is not the right term.
But he was clear on one point: Plans by congressional Republicans to repeal the health law now, then take years to create and implement a replacement law are unacceptable to the incoming president.
E.U. Vaccine Shortages Snowball Into a Crisis As the U.S.'s new virus team holds its first briefing, Biden advisers urge passage of a relief bill. New York City restaurants may reopen for limited indoor dining.
The Sanders plan would increase federal spending by about $32.6 trillion over its first 10 years, according to a Mercatus Center study that Blahous led. Compare that with the Congressional Budget Office's projection for the entire 2019 fiscal year budget, $4.4 trillion. That kind of sticker shock is why a plan for single-payer in Vermont collapsed in 2014 and why Colorado voters overwhelmingly rejected one in 2016. It's why legislators in California killed one. In this plan, the taxes are upfront, the purported savings are down the line.
Fewer still would make such a tasteless comparison.
Not all aspects of reform carry quite the same partisan or ideological tinge. Criminal-justice reform, intended to reduce the harms of mass incarceration, seems to be one of the few genuinely bipartisan agenda items in Washington. (Trump himself, who rails against savage criminals, has spoken about reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance.) Campaign-finance reform occasionally rallies support across party lines, as do a few select aspects of immigration reform.
The Defense Department then halted disclosure of data about specific installations. Lack of vaccinations has been a major obstacle to resuming war crimes hearings at the base's Camp Justice compound. It was not immediately known whether the defendants in the Sept. 11 case, including Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, would consent to be vaccinated. An Army judge has scheduled an arraignment on Feb. 22 for three prisoners accused of conspiring in deadly terrorist attacks in Indonesia in 2002 and 2003. Under the timeline described by Mr. Trivett, prisoners who agree to be vaccinated could receive their second dose on the eve of the arraignment, the first at Guantánamo's war court since 2014. The arraignment hearing would be the first court appearance for the three detainees — Encep Nurjaman, who is known as Hambali; Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep; and Mohammed Farik Bin Amin — who have been in U.S. custody since they were captured in Thailand in 2003. Mr. Hambali, who is Indonesian, is held at Guantánamo as the former leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, a Southeast Asian extremist group that became an Al Qaeda affiliate before the Sept. 11 attacks. The other two men are Malaysians accused of being Mr. Hambali's accomplices in the 2002 nightclub bombings in Bali, which killed 202 people, and the 2003 Marriott hotel bombing in Jakarta, which killed at least 11 people and wounded at least 80. Lawyers for several of the detainees said they would need to consult with their clients by letter about whether to consent to be vaccinated.
Serge Schmemann: Let me ask you about the Middle East. In the October debate you said, I think we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. Did you mean nowhere in the Middle East? Do you think — for example, who should control the Persian Gulf, freedom of navigation, should we close down the air base in Qatar?
But here's the thing: Protecting coverage for pre-existing conditions is overwhelmingly popular, commanding majority support even among Republicans. And McCaskill has been hammering Hawley over his role in that lawsuit.
Fighting corruption is, indeed, an issue with cross-party support. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last year, people ranked as the country's second most important issue reducing the influence of special interests and corruption in Washington.
Well, maybe when I get elected, you can come and help me figure out what's enough, Mr. Biden told him.
Their efforts foundered in March, when a House health bill had to be pulled from the floor after it failed to attract enough support. But now, the bill appears back from the dead, because of a compromise meant to attract votes from the conservative Freedom Caucus. The proposed changes would effectively cast aside the Affordable Care Act's protection of people with pre-existing conditions.
All right, when I get going on reconciliation, man, I'm hard to stop.
What happened to Lindsey Graham, do you think?
But I get it. There are right now, Democrats against Democrats on this. But understand this, we'll get into a general election. Oh, I know what the insurance industry will want to do. I know what Donald Trump will want to do. But the truth is we're going to have the party who tried to take away health care from 35 million Americans, said it was O.K. to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions and is continuing to follow that right now, both in their lawsuits and in their agency practices, and millions of people have lost their health care.
He later added, I'm not looking at months, I can tell you right now.
And he explained his own opposition to decriminalizing illegal border crossings, a view that contrasts with several of his more liberal opponents.
And even if we get to the other side of this crisis by January, there are going to be a set of wrenching debates around who got bailed out and who didn't and around how much civil liberty we should sacrifice to track and quarantine Covid-19 carriers until there is a vaccine. If handled on a partisan basis, those issues will rip our country apart.
He was seen, much like McCain was, as someone who you could have a conversation with, who you could deal with.
Well, I think that the bottom line is if we don't clearly define that we are not socialists, the Republicans are going to come at us every way they can and call us socialists. I disagree with both their perspectives. The debate we're having in our party right now is confusing. Because the truth is there's a big difference between capitalism on the one hand and greed on the other.
Y cuando finalmente intervino la oficina presupuestaria, sus conclusiones fueron las esperadas: si se hacen recortes importantes al programa para personas de bajos recursos, Medicaid, y disminuyen los subsidios a los seguros de gastos mayores privados —todo para poder reducir los impuestos que paga la clase alta— mucha gente va a quedarse sin cobertura. La cifra estimada es de unos 23 millones de personas sin cobertura. ¿Es factible ese número? Sí, podrían ser 18 o 28 millones, pero sin duda los afectados estarán entre esas cantidades.
So, of course, McConnell spent enormous amounts of energy whipping Republicans to deny Obama bipartisan cooperation on Obamacare. So it wasn't just sort of a fact of life he was observing that he had failed to get a single Republican vote. It was something McConnell deployed every tool in his arsenal to do. And I detailed that in the book.
But it's not going to be real change because so long as the lobbyists are writing it, so long as they're the ones who are in the ears of the folks in the House and the Senate, we're just going to keep making little, tiny changes, and I just don't think we can keep doing that.
As such he's hesitant to indict one side without trying to indict the other, making for some tortured equivalences. After chastising Obama-thwarting Republicans, he says he's puzzled by Democrats whose highest priority in the Trump years seems to be thwarting this president (before conceding that the president is such an outlier that blocking him may be defensible). He venerates bipartisan consensus and compromise, even though he shows how they can lead to terrible deals. Obamacare, by placating the insurance industry, was a quintessential compromise — as was the haggling after the 2008 financial crisis that kept even the most notorious bankers from jail.
In terms of expanding the electorate, would you support something like HR1, the For The People Act, which Democrats want to bring as the first bill in the new Congress?
A graduate with a professional degree expects to earn $2.3 million more than a high school graduate. The Brookings Institution's Adam Looney estimated that under Senator Warren's plan the bottom 20 percent of borrowers by income get only 4 percent of the savings.
Glenn Thrush of The New York Times reported, Mr. Trump, aides said, refers to nearly every program that provides benefits to poor people as welfare, a term he regards as derogatory. And I guess you can see where that comes from. After all, he's a self-made man who can't attribute any of his own success to, say, inherited wealth. Oh, wait.
Bigger changes are coming. The administration has proposed regulations that would allow so-called short-term health plans to be offered for nearly a year of coverage. Those plans aren't subject to any Obamacare rules in most states, and are likely to be marketed aggressively. They are likely to cover fewer health services and be available only to the healthy — but at a lower price. Another pending rule would expand the availability of association health plans, a form of group insurance purchasing that may be attractive to small businesses looking for cheaper, less comprehensive options.
Ahora, algunos dirían: 'Ese no es un comentario muy republicano', afirmó a Cooper.
Critics of Senator Warren's student debt plan say it would unfairly benefit those on the path to becoming highly paid professionals.
On the Republican side, Representative Jim Jordan's campaign office announced yesterday that he would not be running for the Ohio Senate seat in 2022. Senator Rob Portman said this week that he would not run for re-election, and Jordan, a staunch Trump ally, was widely seen as having the best shot at capturing the G.O.P. nomination.
The Affordable Care Act, Gilens continued, is one illustration of the power of interest groups in constraining Democratic Party policy.
KK: I'm trying to get a lot in here.
I mean, the Ryan moment, the Paul Ryan moment, where the Republican Party was about makers not takers and was all in on an entitlement reform. I mean, that wasn't the way the Republican Party was between 1981 and 2008, right? I mean, Reagan explicitly said basically, he wasn't going to do much on entitlements and didn't. And then George W Bush actually expanded in entitlements, with the Medicare drug benefit and obviously was a big government guy in general. And so, the Republican Party had gone down a little bit of an ideological cul-de-sac, during the Obama years. One of the reasons why that old Republican Party blew up, was because it had become such a brittle orthodoxy, that had gotten so far detached from political reality. It was not where voters at large were. And it turned out it wasn't even where Republican base voters were, where the Republican electorate was. So and you saw this in 2016, right? I mean, you'd have these ads from the Club for Growth. Trump has said this about health care and Trump said that about taxes and he's done this on trade. And there were a bunch of Republican primary voters who actively liked what Trump was saying on those issues. And then there was another group of Republican voters who just didn't care, right? They weren't so excited about any of those old Republican agenda items, that they held it against him that he wasn't for them.
This approach does not eliminate opposition. A conservative coalition ran a campaign against the measure, claiming that it would increase energy costs. But the state's largest utility, NV Energy, mostly stayed out of the fight. It will still be able to earn big profits from renewable energy, albeit probably not quite as big. In the end, the initiative passed, 59 percent to 41 percent.
There are smaller decisions ahead, too, about how to administer programs, whether to enforce the law's individual mandate, and whether to recruit insurers to participate in markets where competition is thin.
Tariffs are one of the tools. Economic agreements across countries, that many countries join together, and say, we're not going to let anyone import if they're using prison labor, for example, or if they're dumping dangerous chemicals into the water. There are lots of ways to do this, but we can't simply think of this as a tariff, no tariff protectionism barrier. It's not. It's about regulations. Look at the dang NAFTA 2.0, look at what we were negotiating for T.T.I.P. T.T.I.P. was about financial regulations, not about goods that were moving, in a sense, the old way that people think about, that you put a bunch of stuff on a barge and you ship it across the Atlantic Ocean. And we just need to tune into the fact we know what our advantage is and we need to use it, not to try to lock others out, but to try to encourage others to come in.
When a former engineer revealed a pattern of sexual harassment at Uber last year, Travis Kalanick, then the company's chief executive, said he would immediately open an investigation. When users complained about bugs and problems with the Apple Maps app in 2012, Tim Cook, the company's chief executive, released a statement that said we fell short. And in 2011, when Netflix tried to split off its mail-order DVD business into a company called Qwikster, its chief executive, Reed Hastings, wrote a letter to the public. I messed up, he said. I owe everyone an explanation.
President Trump's promise to promote health insurance sales across state lines? Not in the American Health Care Act. Mr. Price's commitment to loosen burdensome benefit rules for private health plans in Obamacare? Also not in the bill. Mr. Ryan's favored policy of high-risk pools? Not there either. The goal of giving states more flexibility to run their Medicaid programs according to local conditions? Barely.
NATO members agreed, in 2014, to a goal of spending 2 percent of their G.D.P. on defense, but in 2017 the only countries to meet that goal were America, Britain, Greece, Poland and Estonia. Mr. Trump chastised fellow member states at a 2017 summit, declaring that 23 of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should.

Exactly. A 2-cent wealth tax just means if you don't lift a finger, your fortune only grows at 4 percent, 6 percent, 8 percent. And yet how many people in this country who are so sophisticated and knowledgeable — right — say you could never get a wealth tax because the billionaires and millionaires won't let it happen? Well, what the hell? This is a democracy.
The American government's antitrust battle with the oil industry perhaps epitomizes a 20th-century approach to antitrust — in 1911, the Supreme Court ordered the dissolution of Standard Oil. Of course, many would argue that the country's dependence on oil and its addiction to Facebook aren't totally comparable.
Right. I mean, I just want to say obviously I don't disagree with you about all of this being extremely stifling. I guess, to me, it's just the question of, do you try to expand the social definition of what women can do and what men can do? Or do you try to erase the idea that male and female has any inherent meaning? And I guess, you know, I know people for whom the idea of doing that seems utopian. And I guess, for me, it just — it doesn't speak to me. It's not something that I particularly aspire to, even though, obviously I don't want to live by the traditional limitations of femininity. And I don't want my kids to be subject to those. I mean, I've had the same experience as you both, to a certain extent. And I think that it's always a temptation, especially if you have one boy and one girl, or in Ross's case is two girls and one boy, to overinterpret a very small sample size.
The House speaker, Paul Ryan, claimed on Tuesday that Republicans would try to repeal and replace the law concurrently. He offered few details, but his statement suggests Congress won't repeal the A.C.A. for several months at least. On Monday, five Republican senators — Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Susan Collins of Maine, Bob Corker of Tennessee, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Rob Portman of Ohio — faced up to that reality. They proposed slowing down a budgetary process designed by congressional leaders to effectively kill the most important parts of Obamacare by defunding them.

Roger Severino, the director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services, the unit responsible for the rule, said in an interview Friday that the move was equivalent to housekeeping, and that the federal government was updating our books to reflect the legal reality that sex discrimination language does not explicitly refer to the legal status of transgender people.
Some progressives believe that Mr. Manchin and others may change their minds if Republicans obstruct the Democratic agenda. For their part, some moderates argue that the threat of eliminating the filibuster could force Republicans into legislative compromise. The minority party has often used the filibuster to thwart signature items of the majority party, and some Democrats fear that, without it, they would be powerless to stop Republicans the next time they control the Senate. Mr. Biden's commitment to keeping the Senate filibuster harks back to the policy debates that animated the Democratic presidential primary. The logic was informed by years of congressional gridlock under former President Barack Obama and the magnitude of challenges facing the country: Big problems need big solutions, they argued, and the filibuster was a blockade to progress. With the Senate split 50-50 between Democrats and Republicans, that could empower Mr. McConnell and a small cadre of moderate voices to block nearly any piece of legislation. It could doom Mr. Biden to the same fate as his Democratic presidential predecessor, who blamed Republican obstructionism for blocking a more robust liberal agenda. Mr. Markey said he was confident that if Mr. Biden began to experience the same fate, he would come around. Astead W. Herndon and
So in a way, you're reminding John McCain of his own example, but also appealing to the ego that John McCain obviously had in very, very high measure.
Several states that expanded their Medicaid programs could reverse course if the Republican plan became law.
And he actually got a fair amount of Dodd-Frank. And — that he did, but ——
He went on to veto that program, after the legislature secured its funding.
How about a different hypothesis: the foundations for Trumpism were laid in part by conservatives who made dishonesty about policy a routine part of Republican politics, and also both-sides-do-it journalists who enabled that culture of lying. This left the Republican establishment helpless in the fact of someone who lied as much in a day as they did in a week, because they couldn't credibly make the case that policy dishonesty was disqualifying.

Yeah, I can imagine. Nobody ever wants to answer this probably. To try this, you've got to have an optimism bias. And I do. I know that. It's an optimism bias that keeps me working 14 hours a day. It's an optimism bias that pulls you in more and more people to try to talk about it.
CLINTON: And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that. Now, why does that matter? Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position. I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it.
I went to Washington. I came here to New York to talk to people about the idea for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and I heard two things over and over and over. Part one, that's a great idea. It would actually make a real difference. That would be structural change, or as I now say, big structural change, in financial services. And part two, don't even try, because you'll be up against the big banks. You'll be up against Wall Street. You'll be up against all of the Republicans. You'll be up against half the Democrats. You'll never get it done. But we did get it done.
Sensing opportunity, Mr. Trump has sought to portray himself as a wartime leader in daily televised news briefings. It has given him a bump in the polls, with his approval ratings creeping up toward 50 percent as independents and some Democrats rally behind him, while Mr. Biden, the likely Democratic nominee, is largely drowned out by the president and even Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York.
— Republicans in the state legislature have already learned a lesson from the years prior, that it's more important to wield power than it is to be seen as a political compromiser.
MG: Your standing in some of the polls in the swing states is not as competitive as some of the other candidates'. Do you think that this issue is hurting you in the swing states like Michigan? If not, what do you make of the discrepancy in swing states?
But Mulvaney has set out to dismantle the C.F.P.B. He has, as The Times reports: frozen all new investigations and slowed down existing inquiries by requiring employees to produce detailed justifications and scaled back efforts to go after payday lenders, auto lenders and other financial services companies accused of preying on the vulnerable.
MC: O.K., so we mark that one off, so we don't have to do immigration reform for this to work.
And what was Medicare at this moment when President Johnson signs it into law?
Some health policy experts say that if large numbers of healthy people buy short-term coverage, it could drive up premiums for those who remain in Affordable Care Act plans.
No, It's fine. So I actually start with the big vision. You know, if you gave me a chance, I'd do a constitutional amendment to protect the right of every American citizen to vote and to make sure that vote gets counted so you put real federal muscle behind it. I also talk about that for a specific reason, because a lot of Americans are shocked to know that that's not already in the Constitution and that there is no federal muscle behind that.
As Mr. Brahin goes, so goes the nation.
Over the weekend, Lindsey Graham spoke at the annual gathering of the Conservative Political Action Conference, where he once again praised President Trump and boasted about their close relationship.
But Republicans can't admit that this is their goal. The public overwhelmingly supports protection for Americans with pre-existing conditions, so right-wing politicians have to pretend they can provide that while dismantling the regulations and subsidies such protection requires. And they have to hope that voters won't remember that they have been promising a plan, but never delivering, for more than a decade.
There is no guarantee that the lawsuit will turn out the way the Trump administration wants, of course. And any final answer is probably a long way away, since the case is likely to be appealed once it is decided. A group of Republican states that brought the lawsuit initially argued that the entirety of Obamacare should be invalidated. A decision for those litigants would mean changes not just to the individual market but to Medicare, Medicaid and a broad array of other health programs.
But as he signed the orders in the Oval Office, Biden acknowledged that they did not represent the sorts of bold steps forward that he had taken on climate the day before. The best way to describe them: to undo the damage Trump has done, he said. There's nothing new that we're doing here, other than restoring the Affordable Care Act and restoring the Medicaid to the way it was.
I think it includes anti-competitiveness and unfair trade practices. I think we need to resuscitate the old tying concept that we use.
It's odd, in a way. After all, trade is clearly an issue about which Trump is truly passionate. He tried to kill Obamacare, but to all appearances his main concern was tarnishing his predecessor's legacy. He wanted a tax cut, but more to score a win than because he cared about what was in it. But reducing the trade deficit has been a long-term Trump obsession, so you might expect him to learn something about how world trade works, or at least surround himself with people who do understand the subject.
MC: I think we can agree that there are huge problems here. But to Katie's point, and then I'm going to throw it to Jesse. You have to be careful to balance the big promises with the over-promising, because then you risk the disillusionment, which I think we saw during the Obama administration. And back to kind of Katie's question about how you pay for a lot of these things. I mean comprehensive immigration for one, you can't do that through budget reconciliation.
While President Trump promised insurance for everybody, the C.B.O. projects that if the Republican plan took effect today, 14 million more people would be uninsured next year, and by 2026, the number of uninsured would be about double what it is today.
In conversations with some unions, Senator Warren has dodged the question of how she would protect existing coverage. At a recent town hall with the Culinary Workers Union, for example, she said their health care is not supposed to change but sidestepped details.
The A.C.A. brought the country's uninsured rate down to record lows several years after it was enacted in 2010, but even before the pandemic some 28 million people had no coverage. Still, an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 27 million Americans could have lost job-based health coverage between March and May, and that a vast majority of them — 79 percent — are eligible for new coverage from Medicaid or subsidized private plans.
Acting Capitol Police chief calls for permanent fencing and backup forces in wake of assault. Capitol Police officers standing by the Capitol's rotunda on Monday. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times The acting chief of the Capitol Police has called for vast improvements to security on the Capitol grounds, including permanent fencing and the availability of ready, backup forces, a sign of lasting changes in Washington in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol siege. Yogananda D. Pittman, who became acting chief on Jan. 8 after her predecessor resigned, had directed her staff to assess the Capitol complex's security upon assuming the post. She noted that security experts had argued for greater security measures for the Capitol even before the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. Additionally, a security assessment in 2006 recommended a permanent fence. In light of recent events, I can unequivocally say that vast improvements to the physical security infrastructure must be made to include permanent fencing, and the availability of ready, backup forces in close proximity to the Capitol, she said in a statement. Ms. Pittman's announcement came a day after the Department of Homeland Security issued a rare warning saying that the United States faced a growing threat from violent domestic extremists who might have been emboldened by the Jan. 6 assault. The deadly Capitol assault has prompted new scrutiny of the Capitol Police and other government agencies. Separate reviews are also being conducted by the Capitol Police inspector general and Russel L. Honoré, a retired Army lieutenant general.
We just undercut ourselves when we do that.
Basically, we need to give up on the for-profit insurers. There is no place, except among a niche, to have our entire system held hostage by this parasitic middleman.
SALT LAKE CITY — From the moment the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, most elected officials in this sturdily Republican state have been eager to squash it.
We have to get to business, Mr. Trump told The New York Times in a telephone interview. Obamacare has been a catastrophic event.
The so-called special enrollment period is intended to help people who have lost coverage in the past year, but it will be open to those who want health insurance for any reason, in the 36 states that use Healthcare.gov. The decision was reported earlier by The Washington Post.
So just make the brief case for us about why you think it's important for us to start using they on an everyday basis more often and he or she less often.

The long sweep of American history is filled with presidential elections that took place during times of war and upheaval, but there is little modern precedent for a campaign unfolding against a backdrop of such widespread national fear.
It was the right bill then, he said. Unlike voting to give exemptions to the gun manufacturers, never a right vote under any circumstances. Being against the Brady bill was never right under any circumstances. It was right at the time.
And what explains that? What's happening in Wisconsin?
Slightly, slightly is not the right word — extremely passive-aggressive yet effective and terrifying figure.
The presidential election will give us a chance to end bullying of many different varieties. If Senator Elizabeth Warren winds up not becoming the nominee, it is possible that one reason for this was voter uncertainty about her Medicare for all proposal. Apparently whenever Americans consider this idea, we are thrown into a panic by the possibility that we will lose our health care insurance, and that it will be replaced by some governmental entity.
What no one knew is that the inevitable fight would center on a struggling brick-and-mortar video game retailer called GameStop. With two hedge funds betting that GameStop's value would fall, a swarm of Reddit users this week led a successful campaign to send the stock price surging instead. The internet-based caper raised GameStop's market value to over $24 billion from $2 billion, and caused billions in losses at the hedge funds.
Numerous other health care provider and consumer groups, including the American Diabetes Association, Families USA and the New Hampshire Nurses Association, wrote a joint letter to the administration last month asking it to establish a special enrollment period. The groups argued that forcing people to verify eligibility would not only delay care receipt, it would deter enrollment by healthy customers, endangering the individual-market risk pool, the grouping of customers that determines what the insurers charge for a policy.
Hong Kong on Wednesday lifted a lockdown on a cluster of buildings after 11 hours, part of a new campaign to impose targeted restrictions on neighborhoods with coronavirus outbreaks. The lockdown in the densely populated, working-class Yau Ma Tei neighborhood is the second that the government has imposed during the pandemic. The first came into effect on Saturday amid concerns that the virus was spreading rapidly in tenement apartments. It was lifted about 48 hours later, after officials found 13 new infections among the roughly 7,000 residents they had tested. The Chinese territory's leader, Carrie Lam, called the operation a success and promised ambush-style lockdowns in the future. Officials said on Wednesday that they had discovered one infection during the second lockdown, out of about 300 residents tested.
Why is defending the Affordable Care Act in the Supreme Court hard? That's what lawyers are for, sure. That's a legal issue, and they've got a whole bunch of lawyers in the federal government.
KK: Well, it has to come to the Senate floor. I mean, Mitch McConnell already has an anti-corruption, election reform bill [passed by the House].
I'll defend the Affordable Care Act from the sabotage of the Trump administration. That I can do all by myself.
It is. And at one point, I just sort of blurted out, do you trust him? Meaning the president. And it took him a while to answer. He seemed taken aback by that. And what he said was, I trust him to want to be successful — which is kind of a non-answer. I mean, what president doesn't want to be successful, right? I mean, I think if I were to ask him, do you trust John McCain, he would say, I trust John McCain to love America and to always do what is right for America and to always work for a cause greater than himself. I remember asking him at one point, do you think Donald Trump believes in a cause greater than himself? And he said something to the effect that, well, Donald Trump's a showman. He's a larger-than-life figure. He wants to be successful. Look, there are a lot of people who say, Lindsey, you know better. How can you live with yourself? What are you doing? And he couches it in the virtue of, look, I believe very strongly in certain things around Syria, around Afghanistan, around judges.
Towards a policy direction that would make it more reasonable for Republicans to say they are actually a working person's party, or as you'll hear in this, appearance party. One of those Republicans is Ramesh Ponnuru. Ramesh is senior editor at The National Review. He's a columnist at Bloomberg View, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Somebody I don't always agree with, but I always try and read and listen to. As always, my email is ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. Here's, Ramesh. So let me start here. If Republicans had passed another big COVID stimulus, prior to November, maybe one as Donald Trump wanted with $2,000 checks, do you think Trump wins a second term and Republicans keep the Senate?
On Tuesday, the Senate confirmed Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., as transportation secretary for the Biden administration. Credit Credit... Pool photo by Stefani Reynolds The Senate on Tuesday confirmed Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind., and a 2020 Democratic presidential candidate, to be transportation secretary, putting in place a key emissary to President Biden as his administration seeks an ambitious overhaul of the nation's infrastructure. The confirmation, by a vote of 86 to 13, makes Mr. Buttigieg, 39, the first openly gay cabinet secretary to be confirmed by the Senate, as well as Mr. Biden's youngest cabinet member. Mr. Buttigieg's bipartisan confirmation underscored the support he has received from lawmakers in both parties as he charted a vision for infrastructure reform that aligned with Mr. Biden's goals on climate change, racial justice, job creation and economic recovery. As transportation secretary, Mr. Buttigieg will oversee an agency that employs 55,000 people and controls around $87 billion in funding at a time when the country's public transit systems are reeling from the pandemic. He is expected to play a key role in shepherding efforts by the Biden administration to push a $2 trillion infrastructure plan through Congress. At his confirmation hearing last month, Mr. Buttigieg spoke of a generational opportunity to transform infrastructure. He pledged to work with state, local and tribal leaders on transportation concerns, while trying to mitigate the effect that transportation policies have historically had on poor and minority communities.
These are the fights we need to have. These are the fights we should be bringing forward. We don't bring those fights forward. We — oh, well, we could — around the edge a little bit. Then we're just going to be the ones who stood by while America became fundamentally a country that lost even a hope that all the kids would have opportunity. That we just extinguish that and say, Nope. Better be born into it, because that's the only way to make it in America. That's not the America I want to see.
I think you're overlooking the places where we're not divided. I have three brothers back in Oklahoma. One is a Democrat. Do the math, the other two are not. And yet, all three of my brothers and tens of millions of people around this country get furious over the fact that Amazon reports $11 billion in profits last year and paid zero in taxes. All three of my brothers understand that we have an America that works great for giant drug companies, just not for people trying to fill a prescription. Works great for oil companies that want to drill everywhere, just not for people who are worried about climate change.
While in West Virginia later on Monday, addressing the National Scout Jamboree, Mr. Trump teased the health and human services secretary, Tom Price, about whether he would be able to wrangle support from Ms. Capito and other Republicans. He better get them, Mr. Trump said, smiling at Mr. Price to indicate he was joking — or at least seemed to be. Otherwise, I'll say, 'Tom, you're fired.'
The Supreme Court needs to be an institution that helps to undergird limited constitutional government, said Mr. Leo, 51, whose cerebral, unassuming demeanor belies the enormous clout he has developed in Washington.
And at times, the tweaks and fixes seem to be at war with one another. Those same short-term plans are likely to pull healthy people out of the exchanges, further destabilizing the markets and creating pressure to prop them up with subsidies and stabilization funds, which cost the government money.

In some sense, McCain's biography — and the overheated rhetoric it encouraged in discussions of his political persona — deprived him of agency. He often seemed to be playing a role created for him by others. Even his work on campaign finance reform with Russ Feingold seemed to lack a guiding principle. It was more a form of penance for his implication in the pay-to-play Keating Five scandal. He became a symbol when what Arizona needed was a legislator.

JI: Let me try to frame it a different way. What do you say to critics who would argue that it will take so much political capital just to enact the first portion of this plan, the aggressive public option that you've laid out, that it would be essentially impossible to then segue to a Medicare for all? You'll spend so much capital getting that first part that it seems — people have said it seems like a pipe dream to say we're going to have this aggressive public option, and then we're going to have Medicare for all three years later.
KK: We have time for, I think, one or two more questions.
And then there's labor policy, where the Trump administration has moved on multiple fronts to do away with regulations that had protected workers from exploitation, injury and more.
The American Rescue Plan is only a start. Because the administration was limited by the budget reconciliation process, many of its provisions need to be made permanent. Which is to say that there is still a lot of work left for the Biden administration and the Democratic majorities that exist, for now, in Congress, much of it tied to whether the Senate will reform itself to allow majority rule.
The analysis, by GoodRx, a company that tracks prescription drug prices, looked at how often residents of different neighborhoods filled prescriptions for different categories of drugs.

Well, you have seen some social conservative support for Romney's idea. I'd say some social conservatives who write for First Things or National Review have been pretty positive about it. Actually it's been uniting folks from The Dispatch, as well as from First Things, people who have not always been getting along much in recent years. You haven't had a ton of criticism. What I would say actually, the shoe that hasn't dropped, you haven't had a lot of conservatives on the economic side attacking the idea as a tax increase designed to fuel a spending increase. Because it would seem to me that the Romney plan is a straightforward violation of Grover Norquist's pledge for Republicans not to raise taxes, because that pledge says, you can't get rid of a tax deduction without making up for it with a tax cut somewhere else. And that's exactly what Romney does — he gets rid of the state and local deduction, which is a pretty significant tax increase and he doesn't use it to finance a tax cut. He uses that to finance this child allowance, which is to a certain degree, just spending. And I've been surprised. Maybe I missed it but I kept expecting The Wall Street Journal to run a bitter attack on it because they've been, for 30 years, bitter enemies of the child tax credit. Getting back to the question of this trade off, or this conflict among conservatives.
But it seems like your case is not only about people who don't consider themselves gender binary. It's also for someone who says, I am a woman, or I am a man. You don't think it's necessary to have that part of their identity be front and center in a conversation constantly. Right?
At a time of pandemic and economic disaster for so many Americans, especially and ironically in states where President Trump has many followers, what does he decide to do? Imperil health care for as many as 23 million of his countrymen. This deplorable timing further convinces me that Mr. Trump is, to use a term coined by James Cowles Prichard in the 1830s, morally insane.
But from there, he jumped immediately to how John McCain made him feel, which was relevant.
The crowd was relatively tame as it stood and listened to Mr. Gaetz criticize Ms. Cheney's mean girl-style politics, and erupted in cheers as the congressman described how he had recently spoken to Mr. Trump. President Trump is going to keep fighting for this country with each breath that he has, Mr. Gaetz said. He then played a recording of Donald Trump Jr. from his phone, who told the crowd, It's time to have change at the top. Ms. Cheney already has one opponent in the state legislature, Anthony Bouchard, who says he will run against her in the 2022 primary. The signs calling for her impeachment on Thursday were paid for by Mr. Bouchard's campaign.
They appeared to have majority support in the Senate, and they had presidents of both parties ready to sign them. They also had massive public support. When Gallup polled federal anti-lynching laws in 1937, they found support at 72 percent, including a majority support in the South. Anti-poll tax laws also had upwards of 60 percent support. The country was ready for these civil rights laws, but because of the supermajority threshold, they didn't pass in the Senate. On the other hand, every other piece of legislation, all of the things that we passed to build post-war America, came and cleared because they had to pass only a majority threshold. They maybe every once in a while encountered a filibuster, but it was quickly resolved and they passed in a timely fashion. What we've done now is we've taken the process that we applied to civil rights during the Jim Crow era and started applying it to every other issue. And so the reason that there is gridlock on every issue you can possibly think of is that the solutions exist, but they have to clear a supermajority threshold. And so just like civil rights took 87 years to pass when the solutions existed, the country was ready for it, public support was there, that's why we're seeing climate change, income inequality, immigration, gun control, you name it, finding it impossible to clear this threshold. It's an impossible threshold to clear.
WASHINGTON — The House is expected to give final approval on Friday to a measure that would allow Republicans to speedily gut the Affordable Care Act with no threat of a Senate filibuster, a move that would thrust the question of what health law would come next front and center even before President-elect Donald J. Trump takes office.
The health law included a permanent legal authorization for the Indian Health Service, which runs hospitals, employs physicians and provides health services to more than two million Native Americans. Repealing the law would invalidate the legal basis for that program.

While more than a half-dozen other Ohio Republicans are weighing Senate bids, none has the national profile of Representative Jim Jordan. Credit... Anna Moneymaker for The New York Times Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, who was former President Donald J. Trump's foremost defender in his House impeachment proceedings, has decided not to run for an open seat being vacated by the retirement of a fellow Republican, Senator Rob Portman, in 2022, an aide said Thursday. Mr. Jordan believes that at this time he is better suited to represent Ohioans in the House of Representatives, where, as the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, he can advance an America first agenda, promote conservative values and hold big government accountable, Russell Dye, a spokesman for Mr. Jordan's congressional campaign, said. Mr. Jordan's high-profile defense of Mr. Trump made him widely considered to be the Republican with the best chance to win Ohio's 2022 Senate primary. While more than a half-dozen other Ohio Republicans are weighing Senate bids to replace Mr. Portman, none has the national profile or Trump bona fides of Mr. Jordan, who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom five days after the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol. Mr. Jordan has long had ambitions to lead House Republicans and has hoped to become speaker if his party takes a majority in the chamber following the 2022 elections.

The closest comparison may be the New York mayoral race in 2001, when the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks loomed over the city's general election. In presidential politics, the Vietnam War, assassinations and civil rights struggles shaped the 1968 campaign and seemed to reveal a country coming apart.

Health care was a key factor in Democrats' victory in the 2018 midterm elections, and it should be a big plus in 2020 as well. The shared Democratic position — that every legal resident should have access to affordable care, regardless of income or health status — is immensely popular. The de facto Republican position — that we should go back to a situation in which those whose jobs don't come with health benefits, or who suffer from pre-existing medical conditions, can't get insurance — is so unpopular that G.O.P. candidates consistently lie about their own proposals.
Mr. Azar described Idaho's plan as a cry for help by a state seeking more affordable coverage options for its residents. He said the Idaho program would be subject to searching review for compliance with federal law.
We're going to have that party who lost a bunch of seats on that in 2018 versus a party that we argue with each other about the best way to try to make sure that people get health care coverage, but at least we're trying to move in that direction. And this is a salient, personal, human fact. Your health care, your housing, getting your kids educated, getting your kids taken care of in child care. Every single one of those, I like where we are. I like where I am in this fight because I think it's the right fight to have and I think we must be in this fight. We cannot take a pass on this.
Right. So I've identified pay-fors, and I lay out that if you want, you can get into it, and you've got a three-year period to be able to do it at a deeply subsidized price or at no price at all.
There we go. But the point is there are some things about tech that are special. I mean, that we're seeing for the first time. Ways that you can be anti-competitive that we hadn't seen before, just like that was true in the early 1900s about, you know — you had the oil supply, and you also owned all the gas stations and how that one worked. We broke that apart.

Not vision in a — I'm not really a big, you know, talk about this in soaring terms. But in real terms, a 2-cent wealth tax.
The notice to the court, filed late Monday by the Justice Department, could not have come at a more opportune time for Democrats. The finding by Robert S.

Trump support is growing among Pennsylvania's Republicans, and they want him to know it. Representative Scott Perry, Republican of Pennsylvania, was instrumental in promoting a plan in which President Donald J. Trump would fire the acting attorney general in an effort to stay in office. Credit... Al Drago for The New York Times Republicans in states across the country are lining up behind former President Donald J. Trump with unwavering support. And perhaps no state has demonstrated its fealty as tenaciously as Pennsylvania, where Republican officials have made loyalty to him the sole organizing principle of the party. Just as in some Midwestern states, a surge in Pennsylvania of new Republican voters with grievances about a changing America was triggered by Mr. Trump, and only Mr. Trump. And as a second impeachment trial approaches next month, many of the former president's defenders see it as the culmination of years of unfair treatment by a Washington establishment that was always hostile to him. Pennsylvania Republicans are already jockeying ahead of the 2022 primaries to prove that they fought the hardest for Mr. Trump, who, in spite of the losses by his party in the White House, the Senate and the House, still exerts a strong grip over elected Republicans and grass-roots voters. Eight of the nine Republicans in Pennsylvania's congressional delegation voted to throw out their state's own electoral votes for President Biden on Jan. 6, just hours after a mob stormed the Capitol.
Actually, I don't think of what I say that way. What I think of is the leadership possibilities that the candidates for president are offering.

Whether we're talking about workers or we're talking about the environment, who has to meet what standards? And there are big corporations who figured out how to game the system. Where standards are high, then move that part of the operation somewhere else where standards are low and save a nickel. Because these corporations, they don't have any loyalty to a country, they just have loyalty to their own bottom line. And they play this all around the world.
Ms. Warren was likely referring to reporting by Sarah Kliff in The Times in November chronicling a rise in hospitals' suing patients over overdue bills.
The insurance exchanges were expected to be a major supplement to that system for people who do not have access to employer plans or government programs. But enrollment in the exchanges — 11 million at the end of March — is far below expectations, and insurers say it must increase to produce a better, more sustainable mix of healthy and less healthy consumers.
And I think right now, the push should be not to expand because that's the issue that's on the table.
But I get it. There are right now, Democrats against Democrats on this. But understand this, we'll get into a general election. Oh, I know what the insurance industry will want to do. I know what Donald Trump will want to do. But the truth is we're going to have the party who tried to take away health care from 35 million Americans, said it was O.K. to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions and is continuing to follow that right now, both in their lawsuits and in their agency practices, and millions of people have lost their health care.

Something that you write about in the book that I thought was such a smart point is that in this era, a very effective move is taking something like, say, the anti-lynching bill that has 70 plus percent support, and saying the issue here is not lynching and what you think of lynching. The issue here is my right to be heard. It's a right to unlimited debate. It's the deliberation that makes our country great. And I think you see this still in all kinds of issues, where people say they don't want to debate the issue. They want debate free speech, right?

For Mr. Trump, anyone who stands between him and his objective becomes collateral damage. And pity those considered part of an unfriendly demographic, such as the people of Puerto Rico, whom the president dismisses as a tool of the Democratic Party and mistreats accordingly . As the Senate has worked this week to hash out a comprehensive disaster-relief package, Mr. Trump's contribution has been to fire off a series of obnoxious, dishonest tweets charging that  corrupt or incompetent  island officials have wasted epic levels of relief funding and are now hot for Democrats to give them more, taking dollars away from our Farmers and so many others. Disgraceful! A White House spokesman, Hogan Gidley, subsequently appeared on TV with a spirited defense of his boss's broadside against that country.
I'm sort of interested that both of you seem to think that both the health care case and the racist tweets are basically bad for Trump from a political perspective.
I mean, I actually thought that it shows the limits of Trumpification and the fact that the Republican approach to Trump's racist provocation is a kind of denial rather than a kind of wholesale adoption. I mean, I think there is a part of the Republican Party and the conservative coalition that's fully on board with the way that Trump talked about the four congressmen and the way he talks in general. But what you get from elected officials is the kind of weak condemnation of what Trump says joined to a pivot to let's talk about something else, like how bad the liberals are. Which tells you something important, right? I think it tells you that a lot of G.O.P. elected officials still have this sense that the bigoted strain in Trumpism can just sort of go away when Trump does. You would have Trumpification if Mitt Romney came out and said, Trump's absolutely right. They should go back to their home countries. Right? I mean that would be Trumpification.
The Affordable Care Act continued to grow in popularity after Republican efforts to repeal the legislation in 2017 — a recent poll found that over half of the public favors the legislation.
Part of Mr. McCain's legacy, which is yet to be fully understood, should serve as a warning to us. We can honor John McCain the man while having reservations about his political career. Among the things for which he will be remembered are his service to the country in the United States Navy, his advocacy for a strong military, his opposition to torture, the Keating Five scandal, two unsuccessful presidential runs, his yearslong feud with conservatives in his own party and the vote that killed Obamacare reform. It's a mixed bag. So let's honor the good and noble in Mr. McCain's life while not being afraid to be point out — and even carry on — legitimate political disagreements.
Since Arkansas reimposed the work requirement last year, its food stamp rolls have lost about 36,000 people, according to the State Department of Human Services. Mr. Hutchinson said the drop was partly explained because people had found jobs, but advocates for the poor said many appeared to have been cut off.
Sui-Lee Wee and Donald McNeil gave us the breaking news that researchers in China have identified a new virus that is behind a mysterious pneumonialike illness that has caused a panic in the central Chinese region. 'There's no evidence that the virus, a coronavirus, is readily spread by humans, and it has not been tied to any deaths,' they write. 'But health officials in China and internationally are watching it carefully, as it comes from the same region where the deadly SARS epidemic broke out in the early 2000s.'
He appears to have warmer feelings for Kim Jong-un, the thug who starves his own people — We fell in love, Trump once said of North Korea's dictator — than for a majority of citizens under his rule on the West Coast. He has higher praise for a traitor and slaveholder, Robert E. Lee — a great general — than for the states working under a hostile administration without seceding from the union.
NATO members agreed, in 2014, to a goal of spending 2 percent of their G.D.P. on defense, but in 2017 the only countries to meet that goal were America, Britain, Greece, Poland and Estonia. Mr. Trump chastised fellow member states at a 2017 summit, declaring that 23 of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should.
It does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their health care costs, the four wrote in a joint statement.
Because it is a flat benefit, the idea at least is that you don't have the situation which you can sometimes have with government benefit programs, where if you earn more income or if your household earns more income, you lose benefits and so you're being punished for moving up the ladder. And then one of the things that particularly conservatives, although not only conservatives have been talking about for the last few years is that America's birth rate has gotten lower. And that there's long been a gap between the number of kids that Americans say they want to have and the number of kids that they actually end up having and to the extent that economic constraints are a reason for that. Maybe something should be done to enable people to hit their family related goals? So these are some of the reasons why people are in favor of this idea, but there's also some opposition. And a lot of the opposition is along the lines of what Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Mike Lee have said, although they themselves have been advocates of an expanded child credit and taken some flak from their own right on that, they think that the Romney proposal is a bridge too far. That it's a resurrection of the old welfare system, where you're handing out money to parents and not requiring work. I'd say that this is a debate that's still percolating on the right.
But what's even worse, if you ask me, is hearing Republicans complain that food stamps and unemployment benefits reduce the incentive to seek work. There was never serious evidence for this claim, but right now — at a time when workers can't work, because doing their normal jobs would kill lots of people — I find it hard to understand how anyone can make this argument without gagging.
I think we need to get our combat troops out. I don't think that combat is advancing the interests of the United States in the Middle East, and it's time to end combat operations. Of course we'll have a continuing presence in the Middle East. We have interests in the Middle East with our allies. We have interests in the Middle East and keeping shipping lanes open, and we will continue to have a presence there, but I don't think combat troops are how we best advance that presence.
These programs tend to be more technocratic and complex than direct government programs. As a result, they also tend to be less popular with voters. Medicare is more popular than the Obamacare insurance exchanges. The basic idea of a Green New Deal — subsidizing clean energy — is more popular than a carbon tax. A higher minimum wage is more popular than an intricate series of tax credits for job retraining.
Tying is an arrangement where to buy one product, a consumer also has to buy a different product from a separate market. An example the F.T.C. offers is a drugmaker that required all consumers buying its medicine for schizophrenia to also buy its blood-monitoring service. The Supreme Court has treated the practice as illegal in the past, but more recently lower courts have permitted it under the more flexible rule of reason.
Five. Five percent. We are widening racial wealth gaps in this country right now. Opportunity is shrinking for our children, and people see this. It's 12 years later. It's 20 years later from a whole set of promises that this was going to get better, and it hasn't gotten better, but people watch at the same moment. They don't look around and see a country that's getting poor. Look out your window, right? They don't look around and say, God, America's really on a downslide. They look out and they say, America is doing great. G.D.P. keeps going up. The stock market keeps going up, unemployment is down, but my family is stretched to the breaking point. My debt load is bigger than ever, and I look over the edge and see where my children are headed. I don't even see my children able to replicate what I have. I don't see them able to buy my house. I don't see them having even the job stability I had. I see them carrying more debt at 19 than I carried at 35.
Kathleen Kingsbury: So we don't have very much time together. We all know your résumé and your bio, and many of us have met you in the past, so you don't mind if we just jump right into questions?
And one problem with that is that it pushes Congresses towards just doing these weird budget reconciliation bills because they can get them done, even with a narrow majority, and away from trying to figure out how to actually do things about these other issues that people really want to see change and experimentation on. So I always think that social conservatives should be much more upset about the filibuster than they are because their issues are consistently down-weighted because they can't clear a filibuster from Democrats in the Senate. And so instead, it's like the Club For Growth side of the party that gets tried out because at least I can go through budget reconciliation. On the Democratic side, you could potentially do things like $1,400 checks, a big expansion of the child tax credits — all really, really important — but you can't do democracy reform. There's a lot of things on green energy you can't do. And so there is also this warping away from experimentation but also away from whole issue areas that probably, at this point, really, really need to be pushed out of the realm of symbolic argumentation and into the realm of, well, do you actually have an idea, Josh Hawley and the Republican Party, about how you want to regulate tech companies? Do you actually want to get rid of Section 230? Do you want to do any of these things? Do you want to change something about moral regulations in this country?
Former vice president Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Kamala Harris of California spoke the most during Thursday night's Democratic presidential debate. It was the second debate of the week after 10 other candidates opened the 2020 campaign on Wednesday.
Actually, I've done 175 stump speeches and I've talked about it in every one of them. You all haven't covered it. I talk about three things that I think we need to do ——
Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the senior Democrat on the Finance Committee, said the Trump administration was promoting junk insurance. The House Democratic leader, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, said people buying these plans could be one diagnosis away from disaster, discovering they have been paying for coverage that may not cover basic care such as cancer treatment.
Wisconsin was a united Republican government under Scott Walker —
All these struggles have led activists to have second thoughts about carbon pricing. John Podesta, who helped direct climate policy in the Obama administration, told me that a new political strategy was necessary. The Green New Deal — a progressive wish list on the issue — includes neither a carbon tax nor a cap-and-trade system. Foreign Affairs recently ran an article with the headline Why Carbon Pricing Isn't Working, by Jeffrey Ball, a former energy reporter at The Wall Street Journal. Christiana Figueres, a Costa Rican who spent six years as the top United Nations climate official, told me: An economist would probably argue that the most efficient way to reduce greenhouse gases is to put a price on carbon. But efficient is not always what can be attained from a political perspective. I would rather move now on what we can do than wait for economists' perfection.
We had a fire, and the fire there was millions of people who lost their homes, but the fire by itself doesn't get it done. The fire by itself wasn't enough. You had to be ready with the big structural change and had to have somebody from the inside who would fight for it.
James Dao: Moving from Europe to Asia, if China were to send troops, massive numbers of troops into Hong Kong, and impose a violent crackdown there similar to Tiananmen Square in 1989, what would you do as president?
Times reporting from Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley found that Senator Warren's wealth tax plan has broad support, including from 77 percent of Democrats and 57 percent of Republicans, with the exception of one demographic: Republican men with college degrees.
There is no doubt that improvements are needed. Deductibles and premiums are too high for many people, and too many young people are forgoing insurance altogether. More generous subsidies for people with modest incomes could bring the cost of health care down at a relatively small expense to the government.
Over all, around 20 million Americans who wouldn't have had health insurance without the A.C.A. now do.

Judge Elrod also asked how the federal government would respond if a stay issued by the lower court after Judge O'Connor's decision was lifted and its order striking down the law took effect.
Yeah, and I think that gets to the fundamental unsustainability of the Manchin, Sinema position. It would be one thing if by standing in defense of the filibuster, that they could leverage a big bipartisan deal that would be an alternative approach to going it alone with the Democrats and passing things on a 50-vote threshold. But as we're seeing on COVID aid, the idea that 10 Republicans are going to give Democrats their votes for just about anything is laughable. They're not giving them 10 votes for COVID aid, and I don't think they'll give them their votes for anything else. And so, Manchin and Sinema are quickly faced with a much more binary choice, which is, do you get anything done at all, or do you not get anything done? And if you care at all about the success of the Biden administration and the success of all the Democrats who are up on the ballot in 2022, when you're faced with a choice between delivering results and failing because you care more about the filibuster than about getting things done, I ultimately think they will come around. But they are, as you say, they're endorsing the premise on principle of passing big things, multitrillion dollar packages, on a majority vote basis. And so once you start to go down that road, unless there is some massive outbreak of bipartisanship, which I think is vanishingly unlikely, then I think that that's the choice they're going to face.
ICE just endorsed me. No, it didn't. Border patrol agents' union did. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
Instead, they're talking about freedom — which these days is the real refuge of scoundrels.
KK: Well, so you're going to kill the filibuster?
That health care would play such a prominent role in the Democratic primary race is hardly surprising, given its role in last year's midterm election. Exit polls found that health care was the top issue for voters, and even the Republican leadership in the House has seemingly blamed midterm losses on the issue.
There is also no mention of a national ban on fracking, which Mr. Biden has avoided calling for, despite pressure from young climate activists. But there are other signs that progressives on the task force were able to push Mr. Biden to the left.
A recent op-ed in The Times argued that Carrie Lam's decision to characterize the Hong Kong protests as a riot echoed a moment in 1989 when The People's Daily, the newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, referred to a gathering of students in Tiananmen Square as turmoil. Protesters in Hong Kong demanded that the term riot be retracted.
O.K.? And I have seen the billionaire go on TV and cry about it.
One House member from the state, Scott Perry, was instrumental in promoting a plan in which Mr. Trump would fire the acting attorney general in an effort to stay in office. And a majority of Republicans in the General Assembly urged its congressional delegation in December to reject the commonwealth's 20 electoral votes for Mr. Biden after the results were legally certified. Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania have also plunged into a lengthy examination of the November election, even though no evidence of more than trivial fraud has surfaced, and courts rejected claims that election officials had overstepped their legal mandates.
In 1959, the Republican National Committee held an internal debate over whether the party should be driven by a distinct set of ideological values. At the inaugural meeting of the Committee on Program and Progress, which was tasked with designing the GOP agenda, the group invited the political scientist Robert Goldwin to make the case that it is neither possible nor desirable for a major political party to be guided by principles. Our modern cleavages give Goldwin's concerns a force that they would not have carried in 1959. With both parties including liberals and conservatives within their ranks, he said, those differences which would otherwise be the main campaign issues are settled by compromise within each party. He warned that our national unity would be weakened if the theoretical differences were sharpened.
You can take it through a constitutional amendment if you think it needs a constitutional amendment.
In seeking higher rates for 2019, insurers point to several developments. Mr. Trump cut off subsidies that insurers use to reduce out-of-pocket medical costs for low-income people. And Congress, with encouragement from Mr. Trump, eliminated tax penalties for people who go without insurance, starting next year, giving healthier people less incentive to obtain coverage.
And because of that, there are a bunch of proposals over the years to try to reconsider a more national health care system.
Even though the Justice Department is not defending crucial provisions of the law, California and 15 other states have intervened in the court proceeding, and they filed a brief on Thursday defending the law, including its consumer protections.
The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, provided for the sale of subsidized, private health insurance plans through federal and state marketplaces for people without job-based insurance. The 2010 law also expanded eligibility for Medicaid in many states. The law protects people with pre-existing conditions from being excluded from coverage, and requires health plans to provide certain essential coverage like preventive care.
Todos los presidentes cambian de rumbo al llegar al cargo, especialmente cuando suceden a alguien de otro partido. Pero nunca se había visto a un presidente tan empeñado no solo en conducir al país en una dirección diferente sino en desmantelar activamente lo que se había establecido antes de su llegada. Ya sea por encono personal, por cálculo político, por desacuerdos ideológicos o por estar convencido de que el presidente anterior dañó al país, Trump ha dejado en claro que si algo lleva la marca de Obama, él no tardará en borrarlo del disco duro nacional.
Well, actually, you're going to have to explain to me what Andrew was — if I'm going to have to argue back against Andrew, you're going to have to tell me exactly what Andrew's argument is.
And my sense is that under normal circumstances, the White House almost reflexively defends laws put on the books by Congress.
Peter Thiel, an early Facebook investor, called Senator Warren dangerous, to which Senator Warren responded good. Mr. Zuckerberg said a Warren presidency would suck for the company, according to audio leaked and reported in The Verge.
We know that slaveholders in the American South used Scripture to justify keeping their fellow humans in bondage. They could find no words from Christ on this, for there are no words from him. Just a line in the New Testament from mere mortals presuming to speak for him.
In this, if in little else, Nixon was joined by Robert F. Kennedy. The journalist Godfrey Hodgson recounts a conversation where Kennedy warned that the country was already split vertically, between sections, races, and ethnic groups, so it would be dangerous to split it horizontally, too, between liberals and conservatives. Politics, in this telling, was meant to calm our divisions, not represent them.
Because of changes to the minimum benefit packages, some lawmakers raised concerns that insurance would not cover mental health and maternity services in every state. An amendment added $15 billion in additional funding to states was designed to help fill any resulting gaps.
Not everyone shares the goal of expanded health coverage, and some of those newly insured bristle under an individual mandate to have insurance or pay a fine. Still, many of the newly insured could not have afforded insurance before the law passed or would have been shut out because of pre-existing health conditions.
KK: Lauren, I wanted to make sure we got to you.
Ms. Pelosi's is a cautious prescription — one that, in addition to frustrating the less patient elements of her party, clashes with her longstanding image as a crusading San Francisco liberal. This incongruity flows partly from the fact that her caricature was always just that, a partisan construct Republicans used to fire up their base. But it also reflects the political landscape in which the speaker now finds herself the nation's most powerful Democrat.
He's been a champion for our military, our veterans, and a fighter for South Carolina jobs.
MC: O.K., so we mark that one off, so we don't have to do immigration reform for this to work.
But the other half, let's say you have a complaint because the trade agreement had said that some other country would permit unionization or would not use low-wage workers beyond a certain point. Do you get a path like that? A quick resolution? And by the way, I should point out: That quick resolution? There's no appeal from it. It is immediately enforceable against a government. So you can go straight against Canada for raising its environmental standards. You can go straight against a South American country for raising its standards to protect its children's health from smoking.
And I don't think that's the right model.
a growing sense among some policymakers, as well as among many in the pro-immigrant advocacy community, that the entire enforcement apparatus must be unwound. Certainly, enforcement reforms are necessary, as the following sections of this report explain. But the move to reject enforcement entirely — even in theory — only fuels louder calls for maximum enforcement.
It is hard to analyze the skinny repeal proposal, because Republicans have provided few details about it. Presumably, it would still provide government subsidies to lower-income families, as the A.C.A. does. But many middle-class families who do not get coverage through employers would be left bearing the full cost of their now much more expensive policies.
MC: But with particular policies, like not everybody's going to be down with banning fracking altogether, especially in the state of Pennsylvania.
The recipient said she believed she was offered a vaccine because she had donated and volunteered for the hospital. And in Jefferson City, widespread confusion led some Missouri lawmakers to scramble for shots that were not intended for them. Group texts among House members and staff said vaccines were available at an area hotel, but the shots were meant for the state's public safety and transportation employees. Mr. Inslee said during Tuesday's news conference that Washington State's biggest barrier to widespread vaccine distribution was supply. As of Thursday, 6.2 percent of the state's population had received their first dose. Just 1.2 percent had received the full two doses. After hearing of the prioritizing of donors, Mr. Inslee said he believed that the hospital had halted that practice. We have to maintain public credibility in this system, he said.
I'm not going to do this. I'm just not. I'm not here to take on Joe Biden and what Joe Biden has done. I'm glad to talk to you about why I'm running for president, but not to attack him.
That gets to one takeaway from the Trump years: that there's a real constituency for the white welfare state he gestured at during his campaign. It's not a majority, but our election rules (starting with the Electoral College) and the structure of our government (like equal representation of states in the Senate) make it large enough to claim and maintain real political power. And the Trump phenomenon also shows that you don't have to deliver the benefits to hold those voters in your camp. All you have to do is deliver pain to disfavored groups, to target them and make a show of it.
Right. He cited the date 2021. We will do all this right after the election.
No longer will illness crush and destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over a lifetime.
Why is defending the Affordable Care Act in the Supreme Court hard? That's what lawyers are for, sure. That's a legal issue, and they've got a whole bunch of lawyers in the federal government.
Now senators are searching for changes to make the bill more politically palatable. But the notion of making those changes today and then speeding immediately to a vote is madness. There would be no time for experts to consider the consequences — to discover the sort of problems and unintended effects that last-minute changes are bound to create. By the time they did, the Senate would have passed it.
There are places like this — traditionally Democratic, white working-class areas where Mr. Obama still showed important strength — across the Northern United States. In Pennsylvania alone, there are similar regions along the Beaver River — north of Pittsburgh — or in the Scranton-Wilkes Barre area in northeast Pennsylvania. There's Youngstown and Warren, Ohio — or a whole strip of towns along Lake Erie, from Toledo, Ohio, back to Erie, Pa. Many of these same areas broke heavily for Mr. Trump in the Republican primary.
Rules and other guidance released Monday provide some ways out. People who live in a county where only one insurer offers Obamacare-compliant health plans now can get an exemption to the law's individual mandate penalties right away. (They'll go away for everyone next year under legislation passed as part of the tax overhaul.) The administration is allowing older plans that predated Obamacare and that don't follow all its rules to stick around another year. It's also allowing health plans to cover a slightly less robust set of benefits, although those changes are mostly marginal.
In practice, though, with virtually everything a candidate says now recorded for posterity, it has become increasingly difficult to evade past statements.
Mark T. Bertolini, the chief executive of Aetna, said Wednesday that the marketplaces were in a death spiral, and at a conference sponsored by The Wall Street Journal, he declined to say if his company would participate next year. And Molina Healthcare, one of the few insurers that seemed to be financially successful under the health law, reported on Wednesday that it was losing money in the marketplaces. It threatened to drop out if its concerns about a risk-sharing program requiring the company to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to other insurers were not addressed.
KK: Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
The order does not direct the Department of Health and Human Services to ease any particular aspect of the 2010 law, but it could result in a substantial weakening of one of its central features: the so-called individual mandate that requires most Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty.
President Biden's Covid-19 relief proposal remains incredibly popular; if anything, it's getting more popular as it barrels through Congress. Multiple polls show that something like 70 percent of Americans approve of the $1.9 trillion plan. It's almost twice as popular as the Republican tax cut of 2017; it's more popular than the Obama stimulus of 2009; it's hard to believe now, but the Biden plan is more popular than Medicare was in the months before it passed in 1965.
is not rooted in scientific evidence, but the lack of it: Pregnant women have been barred from participating in clinical trials of the vaccines, reflecting a long tradition of excluding pregnant women from biomedical research and one that is now being challenged. While the rationale is ostensibly to protect women and their unborn children, prohibiting pregnant women from studies pushes the risk out of the carefully controlled environment of a clinical trial and into the real world. Vaccines are generally considered to be safe, and pregnant women have been urged to be immunized for influenza and other diseases since the 1960s, even in the absence of rigorous clinical trials to test them. As obstetricians we are often faced with difficult decisions about using interventions in pregnancy that have not been properly tested in pregnancy, said Dr. Denise Jamieson, an obstetrician at Emory University in Atlanta and a member of the Covid expert group at the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. The college strongly advocated including pregnant and breastfeeding women in the vaccine trials. In a statement, the C.D.C. said on Thursday that based on how the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines work, they are unlikely to pose a specific risk for pregnant women. The C.D.C. 's recommendation may make sense for the United States, where women may easily be able to consult with their health care providers, said Joachim Hombach, a health adviser to the W.H.O. on immunizations. But the W.H.O.
In 1977, the House of Representatives and the Senate fought over whether Medicaid should be used to pay for abortions. That led to three separate instances in which the government could not provide funding for the Departments of Labor and Health, Education and Welfare. The shutdowns added up to a total of 28 days that year.
We cannot be silent about another threat to the emotional health of people. In addition to biological factors, psychological and environmental factors contribute to mental illness. The hatred, racism and sexism stoked in this election worsen mental illness and must not be ignored.
KK: Oh my god, we're running out of time. We have a bunch of questions around technology. [LAUGHTER]
Mr. Barr did not favor the move but did not object to the White House decision once it had been made, people familiar with what took place said. And one White House official said the administration faced a deadline imposed by the court if it wanted to support the suit.
Charlie Warzel: Senator, how do you first campaign in and then govern a country as polarized as the one that we're living in right now? Because this doesn't feel like a disagreement on a few policies. This is a situation where the cost of letting the other side wins seems almost too much to bear for the other side. And if you look at impeachment, you see politicians literally inventing alternate realities rather than compromise or disparage a party leader. How do you realistically navigate that and get things done? Because it doesn't feel like a divide that you can heal away.
The high level of medical debt among young adults, Ms. McKernan said, is an argument for buying health insurance, even if you feel you don't need it. Get health insurance, even if you're young, she said. A health plan may not cover every cost incurred, she said, but it sure helps.
And while we debate the ideal health system, we mustn't forget that Trump and his allies are as determined as ever to undo the progress we've made.
The first is that most Republican politicians aren't interested. They oppose almost any ambitious government policy, market-based or otherwise. Today's Republican Party is adamantly opposed to fighting climate change, expanding health insurance or to reducing income inequality.
Insurers are supposed to submit their proposals to the federal government by June 21 and have already filed rate requests with several states. Loss of the cost-sharing subsidies, they say, could lead them to increase premiums by 15 percent to 20 percent or more, on top of any increases they might seek for other reasons.
I think it tells you that a lot of G.O.P. elected officials still have this sense that the bigoted strain in Trumpism can just sort of go away when Trump does.
The Michigan ballot initiative's goal was to make the 2016 law more ambitious. And the politics looked so favorable that the two largest utilities basically dropped their opposition. Months before Election Day, they pre-emptively agreed to increase their renewables share to 25 percent by 2030. It wasn't quite the 30 percent level in the initiative, but it avoided the risk of defeat and let activists focus elsewhere. The activists took the deal and canceled the initiative.
To be fair, while Mr. Cohen's methods remain largely the same, his new show is framed differently, with less of an obvious emphasis on maneuvering high-profile victims into gotcha moments. (A segment with Sarah Palin, already well publicized, is not in the first episode, the only one Showtime provided to critics.) An introductory montage announces that four unique voices will reveal who is America, and while the echo of a news documentary unit is certainly meant to be parodic, Who Is America? doesn't always transcend the association. In place of the rough, anarchic glee of Ali G and Mr. Cohen's masterpiece, the feature film Borat, the humor in the new show has more of the studied, calculated texture common to the news-inflected late-night shows that have taken over topical comedy in his absence.
Regarding the Obamacare suit: I don't see the Supremes deciding to dismantle it. Chief Justice Roberts is settling nicely into the Anthony Kennedy role as the Court's swing vote. And he seems especially reluctant to turn the Court into an agent of sweeping social change, which explains his vote in the Louisiana abortion case. I think that's the essence of thoughtful conservative jurisprudence, centered around respect for precedent and incrementalism.
That, too, was an outrageous position. It flouted the Justice Department's duty to defend, a solemn duty, and one that goes to the heart of the rule of law. Without it, the sitting administration could pick which laws it wanted to defend in the courts and which it wanted to abandon. Laws could rise or fall based on nothing more than partisan disagreement. That's inconsistent with a constitutional system that assigns to Congress — not the president — the power to legislate.
Nixon designed his campaign, one of his advisers explained, to allow a potential supporter to avoid admitting to himself that he was attracted by the racist appeal.
Actually, I don't fully believe in this hypothesis either; mainly, Trumpism is the GOP's id triumphing over its weak superego, which was probably destined to happen regardless. But it's a lot more plausible than blaming little old me.

Jared and Ivanka seem torn about whether to keep crossing the rapids or turn back to shore. And as someone in their camp says: It's not like they could leave and all of a sudden you have this quiet life. Look at Don Jr. At this point, being a Trump is less a good brand than a bad state of mind. Besides, as their ally says, with Ivanka's trip to the Olympics in South Korea and her success helping Republicans increase the child tax credit, she feels she's actually found her groove.
Senator Warren frequently refers to Frances Perkins, who was Franklin Roosevelt's labor secretary. In The Atlantic, the former Obama speechwriter Susannah Jacob wrote that Senator Warren's campaign slogan Dream big, fight hard echoes a sentence in Ms. Perkins's memoir, in which she wrote that her heart sank when President Roosevelt questioned the public works program, because Ms. Perkins realized we must fight hard now.
In the last Democratic debate, Joe Biden declared that he would nominate a woman as his vice-presidential running mate. That felt right at the time. But times have changed. Biden needs to go much, much further: At the Democratic convention he needs to name not just his vice president, but his entire cabinet. And it needs to be a totally different kind of cabinet — a national unity cabinet — from Democrats on the Bernie Sanders left to Republicans on the Mitt Romney right. Why?
Following the change in administration, the deputy solicitor general, Edwin S. Kneedler, wrote to the justices, the Department of Justice has reconsidered the government's position in these cases. The purpose of this letter is to notify the court that the United States no longer adheres to the conclusions in the previously filed brief of the federal respondents.
That sure gets a lot done.
But Hal Heiner, Kentucky's Education and Workforce Development secretary, said during Mr. Bevin's news conference that there was an abundance of jobs available to Medicaid recipients, as well as resources to prepare them.
I mean, I hadn't seen him since John McCain had passed away, which would've been in August.
I don't know individual employees there. What I know is the power of that place and how they're using it right now. Well —
It doesn't go well. The legislature gavels in a session this past Saturday.
An important note: We still don't know the details of a repeal bill, and passage is not guaranteed. But Republicans passed a similar package in 2015, vetoed by President Obama, that provides a rough template. Republicans have also said they hope to make further changes through additional legislation. We'll provide updates when new legislative language arrives, expected in several weeks.
So we asked them: How much overlap is there between the two groups?
Stephen Colbert crowed about the news, reminding viewers that Republicans have repeatedly been unable to come up with a successful plan to replace the health care bill that they spent years criticizing under President Barack Obama.
I mean one way — one optimistic way of looking at this for the Democrats, maybe a little bit more optimistic for, say, a Bill Kristol Democrat than an Ezra Klein Democrat would be this. So, you have the potential for — we achieve something like herd immunity. We've got an economic take off as a result of that. And maybe the problem that every presidency, from '92 onward has run into, of overreach and then build backlash doesn't happen. Because he's just structurally incapable of achieving the overreach. And so you don't have a 1994, or 2006, or 2010, or 2018 backlash against Biden. And that you have more, if you're a Democrat and you largely approve of this agenda, you have more slow and steady progress.
Senator Warren visited Beijing in 2018, as Mr. Trump was waging a tariff war on China. She criticized his chaotic foreign policy, while arguing that America cannot support an economic system more integrated with China's while it fails to respect basic human rights.
Now it's time for our weekly recommendation when we give you a suggestion meant to take your mind off of politics. Ross, it's your turn. What do you have for us?
Donald Trump has been too erratic and undisciplined to take welfare chauvinism as far as it could probably go. But it is almost certainly true that somewhere in American politics, there's someone who has paid attention to what Trump has discovered and is planning accordingly.
Those experiences help explain why Warren thinks that bigger changes are sometimes more feasible than modest ones. Bigger changes — tangible, new ideas — can overcome voter cynicism. A lot of people don't believe you can actually make any change on economics, Warren says. I would add another, even larger, example to the pattern: Obamacare. Trump has undone many of Obama's more modest changes, on taxes, climate and other areas. But Obama's grandest accomplishment endures. For all its flaws, it proved too popular to kill.
So, the theory that the election was stolen is so amorphous, right? So, some of the people say yes to that mean, well those Facebook algorithms were unfairly twisted. And some of them mean, vote totals were altered and changed. And some of them just mean, well, The Washington Post, its coverage was not as evenhanded as we believe it should have been and was much too critical of Donald Trump and too soft on Biden. Now, different degrees of plausibility to different theories and also different degrees of severity. But that's, I think, the key of this. It's an umbrella. And you can be a Q nut or you can just be a standard issue Republican, who doesn't trust the media, and both of you can affirm this. And particularly at that level of abstraction, no wedge is being driven between the two of you. And so, a politician can get up and give a speech to you that you will be applauding for one reason and the guy next to you is applauding for a different reason. The guy next to you maybe believes in some totally insane conspiracy theory involving the ghost of Hugo Chavez and you basically, you've got a problem with Jake Tapper.
You start by disrupting. You start with some wins. You start with some places people want to be, and actually immigration reform is one of them. People don't like our immigration system, and our support for immigrants continues to go up. I can be in a room full of people who are three generations away from any immigration experience personally, and they want to see us get this done. It's not just liberals. What was the latest story? Utah wants more immigrants, right?
The Trump administration has not said whether the government will continue paying subsidies to keep costs down for people with Obamacare. If it doesn't, middle-income people could see their rates jump.
Lindsey Graham was not shy at all about speaking out.
But in newspapers and on radios and TV stations from Anchorage to Miami, the effects of the bill are already being contemplated. These could vary considerably from region to region, state to state, even family to family. Thirty-one states expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, though the designs of these programs are not the same, and the states that did not choose to expand would still be significantly affected. Clinics in Pennsylvania desperately need funding to battle the opioid epidemic; rural hospitals in Maine rely on Medicaid for survival; Nebraskans struggle to cover rising premiums; and Floridians fear the loss of money to fight the Zika virus.
Judge Rosemary M. Collyer sided with the House in its challenge to the administration's funding of a program to help as many as seven million lower-income people pay deductibles, co-payments and other out-of-pocket expenses under the law. Congress never provided explicit authority for the spending, she ruled.
Amsterdam surpasses London as Europe's trading hub. Shares worth roughly 9.2 billion euros ($11.2 billion) were traded on Dutch markets last month, beating the €8.6 billion traded on London exchanges. That shift is a tangible sign of how financial markets are being remade after Brexit.
Now senators are searching for changes to make the bill more politically palatable. But the notion of making those changes today and then speeding immediately to a vote is madness. There would be no time for experts to consider the consequences — to discover the sort of problems and unintended effects that last-minute changes are bound to create. By the time they did, the Senate would have passed it.
The tragedy of today's Republican Party lies partly in how far it has tumbled from its heights.
But at least canonically, as I understand it, the way people think about budget reconciliation, raising the minimum wage would not survive because that's not primarily budgetary. But doing a direct subsidy would survive because that is primarily budgetary. So even if raising the minimum wage is the cheaper, more efficient, more direct, more useful way to do this — I'm not saying it is, but hypothetically — you then would have to do the less efficient, more expensive, less useful way of doing it. That it's like, it's not just what kind of thing you do, but how you can do it.
Lauren Kelley: Sure. I wanted to ask about reproductive rights.
Henry Olsen, my former colleague, wrote a wonderful book about this a couple of years ago. And so I think that the struggle that we see now, that we've seen in the Trump era, that we'll see in the post-Trump era, a struggle for the party's identity between populist forces and conservative forces is an old story. And almost all the arguments that are being had have, in some form, been had before. But the post-Reagan party imagined itself to be a little different than that and understood itself as more unified around a set of conservative principles than its electorate really was. I think that reality is much more powerfully evident in the wake of the last few years and will define the direction of the party's struggle for its own identity.
Justices appointed by Republicans are generally committed to following the law. There are justices who frequently vote in a conservative way. But some of the justices appointed by Republicans often don't vote in a way that advances conservative policy.
Well, there's been a significant amount of legal legislation that has surrounded all of this political action.
But G.O.P. health care claims are special, in several ways. First, they're outright, clearly intentional lies — not dubious assertions or misstatements that could be attributed to ignorance or misunderstanding. Second, they're repetitive: Rather than making a wide variety of false claims, Republicans keep telling the same few lies, over and over. Third, they keep doing this even though the public long ago stopped believing anything they say on the subject.
Exactly. This is not just about public health. This is about access to power and the kind of most basic fundamental principles of democracy. If the system that we have been traditionally used to can't hold, what replaces it? And we've seen real resistance to that in this state, and we may see that resistance all across the country.
Her theory of political change has been shaped by two experiences — one failure and one success. As a professor in the 1990s, she served on a federal bankruptcy commission and fought against legal changes that favored banks over borrowers. The fight went on for a decade, and Warren's side lost. The defeat left her believing that a technocratic legislative debate — the inside game, as she calls it — almost always favors industry lobbyists.
Yeah, I can imagine. Nobody ever wants to answer this probably. To try this, you've got to have an optimism bias. And I do. I know that. It's an optimism bias that keeps me working 14 hours a day. It's an optimism bias that pulls you in more and more people to try to talk about it.
Mr. Trump has unsettled markets with trade threats aimed at China, which The Times has editorialized against. He famously boasted Trade wars are good, and easy to win. But a recent Axios report noted that China's exports to the United States dropped 23.1 percent this year.
Carrying out Mr. Cohen's elaborate deceptions and gathering enough successful ones to make a seven-episode series takes time, though — Showtime said Who Is America? has been in the works for a year. And that may have something to do with why the premiere episode feels tepid and inconsequential. During that year, we've gotten so used to people saying crazy and hurtful things of their own free will in public that watching them being tricked into doing so doesn't have the entertainment value it used to.
Rethink Impact, a venture capital firm that invests exclusively in tech start-ups founded by women, plans to announce today that it has raised $182 million for its second fund, surpassing expectations.
Venture fund for female founders raises $182 million
I think part of the reason that it can be effective sometimes is that it does link back to what we consider sort of a foundational American value. And you hear people talking about free speech, and you hear people talking about the right of the minority to have their say and not be trampled upon by the majority. And you think, oh, yeah, that's actually a good idea. But when you see it in its use, it is far more consistently applied in defense of the wealthy, the powerful, and the oppressive, than it is applied in defense of minorities. That's a structural factor. It's because conservatives, the party that's interested in maintaining the status quo, already have more power. So a tool that serves to block change helps them preserve power. And so it's not a coincidence that it's often used as a euphemistic defense of the wealthy and the powerful. And that is today how it continues to be used in the Senate.
While the Obama administration allowed hardship exemptions to the mandate, the Trump administration could conceivably interpret the requirement in a more lenient way, so that more people would not be penalized.
The Affordable Care Act of 2010 set up a system where people could buy insurance on online marketplaces. People below the income threshold could qualify for subsidies if insurance in their area became too costly. People above the income threshold could buy insurance in the marketplace, or they could buy a different set of plans directly from an insurance company or through a broker.
I am in this fight because my daddy ended up as a janitor. I got my big chance at a commuter college that cost $50 a semester, because a bunch of taxpayers had invested in that college. That opportunity is not there today. That same college costs $15,000 now. Kids have to load up on debt to go there today. That's not expanding opportunity in this country. We've got a choice to make as a nation and the good news about 2020, the door has opened just a crack, that all the things that have been broken for so long, Donald Trump has made so much worse and gotten so many people off the sidelines, we actually have a chance. Not just to nibble, but to make big change.
You obviously know where I stand on this political divide. But I'm starting to believe that I misjudged Republican motives.
The Trump administration came into office with its top legislative priority clear: Repeal the Affordable Care Act. It failed. Then, when a group of Republican states tried to throw out Obamacare through a lawsuit, the administration agreed that a key part of the law was unconstitutional.
But it's reasonable to think that most of the attrition can be attributed to the spike in prices, as the Trump administration concludes.
Then there are all the other ways that the wealthy influence policy, without getting involved in elections — through media, lobbying and philanthropy. Each channel is legitimate and most efforts to restrict them would create more problems than they solved. What Mr. Sanders calls the billionaire class will not lose its influence even after all the court decisions back to 1976 have been reversed.
Here again, the anonymous-Republicans equate a bigger defense budget and more weapons with strategy and strength. Thus, by definition, if Trump increased defense spending, he did something right. Did I miss the series of congressional hearings with independent military experts that addressed the question: What are the new (and old) threats we're facing today, and how will these new and vastly expensive weapons systems enable us to better address them?
Throughout the debate to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, President Trump and Republican congressional leaders have insisted they would retain a crucial, popular part of the health law: the promise that people can buy insurance even if they've had illnesses in the past.
They face, it is said, a terrible choice: On the one hand, they can put up token opposition knowing that Judge Kavanaugh is almost certain to be confirmed anyway, get the vote out of the way before the midterms and perhaps use the new associate justice as a whipping boy in campaign ads.
Called Trump — I think it was a [expletive].
Rhiana Gunn-Wright, a 29-year-old Rhodes scholar, works for the think tank New Consensus and helped design the Green New Deal. When I spoke with her, I was struck by her sense of political realism and how different it was from the old definition. For a long time, environmental activists have shown an almost compulsive — and in many ways admirable — honesty. They have chosen policies, like carbon taxes, that emphasize the downsides: Energy prices will rise. The Green New Deal and the recent clean-energy ballot initiatives do the reverse. They emphasize the benefits of clean energy and minimize the downsides. There is a lot of anxiety and uncertainty in America today, Gunn-Wright said. Any solution that is tied to tangible economic benefits is going to have a better chance of passing.
Before the 1970s, the federal government would in some cases spend money without prior congressional approval, said Jim Broussard, the director of the Center for Political History at Lebanon Valley College in Annville, Pa.
Maybe the question answers itself. (Speaking of election law, it was Justice Clarence Thomas who wrote in a separate opinion three years ago that he regarded the court's one person, one vote jurisprudence as lacking a sound basis.) Justice Samuel Alito? The new justices, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh? Shouldn't we assume that they care too? And if not, why not? As the clock ticks toward the 2020 census, just asking.

SS: The Obama administration tried that, Trump administration tried that in different ways, but no results. What kind of leverage would you use? What would you do?
The rule is clearly an end-run around the A.C.A., said the judge, John D. Bates, of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia.
Murkowski landed in the Senate essentially by fiat: In 2002, her father, Frank Murkowski, then a senator, was elected governor of Alaska and had to choose a successor. He publicly considered an up-and-coming mayor from Wasilla, Sarah Palin, then rejected her. Instead, he appointed his daughter Lisa, who had been a state legislator for all of four years. The blatant act of nepotism dogged Frank Murkowski, who went on in 2006 to face Palin in a primary challenge for governor, which she easily won.
In the October Democratic debate, Times national editor Marc Lacey asked Mr. Yang to comment on Senator Warren's calls to break up companies like Facebook, Amazon and Google. Mr. Yang said Senator Warren is correct in her diagnosis of the problem but breaking up the companies isn't an adequate solution because using a 20th-century antitrust framework will not work. We need new solutions and a new tool kit.
The Kaiser Family Foundation's Health Care Tracking Poll has found a decline in public support for Medicare for all since the start of the year. Now roughly 51 percent of American adults are in favor of a single-payer system and 47 percent are opposed, whereas earlier this year 57 percent backed it and 37 percent were opposed.
What's happened to Lindsey Graham? Not a damn thing. Nothing.
Well, when most people look at these presidential primaries, particularly in a state like Wisconsin, they think that this is just about the two candidates at the top — Joe Biden versus Bernie Sanders, and who gets the delegates out of that. But the reason why Wisconsin was holding out and keeping its primary schedule was really to do with more state and local concerns. Initially, the Democratic governor, Tony Evers, and state Republican leaders were on the same page. They both agreed that the April 7 election should go forward. And they said so for a couple reasons. Not only had the virus not really ravaged the state in the same way that we have seen in other parts of the country at the initial time in March when they were making this decision, but they agreed on the importance of the state and local races that would be decided down ballot on the same day of the presidential primary.

O.K.? And I have seen the billionaire go on TV and cry about it.
In 1959, then vice president Richard Nixon—who would go on, as president, to create the Environmental Protection Agency, consider a basic minimum income, and propose a national health-care plan more ambitious than Obamacare—spoke with derision of those who sought to cleave the parties by their beliefs. It would be a great tragedy if we had our two major political parties divide on what we would call a conservative-liberal line, he said. The strength of the American political system is we have avoided generally violent swings in Administrations from one extreme to the other. And the reason we have avoided that is that in both parties there has been room for a broad spectrum of opinion.
Biden's current mission is to make the world focus on his $1.9 trillion plan for a coronavirus comeback. It's currently in the House, where the Democratic majority is expected to pass it readily, once the poor bill makes its way through all the subcommittee chairs who want a little poke at it. But sometime in March it'll be in the hands of Senator Chuck Schumer, whose majority consists entirely of Kamala Harris breaking tie votes.
The president's fans cheer his pugilism, as though he was bravely defending himself — and them — against big, bad bullies. But all too often, the price is paid by the innocent and vulnerable: migrant children snatched from their parents at the border, federal workers thrown into financial turmoil by the government shutdown, farm workers and manufacturers caught up in the trade war, the millions of Americans who stand to lose their health insurance if the administration keeps laboring to kill Obamacare.
That list could grow. Senator Ron Johnson, of Wisconsin, has not yet said whether he will seek a third term, nor has Senators Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who is 87, or Richard Shelby of Alabama, who is 86. Senators Mark Kelly of Arizona and Raphael Warnock of Georgia — two Democrats who joined the chamber after winning special elections — will face voters again in 2022 for full six-year terms.
At least two other Republicans, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, have indicated they will not vote to proceed if Senate leaders plan to then put forth a measure to repeal the health law without providing a replacement.
KK: It's a very bad idea for the children to ——
WASHINGTON — House Democrats, moving to sharpen the distinction between themselves and Republicans as the coronavirus pandemic rages, passed legislation on Monday that would ensure that Americans paid no more than 8.5 percent of their income for health insurance and would allow the government to negotiate prices with drug makers.
Think of what that means. Do — you know that the top — just one quick — one number. I've resisted numbers while I'm in here. The 99 percent America pays 7.2 percent of your total income in taxes. Not total income. Total wealth. The top one-tenth of 1 percent, the part I want to hit with a 2-cent wealth tax, 3.2 percent. 3.2 percent. They have wealth managers who are managing these huge funds that are growing at what rate? Six percent a year, 8 percent a year, 10 percent a year?

Democratic Twitter is dominated by overeducated, over-caffeinated, over-opinionated pain-in-the-ass white liberals. Every candidate, and every staffer, checks Twitter and other social media scores of times a day.
O.K, we need to leave the discussion there. And we'll be right back with our second topic of the day. [MUSIC PLAYING] Our colleague, Farhad Manjoo, recently wrote a much-discussed column about pronouns and gender. In it, Farhad calls himself a stereotypical cisgender, middle-aged suburban dad. But Farhad doesn't want to be called he or him. Instead he or, more to the point, they prefers they and them. It's one way to make society less irredeemably obsessed with gender, Farhad wrote. There is a much larger debate here about degenderization, the push for a society less governed by gender. We're going to have that debate now, and we are thrilled that Farhad has joined us for it. Welcome to The Argument, Farhad.
This is a mistake. There's no doubt that the judicial system must examine the accusations against Mr. Epstein, and that the Justice Department will have many questions about Mr. Acosta's apparent leniency toward him. Congress digging into this case, however, is a poor use of lawmakers' limited time and resources. More dangerous, in the midst of the Trump administration's war on congressional oversight in general , such hearings carry a high risk of turning the Epstein case into a partisan battle — and Mr. Acosta into a political martyr around whom the president and his followers feel moved to rally.
Mark Leibovich wrote about Graham for The New York Times Magazine.
All of this is true. But the main reason that Democrats — including many centrist Democrats — are moving away from market-based programs is not that they have had a change of heart. It's that they are coming to terms with political reality.
But let me finish my point. If you fight on ground where I think you've got lots of bipartisan support and you lead a damn fight — and then — just — if you can deliver a 2-cent wealth tax, which has wide popularity, when I get to sign the piece of paper that cancels student loan debt for 43 million Americans, that's Democrats and Republicans. I think at that moment, the world starts to shift. I think at that moment, a whole generation of people who have only seen the government as debt collector starts to shift. Will we get 100 percent of the folks on board? No. But will we get a lot more? Will we begin to talk about a democracy that doesn't just work increasingly for a thinner and thinner slice of the top, or will we start to talk about a democracy that works for all of us? That 2-cent wealth tax is about child care. It's about things that touch people's lives. It's about universal pre-K for 3-year-olds and 4-year-olds. It's about a $50 billion investment in historically black colleges and universities, tuition-free. Technical school, two-year college, four-year college. You just deliver on something that matters to people. Now they've got a stake in democracy. It feels like it pays off, that it's not just marching in the street over and over and over, and the next day you wake up and it's a little bit worse than it was today.
The attempt to work across the aisle with the Labour Party suggests that May cannot win enough support within her own Conservative Party to pass her Brexit plan.
The stalemates that have come to define the budget process have helped set the stage for repeated shutdown showdowns. It is a broken process that has enabled and empowered partisan bad faith by setting up a situation in which everything is riding on a few enormous bills. So lawmakers try to hook other priorities — immigration, say, or health care — to must pass legislation in hopes of using the leverage to push them through.
Senator Warren has laid out an ambitious timeline that would put children and families under Medicare for all in her first 100 days through a congressional maneuver, then fully roll out her system by her third year in office.
And I know it's tough between here and there. I was in a very tough primary back in 2012 and I wasn't in any primary at all in 2018, so those are my two electoral experiences.
It's not too hard to see why Democrats and independents like the plan. What I'm trying to understand is something that seems like a political paradox. Namely, how is it possible that so many Republicans approve of the plan?
About 10 million Americans lost their homes to foreclosure sales between 2006 and 2014, the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis.
Well, it's not good for them and in a dozen different ways. Wages are part of it, but they are only part of it. It's about unsafe working conditions, for example. If you can hire somebody for cash and not meet current labor standards on safety, that someone needs a safety belt or needs training to go up high on a building, you not only put that person at risk, you reward employers who continue not to follow the law and to undermine safety standards for everyone.
There is a big inconvenient fact about conservative health care proposals, as Ross Douthat notes in his latest column: Virtually no real-world successful example exists.

Times columnist David Brooks noted in The Road to Character that Ms. Perkins discovered her calling to service and organizing after witnessing the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist fire. The analogy to something like the student loan debt crisis or child care, of course, isn't perfect — the debt crisis, for instance, has been slow burning as tuition rates have risen far above the inflation rate since the 1970s.
Because for me, they all are about a central question and that's: Who's going to get opportunity in this country going forward? Will opportunity be reserved just for those born into privilege? Or will opportunity be something that we say as a country, we're willing to make some hard choices to invest, so that all of our kids get those opportunities?

But a degree worse, two degrees worse. I watch that, and I watch as one more player in the game gets even more deeply embedded in Washington and Washington decision making. One more player hires more lobbyists, spends more money on campaign contributions, puts more money into bought-and-paid-for experts and think tanks so that nothing will change. It's like you talk about hardening between right and left. That's not the hardening. The part that's happening is it's hardening between the top and the bottom.
Much responsibility lies with voters, who must not allow themselves to be hypnotized by a compelling biography. Mr. McCain was out of step with his Republican constituents on virtually every major issue of the past generation, including Obamacare, immigration and foreign policy, where Mr. McCain had long supported military intervention around the globe — a policy that has cost our nation dearly.
In contrast, G.M. said it would idle five car factories in Ohio, Michigan, Maryland and Canada while Chrysler is cutting jobs at an Illinois plant.

Senate leaders are now hastily trying to rewrite a sprawling tax bill — one that touches almost every part of the economy — and then pass it mere hours later. They need to do so because an independent Senate analysis late yesterday made clear what everyone already knew: The bill would add to the deficit enormously. In a normal legislative process, the Senate would have received that analysis long before taking any vote.
What institution in America still does the best job molding character?
So, Michelle, what do you think about the whole idea of using they?
Mr. Trump isn't the first to mount a pressure campaign on NATO member states to increase their contributions. President Bush used a summit in Latvia in 2006 to urge other nations to raise their military spending, and President Obama echoed the plea at a 2014 conference in Brussels. Mr. Trump, though, has made spending levels a more central issue.
Well, I think the cause and effect doesn't necessarily work in that direction. We're certainly in a very divided time. And we are in, as you say, a hyper-competitive political environment in a sense that control of Congress and the presidency is up for grabs in just about every election now in a way that we may have become used to over the last 30 years, but is actually pretty unusual over the range of American history. And the question is, is that going to get resolved by empowering small minorities to exercise more power, or is that going to get resolved by requiring more work across these party lines? I don't think either of those would look clean and easy and fun. I don't think we get rid of heated political debates either way. The question is, what gives us a chance to arrive at a more legitimate and a more sustainable set of political arrangements. And I think that requiring a party that has just barely a majority in the Senate to get a small portion of the other members to agree with something significant it wants to do is a good idea, if you're trying to advance public policy that's going to have a relatively broad range of public support. Now, I do think the filibuster is overused, and there are probably ways to constrain its use by making it a little harder to use.
No, It's fine. So I actually start with the big vision. You know, if you gave me a chance, I'd do a constitutional amendment to protect the right of every American citizen to vote and to make sure that vote gets counted so you put real federal muscle behind it. I also talk about that for a specific reason, because a lot of Americans are shocked to know that that's not already in the Constitution and that there is no federal muscle behind that.
Senator Warren said in March that she hopes to pass a constitutional amendment to protect every American's right to vote. She added, Every vote matters, and the way we can make that happen is that we can have national voting, and that means get rid of the Electoral College.
WASHINGTON — Republican governors pleaded with their fellow Republicans in Congress on Thursday to give states more control over both their Medicaid programs and their individual health insurance markets as lawmakers work with President-elect Donald J. Trump to replace the Affordable Care Act.
The Republican governor of Idaho, C. L. Otter, known as Butch, issued an executive order last month to combat what he called the overreaching, intrusive nature of Obamacare. And on Jan. 24, the state Insurance Department issued guidelines for the sale of insurance policies that do not meet coverage requirements of the Affordable Care Act.
BA: So you'd put tariffs on existing foreign imports?
MC: I think we can agree that there are huge problems here. But to Katie's point, and then I'm going to throw it to Jesse. You have to be careful to balance the big promises with the over-promising, because then you risk the disillusionment, which I think we saw during the Obama administration. And back to kind of Katie's question about how you pay for a lot of these things. I mean comprehensive immigration for one, you can't do that through budget reconciliation.
But I get it. There are right now, Democrats against Democrats on this. But understand this, we'll get into a general election. Oh, I know what the insurance industry will want to do. I know what Donald Trump will want to do. But the truth is we're going to have the party who tried to take away health care from 35 million Americans, said it was O.K. to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions and is continuing to follow that right now, both in their lawsuits and in their agency practices, and millions of people have lost their health care.
2. Do Senate Republicans have the votes to pass a health care bill?
There's no arguing that popular storytelling and factual scholarship can be combined in useful ways. What I'm curious about is your opinion on the limits, if there are any, of that combination. It's an excellent question. It took a long time for black scholars and filmmakers to feel comfortable representing black historical figures in three dimensions. Take Harriet Tubman. Students think Harriet Tubman was basically leading a train of slaves out of Grand Central Station. But I think the number she saved was closer to 70 — which was a lot, by the way. Or: The myth that our ancestors were kidnapped by your ancestors, David, is just untrue. The fantasy is that my 10th-great-grandmother and -grandfather were out on a picnic and some white people jumped out of the bushes and they ended up on a plantation in Virginia. That's not how it happened. But one of the things that I've dedicated my career to is showing that black people are just as complex, positively and negatively, as anybody else. For years, the mythos that undergirded black history was that the slaves were the victims of European dominance. But really it was the Europeans who were selling guns to African kings, who engaged in wars against other Africans in order to defeat them and then sell the victims to Europeans. I remember once I was asked to consult on a project about Martin Luther King. I said, You can't do hagiography anymore. King was complicated. He had affairs and doubts.
Last year, Senator Warren introduced a bill called the No First Use Act, which would declare that the United States would never be the first to use a nuclear weapon. Opponents say it could drive arms races in smaller countries that depend on America for protection.
I thought at the time, it was a usefully provocative title. And I overestimated the extent to which people would actually, at least read the introduction. I certainly think that over the last 15 years, it has become more and more central to my political thinking that we have a real difficulty understanding the beliefs of people who are unlike us or who disagree with us. And so it's important whenever we come across an opposing view, or something that our initial response is to oppose, or reject, or be horrified by, to stop and think, is it possible for an intelligent person of good will to believe this? And try to do a real work of imagination in figuring that out. And I did try to do that in the book, but I'd say I've tried to do it more frequently in both directions. So, I was opposed to Trump from the get-go, but I did try to argue, I could totally see why somebody might support Donald Trump in the Republican primaries in 2015 and 2016. And we shouldn't just assume that everybody who supports him is supporting him for obnoxious reasons or hateful reasons. And the same is true of people on our left. And yet, I find that a lot of people are not willing to make that effort. And some people even make a point of pride, on left and right, of not making that kind of effort.
He directs the Justice Department to take sides in a lawsuit that has been making its way through the federal courts. It was brought by Republican legal officials in a number of states. It has been ruled on by one judge in Texas that the Affordable Care Act is invalid.
KK: Well, it has to come to the Senate floor. I mean, Mitch McConnell already has an anti-corruption, election reform bill [passed by the House].
It is bigger than any offered under the Affordable Care Act — subsidies some Republicans loathe as handouts — and costs the federal government $250 billion in lost tax revenue every year.
At issue is a program that collects fees from most insurers and uses the money to help pay high-cost claims for sicker people. The purpose of this temporary reinsurance program is to stabilize premiums and to encourage insurers to participate in markets under the health care law.
Senator Warren has argued that the sheer size of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon pose a real threat to innovation and competition in the technology industry. Mr. Yang has argued that her diagnosis is 100 percent correct but that her solution isn't fully effective because competition doesn't solve all of the problems.
Good Wednesday morning. On today's agenda: the Fed's big announcement on interest rates. More on what to expect below. (Was this email forwarded to you? Sign up here.)
The per capita payments to states are set to grow under the legislation each year, according to the medical portion of the consumer price index. But Medicaid costs for disabled patients and for those in nursing homes tend to be high and sometimes grow more quickly than that index. The change would give states a bigger annual increase for every beneficiary in either category.
I think that our politics has never really been intended to function as a pure majoritarian politics. One of the most important insights that are built into the constitutional system are that a functional republic, to be stable, has to not only enable enduring majorities to have their way, but also protect durable minorities, large ones. And that means that there are all kinds of structures in the system that compel accommodation, that require differing factions to work together, if they're going to achieve anything. And I think those are enormously important. I think a politics where a narrow majority — and the Democrats have narrow majorities in both houses now, in the Senate, barely even that — where a narrow majority could just advance its agenda and then see what the public says at the next election is not a good idea for American society in this moment. I think we are much better served by a politics that compels some work across party lines in order to get anywhere. And Congress has always been designed that way. Congress was not intended to be like the European parliament, where the majority rules for as long as the public will let it. It is a place where the country works out its differences. The weakening of Congress over decades now has, not by coincidence, brought with it a weakening of our capacity to work out differences in our politics.
And I came here to talk with you all about the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. And the very short version of this story is I went around Washington talking to people about how, do not in this crisis, simply outlaw the practices that were bad, that were used on the mortgages, that are used on credit cards, because they'll be like fence posts on the prairie with nothing strong in between. And it'll take the banks and Wall Street about three minutes to figure out how to run around them by redescribing their product or slightly reinventing their product. I think you've got to have an agency that when Wall Street moves, the agency can move. That's how financial crises — it's the only way we're going to make this work.

So that's why people are asking what happened to Lindsey Graham, and I was asking it myself. I mean, I don't think there was a sharper pivot from vehemently anti-Trump to enthusiastically pro-Trump more so than Lindsey Graham within the Republican Party. So I decided that I would spend some time with Lindsey Graham and see if I could ask him enough questions that maybe he could shed some light on this for me.
# #7 Medicaid formula changes New change Medicaid allotments for older and disabled beneficiaries grow faster than the rate of medical inflation Previously Medicaid allotments for elderly and disabled beneficiaries grow at the rate of medical inflation Who's happy with this change Governors
Opponents of President Barack Obama's signature legislative achievement have made what may be a self-fulfilling prophecy: They repeatedly forecast the collapse of the health law, and then push it along.
Even some candidates who back the single-payer approach of Medicare for All told The Times they would also be willing to support a choice between some kind of public option and private insurance , an acknowledgment that many Americans like their private coverage and want the choice to keep it.
The basic solution is straightforward. It involves increasing the subsidies for lower-income families — while also increasing the penalties for people who refuse to sign up for health insurance. The overall cost of this fix would be modest, and a better functioning Republican Party would have no problem agreeing to a compromise. It would preserve a robust role for the private market, after all.
Opinion Debate What should the Biden administration prioritize? Mitt Romney writes that the right answer to human rights violations is an economic and diplomatic boycott of the Beijing Olympics that would still allow American athletes to participate.
It's a full plate, with long odds. For starters, how does a president who sees the essential goodness in everyone deal with a party whose base doesn't even believe in the legitimacy of his presidency? How does he bring the conspiracy theorists back to planet Earth, and cool the tribal passions that fueled the insurrection on Jan. 6?
This liberal astigmatism — our belief that history is a story of racial progress, and our faith in our own empathy — makes Eduardo Porter's American Poison a tough read. It is a learned, well-written but relentless survey of social science studies on the racial polarization, animosity and social fragmentation of American life. A black or Hispanic American reader is likely to finish Porter's summary of the evidence and say, So what else is new? For a white liberal, the book leaves many an illusion in tatters.
I think these are our most vulnerable members of society, and we have to treat them accordingly and to try to do everything for them. Moshe Kantor, president of the European Jewish Congress, this week called on European leaders to ensure that Holocaust survivors, who like other people of advanced age are extremely vulnerable to the virus, were given access to the vaccine. The organization estimates that approximately 20,000 Holocaust survivors are still living in Europe today. Throughout their lives, they have shown mighty strength of spirit, but in the current crisis, many have sadly died alone and in pain, or are now fighting for their lives, and many others are suffering from extreme isolation, Dr. Kantor said, speaking during an International Holocaust Remembrance Day event held online this week. We have a duty to ensure that Holocaust survivors are able to live their last years in dignity and in the company of their loved ones.
Republicans, who previously failed to gain enough votes to replace President Obama's health law, attempted a third measure to repeal major parts of the Affordable Care Act without a replacement. That plan has collapsed.
Mr. Manchin stopped to give her a hug. After he passed, she said she feared that Republicans in Washington will continue to try to repeal President Barack Obama's health care law. If they can't overturn that, then they hope they can at least favor their big-insurance buddies by allowing them to block pre-existing conditions, said Ms. Miller, a nurse educator. I have a pre-existing condition.
Whether it was the border wall, which he insisted would be built; abortion, where he tried to fan conservative anger over comments made by Virginia's governor; or the investigations of his presidential campaign's ties to Russia, which he dismissed as ridiculous and partisan, Mr. Trump chose to appeal to his political base rather than trying to build bridges to Democrats.
Including Joe Biden at that time.
In 1977, the House of Representatives and the Senate fought over whether Medicaid should be used to pay for abortions. That led to three separate instances in which the government could not provide funding for the Departments of Labor and Health, Education and Welfare. The shutdowns added up to a total of 28 days that year.
He was always at his side. The two of them had sort of similar senses of humor.
Richard A. Friedman, in Mentally Ill Without Obamacare (Op-Ed, Dec. 12), correctly focuses on the necessity of preserving medical coverage for psychiatric disorders.
THE REPUBLICAN ANSWER The Congressional Budget Office said that premiums would be 15 percent to 20 percent higher under the House bill than under current law in 2018 and 2019, but would then fall, so that average premiums in 2026 would be about 10 percent lower than under current law. Under the House bill, the federal government would offer grants to the states — $100 billion from 2018 to 2026 — and they could use the money to stabilize premiums by paying some of the cost of very large claims.
An expert on college affordability at the Urban Institute told The Times that Senator Warren's $50,000 debt clearance is too much. Setting the level at $10,000 instead would relieve debt for a third of all borrowers, according to their analysis.
And why would it be controversial in the New Deal period, when it seems like the idea of government taking care of people is very much in vogue?
It doesn't go to a doctor making $1 million a year who also has $1 million in student loan debt.
Whether a president can truly improve, or damage, an economy remains an open question. The greatest economic power might in fact remain in the hands of the Federal Reserve. Economists credit the Fed's policy of keeping interest rates at historic lows with helping to pump up the economy and bring unemployment down. At the same time, the Fed has been blamed for widening inequality, swelling the price of real estate and corporate profits, even as savers and retirees dependent on fixed-income assets have suffered.
Mr. Trump briefly acknowledged Nancy Pelosi as Madam Speaker, but dispensed with even perfunctory congratulations. He all but ignored the midterm elections that swept the Republican Party out of power in the House. And he vowed that the United States will never be a socialist country, likening the progressive Democrats in the chamber to the discredited leader of Venezuela.
This scene is part of Joan Biskupic's new biography of Roberts, The Chief. The book contains a description of the justices's behind-the-scenes maneuverings on Obamacare that's more detailed than any other to appear so far.
To Nordhaus and some other economists, it remains the only policy powerful enough to be worth the effort. I understand where they're coming from. Carbon pricing would affect every industry and every household. It would have cascading benefits, giving the private sector an incentive to invest more in clean energy. But recent history offers reason to be skeptical that focusing entirely on pricing would make its achievement any more likely.
Several members of the Trump family have come under fire for profiting from Donald Trump's administration in possible violation of the emoluments clause, including Ivanka Trump, who was paid more than $1 million from her ties to the Trump Organization last year. And former Vice President Joe Biden's son Hunter held a lucrative position on the board of a Ukrainian natural gas company. In late September, Ms. Warren was, in the words of one reporter, uncharacteristically flustered when asked about the Biden matter.
This change, alone, would slash child poverty by an estimated 40 percent. But this change isn't alone. The American Rescue Plan also triples the value of the earned-income tax credit for low-income workers without children, providing a benefit of roughly $1,500 to more than 17 million Americans and fixing a tax code that, as it stands, punishes childless workers in low-wage jobs.
So the result leaves a reforming conservatism as the neglected stepchild of the G.O.P., granted table scraps while the donors get the feast. It leaves Republicans with ownership of a bill that is neither populist nor popular, and Trump with ownership of an economic agenda that a reasonable voter should consider a betrayal of his promises. And it wastes an opportunity to turbocharge the recovery, because the bill's corporate beneficiaries are already sitting on ample cash reserves and it's the middle-class taxpayers who would have been more likely to spend extra money if they got it.
Part two is again, we should be working more with our allies. Donald Trump seems to think somehow that we are stronger alone and I think that's fundamentally wrong. If you want to bring economic pressure on China, if you want to bring diplomatic pressure on China, it makes a lot more sense to do that if we're doing it with our allies, if we're doing it in conjunction with others. And I think that provides potentially much better protection for Hong Kong. The idea that this is going to be a direct military conflict between China and the United States, that would be deeply destabilizing to the entire world. So I want to see us use our diplomatic tools. I want to see us use our economic tools, and I want to see us leverage everything that we want to do by working much more tightly in conjunction with our allies. We just haven't been doing that. None of the above.
A 2017 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that generic competition has weakened in recent decades, leading to higher prices for generics. EpiPen and insulin prices, in particular, have skyrocketed. Senator Warren's Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would authorize the government to manufacture active ingredients for medications or contract outside entities to manufacture generic drugs and lower prices. But Senator McConnell has railed against socialist price controls in the health care system.
Among other things, right? And it's why though I've tried so hard for 11 months and four days now to talk about the vision of what we can actually do and to try to make it real. Not vision in a — I'm not really a big, you know, talk about this in soaring terms. But in real terms, a 2-cent wealth tax.
I miss John. I miss him a lot.
I think we need to get our combat troops out. I don't think that combat is advancing the interests of the United States in the Middle East, and it's time to end combat operations. Of course we'll have a continuing presence in the Middle East. We have interests in the Middle East with our allies. We have interests in the Middle East and keeping shipping lanes open, and we will continue to have a presence there, but I don't think combat troops are how we best advance that presence.
You start by disrupting. You start with some wins. You start with some places people want to be, and actually immigration reform is one of them. People don't like our immigration system, and our support for immigrants continues to go up. I can be in a room full of people who are three generations away from any immigration experience personally, and they want to see us get this done. It's not just liberals. What was the latest story? Utah wants more immigrants, right?
And it's even more naïve now than it was a few decades ago, because, as Irwin points out, large economic players are dominating more and more of the economy. It's increasingly clear, for example, that monopsony power is depressing wages; but that's not all it does. Concentration of hiring among a few firms, plus things like noncompete clauses and tacit collusion that reinforce their market power, don't just reduce your wage if you're hired. They also reduce or eliminate your options if you're mistreated: quit because you have an abusive boss or have problems with company policy, and you may have real trouble getting a new job.
People tend to vote with their pocketbooks, and the strong economic performance will be at the forefront of every discussion this fall, said Jesse Hunt , a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee , adding, A contrast between single-payer health care and our ideas — a more patient-centered approach — is a debate we fully welcome.
It is hardly premature to ask, in this light, how the Trump administration might manage the fallout from the economic downturn that everybody knows will happen. Unfortunately, the United States could hardly be less prepared.
The tax law overhaul of late 2019 eliminated the home office deduction for employees from 2018 through 2025. Employees who receive a paycheck or a W-2 exclusively from an employer are not eligible for the deduction, even if they are currently working from home, the I.R.S. said. Read more. How does the family leave credit work? Self-employed people can take paid caregiving leave if their child's school is closed or their usual child care provider is unavailable because of the outbreak. This works similarly to the smaller sick leave credit — 67 percent of average daily earnings (for either 2020 or 2019), up to $200 a day. But the caregiving leave can be taken for 50 days. Read more. Have rules changed on charitable giving? Yes. This year, you can deduct up to $300 for charitable contributions, even if you use the standard deduction. Previously, only people who itemized could claim these deductions. Donations must be made in cash (for these purposes, this includes check, credit card or debit card), and can't include securities, household items or other property. For 2021, the deduction limit will double to $600 for joint filers. Rules for itemizers became more generous as well. The limit on charitable donations has been suspended, so individuals can contribute up to 100 percent of their adjusted gross income, up from 60 percent. But these donations must be made to public charities in cash; the old rules apply to contributions made to donor-advised funds, for example. Both provisions are available through 2021. Read more.
It's that you don't get the tariff benefit. This is what it's really about. Where's the baseline? Right? And is the baseline one that says, across the board, you've got to give plenty of notice. You've got to work through, make sure you've got something that's achievable for countries we trade with. But this is not like trying to institute a trade war. This is not like saying we're mad at you and therefore we're going to impose all these tariffs on you, and doing it as Donald Trump has done by tweet.
The relief bill President Biden just signed is breathtaking in its scope. Yet conservative opposition was remarkably limp. While not a single Republican voted for the legislation, the rhetorical onslaught from right-wing politicians and media was notably low energy, perhaps because the Biden plan is incredibly popular. Even as Democrats moved to disburse $1.9 trillion in government aid, their opponents mainly seemed to be talking about Dr. Seuss and Mr. Potato Head.
Mr. Trump isn't the first to mount a pressure campaign on NATO member states to increase their contributions. President Bush used a summit in Latvia in 2006 to urge other nations to raise their military spending, and President Obama echoed the plea at a 2014 conference in Brussels. Mr. Trump, though, has made spending levels a more central issue.
There are effectively three paths forward for the case. The Supreme Court could reject it, letting the lower courts continue their work. It could accept it, and grant the litigants' request for expedited review, setting up a ruling on the case this session. Or it could accept the case on its typical schedule, which would most likely mean oral arguments and a ruling in its session that begins in the fall. Four justices would need to agree to accept the case, but it would take a majority vote of five to speed up the case's consideration.
KK: Simultaneously though, all of the things that you've suggested you would need to do in order to afford Medicare for all, a wealth tax, cutting the defense budget, comprehensive immigration reform, would require the Senate's approval.
And not just from the few remaining relatively moderate Republicans.
archived recording (donald trump) Americans are all praying for his recovery. He's been a really good friend. He's been really something very special — strong, resolute, doesn't quit, doesn't give up.
So let's assume Mr. Ryan isn't an exceptional Republican political liability. What about on policy? We can assess his record by looking at what bills the speaker decided to consider in the House. For that, there are two dynamics to assess: One involves keeping things off the agenda that could split the party, even if they could pass the House with votes chipped in from the other party. As Dennis Hastert, a former speaker, put it, The job of the speaker is not to expedite legislation that runs counter to the wishes of the majority of the majority. The second dynamic entails advancing policies favored by his party.
There are leaders who are ahead of their times, leaders who are behind their times, and then there's Donald Trump, who comes from another time altogether. He's stuck somewhere closer to the Stone Age than to Stonewall. And the Supreme Court just told him so.
We take it on by deciding we're going to take it on. We pass it through Congress, and then we set it up for the states to be able to vote on it.
AK: Sure. I'm really interested in the student loan debt issue, but there's a concern that your plan to forgive student debt really tilts a lot of resources towards the wealthy. So only 2 percent of borrowers have more than $50,000 in debt. A third of all student debt is owned by people in the top income quartile, and most student debt goes to households with advanced degrees. So these are doctors and lawyers, and they've amassed a lot of debt, but they're also investing in their own educational capacity to pay off that debt. So I'm just wondering how you square that with a plan that goes about forgiving student debt?
Americans remain divided over President Obama's most significant legislative achievement, even as 20 million people have gained coverage under the law and the percentage of those without insurance has dropped to record lows. Mr. Trump and Republican leaders of the House and the Senate have vowed to repeal the 2010 law as one of the first legislative actions of the Trump era.
In October 2019, Senator Warren tweeted: Facebook has incredible power to affect elections and our national debate. Mark Zuckerberg is telling employees that he views a Warren administration as an 'existential' threat to Facebook. The public deserves to know how Facebook intends to use their influence in this election.
What institution in America still does the best job molding character?
Top executives from state hospital associations will fly to Washington this week to develop their strategy. Many also plan to visit offices on Capitol Hill, where they will warn of the potential damage if Congress repeals the health law without guaranteeing similar coverage for those who would lose it.
Jamie Daw argues we can transition from Obamacare to Germany's universal health care system far more easily than we can persuade — whom? — to accept single payer. Poll after poll shows Americans long for a single-payer plan. But we cannot ignore the differences between a country that accepts limits on profiteering and one that celebrates any and all legal means of turning any opportunity into a buck.
It is amazing that the whole article never talks about cost controls. With the hospitals and doctors charging exorbitantly, why would you expect the insurance rates to be lower, whether it is a single-payer system or multipayer system?
It is not as if Democrats are lacking powerful immigration issues on which to run. An April University of Maryland Study of American Attitudes on Immigration and Refugees found that the Trump administration's family separation policies are opposed 64-25, including by independent swing voters (67-18) and even by Republicans whose partisan allegiance is not strong (51-34). Only strong Republicans support the policies, 55-26.
Look at the example. He said, I will take your money to lie about other candidates. What does that mean for our democracy? Not even meet the minimal standard that TV ads run, right?

After Senator Warren said during the October debate that the United States should get out of the Middle East, her campaign clarified that she was referring just to combat troops. Noncombat troops have long been stationed in the region for a variety of reasons including ensuring a free flow of oil.
Since Donald Trump's election, a loose coalition of citizens, doctors, nurses, activists and others have rallied together to prevent their fellow Americans from losing health insurance. They won a big victory last month when Congress set aside its efforts to pass a destructive bill. But now the coalition has a new fight.
Health care was a key factor in Democrats' victory in the 2018 midterm elections, and it should be a big plus in 2020 as well. The shared Democratic position — that every legal resident should have access to affordable care, regardless of income or health status — is immensely popular. The de facto Republican position — that we should go back to a situation in which those whose jobs don't come with health benefits, or who suffer from pre-existing medical conditions, can't get insurance — is so unpopular that G.O.P. candidates consistently lie about their own proposals.
KK: You seem to have avoided that approach for the most part. Can you just explain why?
As many as 11 million Americans could find coverage under this proposal, the Labor Department said in issuing the proposed rules, which carry out an executive order signed by President Trump on Oct. 12. The public will have 60 days to comment on the proposal before the Trump administration adopts final rules with the force of law.
Pasa lo siguiente: lo que acaba de suceder en materia climática no es un caso inusual, en parte porque Trump no es un republicano inusual. Al actual Partido Republicano no le preocupa el fondo; no recaba pruebas ni hace análisis para formular o incluso justificar las posturas que adopta en sus políticas. Hay un desdén por los hechos y el pensamiento razonado, y cualquiera que trate de incorporar esas cosas al debate es un enemigo.
Even before the Trump-focused blame game started, Chief Justice Roberts was well on his way to becoming the political right's favorite punching bag. In a rambling speech on the Senate floor last month, Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee, defended the Republican refusal to move forward with President Obama's nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to fill the Supreme Court's vacant seat. Playing off an observation the chief justice had made shortly before Justice Antonin Scalia's unexpected death, to the effect that the Senate confirmation process had become unfortunately divisive and political, Senator Grassley said it was the Roberts court itself that was political. Physician, heal thyself, he said, and then offered this observation:
There's no deputy secretary of state, the official told me. There's no deputy secretary of defense. He ticked off an array of other unfilled positions, insisted that these gaps can't all be chalked up to some noble desire to shrink government and said that they pretty much prevent any meaningful follow-through on whatever bold ideas Kushner might hatch. Trump just thinks, 'Oh, yeah, Jared's in charge of that.' In charge of what? What's he running? You need a bureaucratic infrastructure.
SS: So you mean getting rid of the combat troops there now, or preclude sending any combat troops there in the future?
When Ms. Nixon first emerged on the scene in March, Mr. Cuomo had found himself seemingly responding to her every move. Her campaign gleefully branded it #TheCynthiaEffect, as he moved toward legalizing marijuana, for example, or presided over Democrats reuniting in Albany after years of division that had helped empower Republicans.
At the end of the year, your subsidies will be settled once you file your taxes. If you miscalculated and received too much in subsidies, you will have to repay the difference then.
So voters are right to believe that health care is very much an issue in the midterm elections. It may not be the most important thing at stake — there's a good case to be made that the survival of American democracy is on the line. But it's a very big deal.
Ms. Korey gave up her C.E.O. title after former employees told The Verge that she oversaw an abusive management system at Away, which created a firestorm on social media. She quickly apologized and said she would become executive chairman.
Fighting corruption is, indeed, an issue with cross-party support. In an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll last year, people ranked as the country's second most important issue reducing the influence of special interests and corruption in Washington.
Yeah, exactly. I mean, it wasn't a real test of whether the ideas could get bipartisan cooperation because McConnell did everything he could to prevent it. But I actually would sort of flip it around and say, what if Obama had come into office in 2009, riding 67 percent popularity with these enormous majorities and having 60 seats in the Senate? And he'd only need a majority to pass Obamacare. I would argue that that would have been much more effective at generating Republican cooperation than the need to get 60 votes. Because everybody would have taken it as a given that this bill was going to pass. And the only question was, what does it look like, and who gets to share credit for it? The idea that Republicans are going to work with him in the first place was based on the fact that there are Republicans like Senator Collins, Senator Snowe, maybe even Senator Grassley, who'd worked on healthcare all their careers, who had endorsed on the record ideas like the ones Obama introduced, and that they could be incentivized to work with him. But instead, because of the need to get 60 votes, they were incentivized in the other direction. Democrats are ultimately able to pass it, but barely, and Republicans were able to delay it as long as possible and make it as politically painful as possible. If Obama only needed a majority, he would have passed that thing by the summer.
In fact, Mr. Mulvaney — a founding member of the Freedom Caucus with an almost perfect conservative voting record — spent his six-year congressional career leading the charge against federal spending and borrowing, voting against everything from Hurricane Sandy relief to reopening the government after the 2013 shutdown.
Right. So I've identified pay-fors, and I lay out that if you want, you can get into it, and you've got a three-year period to be able to do it at a deeply subsidized price or at no price at all.
And the time they're spending together, the votes Lindsey Graham is casting for the Trump agenda.
The magical man-boy, Beto O'Rourke, has come back from his 40 days in the desert — vlogging, contemplating, floating in and out of a funk — to share his gifts.
Which is why it's important to place the blame where it belongs.

I'm not going to do names. That's enormously presumptuous.
But Bannon — Bannon is right about the Democrats. But if Trump is the one talking about race, that doesn't help him. Right? I mean we went through this with the midterm elections. Trump went out and talked up the border caravan and how the Democrats were going to let illegal aliens into the country as his closing argument. And there's no evidence that it worked. Trump is helped when the media elevates Ilhan Omar or A.O.C. as the face of the Democratic Party because they are far left. And I think most voters aren't remotely close to where they are. But if Trump is the one doing race talk, I think he's losing.
He was known as someone who was a truth-teller within his caucus.
You knew immediately that when you started working there that you would get health insurance because this was a union hotel, Ms. Hernandez said. She knew what it was like to be a member of a union in Mexico, where she was part of the government workers' union.
The reliance on an ad hoc system of budgeting has made it even more difficult for Congress to keep the nation's fiscal house in order. The continuing resolution passed by the House this week would have added about $30 billion to the national debt.
Look for marijuana to take another big step into the American mainstream. Voters in five states — California, Nevada, Arizona, Maine and Massachusetts — will decide whether to make recreational marijuana legal; if they all pass, that means that recreational marijuana will be legal in nine states. And four other states — Montana, North Dakota, Arkansas and Florida — will decide whether to legalize the use of medical marijuana.
And I don't think that's the right model.
• Trump administration officials say the move, combined with extended restrictions on new green cards, could bar a half-million foreign workers from the U.S. in the rest of this year.
The problem as I see it in the housing market, just picking that one, is we have a supply problem. The two big providers of housing from half a century ago just aren't there. So the developer that built the two-bedroom, one-bath house, garage converted to hold my three brothers for their bedroom, that developer is building McMansions today. And I'm not mad at him. That's where the profits are. And the federal government, as you know, now under current federal law, can't expand federal housing. It can only do replacement when it's taking it off the market. And if it takes it off the market and it doesn't replace it, then it shrinks even more. Housing deteriorates like anything else.
Of course, another self-funding billionaire — Tom Steyer — has had little success with the vast sums he has spent on his presidential campaign. With more than $150 million spent in television ads, Mr. Steyer placed seventh in Iowa, sixth in New Hampshire and fifth in Nevada. But Mr. Steyer, who has never held elected office before, started the race with slightly less name recognition than Mr. Bloomberg, and he focused heavily on early voting states.
Ms. Harris's background as a prosecutor is woven into her identity as a presidential candidate. Her campaign's tagline is Kamala Harris For The People, which mimics what she used to say when appearing in court.
1. The Senate is stalled on a plan to stabilize an economy racked by the coronavirus.
Or three. I mean, how do you want to count it? [LAUGHTER] One is to reduce the cost for families on the first day. I mean, the cost savings doesn't come in on the first day, but you sign the papers that need to be done, so you reduce costs on the first day. The second is to give people the opportunity to be in Medicare if they want, anyone who's 50 or older, and expand the coverage for Medicare. It's to offer Medicare for all complete health care coverage to everyone else who wants it.
An expert on college affordability at the Urban Institute told The Times that Senator Warren's $50,000 debt clearance is too much. Setting the level at $10,000 instead would relieve debt for a third of all borrowers, according to their analysis.
On the domestic side it, something I have often thought about the post-Civil-Rights-Act Republican Party is that it was a party that harnessed a lot of the energy in the politics of white resentment or white frustration with a changing society and a federal government that was, in many cases, helping those changes along. And it harnessed that energy for, strangely, tax cuts for rich people, corporate deregulation, that there was a way in which the party was very much one thing in the base and then a very much another at the elite level. And you could always see this in polling. I mean, Paul Ryan was Speaker of the House, and you would see this polling that base Republicans wanted to raise taxes on rich people. They wanted a higher minimum wage. They wanted more spending on programs for the poor. How much of what we're seeing is that different structural changes in the parties, in the media ecosphere have allowed those things to be decoupled and so forces that, at one point, the party elite or structures were able to hold in check have just begun to predominate? They're able to get their candidates in through primaries. They're able to get their message out through social media. And so what we're seeing now is what always was there, and it's that thin layer that was restraining it or rechanneling it is what has changed?
It was Mr. Hutchinson's Democratic predecessor, Mike Beebe, who got the state's Republican-controlled legislature to expand Medicaid by using federal funds to buy private insurance for the poor. Mr. Hutchinson said in the interview that he wanted to continue the expansion here, but that if the federal government stopped paying most of the cost as the health law requires, we'll just have to look at it again.
From The New York Times, I'm Michael Barbaro. This is The Daily. Today, President Trump has backed away from his call to replace the Affordable Care Act with a Republican alternative. Alex Burns on why the president's own party talked him out of it. It's Wednesday, April 3.
This cycle, even Democrats running in red states are unapologetically putting health care at the center of their campaign messages. There's a reason: Republican efforts to overhaul the health care system last year were deeply unpopular.
Well, I think there's this strange and amorphous thing in a free society called the mainstream culture. And the mainstream culture is that part of the culture that doesn't take itself to be explicitly on one side or another but that it's just the arena in which a lot of our arguments happen and a lot of our public life happens. And I think what we've found in the last more than half century is certainly a transformation of a lot of mainstream institutions in the direction of the left. Now, that's happened in the culture, in Hollywood, music. I think you could certainly see that happening in mainstream journalism, where a lot of the core mainstream institutions are just more expressly on the left than they used to be. And creating alternatives to these is quite a challenge. There's certainly a lively think-tank culture on the right in Washington, but it's a tiny culture. I mean, the think-tank culture, in general, is quite small. And the right has always had some presence in that culture because, in some ways, think tanks have always been more on the right or more on the left. And AEI is not a new institution in response to the contemporary changes in political culture. It was created in the 1930s. And so it has been very hard to actually create alternative institutions at the core. To start a new elite university is not a simple matter. It's not unimaginable. There are people who have thought about it.
When I was a girl, you had a better than 50/50 chance of doing better than your parents. Today, that seems to be slipping under a 1-in-10 chance. Opportunity is shifting away from not just the poor kids. It's shifting away from everybody who's not born into the top. And sure, a few people roll the dice and make it big and we should celebrate that, but it's like this fundamental question of who we're going to be as a country. And yeah, I do fight for a lot of things. I fight for a big vision, but if we don't start there, if we start by compromising, if we start by saying, Hey, everybody line up. We're going to knock 2 cents off your student loan debt, who's showing up for that?
According to the complaint, Health Insurance Innovations participated in a scheme involving Simple Health, another Florida company, whose agents sold them the flimsy coverage.

In December, former Vice President Joe Biden said that he would consider choosing Senator Warren as his running mate and wondered whether she would choose him. The Senator, for her part, has suggested she might prefer a woman.

Well, actually, you're going to have to explain to me what Andrew was — if I'm going to have to argue back against Andrew, you're going to have to tell me exactly what Andrew's argument is.
I would say that, in 2016, Donald Trump managed to stomp a lot of Republican politicians in that primary, who, even if they're a little bit more stuck in an older version of Republican Party orthodoxy, did approach politics more in that way. They did have policy ideas. They wanted to be constructive. Marco Rubio, even then, was trying to begin breaking with some parts of Republican Party orthodoxy or conservative orthodoxy to try to come up with a slightly more working-class agenda. And Trump just won. And there were a lot of tributaries to that victory, and some of them were the media coverage he's able to command and so on. But he was also right that much of the Republican base wanted to have this fight over who rules and wanted to have more of a fight over what kind of country America is. So when I look now at the Republican Party in Congress, I see a lot more learning of that lesson than I do of any policy lesson. I was very, very disturbed that such a large majority of the House Republican conference voted against certifying the electoral college results, even after all that happened on that day. You had these stories of Republicans down there in the safe space not putting on masks. There is a real re-centering of this politics of pure fight than you had before.
Here is a perhaps useful suggestion for Republicans in Congress. The next time they need to do an easy routine task, like naming a new post office, they should label the bill as The Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act.
A government plan, even a Medicare buy-in, could shrink the number of customers buying policies on the Obamacare markets, making them less appealing for leading insurers, according to many health insurers, policy analysts and even some Democrats.
How can I avoid medical debt?
Yes. And I think I am less worried than some about, yes, you know, elevating the profile of these four women is just what Trump wanted, in part because the symbol of the Democratic Party in 2020 is going to be the Democratic nominee, who's not going to be one of these four women. But there are also a lot of people in this country for who they are an inspiration. You know, there's a lot of new voters. There's a lot of young voters. Those are the people I think, in many cases, who are going to be knocking on doors and giving a campaign its kind of cultural vitality. And so not only do you need these four women, you also need the perception that the party supports them. It doesn't mean that the party supports everything that they do, but you certainly don't need a House speaker who's out there elevating her fights with these four women in public and kind of seeking to publicly denigrate and marginalize them.
Last week's setback on health care revealed the limits of an inexperienced White House, but one person has emerged as an effective wingman for a president short on help: Vice President Mike Pence.
And health care was something that they considered including in the package of reforms at that time when they made social security and a lot of these other programs, but it was too controversial, and it actually dropped out of that proposal.
Under the current rule, issued in late 2016 by the Obama administration, short-term insurance cannot last for more than three months, as it was meant to be a stopgap. Under the new rule, the limit would be 364 days, and insurers would be allowed, but not required, to extend policies. The maximum duration, including any extensions, would be 36 months.
Mara Gay: Actually, that's a perfect point for me to just ask you a question that's related. My family is from Michigan, and U.A.W. workers. One of the last things that they really love, many of them, is their health care. So I guess my question is, is both a practical one and a political one, which is why not try and expand health care access without actually taking away programs that people already like? Is there a way to do that? Is there even a way to get to what you're talking about without talking about it in such dogmatic political terms, and how do you — this is I guess the most important part of the question, I think, is how do you make the pitch to a U.A.W. worker that what you can offer is actually better than what they already have?
Given the size of California — the nation's most populous state with nearly 40 million people — approval there alone would be a milestone in the movement toward legalized pot, and no matter that federal law still outlaws it. Voters there narrowly defeated an initiative that would have made pot legal in 2010, but it is back on the ballot now with polls suggesting it is heading for an easy win, particularly in a high-turnout presidential election year.
One of them is use march-in orders on prescription drugs. We can bring down the cost of EpiPens and insulin and other drugs, so that we save families literally hundreds of millions of dollars. It can be done without Mitch McConnell. The power is already there. You've just got to be willing to pick it up and use it. Nobody else has talked about picking it up and using it.
Researchers found more evidence that the variant from South Africa can evade antibodies. Vials of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' antibody treatment Credit... Regeneron, via Associated Press The monoclonal antibody treatment made by Eli Lilly is powerless against a variant of the coronavirus discovered in South Africa, according to a new study posted online on Tuesday. In addition, one of two monoclonal antibodies in a cocktail treatment made by Regeneron also is significantly less effective against that variant, although the combination still works, researchers at Columbia University reported. The findings underscore growing concerns that because of new mutations in its genetic material, this variant, called B.1.351, may be able to resist antibodies contained in these treatments and perhaps those created by the body following vaccination. Dr. David Ho, an infectious disease expert at Columbia University, and his colleagues also tested the monoclonal antibody therapies against the coronavirus variant discovered in Britain. The therapies were reported to be just as effective as they had been against earlier versions of the virus. But the variant in South Africa was a different story. Activity of the monoclonal antibody made by Eli Lilly, and one of the two made by Regeneron, was completely or markedly abolished when tested against the variant, Dr. Ho and his colleagues found. A third variant identified in Brazil shares many mutations with B.1.351 and is expected to behave similarly, Dr. Ho said.
So with the Affordable Care Act, once again, the concept of government-run health care is proposed and ultimately tossed aside.
's executive branch, the European Commission, set a goal of having 70 percent of its population inoculated by this summer. Four days later the president of the European Council, Charles Michel, pronounced that difficult. By this week, a mere 2 percent of E.U. citizens had received at least one dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to numbers collected by Our World in Data. That figure was around 40 percent for Israel, 11 percent for Britain and just over 6 percent for the United States. The vaccine shortages in the European Union come against a backdrop of crisis. The second wave of the virus is still raging second wave of the coronavirus amid prolonged lockdowns in most member countries and anxiety over the spread of at least two highly infectious variants of the virus that are bringing national health systems to their knees yet again. In a rare bit of good news, the French drugmaker Sanofi said Wednesday that it would help produce more than 100 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, starting this summer, but those doses will most likely come too late to salvage vaccination plans for the first half of 2021. Some critics have blamed the European Commission for the mess. The commission struck deals on behalf of the member states to secure a total of 2.3 billion vaccine doses from several companies. But some of its agreements lagged behind those struck by the United States and Britain by weeks.

Lindsey Graham has certainly ascended to the role of one of Donald Trump's two or three closest advisers on the Hill. The backdrop to this, though, is that Lindsey Graham's best friend, John McCain, is going through a very, very public, difficult illness. And Donald Trump basically didn't let up at all. He was still criticizing John McCain for his vote against the Affordable Care Act repeal of 2017. But also, John McCain, through his office, even through his illness, was not shy about criticizing Donald Trump for things like Helsinki, Charlottesville. And Donald Trump was not one to let this lie and was going to bash John McCain right back. So you had this situation where Lindsey Graham and the president were becoming very close and public friends, whereas John McCain was dying a very, very slow and tragic and public death. So I think people began to ask this question, what was going on with Lindsey Graham, in maybe a more personal framework, because John McCain and he were known to be so close, and John McCain, obviously, was very sick.
They're big people. I know their names very well, from watching business and studying business all my life, said Trump.
If you are a giant multinational corporation and any regulation comes along that you don't like, the local country raises the minimum — we've actually seen this — raises its environmental standards, you get to sue them to get them to drop those standards. And who will your case be heard by? It'll be heard by a handful of corporate lawyers, who when they're not sitting on this arbitration panel are working for big law firms that are doing work for you or other multinational corporations like you. That's one set of how the path will run.
The city will provide low-interest loans of up to $100,000 to roughly 2,000 small businesses, according to the mayor's plan. But Mr. de Blasio has also warned that the city is facing major budget cuts and layoffs. He recently announced that the city's property tax revenues are projected to decline by $2.5 billion next year, driven by a drop in the value of office buildings and hotel properties that have emptied out during the pandemic. Mr. de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo have expressed optimism that President Biden, along with a Democratic-led Congress, will bring substantial assistance to the city. Mr. de Blasio also called for higher taxes on wealthy New Yorkers in his speech — a policy he has pushed for years, but that Mr. Cuomo has opposed. Mr. de Blasio noted that more than 100 billionaires in the state increased their net worth by billions of dollars during the pandemic and called again for a redistribution of wealth. There is clearly enough money in New York to invest in a fair and fast recovery — it's just in the wrong hands, he said.

The Republican Party has essentially tied itself to a magical solution: getting rid of the law while keeping its benefits. The party does seem committed to repealing major parts of the law early in 2017, as Nicholas Bagley of the University of Michigan laid out in a smart tweetstorm yesterday. Yet Republicans could cause a lot of anger and frustration if they stick to their plan.
Stephen Colbert crowed about the news, reminding viewers that Republicans have repeatedly been unable to come up with a successful plan to replace the health care bill that they spent years criticizing under President Barack Obama.

I think we need to get our combat troops out. I don't think that combat is advancing the interests of the United States in the Middle East, and it's time to end combat operations. Of course we'll have a continuing presence in the Middle East. We have interests in the Middle East with our allies. We have interests in the Middle East and keeping shipping lanes open, and we will continue to have a presence there, but I don't think combat troops are how we best advance that presence.

Roughly 50 percent of Pennsylvania's population supports the fracking industry.
I'd say to the extent that conservative voters and writers are paying any attention to it, it's been largely positive. But conservative politicians have, as you note, been standoffish. There hasn't been a ton of criticism, but not a ton of interest either. And I suspect a lot of people are just hanging back and waiting to see how this develops and where it goes. Partly, it's gotten wrapped into the whole COVID relief debate, since Romney is trying to affect the outcome of that. But I imagine — if we assume that he's not going to get his way completely on this, this will be a continuing issue going forward. And we'll see if it takes off.

John Broder: We have combat troops in Syria now fighting ISIS.
The lack of optimism in contemporary liberal and centrist thinking opens the door to Trump-style demagogy, since if the country really is going to hell, we do indeed need walls. And because optimism has lost its standing in American public opinion, past reforms — among them environmental protection, anti-discrimination initiatives, income security for seniors, auto and aviation safety, interconnected global economics, improved policing and yes, Obamacare — don't get credit for the good they have accomplished.

It would be an exaggeration to say that the Democratic primary race is entirely about health care, but only a little bit of one. The standout moment from the first evening was Elizabeth Warren's vociferous defense of eliminating private insurance companies, and much of the first half of last night's debate was consumed with the issue as well. The candidates onstage were eager to recommend their plans and elaborate on their differences: Perhaps more than any other issue, this was one on which the different policy ideas in play were clear. Democrats were offering voters choices.
It's so good, and I think it's great because it's not a happy tale. And I think it really gets into that ambivalence that you feel as a child and helping think through some of the tougher parts of childhood. But it's been a big hit for both our kids. And it's definitely my favorite.
The race even in retrospect, is a little odd, because in one way it was not tight. It was a more comfortable margin for Biden than say, the 2000 race for the Republicans. But at the same time you look at three states where if you switched what, 22,000 votes in the right places, Trump would have gotten the election kicked into the house, where Republicans would have had a majority of state delegations and he would then have won. So in that sense it was pretty tight, and you do have to look at small things that could have made a difference. So, even though most people's opinions were pretty baked in and there wasn't a whole lot of fluctuation in public opinion about Donald Trump throughout his entire presidency. I think that could have made a difference. Definitely could have made a difference in the Senate. There are a number of other things that you could point to like, what if Trump's policies on COVID had been basically the same, but he just carried on a little bit less like a maniac about it, had done the bare minimum of being a reassuring figure when he spoke about it? What if he hadn't discouraged mail-in voting? That might have been enough.
Do you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn't like me? Trump tweeted just after the immigration decision was handed down. I merely get the impression that a majority of the justices are sane.
His remarks about Mr. Sanders on Wednesday amounted to some of his most sustained criticism of his rival to date, part of an energetic performance in which Mr. Biden was by turns punchy — when discussing politics — and emotional, such as when he discussed grief or cancer.

This cycle, even Democrats running in red states are unapologetically putting health care at the center of their campaign messages. There's a reason: Republican efforts to overhaul the health care system last year were deeply unpopular.
Well, I think the cause and effect doesn't necessarily work in that direction. We're certainly in a very divided time. And we are in, as you say, a hyper-competitive political environment in a sense that control of Congress and the presidency is up for grabs in just about every election now in a way that we may have become used to over the last 30 years, but is actually pretty unusual over the range of American history. And the question is, is that going to get resolved by empowering small minorities to exercise more power, or is that going to get resolved by requiring more work across these party lines? I don't think either of those would look clean and easy and fun. I don't think we get rid of heated political debates either way. The question is, what gives us a chance to arrive at a more legitimate and a more sustainable set of political arrangements. And I think that requiring a party that has just barely a majority in the Senate to get a small portion of the other members to agree with something significant it wants to do is a good idea, if you're trying to advance public policy that's going to have a relatively broad range of public support. Now, I do think the filibuster is overused, and there are probably ways to constrain its use by making it a little harder to use.
Republican lawmakers cite rising premiums as a main reason for repealing the Affordable Care Act.
Oh, right, Steve Daines, yeah, he went on a sort of America, love it or leave it kind of thing. Yeah. But I think, in general, the Republican response is either a kind of condemnation, like the one Romney gave that is not as strenuous as it should be, or a kind of let's pretend Trump didn't say that and just say, yeah, Trump's right that it's bad that these Democrats are socialists.
It's a scary thing to go back and know you have low immunity, she said in mid-May, after two days back at her job. But when it all boils down to it, I don't think Covid-19 is going away any time soon. I don't think you can hide from it. You've got to trust God and go back.
I'm sort of interested that both of you seem to think that both the health care case and the racist tweets are basically bad for Trump from a political perspective.
Mm-hmm. One of the most vulnerable population to this deadly virus. And they start dropping off, informing their local jurisdictions that they don't think that they want to participate in the scheduled election.

Every Republican analysis of the midterm elections concluded that they lost the House because of health care more than any other individual policy issue. So if you are Kevin McCarthy, the new House minority leader, you are just appalled at the idea that your members are now going to have to have this fight all over again.
John Broder: We have combat troops in Syria now fighting ISIS.
I want to draw out a move that was made in that era, but before I do, I want to note something. Because there's a slight bit to that I disagree with you on. And it goes back to our budget reconciliation discussion earlier. We still do have two classes of legislation. And so for people who think this is not the world we live in now, one thing I do want to note is that all kinds of civil rights legislation that needs to be passed now — the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, the For the People Act, which has all kinds of automatic voter registration and voter protection and amplifies small donor donations six to one, so you begin to rid big money of its control of politics — that will all get filibustered. DC statehood to enfranchise DC, which is primarily African-American voters, cannot pass because of the filibuster. But the Trump tax cuts could pass because he only needed 51 votes. You could repeal Obamacare because you only needed 51 votes. They didn't get it, but they could have. There's still tracking. And I mean, it hits all kinds of different things now, so it's not the way it was before, where it's just civil rights issues. But I do want to note that civil rights issues remain subject to a much higher threshold than, say, a corporate tax cut.
At age 19, Senator Warren married her high school sweetheart, a computer engineer, Jim Warren. She gave up a full scholarship to George Washington University for the marriage, and they later split in part because he didn't support her career ambitions.
I really wonder if that room for compromise is actually there, and I mean that in this way. I can really track the divisions on the Democratic side around policy. I can really tell you which part of the party is supporting Medicare For All and which part isn't, and it's a real difference. It's going to lead them to do different things and in different ways. And the Republican Party, my background and my present, I guess, is as a policy reporter. You and I used to have lunch and argue about Medicare For All for long periods of time. I often feel, particularly through the Trump era, that when I'm trying to track Republican Party policy divides, I'm tracking something that both is there and isn't. It is there rhetorically, and people will talk in different ways. You'll have a Josh Hawley or a Tom Cotton or a Marco Rubio or Tucker Carlson give pretty interesting speeches — and a Donald Trump, in his own way, in 2016. And then when it comes time to govern, there's a lot less there, that the policy is much more symbolic than it is anything else and that trying to follow the Republican Party this way and trying to then assess what they might compromise on or not just doesn't end up working out because that's not the beating heart of it.
And on the socialism side, even though this was largely a private market program, it still was susceptible to those kinds of criticisms. And we heard Republicans talking about it as a government takeover, talking about as a socialist plot.
If you've tuned in to the N.F.L. playoffs or the Golden Globes, or even tried to watch a Minecraft video on YouTube, you've probably seen Bloomberg's ad about health care. The 60-second TV spot begins with creepy music that sounds as if it were borrowed from a horror-movie soundtrack and footage of Trump saying things like Obamacare is a complete and total disaster and Let Obamacare implode. The music then turns upbeat, and a narrator touts Bloomberg's health-care-related accomplishments as New York's mayor: lowering the number of uninsured and infant mortality rates, increasing life expectancy. There's a multi­racial cast of smiling professionals in scrubs and white coats, pushing happy patients in wheelchairs and checking the heartbeats of adorable toddlers.
This is what passes for principle in high Republican circles.
And right out of the gates, Donald Trump insults John McCain.
These policies have moved forward easily and with little opposition. The health care industry has generally supported the changes because private health plans typically pay higher prices to doctors and hospitals. Democrats who support expanding public coverage generally describe these changes as low-hanging fruit — the changes they could accomplish quickly to expand coverage.
Hell of a busy time for concerned citizens. Donald Trump just kicked off his re-election campaign, leaving his supporters cheering while less enthusiastic citizens kept yelling That's just not true! at the television.
Every Republican analysis of the midterm elections concluded that they lost the House because of health care more than any other individual policy issue. So if you are Kevin McCarthy, the new House minority leader, you are just appalled at the idea that your members are now going to have to have this fight all over again.
The tension between incremental and transformative change has been a feature of the 2020 campaign. Mr. Obama, for instance, weighed in to say that the typical American doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system, an implicit critique of Senator Warren's and Senator Sanders's campaigns.
That sure gets a lot done.
That he's up front about what this is and what it isn't and the degree to which this is an opportunistic transactional relationship.
Actually, I've done 175 stump speeches and I've talked about it in every one of them. You all haven't covered it. I talk about three things that I think we need to do ——

But surprise — a raft of new polls show that some of the most hard-core Trumpsters are starting to get a clue. I know, hold your applause. It's like discovering that climate change is not a hoax when your town is under water, and all your commander in chief can do is throw you a roll of paper towels. And the woke among the true believers is small.
This is our chance to turn that one around.
Clinton: We need to do our part on refugees. It's brave for a politician say that at a time when there is such fear of refugees. — Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) 10 Oct 16
I think her vote is wildly unpopular among constituents in the district, Mr. Brindisi said. And what adds insult to injury is that she celebrated her vote by snapping selfies of herself at the White House, gleefully cheering a vote that would take health insurance away from thousands of her constituents.
I like markets. I believe that capitalism can produce enormous value. But capitalism without rules is theft, and one of those rules should be progressive taxation. Everybody pays their fair share. And one of those rules should be you don't get to crush the opposition. That's not how markets work. And that's a battle we had at the end of the 1800s and into the early 1900s, and it's a battle we need to have again. The giants have grown and they exercise so much economic power, but they also exercise too much political power.
New health insurance options aren't the only thing that has changed since the passage of the Affordable Care Act. A strengthening economy has nudged more Americans into the work force, increasing people's access to health insurance at work.
But it's not going to be real change because so long as the lobbyists are writing it, so long as they're the ones who are in the ears of the folks in the House and the Senate, we're just going to keep making little, tiny changes, and I just don't think we can keep doing that.
It's still very early, but Joe Biden has emerged as the clear front-runner for the Democratic nomination. Bernie Sanders is in second place, although he appears to be fairly far behind, and one poll shows him in a statistical tie with Elizabeth Warren. So what should we think about the men currently leading the field?
So when Republicans say they're disgusted by Trump's ignorance and indecency but love his deregulations and tax reforms — those very sanitized words — this is what they love: taking huge fiscal and environmental risks — effectively throwing away our bumpers and spare tires that we may soon need to drive through the next financial or climate storm — for a short-term economic and political high.
What is the reaction from Republicans in Congress?

Yes. I do think that the Europeans need to bear a significant share of the cost of defense of Europe. I don't think that hectoring or embarrassing them is a way to get there. I think we get there by talking about the ways that work best for them on the ground, but I do think it's important. It's an important partnership, and it should be a partnership.
Murkowski is one of only a handful of Republican senators who have shown some degree of independence from Trump. The Republican dissenters fall into a few categories. There are the critics, the most vociferous of whom are Jeff Flake and Bob Corker, both senators who are not running for re-election. There are the strayers, among them Murkowski and Collins, who have criticized Trump and also voted against him on major legislation. Rand Paul, the staunch libertarian, votes with Trump less often than any other Republican senator, but he has also gone out of his way to defend him. Lindsey Graham votes with the president slightly more often than Murkowski and Collins, but he joins them in yet another category: the pragmatists. Those senators have staked out the now-controversial position that they would rather get something done than nothing, even if it means compromising with Democrats. Murkowski, who has exercised her independence in all three ways, has nonetheless managed to bring back to her state its most long-desired spoils — more opportunities for drilling and more opportunities for building in previously protected wilderness.
Senator Warren's Medicare for all would require $20.5 trillion in new federal spending over the next 10 years. She has promised the money won't come from raising taxes on the middle class and maintains that between defense cuts and a wealth tax, the costs would be covered. But of course, that would require Senate approval — and Senator McConnell has sworn it won't happen as long as I'm majority leader.
I serve the people who created Obamacare, people who treat epidemics and devise ways to make the world healthier and more humane. But I can't afford the health care plan Harvard wants us to accept.
I disagreed with them. So for example, the Trans-Pacific Partnership had a robust investor state dispute resolution mechanism, which multiple of our trade treaties have had for decades now. And I just think that's fundamentally wrong. It's a two-tier system that says, in effect, we'll make a bunch of promises in a trade deal on the environment, on use of prison labor, child labor and on anything else, and then we'll give two entirely different enforcement mechanisms.
I serve the people who created Obamacare, people who treat epidemics and devise ways to make the world healthier and more humane. But I can't afford the health care plan Harvard wants us to accept.
The 142-page bill would create a new system of federal tax credits to help people buy health insurance, while offering states the ability to drop many of the benefits required by the Affordable Care Act, like maternity care, emergency services and mental health treatment.
The authorities have demanded that people visiting rural areas during the holiday spend two weeks in quarantine and pay for their own coronavirus tests. Many migrants, who endure grueling jobs for meager wages in big cities, say those restrictions make it impossible to travel. The rollout of the rules has drawn widespread criticism in China, with many people calling the approach unfair to migrant workers, who have long been treated as second-class citizens under China's strict household registration system. The workers have been among the most deeply affected by the pandemic, as the authorities have carried out scattered lockdowns to fight the virus and employers have reduced hours and pay. In a regular year, hundreds of millions of people travel by plane, train and car to be with their families for the Lunar New Year. The holiday, which typically includes big festive banquets and fireworks, is normally the only time that many workers can return to their hometowns to see loved ones. This year, many are making plans to spend the holiday alone. Javier C. Hernández and
And am I right to think that both of you expect that, however it happens at the appeals court level or the Supreme Court level, Obamacare will survive?
Essentially, we are getting rid of Obamacare, Mr. Trump said, reminding a cheering crowd that the individual mandate that required most people to have health insurance or pay a penalty was scrapped as part of the Republican tax bill he signed into law last year. Some people would say, essentially, we have gotten rid of it.
One high point in the we-love-business Trumpathon came when the president brought up Mike Lindell, the head of MyPillow. (Boy do you sell those pillows.) Lindell then launched into a short infomercial for his company, followed by a eulogy to Trump as the man who had rescued a nation that had turned its back on God. It wasn't inspiring, but it was definitely a break in the routine.
Still, the core idea in the Green New Deal is one shared by the left and the establishment center-left. (Remember that Markey, who is hardly a socialist, also had his name on the Obama-era cap-and-trade bill.) Even Nordhaus says, I laud the spirit of the Green New Deal. The idea also happens to be popular with the public, polls show. Most voters support clean energy and, after four decades of slow-growing living standards, also support federal action to create good jobs.
With the Iowa caucuses less than a month away, Democrats need to move beyond the Medicare for all fixation. Enough time has been spent bickering over the particulars of an electorally risky proposal that is unlikely to come to pass, no matter who wins the White House.
The Sanders plan would increase federal spending by about $32.6 trillion over its first 10 years, according to a Mercatus Center study that Blahous led. Compare that with the Congressional Budget Office's projection for the entire 2019 fiscal year budget, $4.4 trillion. That kind of sticker shock is why a plan for single-payer in Vermont collapsed in 2014 and why Colorado voters overwhelmingly rejected one in 2016. It's why legislators in California killed one. In this plan, the taxes are upfront, the purported savings are down the line.
— that they were finally able to pass legislation that established the program that we now call Medicare.
JI: So this is an incremental plan that you've talked about, right? So your first hundred days you have essentially two health care plans, right? You have one that — would enact ——
Which is pretty much what happened here. Despite their ceaseless attacks on the health care act since Mr. Obama signed it into law in March 2010, Mr. Trump, Mr. Ryan and their colleagues have never had a workable plan that could gain the support of a congressional majority. That is why they rushed their turkey of a bill to the floor without going through the laborious process of holding hearings and building coalitions. The last-minute wheeling and dealing did nothing to disguise the bill's underlying and increasingly obvious purpose, which was to reduce taxes for the wealthy by cutting benefits for the needy.
The dividing line, the litmus test that helps people to see if they are on the right or the left seems to be changing. When I came to Washington now probably 17 years ago, because I've become an old man, or 15 years ago, how you felt about Grover Norquist's tax pledge really told you whether or not you were a Republican or a Democrat. You really could tell everybody almost based on that. Economic issues were the locus of party competition, and social issues and views were much more mixed in between the parties. And that seems to me to have changed, not that literally Republicans are voting for a bunch of tax increases in Congress. They're not. But in terms of where the energy in the party is, in terms of where the energy between the party is, it seems to me, it's moved much more towards the issues of civil rights, of demographic change, of LGBTQ rights, of gender issues, of what people broadly categorize as social issues. And I do think that has changed some of the elite lining up. I would say that a lot of corporate America is still quite fiscally conservative, so to speak. There's not a lot of great statements in support of Medicare For All or some other kind of single-payer health care or cutting the child poverty rate by half, all kinds of things that I think of as very, very, very important questions within our political sphere.
Proponents want to sweep away our complex, confusing, profit-driven mess of a health care system and start fresh with a single government-run insurer that would cover everyone.
Gail: Sorry, the theory about president-gets-to-pick was demolished by Mitch McConnell in 2016 when he refused to allow President Obama's nominee, the totally qualified Merrick Garland, to even come up for a vote — or even, really, a discussion. In fact McConnell bragged that telling the president you will not fill the Supreme Court vacancy was one of the proudest days of his life.
archived recording A federal judge in Texas has just struck down Obamacare. True story. Judge Reed O'Connor says the individual mandate, the part of the law that requires you to participate, is unconstitutional. And because it cannot be separated from the rest of the law, which it cannot be, the entire law is invalid.
You do what you can with 50 votes to offer people what's possible. And then when lots of people get experience with it and they say, I like this, this works for me, then we vote on it and everybody gets better off and gets to try it. I think that's what's going to happen on Medicare for all. In fact, I think that is the way that we can solve our health care problems.
Insurers are threatening to exit the Affordable Care Act's market unless the Trump administration and Congress can quickly clarify their intentions: Will they support the existing public marketplaces, encourage people to sign up and keep federal assistance flowing to insurers, or not?
Schultz's politics are to the left of mine, but I would vote for someone like him in a heartbeat if the other names on the ballot are Trump and, say, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren. Isn't candidate diversity supposed to be something liberals believe in?
If you are a giant multinational corporation and any regulation comes along that you don't like, the local country raises the minimum — we've actually seen this — raises its environmental standards, you get to sue them to get them to drop those standards. And who will your case be heard by? It'll be heard by a handful of corporate lawyers, who when they're not sitting on this arbitration panel are working for big law firms that are doing work for you or other multinational corporations like you. That's one set of how the path will run.
This is not a partisan statement. One of us is a Republican, the other a Democrat. We differ on many policies, including health care reform.
This liberal astigmatism — our belief that history is a story of racial progress, and our faith in our own empathy — makes Eduardo Porter's American Poison a tough read. It is a learned, well-written but relentless survey of social science studies on the racial polarization, animosity and social fragmentation of American life. A black or Hispanic American reader is likely to finish Porter's summary of the evidence and say, So what else is new? For a white liberal, the book leaves many an illusion in tatters.
It's both capped in terms of the number of dollars, and it's capped in terms of the income.
It puts him in direct conflict with Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and others who back a single-payer Medicare for all plan. Mr. Sanders has led the charge to eliminate most private health insurance as part of his proposal, though other Democrats running for president have said they would seek to retain a private-insurance structure.
Under the proposal, the Trump administration would have offered more waivers to states, so they could devise and run their own health programs with federal money that would otherwise be available under the Affordable Care Act.
Tell me, are you really feeling more secure today?
But I get it. There are right now, Democrats against Democrats on this. But understand this, we'll get into a general election. Oh, I know what the insurance industry will want to do. I know what Donald Trump will want to do. But the truth is we're going to have the party who tried to take away health care from 35 million Americans, said it was O.K. to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions and is continuing to follow that right now, both in their lawsuits and in their agency practices, and millions of people have lost their health care.
JB: And leave the Kurds to their fate?
The possible costs of the Democratic candidates' commitment to decriminalization of border crossing are evident in a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll conducted July 15-17. It found that all voters oppose decriminalization by better than two to one, 66-27.
During a 10-day break for the Supreme Court in April 2012, several justices left Washington to give lectures or take short vacations. But both John Roberts and Anthony Kennedy remained in Washington, and Roberts used the time to try to win over Kennedy on Obamacare.
And I don't think that the argument that therefore, we should eliminate the protections for large minorities in the rules of the Senate and allow these temporary majorities to make big changes in how we govern ourselves, it doesn't seem to me like the right way to respond to this moment of intense division. I do think that we can think about other changes in the institution, in Congress. It seems to me that, as I said, there needs to be less centralization so that more questions are on the table. I think there's room for electoral reform, for ways of expanding the electorate, and that would help both parties in ways that I think are not entirely clear right now to both parties' politicians. The 2020 elections has a lot of lessons on that front. It turned out, there were 10 million more Republican voters than the Republican Party thought there were, and it was only mail-in voting that brought them out. I think there are ways of bringing more people into the system that could allow us to break the logjam, in some respects. But to focus on the fact of minority protections on the limits on majoritarianism as the key that holds us back from having a clearer set of political divisions or a dominant political majority or a clear direction for the country, I don't think that's really how the causation flows here.
In Arizona, Michigan and Nevada, Steyer's group was trying to put a simple question in front of voters: Should their state use more clean energy? According to the polls that Foser and his NextGen colleagues studied, as many as 80 percent of Americans say yes to that question.
But the Democratic Party, Grossmann and Isaac argue, is not aligned with business preferences or affluent preferences in any domain — and actually represents middle-class views over affluent views on economic policy.
Indeed, all of these things surely played a role in GOP health care strategy. But at this point they've clearly lost the political argument. In 2017, Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare made it clear to everyone that their party didn't have any better ideas, and never did; everything they proposed would have devastated the lives of millions.
MC: And there is a good question. How do you do that if Mitch McConnell still holds that Senate?
You're asking the fundamental question about how you break them up. This was the question for Standard Oil. How did they break up Standard Oil? They ended up doing it actually by geography back in those days, but that's obviously a very different world from the world we live in right now.
KK: Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
Times columnist David Brooks noted in The Road to Character that Ms. Perkins discovered her calling to service and organizing after witnessing the 1911 Triangle Shirtwaist fire. The analogy to something like the student loan debt crisis or child care, of course, isn't perfect — the debt crisis, for instance, has been slow burning as tuition rates have risen far above the inflation rate since the 1970s.
At this point it's alarmingly easy to see how the United States could follow the path already taken by Hungary, becoming a democracy on paper but an authoritarian one-party state in practice. And I'm not talking about the distant future: It could happen this year, if Trump wins re-election — or even, potentially, if he loses but refuses to accept the results.
But that brings us to the second problem.
In a state where approval of President Trump is near the country's highest, Mr. Manchin, a Democrat, was once thought to be deeply endangered in his re-election this year. But the 71-year-old incumbent, who likes to say Washington sucks, has a 7- to 10-point polling edge over his Republican opponent, Patrick Morrisey. A lot can happen before Election Day, but for now, he is the envy of other red-state Democrats as the parties wrestle over control of the Senate.
I don't know individual employees there. What I know is the power of that place and how they're using it right now. Well —
I would encourage someone who is looking for coverage just for a catastrophic need to really read the fine print, said Claire McAndrew, the director of campaigns and partnerships at Families USA. They often contain complicated exclusions that your average consumer could never predict.
The importance of a grass-roots movement is there is one thing that beats fake news, and actually the data showed this, and that's somebody you know. It's somebody who actually talks to you. It's somebody who does the face to face. It's somebody who reaches out. It's somebody who knocks on your door. It's your neighbor. It's the person who talks to you in line at the grocery store. That's part of it. It's why you have to build — when I did inside/outside, it's also about the importance of building grass roots, building it from the ground up. It's why I made the decisions I made in running for president right from the beginning, which we can talk about in a minute. But for me, that's at the heart of it, and then there's a second part. I'll push first to get the anti-corruption bill through. I'll push to deliver on a meaningful anti-corruption deal. I think you can get a lot of people on board for that, Democrats and Republicans to push for it. I dare you to vote against it, right? That is a fight I will have, and it will be a fight.
But depending on its design, a public option may well threaten the A.C.A. in unexpected ways.
Whether on tax reform, whether on repealing the Affordable Care Act — that was both in 2017, but into 2018 on foreign policy.
BS: Last question. What are you likely to fail at as president?
Did any of these Republican lawmakers take note of the Iranian naval exercise in the gulf in August ? The Iranians took some big old ships from the shah's days and said you will be the American Navy. And then they used swarming tactics to ravage those big ships — deploying scores of very small, cheap speedboats and kamikaze coastal craft, armed with light missiles and rocket-propelled grenades.
So the effect is that the promises that are put into trade agreements like T.P.P., they may all look the same on paper, but man, they are nowhere close to each other in terms of what happens with enforcement. Multinational corporations are given the opportunity basically to opt out of laws they don't like, where protections that are supposed to be written for our workers, for the worldwide environment, for human rights standards, just get left by the curb.
Another gap in funding the following year, when President Jimmy Carter took issue with a costly public works bill and defense spending, lasted 17 days.
Health Care. Universal medical coverage, whether expanding Obamacare with a public option or some form of Medicare for all, is going to happen. It's had majority support for some time. The pandemic has just sped up the timetable. One poll found that 41 percent of adults are now more likely than they were before the pandemic to support a government-run care system covering all Americans.
I mean, I don't think the Supreme Court is going to kill Obamacare.
The biggest factors affecting what happens in November, according to political science research, are not things like the speaker of the House but so-called fundamentals, like presidential approval, the state of the economy and the number of seats the majority party is defending. And the president's party is almost always likely to take a beating; in only three midterm elections since 1934 has the party controlling the White House gained seats. Mr. Ryan's retirement is not likely to break these trends.
A 2017 paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research found that generic competition has weakened in recent decades, leading to higher prices for generics. EpiPen and insulin prices, in particular, have skyrocketed. Senator Warren's Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act would authorize the government to manufacture active ingredients for medications or contract outside entities to manufacture generic drugs and lower prices. But Senator McConnell has railed against socialist price controls in the health care system.
People make too much of the word 'unprecedented,' but this was truly unprecedented, in how much money he spent, how quickly he spent it and how unopposed that money was, said Ken Goldstein, a professor of politics at the University of San Francisco.
You know, when I put together my anti-corruption plan, which is a big plan about the influence of money, I didn't put the provision in, but it was mostly because it's like so many things, I hadn't actually seen the implications of it. I think it's actually a very bad idea, and I would like to see it as part of an anti-corruption —
And the governor issues a stay-at-home order like many other governors did across the country and closes all non-essential businesses.
KK: Should it be against the law for the children of sitting presidents and vice presidents to serve on the boards of foreign companies or otherwise profit from their parents' service?
There is truly nothing — like actually nothing — I find more galling than hearing senators defend an effort to block or deprive actual racial or ethnic minorities of rights under the rubric of minority rights. Right? The important thing is the right of the Republican Party to block bills that would ensure that African-Americans in this country have the right to vote, that it is the important thing is that the right of the minority, the Senate Republican minority, to block a bill that would allow Black and Brown, and for that matter, white residents of Washington, DC to have full representation in Congress, it is so Orwellian. It's one of the places where I have a lot of trouble keeping my cool.
I mean, I don't think the Supreme Court is going to kill Obamacare.
KK: But do you know of any specific evidence that immigrants drive down wages?
I've been struck that one of the most interesting populist ideas to come out from the Republican, at least, Senate caucus, after the election, was not from one of the post-Trump populist , players like Hawley or Cotton, but it was from Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee. And he's got this idea, which, I think, is genuinely exciting and possibly bipartisan, for a child allowance. But I haven't seen even one other Republican Senator endorse it. So can you walk me through the idea first and then the debate over it on the right?
In some ways, the development of the right vocabulary for this is the first challenge, and it is the kind of work that some people like us might do. And we, at AEI, have been trying to do this for a while. People can find on the AEI website a project over the past year that has tried to define the nature of the power being exercised. And it is extremely difficult to do. I think that it challenges us to think about the nature of the public square, to think about the nature of access to information. But we're going to have to find that vocabulary in a way that rings plausible to a majority of the American public, and we're pretty far away from that. It is certainly true that bad cases make bad law in this situation. Those bad cases often involve failures of restraint and self-control, which in some ways, these platforms invite, but which, nonetheless, they're not exactly responsible for. I think it is imperative for people who exercise power or who want to be taken seriously to be off these platforms, to not be on Twitter. I don't think journalists should be on Twitter. I don't think Joe Biden should be on Twitter. He should discourage any politician from being on Twitter. You lose something by that. You could lose a lot by that in the media.
Tying is an arrangement where to buy one product, a consumer also has to buy a different product from a separate market. An example the F.T.C. offers is a drugmaker that required all consumers buying its medicine for schizophrenia to also buy its blood-monitoring service. The Supreme Court has treated the practice as illegal in the past, but more recently lower courts have permitted it under the more flexible rule of reason.
Well, I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes. It's almost like an Etch-A-Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.
And what he did was he proved that blame for gridlock ends up being directed towards the party in power, and that the minority can really easily deflect blame simply by saying, well, you guys are in power, figure out a way to get things done. And if you sort of spread it out over time — and I remember this having been there and trying to sort of mount communications campaigns to lay the blame at Republicans' feet — it's really hard because people just don't want to hear it. They don't want to hear it. It sounds like excuses. And it's diffuse. It happens over weeks and months. There are very few action-forcing points where you can use to hang the blame. So McConnell carried out that experiment. He proved the Republicans suffered, really, no blame at all. And then they have this massive success in the 2010 midterms taking back the House, gaining upwards of 50 seats in the House and seven seats in the Senate, taking Democrats down from 60 seats all the way to 53. So there's just really no question that his experiment worked and proved that obstruction in our current polarized environment is a successful political strategy for the party that's out of power.
We just undercut ourselves when we do that.
The Bevin administration has estimated that the plan will result in 100,000 fewer Medicaid recipients after five years and save $2.4 billion, mostly in federal Medicaid funds. But Mr. Bevin couched the policy change as a moral rather than a fiscal decision, saying he did not care about the savings and saw it as an opportunity for Kentucky's poor not to be put into a dead-end entitlement trap but rather to be given a path forward and upward so they can do for themselves.
Or, the Senate. The modern use of budget reconciliation is a kludge. The institution has become paralyzed by the filibuster and rather than rewriting its rules to solve that problem, senators have instead patched it through budget reconciliation. The Senate gets just enough done that no one can say it is actually impossible to pass big bills through the body. But budget reconciliation narrows the range of problems Congress can solve, the number of bills it can pass and the policy mechanisms it can use. No one would ever design a legislative body that worked this way, but this is how the Senate has come to work, one kludge on top of another. For any particular problem we have arrived at the most Gerry-rigged, opaque and complicated response, Teles wrote. That is both an apt description of today's Senate and of the kind of policy budget reconciliation produces.
KK: Simultaneously though, all of the things that you've suggested you would need to do in order to afford Medicare for all, a wealth tax, cutting the defense budget, comprehensive immigration reform, would require the Senate's approval.
Roughly 50 percent of Pennsylvania's population supports the fracking industry.
By joining together, the Labor Department said, employers may reduce administrative costs through economies of scale, strengthen their bargaining position to obtain more favorable deals, enhance their ability to self-insure and offer a wider array of insurance options.

I was at Netroots Nation last weekend. And they had converted most of the bathrooms in the convention center into all-gender restrooms. What it meant was basically that you sort of had to, if you're a woman, you kind of had to often walk by men in urinals to go use the bathroom. I thought that maybe I was the only person who was so stodgy and old-fashioned as to feel mildly uncomfortable. But there was one bathroom in another part of the building that hadn't been converted, and it had, like, three stalls. And there was this huge line of women waiting to use it. Don't get me wrong. Trans women have every right in the world to use women's bathrooms. Trans men have every right in the world to use men's bathrooms. I think that this kind of rush to pretend that gender is not an important organizing principle can end up trotting on the needs of women for whom their lived experience is that it necessarily is.
At least eight other Republican-led states are hoping to follow — a ninth, Indiana, has already won permission to do so — and some want to go even further by imposing time limits on coverage.
Serge Schmemann: Let me ask you about the Middle East. In the October debate you said, I think we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East.

Prisoners at Guantánamo Bay will be offered vaccination, the Pentagon says. Troops and civilian residents at the U.S. naval base and military prison at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, are already being vaccinated. Officials said shots would be offered to detainees as well. Credit... Alex Brandon/Associated Press WASHINGTON — The Pentagon has decided to offer coronavirus vaccines to detainees at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, possibly starting next week, according to a prosecutor in the case against five prisoners accused of conspiring in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The prosecutor, Clayton G. Trivett Jr., wrote to defense lawyers on Thursday that an official in the Pentagon has just signed a memo approving the delivery of the Covid-19 vaccine to the detainee population in Guantánamo. Medical workers at the U.S. naval base began vaccinating the 6,000 residents on Jan. 8, including the 1,500 troops assigned to the detention operation. But the Trump administration had declined to say whether prisoners would be vaccinated. The 40 detainees at the prison complex could start receiving the first of the two required doses of vaccineon a voluntary basis as soon as Monday, Mr. Trivett said. Under Pentagon policy, because the Food and Drug Administration has given only emergency-use authorization to the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, the recipient's consent is required to administer the shots. It is not known how many people at Guantánamo have been infected with the coronavirus. Early in the pandemic, the military reported two cases there, both believed to be sailors.
While President Obama himself didn't personally appear in court to defend the Affordable Care Act, the legal challenges hurled at the legislation demanded years of government and legal resources, not to mention public attention — so the legal dimension of the health care fight can't be discounted.
Kamala Harris, Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand and most likely Amy Klobuchar are all capable candidates, and I expect there will be other women who will enter the fray.
Brent Staples: But she needed the Triangle Shirtwaist fire. What is the contemporary equivalent of the Shirtwaist fire?
Mr. Biden pressed the point on Wednesday. He's gone after every corporation in the world — I don't disagree on all of it with him, Mr. Biden said. But I have not seen him go after the gun manufacturers.
And how did much of the Republican Party respond? By criticizing the four women at least as much as Trump— it's the latest sign that Republicans appear to be approaching full Trumpification. What Trump wants, it seems, many Republicans are happy to do. Ross, I realize this may not be your favorite kind of discussion in which Michelle and I ask you to answer for the outrages of Donald Trump and the Republican Party. But here we go. So what did you think about the reaction of other Republicans to Trump's comments this week?
Critics of Senator Warren's student debt plan say it would unfairly benefit those on the path to becoming highly paid professionals.

Hey, that's entertainment. Schumer is not necessarily the most exciting politician on the planet, but he works like a demon. I've known him since the 1980s, when he was in the House and he was one of the very few members of Congress who had both young children and a full-time working spouse.
archived recording (tony evers) Hi there, folks. Governor Evers here.
Six decades later, a similar impulse seems to hold sway in Washington. While Democrats search for a muscular patriotic language to win back Trump voters (or galvanize their own), Republicans and conservatives seem happy enough to claim the gentler mantle of reform, especially when facing popular skepticism or outright hostility toward their policy proposals. Having accomplished tax reform, Speaker Paul Ryan now dreams of entitlement reform, through which he envisions reducing the deficit by cutting back on signature liberal programs like Medicare and Social Security. In a recent open letter sponsored by the Heritage Foundation, 12 conservative figures urged Ryan, along with Trump and Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, not to forget about health reform, by which they mean continuing the effort to undo Obamacare. Several signers of that letter have been described as reform conservatives, a loose term that signals inside-the-Beltway policy seriousness while creating distance from the more xenophobic elements of the Republican Party.
The story in Arizona was very different. The utility there, Arizona Public Service, is powerful and aggressive, and it fought hard against the initiative. Crucially, the office of the state's attorney general, who has received campaign donations from the utility, added five words to the ballot question: irrespective of cost to consumers. They basically placed an ad against the measure in the measure, Steyer said. It failed to pass, 69 percent to 31 percent.
When I was a girl, you had a better than 50/50 chance of doing better than your parents. Today, that seems to be slipping under a 1-in-10 chance. Opportunity is shifting away from not just the poor kids. It's shifting away from everybody who's not born into the top. And sure, a few people roll the dice and make it big and we should celebrate that, but it's like this fundamental question of who we're going to be as a country. And yeah, I do fight for a lot of things. I fight for a big vision, but if we don't start there, if we start by compromising, if we start by saying, Hey, everybody line up. We're going to knock 2 cents off your student loan debt, who's showing up for that?
If the Supreme Court rules that Obamacare is out, we'll have a plan that is far better than Obamacare, he said.
The way I think we get something done in Washington, it's the Frances Perkins story. It's not enough to organize on the outside and have the marches in the street. Before the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire, there had been dozens of marches, right? Lots of high profile. But the guys who ran the factories figured out it was a lot cheaper just to grease palms in Albany than it was to actually change their practices and put up adequate fire escapes and fire preventive measures. So just pushing from the outside, it's not enough to get it done. Just fighting it from the inside is not enough to get it done. But the one-two punch of pushing from the outside and leading it from the inside is where you see real difference.
Pursuing a legislative path was tougher and led to an uncertain outcome, but he wanted his reforms to endure, Johnson explained, and to do so they required the stubborn force of law.
when the D.N.C. made accumulating small donors a centerpiece to debate eligibility among two dozen potential candidates, that's when the unintended consequence kicked in. Small donors are often more motivated, more activist, more engaged, more ideological. In short, more leftist. They're less likely to send in five bucks to a candidate who says, I'm going to preserve Obamacare, maintain private insurance, and add a public option so anyone who wants to can join Medicare — even though that's where most Americans and most Democrats are.
My fellow Americans, we face a national emergency. Never before have we had a president so utterly lacking in personal integrity, so able to lie and abuse his powers with such impunity and so blindly backed by an amoral party, an unscrupulous attorney general and a media-fund-raising juggernaut. It is an engine of raw power that will cram anything the president says or does right down your throat.
Biden's relief plan also includes a major expansion of the Affordable Care Act in the form of greater subsidies for Americans who purchase their health insurance on the marketplaces established by the law. This would, according to an Urban Institute estimate, reduce the number of uninsured people in the United States by more than four million.

I am in this fight because my daddy ended up as a janitor. I got my big chance at a commuter college that cost $50 a semester, because a bunch of taxpayers had invested in that college. That opportunity is not there today. That same college costs $15,000 now. Kids have to load up on debt to go there today. That's not expanding opportunity in this country. We've got a choice to make as a nation and the good news about 2020, the door has opened just a crack, that all the things that have been broken for so long, Donald Trump has made so much worse and gotten so many people off the sidelines, we actually have a chance. Not just to nibble, but to make big change.
Facing perhaps the most difficult re-election of his career, Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, is getting an early start against Representative Ann Kirkpatrick, the likely Democratic candidate in the race, with a new television ad hitting her for her strong support of the Affordable Care Act.

Now here's the good news. We've created associations, millions of people are joining associations. Millions. That were formerly in Obamacare or didn't have insurance. Or didn't have health care. Millions of people. That's gonna be a big bill, you watch. It could be as high as 50 percent of the people. You watch. So that's a big thing. And the individual mandate. So now you have associations, and people don't even talk about the associations. That could be half the people are going to be joining up.
MC: O.K., so we mark that one off, so we don't have to do immigration reform for this to work.
Here are the steps the company is taking to address the issue:
It's odd, then, that so much of Brill's prose feels padded, as he mines his accumulated knowledge to deliver disquisitions on the Bayonne Bridge in Staten Island and the vagaries of the gas tax. (Strangely, there's no mention of a devastated post-hurricane Puerto Rico or the water crisis in Flint, Mich., except in an endnote.) He complains of lawyerly bloat in government, producing rules that were comically complicated and so long, though his own long book seems to suffer from a mild version of it. It is difficult to overstate the degree to which the ubiquity of arbitration clauses has un-leveled the playing field, he writes, as if to warn us, before giving it a try.
In other words, they don't really have a plan to replace it.
You can't say that there's never any conflict between these two things because in the life of every parent and every family there are very difficult conflicts that have to be managed even for very affluent, well-off, and lucky parents. There's just a conflict between paid work and child rearing. But it certainly is true that if you create the conditions for a flourishing economy, which can include promoting work that this can be good for families and can be good for family life. So, here I actually will defend Lee and Rubio. Sometimes you'll get people who will say things like, we shouldn't care about incentives on work at all. If we're helping people, if we're bringing people out of poverty, you have to care about magnitudes, the size of these affects, and so forth. But I also do think that they're right. The old welfare system did, by creating these poverty traps and discouraging work, harm families. I think that to some extent, and here I get back to disagreeing with them, I think that they are misapplying those lessons in thinking about this current proposal, which is a different proposal from the old welfare system and it's in a different context than the old system was. For example, like as I was saying earlier, we're talking about a flat benefit which doesn't create that same kind of trap that you had in the old system.
About 10 million Americans lost their homes to foreclosure sales between 2006 and 2014, the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis.
And that was the neighborhood destroyed by white mobs, who looted black businesses and homes, killing probably hundreds. (We don't know how many because the massacre was never properly investigated.) The police, of course, did nothing to protect black citizens; instead, they joined the rioters.
So it may be interesting if he were in power. But as long as he is not in power, there just isn't much actual room for negotiation, whereas the people who might be more into the room for negotiation are folks like Romney and Collins and others who actually haven't moved that far on the underlying economics.
I'm voting for Mikie Sherrill because I know she'll like fight for me and my family, my daughter, and for the A.C.A.
I'm Lindsey Graham, and I'm running for president of the United States.
A further amendment added another $15 billion, to create a program called invisible risk sharing. The legislation is fairly vague about how the program would work, but authorizes the Department of Health and Human Services to set up another program to reimburse health insurers for very sick patients with the funds.
The spike in premiums is a sign that not enough healthy people are signing up for the exchanges. Without healthy people to balance out the sick, insurance stops being insurance and becomes terribly expensive.
That's a pretty pale rebellion. It's like saying you're going to sit home on Election Day and sulk.
I think it includes anti-competitiveness and unfair trade practices. I think we need to resuscitate the old tying concept that we use.
The court, even with two Trump appointees, moves with the illuminated society around it. Trump just grovels before his blinkered base. And while Trump is often clueless about public opinion, the court seems to be at least loosely tethered to it, as with a 5-to-4 ruling on Thursday that nixed his intended scuttling of a program that protected immigrants known as Dreamers from deportation. In some polling, about three-quarters of Americans support that program.
Jesse Wegman: Senator, I want to just take you back for a moment to Mara's question about swing states and swing state voters and your point about large structural changes that people warn you off. The other day, you repeated your argument that you wanted to be the last president to win the Electoral College and the first to win the national popular vote. How do you expect — I'm assuming you're not talking about a constitutional amendment. How do you expect to get there in five years, unless you're the president, unless you win the Electoral College and Donald Trump wins the popular vote in 2020?
The value of health insurance skyrocketed for a lot of Americans, said Michael Marchand, chief marketing officer for the Washington Health Benefit Exchange. All of a sudden masks, Clorox wipes and health insurance became really important.
But I take your question seriously. The place I might be most likely to fail is to get only part. Now, part's better than none, right? But only part. And that's a deeply worrisome thought.
The changes in premiums affect nearly everyone, but are particularly valuable for two groups. If you have a low income, subsidies will cover enough to give you a free silver plan with extra benefits that lower your co-payments and deductibles. And if you earn more than 400 percent of the federal poverty level — about $51,000 for a single person or $105,000 for a family of four — for the first time you will qualify for help buying insurance.
It should be a nonpartisan issue, but oftentimes it gets thrown under the rug, Mr. Vaglienty said. Was Mr. Van Duyn closer to making up his mind after chatting about the candidates? Minutes later he left, but sent an update via text message: I went for Sanders because I felt he had a better chance than Warren, given that he has been polling ahead of her, and that he was trailing Biden, he wrote.

And I'm not saying that's a record of glory. Those filibusters were often aimed at civil rights bills — but fewer than one vote to break them each year. Since 2010, it has taken on average more than 80 votes each year to end filibusters — more than 80. This is not the Senate of the 20th century. Something completely different has happened. It has changed. It is not the Senate the founders wanted or built. It is the Senate they warned against. I reported on the Senate for a long time. And one of the fascinating things about talking to Republican and Democratic senators and Republican and Democratic staffers is nobody likes the place anymore. For all the people that work their whole lives to get there, they get there and they look around, and they're appalled. They may disagree on how to fix it and what is wrong, but they are appalled. Nobody thinks it works well. This is not a situation where it's only outside critics who recognize something is wrong. The most searing denunciations, they come from the insiders. They come from the staffers. They come from the members. One of those staffers is Adam Jentleson. He was deputy chief of staff to then Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. He was high up enough in the institution to see how it really worked, but he was also young enough, new enough, to be free of the gauzy nostalgia for the days of yore.
KK: We're running out of time here.
Lindsey Graham decides he's going to run for president.
So one way to understand why the leadership of the Culinary Union is fighting so hard against Medicare-for-all proposals is to look back to the 1990s.
But that is the specific, right? This is the place where Democrats have fired on Democrats about how we're going to do health care. And I'll make two pitches on that. One is I think the best way we're going to do health care — this is just what I believe — is you do what you can to bring down costs. You got a little success on the table. It's a lot of success. It's hundreds of millions of dollars of success. You've got that on the table. You start to offer people what's possible.
We share the same goal, universal health care for every single American, Mrs. Clinton said of her rival Mr. Sanders. But we have a real difference about how to get there.
There is a brief discussion among Democrats at that time of trying to do a single-payer system, a more universal system, where everyone gets something like Medicare, but that really, even at that time, is very much a fringe view among Democrats. The consensus idea that President Obama and the Democrats in Congress want to do is something that sort of expands on our current system, where you still have a lot of different private insurers. People have a lot of choice.
KK: And then I think Brent is going to close us out.
And so, after he left, he spent a few years researching the Senate's history to understand how it led to this grim present. And his new book, Kill Switch: The Rise of the Modern Senate and the Crippling of American Democracy, it is, in my view, the essential book on the modern Senate. It is excellent. Now it's not particularly uplifting, but one thing it is not is without hope, because the Senate, unlike a lot of other things in American politics, can be changed. And so I wanted Adam to come on the show to talk about how the Senate became what it is today, talk about what it means for Joe Biden's agenda, to talk about what really drives senators like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema, what it really feels like to be in there, legislating at this moment in this institution at this time, and of course, about how to fix it. As always, my email is ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. I'm always interested to know who you'd like to see on the show, so send me your guest suggestions. Here's Adam Jentleson. So I want to start with the real sexy stuff, the stuff that gets the audience excited. What is the budget reconciliation process, and why am I hearing so much about it right now?
The so-called special enrollment period is intended to help people who have lost coverage in the past year, but it will be open to those who want health insurance for any reason, in the 36 states that use Healthcare.gov. The decision was reported earlier by The Washington Post.
Well, you have seen some social conservative support for Romney's idea. I'd say some social conservatives who write for First Things or National Review have been pretty positive about it. Actually it's been uniting folks from The Dispatch, as well as from First Things, people who have not always been getting along much in recent years. You haven't had a ton of criticism. What I would say actually, the shoe that hasn't dropped, you haven't had a lot of conservatives on the economic side attacking the idea as a tax increase designed to fuel a spending increase. Because it would seem to me that the Romney plan is a straightforward violation of Grover Norquist's pledge for Republicans not to raise taxes, because that pledge says, you can't get rid of a tax deduction without making up for it with a tax cut somewhere else. And that's exactly what Romney does — he gets rid of the state and local deduction, which is a pretty significant tax increase and he doesn't use it to finance a tax cut. He uses that to finance this child allowance, which is to a certain degree, just spending. And I've been surprised. Maybe I missed it but I kept expecting The Wall Street Journal to run a bitter attack on it because they've been, for 30 years, bitter enemies of the child tax credit. Getting back to the question of this trade off, or this conflict among conservatives.
Serge Schmemann: Let me ask you about the Middle East. In the October debate you said, I think we ought to get out of the Middle East. I don't think we should have troops in the Middle East. Did you mean nowhere in the Middle East? Do you think — for example, who should control the Persian Gulf, freedom of navigation, should we close down the air base in Qatar?
Actually, I don't think of what I say that way. What I think of is the leadership possibilities that the candidates for president are offering. I don't know anybody who sits around and says, I want to make peace with corruption. I don't know where those people are in America who think it's O.K. that Amazon makes $11 billion and pays nothing in taxes. I haven't seen those people. Now, maybe they just stay away from me, but I don't think so. I think —
One thing I think about when trying to evaluate Donald Trump's success and the lessons of it is that those of us, and this describes you and me, who are policy wonks by inclination and trade, have a tendency to pick through Trumpism and find the policy threads. And so, he did a lot of things in the 2016 campaign made a lot of comments that were more moderate, right? He wasn't going to cut entitlements. He's going to raise taxes on people like himself. He was to give everybody beautiful, generous, healthcare. And then there are a number of Republicans who are trying to build a post-Trump, Trumpism, around his policies. And even people who were one time critics of him, like Lindsey Graham, has said, what we need to do is keep Donald Trump's policies and just move forward from there. But I do think one question is, whether or not — what Donald Trump really understood, was that policy communication wasn't very important. And that what is uniting Republicans right now at the core of the energy in the party, is a sense of cultural threat. And you could describe that in a lot of different ways and it comes together in different ways. It's racial change, right, demographic change. It's secularization in society. He did do very well among evangelical voters, in general, and they stayed with him in a very loyal way through 2020.

We have a duty to enforce the law as Congress has written it, Mr. Azar said. But he added that the federal government must proceed with a great deal of deliberation and caution and care in assessing the Idaho plan.
Last year, Senator Warren introduced a bill called the No First Use Act, which would declare that the United States would never be the first to use a nuclear weapon. Opponents say it could drive arms races in smaller countries that depend on America for protection.
Yeah, I'm not sure if that's true either. I mean, I do think that he's able to take certain extremely fringe ideas and mainstream them. But, yeah, we shouldn't forget about the fact that he is extremely unpopular.

Mr. Trump said his campaign received more than 120,000 requests for tickets to the event. Supporters began lining up 30-plus hours before showtime, hauling in sleeping bags, coolers and stadium chairs. Rainstorms on Tuesday drove the crowd to seek shelter, but could not dampen its ardor. Inside and outside the arena, people danced, whooped and reveled in MAGA-mania.
Insurers, which had been arguing in favor of the enrollment period, had been hopeful just a few days ago that the White House might announce such a step. But the situation suddenly became fluid, in the description of one executive. Another described the administration as divided about whether to proceed, especially given the president's support for the lawsuit that would overturn the law.
NF: How do you deal with the fact that while people might want big change, they're also afraid of it?
On the other side were Mick Mulvaney, the director of the White House Office of Management and Budget; Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin; Kevin Hassett, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers; and Larry Kudlow, the director of the National Economic Council.
The terms of the new amendment, go something like this: States would have the option to jettison two major parts of the Affordable Care Act's insurance regulations. They could decide to opt out of provisions that require insurers to cover a standard, minimum package of benefits, known as the essential health benefits. And they could decide to do away with a rule that requires insurance companies to charge the same price to everyone who is the same age, a provision called community rating. In exchange, states would be required to set up special arrangements for high-cost patients.

After the law passed forcing insurers to accept anyone without raising premiums, Mr. Dailey was able to enroll in a Blue Cross plan in Texas, which covered his medical care that at times approached $200,000 a year. His income was low enough that he also qualified for generous federal subsidies under the law that kept his monthly premiums at no more than $235, and his out-of-pocket costs capped at around $1,000 a year.
I went to Washington. I came here to New York to talk to people about the idea for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and I heard two things over and over and over. Part one, that's a great idea. It would actually make a real difference. That would be structural change, or as I now say, big structural change, in financial services. And part two, don't even try, because you'll be up against the big banks. You'll be up against Wall Street. You'll be up against all of the Republicans. You'll be up against half the Democrats. You'll never get it done. But we did get it done.
In short, on the eve of Obama's presidency, something big happened: Everything started getting digitized and made mobile — work, commerce, billing, finance, education — reshaping the economy. A lot of things started to get very fast all at once. It was precisely when we needed to double down on our formula for success and update it for a new era — more lifelong learning opportunities for every worker, better infrastructure (roads, airports, rails and bandwidth) to promote the flow of commerce, better rules to incentivize risk-taking and prevent recklessness, better immigration policies to attract the world's smartest minds, and more government-funded research to push out the boundaries of science and sow the seeds for the next generation of start-ups.
One by one, Democrats rose to voice their objections. Senator Maria Cantwell of Washington said that Republicans were stealing health care from Americans. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said he was voting no because health care should not just be for the healthy and wealthy.

The problem is that while the A.C.A. uses government funds to cap the percentage of income that each person must spend to pay for a robust health care plan, the Republican approach would almost certainly provide millions of individuals and families with less than the cost of quality insurance.
And I thought I would see a larger social conservative core saying he's right and we've gotten this wrong. I've been a little bit surprised that there hasn't been more support for him, or do you think I'm misreading this?
Mr. Trump began his presidency with a promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act, but efforts to do so in 2017 were unsuccessful. Despite Republican control of both houses of Congress, legislators were unable to agree on an approach. The Senate tried and failed to pass several different bills that would have reshaped big parts of the 2010 health law.
One State Department official said that negotiations remained far in the distance and that Mr. Malley would initially consult with leaders in Europe, in the Middle East and in Congress before any talks began. The official said American negotiators would ultimately seek a longer, stronger but also broader deal to curb Iran's missiles and proxies — another strategy that Tehran has already refused to consider. But it echoes what the Trump administration had demanded when it withdrew from the 2015 deal and imposed a pressure campaign of harsh sanctions and military threats against Iran and its senior officials. Even before Mr. Malley was appointed, conservatives had accused him of being too accommodating toward Iran and Israel, although dozens of foreign policy experts described him as an astute analyst and accomplished diplomat.

In fact, let me quote you a New York Times article from just last week that I thought was terrific, and that's about a 2-cent wealth tax and how it is popular across political lines and it's popular, why? Because most of America gets that they're getting cheated in this game, and you get that wherever you are on that income scale until you get up to the very top.

Or, the Senate. The modern use of budget reconciliation is a kludge. The institution has become paralyzed by the filibuster and rather than rewriting its rules to solve that problem, senators have instead patched it through budget reconciliation. The Senate gets just enough done that no one can say it is actually impossible to pass big bills through the body. But budget reconciliation narrows the range of problems Congress can solve, the number of bills it can pass and the policy mechanisms it can use. No one would ever design a legislative body that worked this way, but this is how the Senate has come to work, one kludge on top of another. For any particular problem we have arrived at the most Gerry-rigged, opaque and complicated response, Teles wrote. That is both an apt description of today's Senate and of the kind of policy budget reconciliation produces.

Still, Brill does have some stunners in store. The most surprising parts of Tailspin come at the end, when he tries to forecast what might happen next, offering a rather extraordinary mix of doomsaying and wishful thinking. He envisions a day when things get so bad that President Trump's supporters will awaken to the debacle that their choice produced. He foresees coal miners deciding to march on Washington and demand help in transitioning to an energy industry of the future. He anticipates the productive public fury that would erupt if a bridge collapses on the same day or in the same week that two trains derail, a big city loses electricity and a school system finds out that its water fountains are gushing lead.

Enrollment in N.Y.C. schools drops sharply, especially among preschool-age children. Children arrive for class on the first day of school reopening in December in Brooklyn. Credit... Angela Weiss/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images New York City's school enrollment fell sharply this year, the latest sign that students across the country have left the public school system temporarily or even perhaps permanently during the coronavirus pandemic. Enrollment in the nation's largest public school system, with nearly 1 million students, fell by about 4 percent, or roughly 43,000 students, from the previous year, according to data released by the city on Wednesday. Most of the enrollment drop was concentrated in early grades, especially prekindergarten classes for 3- and-4-year-olds. The decline reflects how some parents are delaying enrollment because of the limitations of remote learning, which are particularly acute for young children, while others are opting for home-schooling, either short-term or indefinitely. The decline in enrollment is sobering news for the school district, which has partially reopened its classrooms while many other large urban school systems have struggled to do so. The new numbers could affect state aid to the city's public school system, though it is not yet entirely clear how. Still, enrollment in New York City has been declining at lower rates for years, as many students have left traditional district schools for charter schools, which now enroll over 100,000 children. Public school enrollment has also declined in states across the country in recent months, including Massachusetts, Montana and Missouri.
He's obsessed with the weaponry of pirates, the pistols, the daggers, the swords. You know, this is just one example, but I think it's a familiar example to a lot of parents, that I don't think that my son was born into some sort of cultural prison of gender. I think that maleness and femaleness are biological realities that have strong cultural expressions that can vary from person to person. But I don't see how, looking at my son, it would help him, remotely, for me to be disappointed in his obsession with piracy, and now his obsession with knights, and his desire to wave swords, and all the rest. I think it's much healthier for me to concede the obvious and say, maleness is real. And what we want is to find a healthy and morally upright expression of maleness so that he thinks about himself as a man in ways that are protective and chivalrous rather than toxic and aggressive. And I think that's a cultural construct, but it's a cultural construct placed on top of a biological reality and a fundamental difference that, as Michelle says, persists in different forms in just about every human society. So I'm just curious: Why do you feel like your children are imprisoned rather than feeling like they're just finding cultural expressions for who they actually are?
Oh, I'm not going to do names.
Yes. I just think it's got this — no one has to say there is a conflict of interest, and I'm not trying to talk about anyone's individual circumstances, but I think one of the things we have to deal with in public life is the appearance of conflict of interest. You know, that's supposed to be the guiding principle, for example, for judges. It's not whether or not there is a conflict of interest, it's whether or not people in the public could reasonably be concerned that it were, because it's important that you believe that judges are acting independently and not influenced because they're going to get money or someone in their family is going to get money. And so that's where I think the analogy is the closest, and whether you make it a rule of ethics or whether do you actually just make it part of the law, I think is a fair question, but I get why we should push in that direction.
Such as Medicare, which people like, by a wide margin.
I know that as you sit here it looks like, wow, this woman wants to do a lot and it's hard. And the truth is, it is. I spent my whole life studying working families. Why they go broke, what's happening in America, why America's middle class is being hollowed out. Whole books written about this. And I watch every year two things as it gets worse and worse and worse. Not fire worse. That was 2008 and — everybody is ——
In June, Senator Warren released a plan focused on voter disenfranchisement and election security. The plan proposes, among other measures, improved voting equipment across the country and bans on voter purges.

NF: But it's also about the Medicare for all plan.
In fact, the Trump administration is already trying to take away those protections via the courts. It probably won't succeed. But it might, in which case an estimated 17 million Americans would lose their health coverage.
You know, I've been endorsed by Cory Booker, Kirsten Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren, Jan Schakowsky, six other members of Congress, a governor, and then 40 local politicians. I think that I'm a blend of the entire party.
What book would you give a progressive right now to read about conservatism?
The whole episode fits a Trump administration pattern. In describing his behavior with lobbyists, Mulvaney did something outrageous and worthy of attention. And yet he also managed to divert attention from policies doing real damage to Americans.
Two federal judges in one of the most conservative appeals courts in the nation appeared ready on Tuesday to fall for the most specious legal challenge that the Affordable Care Act has faced — which is saying something.
I mean, one way I think about it is it's almost certainly the case that there are real differences between boys and girls and men and women that extend beyond the ones that you can see. And yet it also seems to me likely that we've exaggerated how big those differences are. And, Farhad, I think that's part of your point, that, Ross, your point about there being real differences can be true, but it can also be the case that they're not nearly as big as we think.
Bret: I wonder about that. Coronavirus rates are also rising steeply in California, which had a lockdown about as severe as New York's. And fatality rates are so far holding steady or rising only slightly even in states like Texas and Florida that have seen infection rates soar over the last month.
CW: Can I ask about that?
You didn't vote for him in the general?
Generally speaking, dark-money groups are politically active organizations, often nonprofit, that, under I.R.S. regulations, are not required to disclose the identities of their donors.
So I'm just going to read the section of the Federalist Papers — and this is from Federalist 22 — just because I love the quote so much. The necessity of unanimity in public bodies or of something approaching towards it — so a supermajority requirement — has been founded upon a supposition that it would contribute to security. But its real operation is to embarrass the administration, to destroy the energy of the government, and to substitute the pleasure, caprice, or artifices of an insignificant, turbulent, or corrupt junto to the regular deliberations and decisions of a respectable majority. They really did look at this, and they really did reject it. And the point you made here — and frankly, the point they make there — I think is very important and very subtle. And it is one of the things that has actually changed in the way people thought about this over the course of my time in Washington. And I will immodestly say I've tried very hard to get people to change the way they thought about this. Which is when I came to Washington, the dominant view was bipartisanship is something the minority wants, and the majority has to be incentivized to offer them. That the problem in governing is that if the majority is power, they will lock the minority out. They will never let them in. And so, you really need to construct your rules, such as the majority has a reason to work with the minority.
I was surprised by how fast it happened. I wasn't surprised that he sort of came up with a really big theory of what should happen next and then eventually let it disintegrate, because we've seen that pattern a number of times. But to pick a fight this big and to stick with it for so little time is the definition of politically counterproductive.
The White House budget is generally viewed as a political messaging document. Congress, which is responsible for approving government spending, is under no requirement to adhere to White House requests. Lawmakers have previously rejected many of Mr. Trump's attempts to gut domestic programs.
He clearly recognizes the problem — he said he spends a lot of time thinking about it — but he also knows the solutions will come only when he is long out of office. Many citizens, he said, back on Air Force One, have to worry about retraining at some point in their careers, because they can't anticipate being in one place for 30 years. The occupational mix in the economy places greater demands on people because it's changing more rapidly. And all of this makes people feel that they don't know what's around the corner. For whatever sense of uncertainty business leaders lament, this may be a much more profound sense of uncertainty.
Mayor Bill de Blasio wants 5 million New Yorkers vaccinated by June. Vaccines being given out in the Bronx this week. Credit... James Estrin/The New York Times In his final State of the City address, Mayor Bill de Blasio offered a sprawling vision of New York City's recovery from a pandemic that has taken tens of thousands of lives and destroyed the city's economy. The mayor committed to accelerating the city's vaccination efforts and set a goal of inoculating five million New Yorkers by June. He also said he would begin in May to bring back to offices the thousands of city employees who have been working remotely, and would safely reopen schools for all students in September. New York City's vaccination effort is the foundation of a recovery for all of us, the mayor's 18-page recovery plan says. With every vaccine shot, New York City moves closer and closer to fully reopening our economy, restoring the jobs we lost and ensuring equality in our comeback. If the federal government provides enough stimulus dollars to the city, Mr. de Blasio said, he will create a City Cleanup Corps of 10,000 temporary workers to focus on beautifying the city — an idea he compared to President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Works Progress Administration during the Great Depression. Mr. de Blasio also proposed two plans to help small businesses: a $50 million recovery tax credit program for businesses that have faced hardships from the pandemic, and a $100 million recovery loan program to help shops stay open.
Early in the campaign, Mr. Trump's response to specific policy questions was often to assure voters that he would hire intelligent people to work on the problem. In his book Crippled America, he wrote that to develop a replacement for Obamacare, we should hire the most knowledgeable people in the world on this subject and lock them in a room — and not unlock the door until they've agreed on the steps we need to take.
In a fundamental sense, Trumpism is the culmination of that strategy. Commentators keep calling Trump a populist, but the only way in which he actually caters to working-class white voters is by appealing to their racial animus. He may be successful in doing so partly because it's the only thing about his political persona that's sincere: All indications are that he really is a racist.
He also repeated criticisms he has been making about Mr. Sanders for weeks over his record on gun control. Previously, Mr. Biden has acknowledged that Mr. Sanders has changed his views on gun control — but on Wednesday he said Mr. Sanders's past votes on the subject remain important.
But doing away with an entire industry would also be profoundly disruptive. The private health insurance business employs at least a half a million people, covers about 250 million Americans, and generates roughly a trillion dollars in revenues. Its companies' stocks are a staple of the mutual funds that make up millions of Americans' retirement savings.
So the way I see this is all I can do is get out and tell you what I'll fight for, and I'll point out the difference between the two. I try not to get over my skis. No, I do. I've really tried hard not to be personally critical of other candidates. I got a little heated once, but once, and because I think this is the fundamental question. Do you think that this democracy, do you think that this economy, do you think this government is going to make it if all we're offering are little nibbles around the edges?
People understand this is good for our economy. It's good for our worldwide security. If you're not willing to get out there and fight, nothing is going to change. And yeah, the fights have to be realistic. It's why I start everything with, Here's how I'm going to pay for it. You may not like how I did, but at least I laid it out there. You don't have any doubt, and I show you where every single nickel comes from because I want it to be realistic. I didn't start with free college. I started with a 2-cent wealth tax, because we can do a 2-cent wealth tax. I started with it and said, and here's how much revenue it produces. It produces a staggering amount of revenue, far more than raising income taxes, because that's what the wealth curve looks like.
They say that this is not only logistically impractical —
Under the House bill, the budget office said, premiums would tend to rise for older people and decline for younger people. By 2026, it said, premiums would be 20 percent to 25 percent lower for a 21-year-old and 8 percent to 10 percent lower for a 40-year-old — but 20 percent to 25 percent higher for a 64-year-old.
By giving people the choice to buy insurance, Republicans could end up dangerously skewing the health insurance market, Obama administration officials and insurance executives say. Sick people are more likely to sign up, they say, and there may not be enough healthy people paying premiums to cover the costs for those who are less healthy.
Here's what you need to know:
Oh, I believe that we need Medicare for all.
It's a big job to actually have responsibility and produce results, said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader. And we intend to do it.
No. Not — slightly is not the right term.
But budget reconciliation doesn't just alter liberal priorities. Social conservatives often complain that when Republicans hold Congress, their legislative asks are shunted aside for tax cuts and health care repeal laws. That is, in part, a budget reconciliation issue: You can pass tax cuts and (partially) repeal Obamacare through budget reconciliation. You cannot regulate pornography or push school prayer through the process.
archived recording (nancy pelosi) This is actually an opportunity for us to speak to the American people with clarity. archived recording (chuck schumer) It's a stark reminder of the difference between our two parties. Democrats are fighting to expand and improve health care coverage and lower costs while Republicans are trying to take it all away and raise costs.
The budget's approach to health care is particularly striking given the administration's actions in court. The White House has joined a lawsuit brought by a group of Republican states that would seek to invalidate all of the Affordable Care Act. The Supreme Court is deciding whether it will take up that case or allow the lower courts to continue reviewing it. The president has repeatedly promised to release a health care plan that could be deployed if he wins in court, but has yet to do so.
I have usually agreed with that view and I think it was a very common one through the Trump presidency. But I do think one of the things that, probably the final year of the Trump presidency, some of what we saw on COVID then obviously what we saw during and after the election, I think, really calls it into question this idea that, well, people are just saying stuff. Donald Trump is just saying stuff. Republicans are just saying stuff and when push comes to shove they're not going to act. When what I think we've seen is that it is a totally plausible mechanism of how people cognitively work to say, yes people might embrace an idea only half seriously. They embrace it as a statement of identity and expression of group solidarity. But once you have cognitively put yourself there, then once you get pushed, it's not a far step to actually acting on that idea. Once you've opened yourself to it. So, which is to say, I think it has often been posited, there's some kind of tension between maybe half seriously embracing a somewhat ridiculous idea and then really believing it. But I actually think it's worth at least considering that that's more of a process that the fact that you don't need to take it too seriously to say yes to the pollster gets you in the door on something nutty. And once you're in the door then it's easier to actually become part of the party.
But on the other hand, we have other diplomatic initiatives and it's really important that we're trying to work with this country, and they're important to us strategically for this reason and we have this ongoing negotiation in that political thing. Drag your heels, drag your heels, drag your heels, until the jobs have disappeared here. And then once you go forward, you've got to go forward through a different kind of court that's much slower.
Dr. Robert R. Redfield, the director of the C.D.C., noted this trend on Thursday during a call with reporters.
NF: Why would you think, why is that ——
I think we need to get our combat troops out. I don't think that combat is advancing the interests of the United States in the Middle East, and it's time to end combat operations. Of course we'll have a continuing presence in the Middle East. We have interests in the Middle East with our allies. We have interests in the Middle East and keeping shipping lanes open, and we will continue to have a presence there, but I don't think combat troops are how we best advance that presence.
And what about putting a price on carbon?
On Monday night, the U.S. Supreme Court sided with Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin, who had opposed extending the deadline for absentee ballots in today's election. In a 5-to-4 ruling, the court's conservative justices wrote that such an extension, quote, fundamentally alters the nature of the election, and said that all absentee ballots must be postmarked by 8:00 p.m. Tuesday night. Polls in Wisconsin are scheduled to open at 7:00 a.m. this morning, but it's unclear how many poll workers will show up, how many polling stations will be open, and what kinds of protections will be in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus during in-person voting. Meanwhile, the virus continues to spread across Wisconsin. As of Monday, the state reported nearly 2,500 infections and 77 deaths. We'll be right back.
We just undercut ourselves when we do that.
Yeah. I mean, that's precisely it. I feel like gender and gender constructs have too big of a place in society in the way that we think about the world, in the way that people understand their preferences. I have a son and a daughter who are six and eight. And it's just crushing to me that they feel so strongly attached to very gendered expectations. They play with girl toys and boy toys and listen to what they call girl music and boy music. And it seemed to happen kind of automatically in a way that was difficult to think about how they were being kind of hemmed in by these gender expectations. I don't know if changing the pronouns we use will have a huge effect on this. But it feels like a small thing we could do to kind of free ourselves from what I think of as this kind of prison of gender expectations in society.
New York severely undercounted virus deaths in nursing homes, a report says. Emergency medical technicians lifting a man after moving him from a nursing home into an ambulance in Brooklyn. Credit... Lucas Jackson/Reuters An investigation by the New York State attorney general has concluded that Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's administration undercounted coronavirus-related deaths at nursing homes by as much as 50 percent. The count of deaths in state nursing homes has been a source of controversy for Mr. Cuomo and state Health Department officials, who have been sensitive to any suggestion that decisions made at the outset of the pandemic may have caused some of those deaths, which the state puts at more than 8,700. They have also been accused of obscuring a more accurate estimate of nursing home deaths, because the state only counted deaths at the actual facilities, rather than including deaths of residents who were transferred to a hospital and died there. In the 76-page report released on Thursday by the attorney general, Letitia James, a survey of nursing homes found consistent discrepancies between deaths reported to the attorney general's investigators and those reported to and officially released by the Health Department. In one instance, an unnamed facility reported to the Health Department that it had 11 confirmed and presumed deaths on site through early August. The attorney general's survey of that same facility, however, found 40 deaths, including 27 at the home and 13 in hospitals.

With the political madness of recent weeks — the shutdown and the smackdowns, the incitements and the indictments — it's easy to forget there is much actual governing to be done by the new Congress: bills to introduce, nominees to consider and, for House Democrats in particular, oversight of the executive branch to conduct. Major oversight.

Now roughly 51 percent of American adults are in favor of a single-payer system and 47 percent are opposed, whereas earlier this year 57 percent backed it and 37 percent were opposed.
In the last Democratic debate, Joe Biden declared that he would nominate a woman as his vice-presidential running mate. That felt right at the time. But times have changed. Biden needs to go much, much further: At the Democratic convention he needs to name not just his vice president, but his entire cabinet. And it needs to be a totally different kind of cabinet — a national unity cabinet — from Democrats on the Bernie Sanders left to Republicans on the Mitt Romney right. Why?
Cathleen Decker of The Los Angeles Times put it this way: In all the anger coming from liberal Dem groups today, she wrote that she had yet to see a scenario under which a longer shutdown would have resulted in a more positive outcome from their point of view.

When we get away from politics, we all start talking about our children.
And then we started to realize that patients who were coming in with no fever but abdominal pain actually had findings on their X-rays and chest CTs that were consistent with this coronavirus, Covid-19. So someone in a car accident gets brought in and we get a CT scan of them, and their lungs look like they have coronavirus. We were seeing a lot of patients who probably had Covid, but we didn't realize. Ten residents and also many, many of our nurses and a few of the attending physicians got sick. The anxiety of this situation is really overwhelming. All of the doctors, it's hard for us to get tested even if we want to, even if we have symptoms. We're exposed over and over again. We don't have the protective equipment that we should have. I put on one N95 mask in the morning. I need to have that N95 mask on for every patient I see. I don't take it off all day. The N95 mask I wore today is also the N95 mask I wore on Friday. We're always worried that we'll be out of N95 masks. What's a little bit scary now is the patients that we're getting are much sicker. Many of the young people who are getting sick don't smoke, they're healthy, they have no co-morbidities. They're just young, regular people between the ages of 30 and 50 who you would not expect to get this sick.
KK: But does it drive down wages for American workers?
So let me see if I have this right: Because a German chancellor, Otto von Bismarck, came up with an inefficient way to provide universal health care almost 140 years ago, the United States should now copy his system?

But that's where the subsidies come in.
Premiums will rise by 15 to 20 percent in the first couple of years, but decrease in 2020.
The Trump administration's goal is not only to weaken the Affordable Care Act but also to trick the public into thinking, as opponents of the law like to say, that Obamacare is collapsing under its own weight. Let's be clear: If the Affordable Care Act collapses, it is because the president demolished it.
It's both capped in terms of the number of dollars, and it's capped in terms of the income.
I'm in remission now, thankfully, but if my disease comes back, it cannot be while having my health insurance company tell me that my pre-existing condition precludes coverage. Nor should any of us with these long-term issues be denied coverage, or required to pay higher premiums.
What they will vote on will not matter if senators oppose beginning debate. Mr. McConnell can lose only two Senate Republicans, now that Mr. McCain intends to be in the chamber.
It is one of the many ways the U.S. health care system has made us so much more vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic than other countries, said Larry Levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation and a co-author of the new study. In other countries, you don't hear about people losing health insurance when they lose their jobs.
The problem as I see it in the housing market, just picking that one, is we have a supply problem. The two big providers of housing from half a century ago just aren't there. So the developer that built the two-bedroom, one-bath house, garage converted to hold my three brothers for their bedroom, that developer is building McMansions today. And I'm not mad at him. That's where the profits are. And the federal government, as you know, now under current federal law, can't expand federal housing. It can only do replacement when it's taking it off the market. And if it takes it off the market and it doesn't replace it, then it shrinks even more. Housing deteriorates like anything else.
And the reason democracy is threatened in a way it never was under Nixon is not simply that Trump is a worse human being than Nixon ever was; it is the fact that he has so many enablers.
Alex M.

[Follow our live Trump vs Biden 2020 election updates and analysis.]
NF: Why would you think, why is that ——
I went to Washington. I came here to New York to talk to people about the idea for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and I heard two things over and over and over. Part one, that's a great idea. It would actually make a real difference. That would be structural change, or as I now say, big structural change, in financial services. And part two, don't even try, because you'll be up against the big banks. You'll be up against Wall Street. You'll be up against all of the Republicans. You'll be up against half the Democrats. You'll never get it done. But we did get it done.
Think of what that means. Do — you know that the top — just one quick — one number. I've resisted numbers while I'm in here. The 99 percent America pays 7.2 percent of your total income in taxes. Not total income. Total wealth. The top one-tenth of 1 percent, the part I want to hit with a 2-cent wealth tax, 3.2 percent. 3.2 percent. They have wealth managers who are managing these huge funds that are growing at what rate? Six percent a year, 8 percent a year, 10 percent a year?
In December, former Vice President Joe Biden said that he would consider choosing Senator Warren as his running mate and wondered whether she would choose him. The Senator, for her part, has suggested she might prefer a woman.
In Arizona, Michigan and Nevada, Steyer's group was trying to put a simple question in front of voters: Should their state use more clean energy? According to the polls that Foser and his NextGen colleagues studied, as many as 80 percent of Americans say yes to that question.
After Super Tuesday, states that are scheduled to vote start postponing and sometimes outright canceling their scheduled primaries.
I do think there's an assumption that the legislation wouldn't actually have any real world effects that you need to care about. That it's just a political game, which, I think, was actually a pretty widespread assumption among Republicans. And then there's just the, we don't want to spend money, we'll spend money if we have to, but it's not our comfort zone.

There's always a tension for presidents around whether to submit a specific proposal to Congress or let the legislative process play out, Mr. Levitt added. When it comes to health care, the challenge has been that the president has not only avoided proposing a specific plan, but has made promises that no plan could ever fulfill.
Democratic lawmakers have a few questions for Alexander Acosta. President Trump's labor secretary has been summoned to appear before the House Oversight and Reform Committee to explain his role in the 2008 plea deal given to Jeffrey Epstein, the wealthy financier accused of sexually abusing and trafficking scores of teenage girls.

I think having people here who are working under the table is both bad for American workers and bad for the American economy. One of the reasons I propose to create a pathway to citizenship for everyone who's here to stay, a pathway that is fair and achievable, is to stop the problem of two-tier hiring: those who are hired in the legal system and then those who are hired outside the legal system. People who are undocumented have no protection and are frequently subject to wage theft, to unsafe working conditions, and that's not good for anyone. It's not good for American workers. It's not good for the American economy.
BA: What is the right stance?
I'll second that and also note that she'll be on the show on Tuesday. So if you want to tune in then. And then finally, your favorite children's book?
Which is why, for all these ideas, if you ask Republican politicians what they stand for when it comes to health policy, you are likely to hear slogans like patient centered and preserving the doctor-patient relationship and possibly something about how Democrats want to socialize Medicare — as if the nation's largest government health program is not already an essentially socialist enterprise.
In a democracy, how is it that they have so much political influence that one-tenth of 1 percent can say, I rather your kid have to deal with $50,000 in student loan debt, and I'd rather you never get a chance to get a child into day care, which means you either piece stuff together in crazy ways or quit your job. And I'd rather your public schools still have tiles falling out of the ceiling and textbooks that are 11 years old than that the top one-tenth of 1 percent has to pitch in 2 cents.
The worry now among advocates for lower-income Americans and the sick is that the Trump administration might seek to undermine the health care law through administrative steps. For example, officials could seek to reduce subsidies that help people earning just above the federal poverty line pay for out-of-pocket costs. Republicans in the House sued the Obama administration in 2014 to block those subsidies. That case is still pending, and the Trump administration could decide to stop defending the subsidies. Such a move would only compound the mistakes it made by trying to rush a half-baked bill through the House.
I guess I can see President Trump's argument there. It feels kind of legitimate. Wouldn't it be smart for Republicans heading into the next presidential election, 2020, to recognize that there are things that voters like about the Affordable Care Act? But in order for it to be a benefit for the Republicans and not the Democrats, they need to convince voters that the Democratic plan is a bad one and that Republicans will give them a better one.
Let me ask you both something, which is if there's one thing Donald Trump is good at, it's manipulating public opinion.
Indeed, the story of this bill may be the story of how Biden has repudiated the austerity politics of much of the last decade, as well as the anti-assistance paradigm he himself helped forge when, as a senator, he warned in 1988 of welfare mothers driving luxury cars and voted, in 1996, to make so-called welfare reform a reality.

The per capita payments to states are set to grow under the legislation each year, according to the medical portion of the consumer price index. But Medicaid costs for disabled patients and for those in nursing homes tend to be high and sometimes grow more quickly than that index. The change would give states a bigger annual increase for every beneficiary in either category.
She added, The idea that we are encouraging work and independence, then taking away the health care that makes people more employable and better able to function — none of this adds up to something that's going to be good for Kentuckians or our economy.
In this sense, and also in the canny and sometimes moving choices of inspirational figures in the balconies, I suspect the speech was effective, that it might help lift Trump temporarily upward from his mean of 38 percent approval toward the we're holding the House by our fingernails promised land of 44 percent.
While Kirkpatrick's proud of putting us at risk, John McCain is leading the fight to stop Obamacare, the female announcer says.
These are all states that said that the public health crisis was too great for them to hold in-person elections in March. But there's one state that refuses to budge, even as public health officials are urging them and states across the country have taken that drastic step. It's Wisconsin.
A nationwide poll conducted by SurveyMonkey for The New York Times found that six in 10 Americans support a wealth tax. The slice of the electorate least likely to support it is Republican men with college degrees.
KK: But do you know of any specific evidence that immigrants drive down wages?
The bully in this instance being — well, you know.
The low point for the self-proclaimed daddy's girl came a month ago when The Times reported that the president might be using his chief of staff, John Kelly, an adversary to Javanka, to push them out and back to New York.
Astead, why is it that Wisconsin has so quickly erupted into a really nasty partisan battle over something as seemingly basic as making sure people can vote safely in a primary election? I mean, that would seem to be in everyone's bipartisan interest to protect life, right? I mean, Democrats and Republicans will be casting ballots.
This scene is part of Joan Biskupic's new biography of Roberts, The Chief. The book contains a description of the justices's behind-the-scenes maneuverings on Obamacare that's more detailed than any other to appear so far.
I, myself, was very uncomfortable with that statement when he said it — I worked for him at the time — and would be still. But that is something like the view of a certain kind of more populist-inclined Republican politician. And it's hard to know, but I think that if the Biden era is more policy inclined — look, it's going to be more policy inclined — but if it is really an era of policy debates, where there are actual arguments and bargaining and negotiation, I think you will see these differences emerge with much greater force, differences among Republicans, on the role of government.
But she told Andrew that was a mistake. She decided to become co-C.E.O. alongside Stuart Haselden, who was meant to be the sole chief executive, because the company had let inaccurate reporting influence the timeline of a transition plan that we had.
The voter asked how the candidate would replace the law that might have saved his brother-in-law if it had been in effect earlier. Needless to say, all he got was boilerplate about government regulations and the usual false claims that Obamacare has destroyed millions of jobs and caused premiums to skyrocket.
It doesn't go to a doctor making $1 million a year who also has $1 million in student loan debt.
Senator Warren has argued that the sheer size of companies like Facebook, Google and Amazon pose a real threat to innovation and competition in the technology industry. Mr. Yang has argued that her diagnosis is 100 percent correct but that her solution isn't fully effective because competition doesn't solve all of the problems.
CW: That's just a process of fact-checking and you want that to be independent, because then there's the issue of Facebook getting involved.
After Senator Warren said during the October debate that the United States should get out of the Middle East, her campaign clarified that she was referring just to combat troops. Noncombat troops have long been stationed in the region for a variety of reasons including ensuring a free flow of oil.
