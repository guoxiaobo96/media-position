john druschitz spent five days in a texas hospital last april with fever and shortness of breath. it was still the early days of the pandemic, and doctors puzzled over a diagnosis.\n\nthey initially suspected coronavirus and hung signs outside his door warning those entering to wear protective equipment. mr. druschitz had already spent two weeks at home with worsening symptoms. he recalls one doctor telling him, this is what it does to a person.\n\nensuing lab work, however, was ambiguous: multiple molecular tests for coronavirus came back negative, but an antibody test was positive.\n\ndoctors found that mr. druschitz had an irregular heartbeat and blood clots in both his lungs. they sent him home on oxygen, and ultimately did not give a coronavirus diagnosis because of the negative tests. he didn't think much about the decision until this fall, when he received a $22,367.81 bill that the hospital has since threatened to send to collections.
the administration has instituted regulations to undermine the law, for example expanding the sale of short term health insurance policies that do not have to cover pre-existing medical conditions or other health benefits deemed essential by the law, such as emergency services and prescription drugs. and the white house has cut funding to promote obamacare sign-ups and for navigators who are supposed to help consumers enroll.\n\nin seeking to get rid of the tax, the democrats appear in one sense to be joining the slow dismantlement — or at least undermining their own argument that the embattled health law will save taxpayers more than it costs them over the long run while holding down health spending broadly.\n\nbut that proved to be of less concern than complaints from some of the democrats' key supporters, who say the cadillac tax will hurt middle-class workers. the bill's sponsor, representative joe courtney of connecticut, titled it the middle class health benefits tax repeal act and recruited 367 sponsors, including 200 democrats.\n\neven some liberal economists, backed by the unions, are urging repeal. the economic policy institute, a liberal research group, argued that health care costs were already decelerating, so the tax was unnecessary both to pay for the health law and to further slow down health cost increases.\n\nto put it simply, the tax aims to reduce patients' utilization of health care, wrote thea m. lee, the president of the institute and a former leader of the a.f.l.-c.i.o., and the economist josh bivens. but the glaring problem of u.s. health costs is not excess utilization; instead it is high and rising prices for health care. smart cost-containment policy should address these prices, not seek to ratchet down how much care patients seek.\n\nwith so many supporters, mr. courtney secured a vote on the house's fast-track calendar, which requires two-thirds of the house to vote for passage, but also allows the bill to bypass rules that would require the cost to be offset by spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere.\n\nrepealing the 40 percent excise tax on generous employer-sponsored health plans would increase projected federal deficits by $197 billion through 2029, according to the budget office, and so far there is no plan for replacing the lost revenue. many health economists, who have generally been the biggest supporters of the tax, still see it as an important way to contain rising health care costs, contending that generous health benefits encourage people to get more medical care than they need.
[music playing]\n\nezra klein\n\ni'm ezra klein, and this is the ezra klein show. i don't want to ruin too much of this show by summarizing it at the top. heather mcghee, who is my guest and the author of the wonderful and really important new book, the sum of us, explains all of it better than i can. so i'm going to let her do it. but i do want to share a connection this conversation made for me that i wish i'd made before i walked into it. and so maybe you'll get more out of it having this earlier than i did. a few years ago, i interviewed a psychologist named lisa feldman barrett, and she had written this really great book about how the mind generates emotions. and her argument is that emotions are metaphors that apply to sensory data. depending on which metaphors our society has given us, we will interpret the same sensory data in different ways. so if you believe yourself to be an anxious person or your society talks about anxiety a lot, you'll likely interpret a speedy heart rate, a bit of stomach churning as anxiety, a bad thing. i know i've done this quite a bit. but another person in another context might feel the same feelings as anticipation or excitement. she tells this funny story about being on a date and thinking it wasn't going well — that the conversation was lame, that the guy was lame. but at the same time, she was flushed and her heart rate was sped up and she felt these butterflies in her stomach, and so she thought, i must be wrong. there must be some real primal connection here. but it just turned out she had food poisoning. her brain had a story, a metaphor. it knew how to apply to those sensory feelings. and so then it got what those feelings met wrong. our brains are prediction machines, and sometimes they predict incorrectly. something that i took from this conversation with heather is that the same thing happens on a societal level. if we grow up in a society cut up by racism, told again and again that our relationships, our policies are zero-sum, that if those people over there are going to progress, it's going to come at our expense, that metaphor will lodge in us. we'll become used to interpreting the data of this world in a zero-sum way. and so a society that needs to tell that zero-sum story again and again and again to justify racial hierarchy and oppression, to justify ill-gotten gains, will also become used to seeing the world through that lens. and so we will deprive ourselves — all of us — of so many opportunities to advance together, because we are so used to fearing that any other group's gain will mean our loss. but even outside that specific outcome, it's just worth thinking about this whole conversation in terms of the deep stories we tell ourselves and the way that trains our mind to think, the way that trains our mind to interpret. when we are useful looking at things one way, we will look at almost everything that way. we'll be quick to impose that story on the world around us. and if that's a bad story, a story of scarcity rather than abundance, of zero-sum rather than positive-sum interactions, then that is a world we'll get. in many cases, that is a world america has now. as always, my email is ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. i'm always interested to know who you'd like to see on the show next or what you think of the show. just send me your suggestions, your feedback. here's heather mcghee. so the metaphor at the center of the book is this idea of the drained public pool. but i want to start in the reality of the drained public pool. tell me about that.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nso in the 1920s, '30s, and '40s, america went on this building boom across the country of this novel thing which was the grand, resort-style, public pool. it was a tangible symbol of government largesse and commitment to the kind of high, leisure-filled quality of life that would become the american dream. it was a melting pot, almost literally. it was a part of the americanization project of bringing white ethnic communities together to have shared recreation. there was a sense that the new america of the 20th century, the early 20th century, needed this kind of public investment to cohere a national identity and improve everyone's quality of life. and there were over 2,000 in the united states, and many of them were for whites only and segregated, as were most of the public benefits at the time. then in the 1950s and '60s, civil rights advocates in black communities started arguing that their tax dollars had funded these grand public pools, and therefore, they should be allowed to swim too. and that's when white towns got really creative. in order to avoid integrating the public pools, they sold them to private entities for $1. they wouldn't provide them in a public way anymore. and then ultimately, in order to avoid integrating them, many of these towns drained their public swimming pools rather than let black families swim too. so of course, the white families lost a public resource as well. the black families never knew the glory days of the well-funded public pool. we started seeing backyard pools crop up around the country and these private members-only swimming clubs — over 100 of them in the d.c. area alone after pool integration — these private clubs that you had to pay. and it was a tangible example, like of course, massive resistance to brown in virginia, where they closed dozens of public schools, where once the idea of the public included people of color, not only was the public no longer good, but white people didn't want public goods at all.\n\nezra klein\n\nit's such a powerful visual. so you went to one of these pools, and they literally poured concrete in it.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nmm-hmm. yeah.\n\nezra klein\n\ni mean, they destroyed something they loved.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nyeah. i traveled to montgomery, alabama, where oak park is still there, but the pool that was the center of the park in the middle of montgomery was filled in, seeded over with grass by the time the next summer came along, and you see this wide expanse rimmed with oak trees now. i actually collected a handful of the acorns from these oak trees just as a reminder of how recent this phenomenon was, and how it can regenerate if we're not careful — these seeds of this exclusion and dispossession. they closed in montgomery the parks and recreation department for a decade, from 1959 to 1969. so they sold off the animals to the zoo. they had no parks and recreation department at all for a decade of the 1960s. and when they reopened the system, they never recreated the pool. they never rebuilt the pool.\n\nezra klein\n\nso i want to hold here for a couple of minutes and talk about the psychology. i think it is easy to listen to something like this and say, well, that's in the before days.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nyep.\n\nezra klein\n\nbut 1969 is not 6,000 years ago. my parents were alive. my brother would be born in a couple of years. that is in living memory. so i want to talk about the psychology that would lead white people to brick over their own public goods rather than share them. at that moment in 1959, when you have leaders in montgomery, alabama — white leaders closing their park department, telling their own children, there will be no pool for you to go to — how do they see themselves as doing the right thing for their children, for themselves? the book, both in this metaphor and in everything else we're going to talk about, is about this idea that this mindset leads to not just black people getting less, but white people getting less. and it literalizes right here. so how are they the heroes of their own story?\n\nheather mcghee\n\nthe story that allows them to be heroes by cutting off their noses despite their face, for example, is a story in which black people have a poverty that is contagious — that black people are both physically unclean and dangerous, more prone to violence, and so would therefore be threatening to the little kids and the — heaven forbid — women in bathing suits. there's a sexualized stereotype around hypersexual black masculinity, that we can't have our white women being anywhere near black men. but there is also the idea, i think, on a deeper level that when generations of white people have been the beneficiaries of these invisible government benefits from the homestead act, the g.i. bill, that have created an actual economic superiority over black people, that idea reifies the idea that there's something innately superior about white people. and so the way i made sense of it was, if you've been taught for generations to disdain and distrust a group of people and exclude them from the circle of human belonging, from citizenship, from economic inclusion, from schools, from unions — the list goes on — neighborhoods, mortgage markets, and then suddenly the same government that was the purveyor of all of that, the government that wrote into its housing codes, do not sell to black people or we will not give you money — that same government almost on a dime said, ok, now you have to swim with those people. you have to go to school with those people. it was a level of betrayal to the white consciousness that made white people want to disengage from a collective that was no longer trustworthy.\n\nezra klein\n\nyou and i grew up in a similar milieu in politics, in this policy analysts world in d.c. and you were at demos, and i was at the american prospect, which at a certain point merged together for a time. and something you talk about is a realization — as that work continued looking at table after table showing how a tax plan or a student debt plan or a health plan would benefit different groups, that there was this myth at the core of policy analysis that what people are trying to do in politics is pursue their economic self-interest. and when you look at examples like this one — but so much that we'll talk about here, so much in the trump era, so much in modern politics too, you just endlessly watch that disproven. you just endlessly watch that narrow distributional table way of measuring what is in somebody's self-interest fail. so when you look at these stories, how do you understand political self-interest?\n\nheather mcghee\n\nyou're right that in many ways, i left the think tank world in order to set out on the three-year journey it took for me to write the sum of us, because i felt like the way the progressive economic orthodoxy was understanding economic self-interest and what was driving people and how to make change — the idea that we could study the problem, put the numbers in front of decision makers, and of course, everybody would benefit — that all seemed very flawed to me, particularly after the election of donald trump. what i understand now is that much more than a material self-interest is a status self-interest — is a self-interest particularly in a society as hierarchical as ours, as brutally hierarchical as ours. being in the middle or on the top of that hierarchy is more important than $7 more an hour for you, is more important than $10,000 off of your student loan bill, is more important than things like taking action to address climate change. all of these obvious self-interest issues have been filtered through a racialized zero-sum story — the idea that progress for people of color has to come at the expense of white people. that is, more than anything i discovered, the major stumbling block to progress in america.\n\nezra klein\n\nso i want to look at some of the policy areas this plays out today, because i think it's important to say this really clearly — drained pools is by no means the most consequential example of drained pool politics. and so i actually want to begin with medicaid expansion after the affordable care act. you cite a study in the book which found that as the percent of the black population increases, the likelihood of medicaid adoption in a state decreases. tell me about that.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nso i look at the racialized history of our unique-among-advanced-economies unwillingness to provide universal health care, and it's just overwhelming, the evidence. from the very beginning, truman tried to have a national health insurance plan. the segregationist dixiecrats in his party opposed it. and then, of course, to obamacare and medicaid expansion. i actually didn't realize until i began researching the book that white americans are pretty vehemently opposed to obamacare and have been. support for it has never reached over 50 percent. it's still an unpopular plan among white americans, even though if you break down the individual policies, white americans are supportive of it. but if you think about medicaid expansion, which is still a fraught battle — we still have a dozen states that have refused to expand medicaid. and as soon as, not incidentally, a states' rights theory was used to knock down the medicaid expansion that should have been universal across 50 states, you had a new mason-dixon line of states mostly in the old confederacy that refused to expand medicaid. and i looked at a bunch of the research that really showed the racialization of health care opinion, and i go to texas, which is the state with the highest uninsured in the population. it is the state with the highest number of rural hospital closings. and these are hospitals that are the lifeblood of these mostly rural, conservative, largely white towns, and they are closing. and a significant degree of the closure is because of unpaid bills by people who should be eligible for medicaid. but the texas political class — the overwhelmingly white, overwhelmingly male political class in texas is absolutely opposed to expanding medicaid. and the idea that i heard from the advocates on the ground was that the idea of medicaid has become a dog whistle for black people. even the latino community in texas — there were many people who said, it's not something we want, because after 40 years of being told that public benefits are only for degraded poor people, you don't want any part of that. admitting that you need medicaid is admitting that you were on the bottom of this social hierarchy that you're going to work like hell to rise above.\n\nezra klein\n\nso i remember covering this. i covered the affordable care act closely. and there are two things about this that always stick in my mind. one is that the medicaid expansion, even with the supreme court decision allowing states to opt out — it was built to be such an extraordinarily good deal for the states. the federal government paid 100 percent of the cost for the first three years, and then it was 90-10 after that. medicaid is usually a much closer match between the federal government and state governments. the federal government was backing up dump trucks of health care money into these red states, and these red states are saying no. but then the consequences are deadly. so a 2019 study by the center for budget and policy priorities found that medicaid expansion saved 19,000 lives from 2014 to 2017, and state decisions not to expand cost 15,600 premature deaths over the same period. and to state the unbelievably obvious, a lot of those are white people. this isn't just not being able to swim in a pool. this is your mother may die, your friend may die — it's shocking.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nit's shocking. it's very upsetting. i did talk to health care advocates who could easily recall people they knew who had died because of a lack of health care coverage. and these are the stakes. this is why i felt the need to write a book making this somewhat controversial argument that racism has a cost for everyone. because when we continue to allow the zero-sum story, the idea that progress for one group comes at the expense of another, it's a lie that we are buying into, and it's a costly lie. i talk about health care in the book. i talk about the lives lost for our unwillingness to — in a way, it is swimming in the same pool, ezra. it's the same risk pool. it's the same health insurance pool. actually, insurers use the word pool.\n\nezra klein\n\nthe wonk is coming out with that pun. [laughter] swimming in the same risk pool.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nthat's right. but i mean, deep must that zero-sum story be to have white americans, the majority of whom have voted against the party of the new deal that largely built the white middle class since that party also expanded to become the party of civil rights too — they're cheering the gutting of public investments that they, in fact, would benefit from. and yet ever since integration, we have had white political majority that has cheered on the cutting of the social safety net, the ratcheting down of welfare to virtual meaninglessness, and the attacks on unions.\n\nezra klein\n\nso one of the things i'm going to want to push on during this conversation is some questions of causality. and so one here is about whether or not this reflects a often counterproductive human belief in certain forms of zero-sum fairness or racism directly. so there are all kinds of studies and experiments in which if people feel somebody else is getting something that is unfair, they will make it so they and everyone else get less in order to keep it from that person getting more. my colleague, sarah kliff — we're both at the new york times now, but back then, we were at vox — she did this extraordinary reporting trip to kentucky early in the trump era. and she was going and looking at and talking to white people in kentucky, poor white people who were benefiting from the affordable care act but were supporting donald trump and supporting a republican party that wanted to repeal it. she got a bunch of explanations, but one thing she kept finding was anger and resentment that the slightly better-off working class white people had towards the slightly poorer white people, because they were paying premiums in the exchanges, and the slightly poorer white people were not paying premiums for medicaid. they felt the poorer white people were getting too much for nothing. so is this just a racialized phenomenon, or is this a deeper thing in which this idea that somebody else is getting more than we are when we're the ones who deserve more than they get just fouls up politics everywhere and always?\n\nheather mcghee\n\nthe zero-sum story — i go back in the book to the beginning — where did we get the zero-sum story? it's not an obvious thing. it's not an obvious belief system. it's not a natural sense of group competition, and it's more widely held among white people than other people. and so i went back to the founding and the pre-founding of this country and showed how it was used to justify the first economic policies of this country, which were stolen people, stolen land, and stolen labor. that zero-sum racial hierarchy created the scaffolding. i do believe that since it's so aggressively marketed to white people through the lens of racial hierarchy, it's very clear to me that a white person can feel that way about other white people as well, that resentment and that desire to distinguish among the various small gradations on this ladder of human value. but it's that ladder of human value that was first mapped onto the american psyche as a racialized project. though disdain and distrust that particularly white americans have for people who are poor is a very racialized view — it's the idea that there's something inherently wrong with people who don't have enough money. it's also — of course, the whole thing is very rich. when you say that people are so resentful of people getting things in an unfair way, i mean, that's what the entirety of the white spoils system has been in this country. and those same people are not resentful of white privilege. those same people are not resentful of the history, which frankly, many of them were taught not to know and worked very hard not to know of all of the litany of free stuff that was given by the government to create the white middle class. and so i do think it's related — the idea of resentment at some idea that somebody is getting something else and the way that we cling as americans to whatever our rung is on this brutal hierarchical ladder.\n\nezra klein\n\nso i want to try to draw out more this psychological model you're suggesting here. so human beings are born, and we're pretty malleable in the way we can understand society working. there have been lots of different ways society has been composed going way, way, way back through the ages, and lots of different ways they're composed around the world now. so it's obvious to me looking at some of these studies that we all have a tendency to be willing to either be altruistic and believe we should be helping each other, or to be pulled towards a selfish, zero-sum, angry, resentful — i have a toddler, and i will see this — just flipping every couple of hours depending on mood. and so what you're saying is that in a society riven by racism, more of a story that gets people thinking in a zero-sum resentful way is told and told and retold and retold. and if i understand you, it falls within particular power. that's why people say, look at black people. but it's a way you have structured your thinking so that it also becomes natural for you to think of other white people this way, people of other social classes this way, maybe people of other countries this way. that once this model of this is the right way to understand your competition with others takes hold in your brain, it's an easy metaphor to start applying everywhere. and so these things that maybe have a beginning in the need to construct and sustain this racial caste system begin to be applied more broadly over time. is that true to how you think about it, or am i getting that story wrong?\n\nheather mcghee\n\nno, i think that is right. when you create this hierarchy of human value, and you feel that there are only so many rungs on that ladder, and if someone gets on your rung, that means you have nowhere to go but down — that can apply to immigrants, different kinds of immigrants over different time, that can apply to women coming into the workforce, et cetera. but i will say that for me, it was important to note that the zero-sum racial hierarchy is a story that has been relentlessly packaged and marketed and sold by people who benefit the most from the economic status quo. it is not something that is a predominant white working class idea on its own. everything we believe comes from a story we've been told. and whether it's rupert murdoch and the desire for a billionaire to have a propaganda mechanism where the zero-sum story is really the core narrative that finds a new example every hour to the person with the biggest bull horn in the world for four years, to donald trump, and everything in between, the conservative orthodoxy around makers and takers and freeloaders and taxpayers and reagan's shifting of the narrative of what was wrong with black people from white oppression to cultures of black poverty — all of that is a story that political and economic elites have sold for their own profit to a white majority that then continues to vote for their perceived racial interest instead of their class interest with brown and black americans who are often struggling from the same economic challenges.\n\nezra klein\n\ni always think of donald trump in this model, because trump is somebody who i think you really see had a temperament oriented towards this kind of zero-sum thinking, and then applied it to everything despite being at the very top of the ladder. i mean, he's somebody who was racist, but also his understanding, as far as i could tell, of all relationships between america and other countries was that we were either winning or losing the transaction. his understanding of all business deals was he was either winning the deal or he was losing the deal. his understanding of all human relations was he was either winning and dominating or losing and being made weak. and it always struck me in him and in its appeal to people that it is actually, sadly, much harder to make people think about the ways in which a world can be positive-sum, the ways in which a deal can benefit both sides simultaneously, than the ways in which it can be zero-sum. and so there's this real danger of people who have either felt this or seen this or oriented towards it, and then that becomes the only way they can think about life.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nyeah. i mean, i do my best in the book to try to find examples time and time again that give lie to the idea of the zero-sum not only enumerating the costs of racism to white people, to widen the aperture that has completely unwittingly and not at all with anything but positive intent communicated a story in recent years of white privilege that suggests that racism is good for white people, so maybe they should actually keep it. if i'm told all the time that racism is to my benefit, the only thing i have to make me want to join with racial justice advocates to fight against racism is a sense of self-sacrifice. and at a time of widening insecurity, that's not enough. it's also not true. i mean, we hit on the formula in this country for making broadly-shared prosperity for the masses. and we walked away from it because of racism. that is more clear to me now than ever. and you get reports coming out every six months it seems from citigroup this summer saying that we've lost nearly $20 trillion in economic output because of the racial-economic divides over the past 20 years. or the federal reserve bank just this past week — a report saying we lost $2 trillion in economic output in 2019 because of the economic gaps between white men and everybody else. it's no way to run a country. we're leaving some of our best players on the sidelines. [music playing]\n\nezra klein\n\nso you mentioned earlier that if you look at public opinion about the affordable care act just among white people, it has never been popular. though the affordable care act is now above 50 percent in polling, it is not above 50 percent among white people. i mean, if you at, say, votes for donald trump, donald trump would have won if only white people voted. and one way of reading this that i see sometimes, it's just like, white people are conservative. but something that you draw out, and that you see, i think, if you look at europe, is that that is a reaction to america's particular history with race and its racial divide. so there's obviously nothing genetic about white people that causes them to favor these politics, or else canada would not have a universal health care system, the uk wouldn't have it, denmark wouldn't have it, switzerland wouldn't have it. in other places, white people do not have the politics that white people in america have.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nmm-hmm. that's exactly right. everything we believe comes from a story we've been told, and the story that has been aggressively marketed to white americans has been that there is something so wrong with black and brown people that you don't want to be in collaboration with or in solidarity with them or else that reflects on you. there is a hierarchy of human value. you'd better fight like heck to maintain your position in that hierarchy. i think it's really important not to even inadvertently communicate that there's some sort of biological basis for these group-identity-related psychologies. i talk about it in terms of the slogan that's become very popular in some places on the left. trust black women. i'm a black woman. i want you to trust me. i want to trust stacey abrams. i want you to trust ayanna pressley. i agree to a certain degree, but i was always a little bit wary of it, because it suggests there's something biologically amazing and magical about us. and in fact, it's not that. it's that there is a social hierarchy, that group identity does shape your experience of the world and how the systems shape your life, and so people who are at the intersectional bottom of that social hierarchy are the ones who have the clearest view of all of it — all who is harmed by it, and what you need to do to fix it for everyone.\n\nezra klein\n\ni want to move to another example in the book, which is higher education. you connect the transition from publicly financed higher education, which we really did have through much of the 20th century — you really could go to college on the government's dime and not come out with tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans — and you connect the racialization of this and the way that the politics of race deformed white attitudes towards public spending to the student debt crisis today. can you talk through that story a bit?\n\nheather mcghee\n\nthis was really important to me, because there actually has been a lot of reporting about poor and working class white people who reject welfare and means-tested medicaid, because they're so silly. they cut off their noses despite their faces and tsk-tsk about them. but i want to talk about something that was a much more middle class issue, which is college. the somewhat novel idea of well-funded public colleges, at least one in every state, was one of the hallmarks of the american whites-only social contract for the first half of the 20th century. all of that changed with a new post-civil rights movement anti-government ethos among the white voting majority which wanted tax cuts and not public spending, which wanted a sense of pulling up the ladder and divesting from these places that had become really fraught and contested spaces like public education of the k through 12 level. public college became a place where integration was being threatened. and so it's not normally conceived of. first of all, most people don't know that we have so much student loan debt because of government cutbacks of states spending less per capita on public college despite a growing tax base and a federal shift from grants to loans. people don't know that it's government cutbacks that created the student debt problem. and they certainly typically don't map the issue of race and racism onto it. but the shift in the expectation of free college for a majority white college-going population to a debt for diploma system for a predominantly students of color population is one of the most dramatic examples of racism draining the pool. and if i can just add, it's so frustrating, because it's seen as a colorblind issue. student debt — the rules that we changed in order to make student debt the new normal were not explicitly racist like redlining or all of that. but when you say suddenly to a generation, not only do you have to go to college to get a middle class job because of changes we've made in the labor market, but you will now have to fund that college out of your own family's wealth, knowing full well that family wealth is where history shows up in your wallet, where the amount of money you have in savings or cds or home equity absolutely tracks to what side of the color line you were on when the government was handing out free wealth building opportunities, you get what you have now, which is a widening of the racial wealth gap, which is the fact that a black family with a college degree has less wealth than a white family headed by a high school dropout. it's colorblind, but it's systemically racist, and it impacts not just the targeted community, but also the majority of white students who have to borrow now too.\n\nezra klein\n\nthis, i think, is such an important point. i want to hold on it for a minute, because something i was thinking about reading the book is a little bit subtle here. so if you think about the way a lot of american public policy has changed over the decades you're tracking, basically, it moves from the government does things that you just get, like public college, to you have to pay out of pocket for it. and so that's really a move from something that builds wealth in the future to takes income in the present. and so then, what looks like a fair race to people — i mean, everybody's getting this chance to go to college and get a pell grant — but in fact, as you say here, is reflecting that if you got in when the getting was good, you have the assets to then pay for the thing you need now and just have it then continue to build wealth. and that's where it seems we get into some of this widening wealth gap stuff. and i'd like to talk about the mechanisms of that a little bit, because i think it's really important, wherein if you have family who can pay for your higher education, and so then you go to college and you get a really good job, then you just start rebuilding wealth. but if you have family who couldn't pay for your higher education costs, and so you go to college and you get a good job, but you're paying off hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt, and you're also helping other members of your family who maybe don't have as much as you do, then you don't build wealth. it helps your income some, but it doesn't translate into your wealth, and so the gap just keeps widening. i really feel like the dynamics of wealth creation are understudied and under-emphasized in politics, where we tend to talk about income. but in many ways, they seem to me to be more important.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nin my time at demos, we really focused on these issues of wealth and debt, because it is so much more compounding in terms of opportunity and disadvantage than an income. you could get a great job today or tomorrow. you could get a great contract. you could have enough money in a given paycheck to pay your bills. but the question of what happens when that paycheck stops or is paused or you feel sick and can't go in is life determining. and that is where, basically, we're all paying compound interest on decisions made long before we were born — racially explicit decisions. there's a section in the book where i lay out the list of free stuff that was given to white americans to help build wealth. and it's so important to recognize that the divides that everyday people observe today — what's going on with that black neighborhood? why does it feel like it doesn't have as many small businesses? why does it seem like the schools in black neighborhoods are underfunded? well, they're linked to property values, which are a result of generations of explicit laws forbidding black people from owning homes and selling them. and so we have this now somewhat colorblind story of economic disparity today that we try with the american mythology of individual effort and bootstraps and just overall individualism to justify by saying, well, black people just don't try that hard. but in fact, it's not that black people don't try that hard. it's in fact that decisions were made long before many black people and white people were born, and when we ended the era of explicit racial wealth stripping policies — i'm going to put a caveat in that around the subprime mortgage crisis, which we may come back to — we didn't take that into account. and that's why there's such a vocal call now for reparations, because no amount of education or income that black families do is going to make up for generations of racism in our wealth building markets.\n\nezra klein\n\nso senator cory booker and congresswoman ayanna pressley have this idea for baby bonds, which is a wealth generating proposal. and they calculate that it would close about a half to two-thirds of the racial wealth gap, at least if you're measuring that from the median, not the mean. and for a long time in the democratic party, there was this idea that because the politics of race are so difficult, because framing things for race creates these drain the pool mentalities. so what you want to do is you want to have racially progressive policies that you sell in a colorblind way. and in recent years, there's been an almost reversal, i think, having to do with the dynamics inside the democratic party, where policies that are literally colorblind, like this baby bonds policy, are being sold in a very race-conscious way, as a way of, say, closing the racial wealth gap. given the research you've done here, and so the grappling you've done with the politics that happen when you frame things around race, where do you come down on that?\n\nheather mcghee\n\nso what that's reflecting is the hard fact that the majority of white americans have not voted for democrats since the civil rights movement. and so when we were growing up and there was this fear of the white center all the time in politics, it was a cold calculation. the new calculation is that what the democrats are riding to victory is a new, multiracial, anti-racist coalition, the backbone of which is black people, and then the white people who join are progressives who don't mind sitting in a meeting with and swimming in a pool with black people. they came for obama, they stayed to fight against trump. now they like it. so that is, i think, what explains that shift. i think the idea is we've got to deal with these racial disparities. i think it is a genuine desire to see this country prosper by making sure that all families have what they need and that we don't keep holding back millions of american families because of bad public policy decisions. but i think the politics of it are, yes, we can actually talk about the race impacts of this, because there's a clamoring for racial justice. and the white democrats who are with us are basically there because of their racial attitudes.\n\nezra klein\n\nbut in a world where you have to sell that beyond the democratic party, is that a bad strategy?\n\nheather mcghee\n\ni wrote this book because i think it's important to talk about the benefits of moving beyond drained pool politics for all people, including white people. we have reached the economic and moral limits of the zero-sum world view that was handed to us at the founding of this nation. and i do believe that today's inequality insecurity dysfunction has as its unifying core this majority-white belief in a zero-sum racial hierarchy. and so i'm trying to make this an invitation to white americans to join in, to release this really false and illusory idea that they're so different from people of color and so much better than people of color that they don't want to be in fellowship with people of color, get a sense of patriotism about who we are as americans, all of us, and move forward together. joe biden, in his first speech on race as president, was issuing a bunch of racial equity executive orders. and he actually said, for too long, we've allowed a narrow, cramped view of the promise of this nation to fester. we've bought the world view that america is a zero-sum game in many cases. if you succeed, i fail. if you get ahead, i fall behind. if you get the job, i lose mine. maybe worst of all, if i hold you down, i lift myself up. but racism is corrosive, it's destructive, and it's costly. it costs every american, not just those who have felt the sting of racial injustice. so that, for me, was a big win. the idea that this man who — in many ways, joe biden is an avatar of the white moderate who's had a huge journey himself on these issues, who's always wanted to have his heart in the right place. god, he even was a lifeguard in a black pool. it doesn't get any more apt than this. he followed the white moralizing logic into the crime bill of the 1990s. he was opposed to busing for school integration. and yet, then he became barack obama's best friend, and also, i think, did what good politicians do, which is read the moment and recognize that his constant moral compass now demanded something much bolder in terms of confronting the persistence of racial inequality and systemic racism. and yet, because he's still got his finger on the pulse of the scranton white american politics, he needed to call out the scapegoating. he needed to say, hey, i'm nostalgic for that time too, when a white guy could go into a factory and come out with being set for life. but it wasn't the black folks and the immigrants who took that factory job away. and in fact, this divided politics is propping up a party and an economic worldview that is stripping opportunity from your family and your neighborhoods and your communities. i was really proud, obviously, as you can imagine, to see that moment happen, and to see him try to speak to white americans to say that it doesn't have to be a zero-sum game.\n\nezra klein\n\none thing that touches on is that i think in politics for a long time, it's been believed there are two ways of approaching this. one is to deal directly with racism and the fact that you're trying to close racial economic divides, and the other is to ignore it, to pretend you don't know anything about racial economic divides, and you've just got this economic policy. but you've been involved with ian haney lópez in some research that has this other idea, which is to say that in fact, the human mind does have a us-versus-them tendency. it is a powerful thing to harness in politics. this is how i read it. i don't think this is how ian or you would frame it. and that the most powerful messaging is to say that there are powerful economic interests that are using racial division to enrich themselves and keep everyone else down. and so there's actually a different synthesis here that is more effective, but it's not one that ignores division. it is one that recasts division. i'm curious to hear you talk a little bit about that.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nthat's exactly right. this idea that racism has a cost for everyone animated a massive public opinion and political messaging project that ian haney lópez, who was my law professor at berkeley, and anat shenker-osorio, who's a linguist and political message strategist, led to try to square the circle of the divide in progressive messaging. so you have the race left, which is talking about racial disparities and racial injustice, and which definitely galvanizes many people of color, though not all, and many white people who've made it part of their identity to be anti-racist, and then you have the class left that often says, you know what, that's divisive. let's talk about economic populism, and let's talk about the plutocrats and the 99 percent. there's no difference among the 99 percent. it's the 1 percent versus everybody else. and what we found was that given how overwhelmingly powerful the megaphone is for the zero-sum scapegoating story, it wasn't effective even with persuadable, slightly progressive voters, to ignore that zero-sum story and just say, hey, no, it's about the 1 percent and the 99 percent. ignore those divides. ignore the stereotypes that are deeply ingrained in your brain about immigrants and poor black people. ignore what donald trump is saying and what fox news is saying and what your neighbor is saying. you have to actually give people a new way to think about that dominant narrative, because it's not like they can ignore the dominant narrative. they need to recast the dominant narrative as a tool of the plutocrats, as a tool that stops us from joining together across lines of race to do what we can only do together and what we can't do alone — things like adequately fund our infrastructure and our schools, things like tackle climate change, things like rewrite our trade laws to make sure that every american who wants one has a decent job. and it's really important to not ignore just how profoundly racialized the story of the american economy and government is and has been for all of our history. so if you try to bring colorblind tools to convince people about their economic self-interest while ignoring just how profoundly racialized the economic story is, you just won't succeed. [music playing]\n\nezra klein\n\ni spent a lot of time grappling while thinking about the book with the way in which policies that begin with racist roots get out of control. they slip their reins, and they become broadly applied, hurting a lot of people of all different races, and also in a funny way, non-racist in their modern intent, but still terrible. so you have a discussion in the book of single-family zoning. and single-family zoning is a policy with extraordinarily racist roots, and particularly so in california, where i live. and in san francisco, where i live, single-family zoning has made it unbelievably unaffordable for basically anybody to live here — black people, brown people, but also white people. i know tons of white people who have had to leave or have not been able to raise a family here because of single-family zoning. and one of the stories about this that began to take shape in my head is that there's obviously the case of policies that are directly racialized even now, like medicaid, that the racialization of them ends up draining the pool. a lot of white people benefit from medicaid, but they're voting against it on race grounds. but then there's something like single-family vote zoning where i was talking to somebody doing survey research on this, and they were saying that in fact, single-family zoning is popular among everybody when you ask about it, voters of all races, but it's making things unaffordable for everybody. you built zoning policy on the zero-sum racial idea, and now you have zero-sum zoning policy which only works to the advantage, if it works to anybody's advantage, of either the rich or the people who already live there, the incumbents. and that as a way of thinking about policy generally, that strikes me as very powerful that if you are engaged in zero-sum policy construction or zero-sum policy framing, that no matter whether or not you think now that you've cut the division well, you have no idea, eventually, which side of that you are going to be caught on — that zero-sum logic — it grows.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nyeah, that's actually a really good way of thinking about it. i totally agree that the crisis of affordable housing is a great example of racism costing everyone. and i also, in my mind, when i think about the zero-sum logic growing out of control and leaping off the rails, as you said — i think about the financial crisis. i think about a totally racialized mortgage market where, for generations, the idea that black and brown people were risky — so risky that the government drew lines around black and brown neighborhoods and said, we will not guarantee a backstop — the mortgages, as we were doing for the entire mortgage market, of any mortgages sold in these neighborhoods, because it's just too risky. never substantiated. never substantiated, this idea, but it was just a common sense that black people are going to be risky. that then was replaced very quickly by a lightly regulated mortgage market in the 1990s that, at the end of redlining, which happened in the late 1970s, you had about 10 years of fits and starts of black people emerging into the mainstream mortgage market. and then you have the advent of the subprime mortgage, which was totally justified. it was pretty zero-sum. it was like, these lenders can make double what they were making by increasing the interest rates on these loans. and it will cost handsomely the borrower. but it's ok, because what's happening is these lenders are pricing for risk. and so you had the advent of these high-cost loans. the idea was, they were supposed to be marketed and sold to people with lower credit scores. but in fact, the majority of subprime loans before the crash went to people with credit scores that would have allowed them to get prime loans. it was just, the limit was what you could get away with selling people. and this mechanism was first test it out in black neighborhoods of existing homeowners. i mean, it's the thing that i actually get the most emotional about in terms of this book and all of these ideas. it's these communities that had just been excluded out of the american dream for so long that finally got their piece of it, and then there was a knock on the door, and brokers came in and said, you could really consolidate your debt. we could get you a better interest rate. and they just lied and they cheated and they swindled — and cascading losses in black and brown neighborhoods that then once the mortgage market saw how much money was being made and how much the government was not going to stop them — and in fact, the federal government took actions only to make it easier for lenders to avoid consumer protections in the early 2000s — then the wheels were off. and then it was a open season on the wider and whiter mortgage market. and if i do anything with my book, i want people to jettison this narrative that we actually heard from mayor bloomberg — that it was the financial crisis, which cost us so much as a country and as a globe, was the fault of the victims of redlining, was the fault of black and brown people who got in over their heads, who shouldn't have been in those houses in the first place, who were financially illiterate, when in fact, what happened was just a quintessentially american mix of racism and greed that was enabled by structural racism and institutional racism and that then, of course, most direly impacted the finances of black families who have still not recovered. the home ownership rate is back to what it was before the fair housing act. it's just devastating. and yet it also costs millions of american jobs of white people and foreclosures in white neighborhoods as well.\n\nezra klein\n\none thing this book is doing is providing a different deep story of american politics and policy making — a different understanding of what's been going on under the hood in the way we think and then the outcomes that kind of thinking has. and one of your suggestions in the final chapter of the book relates very directly to how we might change that story, which is this idea of a truth, racial healing, and transformation commission. and i think about this a lot. i've talked to people who are more expert in this area than i am. and i go back and forth on it, because i always wonder, how do you make sure, given what we see, let's just say, with the insurrection on the capitol — given how hard it is to get americans to agree on any kind of truth now, how could you do something like this that would result in more healing rather than more division? but you've thought about this. so when you imagine something like that, how would it look? what makes you confident that would help?\n\nheather mcghee\n\nwell, first, it wouldn't be a blue ribbon commission in washington like the kerner commission or the clinton commission on race. it would be a ground-up effort at the community level, which i think is really important. this is not about experts picking up history books and learning what they should already know. this is about communities coming together, people who really already have a stake in the well-being of their community. i talked to folks in dallas who have created this truth, racial healing, and transformation hub which invites stakeholders from the cops to racial justice advocates, from librarians and schoolteachers to business leaders, to come together and do a few key things to rewrite the racial history of their community to create what's known as a community history. and the people who did this in dallas said 90 plus percent the people we talked to just didn't know — white, black, or brown. there's just so much we don't know. there's so, so much in so many ways, like the lost cause profoundly won in terms of our historical imagination. i was talking to someone earlier today who's from st. louis, which is the city where there was the huge fairground pool riot that i talk about in the book, where the largest public pool that we can find record of was closed after a bunch of racial riots and integration. and she had no memory of it. she wasn't able to find lots of people in her community who had memory of it. and this is a black woman. we've just erased so much of the knowledge. and so we're left to puzzle out — why is it we can't — i open the book saying, why is it we can't seem to have nice things? why are we not addressing climate change? why are we not having universal health care? why is it so hard for working families to make ends meet? why does it feel like we keep falling behind and falling apart? and so when you give people the truth — sometimes people talk about putting a racial equity lens on an issue. i think it's taking blinders off — just allow people to know the full story of our community's history, the beauty and the struggle. then you get people on the same page, and then you can turn it. i do think it needs to be the federal government to adopt this as a national effort, but it needs to be implemented at the local level. i tried for almost 20 years to give rational, economic, self-interest arguments to decision makers and to white people who are listening to me talk on meet the press and whatever, to say, what let's do something about the struggling middle class, which is a diverse middle class now. and it wasn't working. we still have this racialized politics. we still have the majority of white people voting for donald trump. and i think i became hopeful at the end of writing this book, because there is a yearning, i think, in all of us for human connection. the bullhorn that is the loudest is the zero-sum, but it's also true that the largest social movement in american history is black lives matter in 2020, that you now have millions more white people who want a way out of the moral and economic quandary that is american racism. there are these moments where the brutal ugliness of the american lie causes a groundswell and an opening and a pivot. all of this is our history. it's the struggle and the beauty at all times. and i think the more we can see these kinds of conversations where people really connect on a human level and at the local level — i hate to sound like a federalist here, but i do think it's really important for people to experience this with people they have relationships with in communities where they really have real bonds, to see what it's like to have a shared story of american struggle and american progress.\n\nezra klein\n\nis donald trump himself an apotheosis of drain the pool politics? and i mean this in two ways. one is that he follows barack obama, so there's, for the first time, an african-american president. and then white people, largely — i mean not exclusively, but overwhelmingly are the ones who make donald trump his successor. and trump is a pretty manifestly unqualified, incompetent, erratic guy. we get a lot of death and destruction as a result with coronavirus. but then at the end, when trump loses reelection, and you have the storming of the capitol, it's such a perfectly literal if we can't have this country, no one can — this political system that did pretty damn well for white people, actually. i mean, you can actually make a somewhat different argument for non-white people until much more recently, but did pretty damn well for white people. america has gotten pretty rich. and it's like, enough of it. enough. we'll pave it over. we'll fill the pool. there's a lot of policy in the book, but i actually thought there was this amazing literalization of it into politics — it must have been right while you were finishing, or probably after you had finished, actually — that you really see the power of this. because for a political party that has so wrapped itself in the flag and patriotism for so long to so literally give up — like to attack cops and storm the capitol, it becomes very hard to deny that this is the tendency, this is the reaction.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nit's a book about the economy, but i do include a chapter on democracy, because on the list of nice things that we can't seem to have because of racism, a functioning representative democracy is pretty high up on the list. and so i traced the history of all of the ways that, from our founding, elites attacked the bedrock of what is a pretty bold and beautiful idea, which is self governance and representative democracy, in order to keep room for racism and slavery and racial subjugation. i have an extremely long section of notes in this book that is kind of a joke with my publisher. but one of the longest notes — i think actually the longest note is what i put in the notes instead of going into long detail about colfax, louisiana, which is a story of one of the many but one of the most deadly anti-democracy racial mob violence stories in american history. i did finish the book long before january 6th, but colfax, louisiana, is in the book. and colfax, louisiana, is the story of a white mob storming the courthouse where an election result was going to be certified for a reconstruction era governor who won office with a multiracial voting population. and they attacked the courthouse. black people tried to defend the courthouse. they slaughtered 100 black neighbors, and then burned the courthouse. this white, racist mob was willing to burn down the edifice of their own government rather than submit to a multiracial democracy.\n\nezra klein\n\ni think that is a good place to come to a close. so the final section of the podcast is around book recommendations. and i want to start here. what's, in your view, the best novel or movie for understanding race in america?\n\nheather mcghee\n\ni don't think it's been written yet. i don't think it's been shot yet, to be honest. we're just now starting to tell stories that include black people as more than supporting characters or immigrants as villains. but i grew up as a sci-fi and fantasy nerd, and so parable of the sower continues to be just profoundly prescient and a beautiful must-read for everyone.\n\nezra klein\n\nwhat's the one book you would give joe biden to read if he asked for a recommendation?\n\nheather mcghee\n\ni would love for joe biden to read a book called the color of law richard rothstein, which really helps explain the way that government segregated america. he's got a big commitment to racial equity at the center of his administration, and he's got to see all the different ways that it's government policy — many of those policies that are still on the books — that are segregating us and keeping us apart.\n\nezra klein\n\none of my favorite heather mcghee facts is that you really wanted to be a television writer. so what's your favorite tv series?\n\nheather mcghee\n\ni wanted to be a tv writer when i was growing up, because i wanted to be the black norman lear. i felt that television had this amazing power to tell americans who other americans were, and therefore cohere a national story of our relative goodness or merit. and so norman lear — i mean, he did sanford and son, he did good times, the jeffersons, all in the family, maude — all of these real, working, middle-class, totemic reflections of who we were and who we were becoming that really grappled with the issues of the day. i don't know. i don't that we've done much better than that in terms of tv shows that people are actually really watching.\n\nezra klein\n\nbut so what is one of those you'd recommend if people don't know their history?\n\nheather mcghee\n\ni think good times is amazing.\n\nezra klein\n\nthat's a good recommendation. and finally, you and i both have two-year-olds. what's your favorite children's book or your favorite book to read to your child?\n\nheather mcghee\n\nso we are really into the word collector these days. do you know this book?\n\nezra klein\n\ni have not. no. i've heard of it, but i have not read.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nit's about a boy named jerome — it's a little black boy — who collects words. some people collect stamps and coins and rocks. jerome collects words. and my son collects words. he pauses on words he's never heard. he ruminates on them, and then he loves to throw them back out at us. and it's a really beautiful story of a little black boy who collects words that he hears and comes across. and then at the end — hate to give away the ending — it's only like 10 pages long — he spills all of his bag of words off a mountaintop to give them to other children. and he has no words to describe how happy that makes them.\n\nezra klein\n\noh, i love that.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nit's so nice.\n\nezra klein\n\nthat's wonderful. the reason i now ask that one in every episode, because i've just decided children's books are both nicer and more affecting somehow. they tuck a lot of emotion into a contained space.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nyeah, they're all we need, really. let's write a children's book, ezra. what's your favorite these days?\n\nezra klein\n\nooh, i have a couple that i love. but i've become — the two that i love most are — there's an illustrated book around the song what a wonderful world — the one sung by louis armstrong. and it is — it'll bring tears to your eyes. it is beautiful. i don't remember the illustrator offhand, but i just love it. i sing it to my son every night. and then i really love a book called the quiet book. it's a book about how there are many kinds of quiet, but it's very true in a strange way about all these different moments and different kinds of quiet. and it's a little bit unusual for a kids book in — maybe it's not that unusual, but it has a lot of somewhat sad and intense forms of quiet, like others telling secrets quiet or last one picked up from school quiet. and also happy ones, like tucking in teddy quiet. and i just find it very affecting. i really like the quiet book. and your book, of course, is the sum of us, and everybody, including joe biden should read it. it's really fantastic. congratulations on writing it and publishing it. thank you very much.\n\nheather mcghee\n\nthank you very much, ezra.

every state is required to provide medicaid coverage to certain groups: poor children and pregnant women, people with disabilities, and poor older people requiring long-term care. but the obamacare expansion provides coverage for many poor parents and childless adults who were less often covered in the program. the health law provides federal funding for states to include all residents who earn below or just above the federal poverty line — the limit is about $16,000 for a single person.\n\nin the first three years of the expansion, the federal government paid 100 percent of the tab. but now states need to chip in a small share to cover the expansion population's medical bills. that share, 5 percent this year, is set to rise to 10 percent in 2020.\n\nsome state governments and local think tanks have prepared estimates of the costs and benefits of medicaid expansion in their region. but the avalere analysis is the first to apply a consistent methodology across all of the states that have declined to expand. some of the numbers are big. florida would get an estimated $26 billion over the next decade, according to avalere; north carolina $13 billion.\n\nthe medicaid expansion has been the subject of substantial scholarly attention. strong evidence suggests states' expansion has helped improve the financial health of their low-income residents, as well as the financial performance of local hospitals. studies also show that medicaid coverage has helped low-income americans get access to health care, though there is not yet strong evidence about whether it has improved their physical health.
washington — neera tanden, president biden's nominee to head the office of management and budget, suffered a significant setback on monday as two moderate republicans said they would not support her nomination, potentially dooming her chances for confirmation.\n\nthe statements of opposition from senators susan collins of maine and mitt romney of utah, two republicans with a professed willingness to work with the biden administration, further winnowed ms. tanden's chances in an evenly divided senate. three senators in four days have announced plans to vote against her, after senator joe manchin iii, democrat of west virginia, became the first to publicly oppose her confirmation.\n\na white house official said on monday that the administration continued to stand behind ms. tanden's nomination, but her path to confirmation was increasingly narrow. her failure to win confirmation would be the first casualty for mr. biden, who has so far been able to win senate support for several other cabinet picks, though many nominees have yet to face full senate votes.\n\nms. tanden's fate consumed the white house on monday, as continued questions about her history of attacking both republicans and progressive democrats threatened to undercut mr. biden's promise to bring a unifying tone to washington. when pressed repeatedly about whether mr. biden had any problems with ms. tanden's social media practices, jen psaki, the white house press secretary, avoided answering directly and focused on the nominee's qualifications.
1. high-stakes maneuvering on health care:\n\nsenate republicans unveiled their answer to obamacare: a 142-page bill drafted in secret that includes deep cuts to medicaid, impedes access to abortion and shifts resources from the poor to the rich.\n\nfive republican senators say they will not support the bill as it stands — meaning that mitch mcconnell, the senate majority leader, above, may be ready to accept a loss if he manages to push the measure to a vote this week.
of course i am concerned, said gov. brian sandoval, the republican governor of nevada, where about 300,000 people have gained medicaid coverage. i am someone who elected to expand medicaid. that's been very beneficial to my state, and i want to be sure those individuals can keep their coverage.\n\ngovernors are all in agreement, said gov. terry mcauliffe of virginia, a democrat who is the chairman of the national governors association. we do not want one single one of our citizens to lose access to quality health care. we are all unified on that. actually, we want to expand, so everybody has access to quality health care.\n\nmr. trump brushed aside opinion polls suggesting that the 2010 health law was becoming somewhat more popular. people hate it, the president said, but now they see that the end is coming and they're saying, 'oh, maybe we love it.' there's nothing to love. it's a disaster, folks.\n\nbecause of the intricate procedures that govern budget legislation and the inherent complexity of health care, republicans appear unlikely to undo the health law as quickly as they had hoped. mr. trump said congress must tackle the affordable care act before it can overhaul the tax code, also a high priority for republicans. and those delays could slow work on other priorities like a trillion-dollar infrastructure push.
washington — president obama vetoed legislation friday that would have repealed the affordable care act and stripped all federal funds from planned parenthood, writing in his veto message that the measure would reverse the significant progress we have made in improving health care in america.\n\nmr. obama's veto — only the eighth of his presidency — was expected, and his decision to issue a simple message without holding a public ceremony indicated that he did not wish to draw attention to the showdown. republicans do not have the votes in the house or the senate to override the veto.\n\nbut it shows that nearly six years after its enactment, the health law remains one of the most divisive political issues of the obama presidency. for many americans, the health law is seen as costly, cumbersome and a government infringement on freedoms, even as it has spread health coverage to millions and ensured popular benefits like ending lifetime coverage limits and the denial of insurance for pre-existing medical conditions. this week's house vote was the 62nd to fully or partly repeal the health law but only the first that sent legislation to the president's desk.\n\nthe white house has long expected that the fierce politicking around the law would wane as millions of people got coverage and other issues took center stage. but while some republican governors have decided to take advantage of the law's provisions to expand medicaid coverage in their states, republican legislators in congress remain persuaded that the law is collapsing and are determined to help it fail. republicans also showed they could use arcane budgetary rules to circumvent a democratic filibuster and pass repeal legislation for the signature of a republican president.
washington — several republican senators on monday proposed a partial replacement for the affordable care act that would allow states to continue operating under the law if they choose, a proposal meant to appeal to critics and supporters of former president barack obama's signature health law.\n\nbut the plan was attacked by democrats as a step back from the affordable care act's protections, and it was unlikely to win acceptance from conservative republicans who want to get rid of the law and its tax increases as soon as possible. if anything, the proposal — by senators bill cassidy of louisiana, a medical doctor, and susan collins of maine, a moderate republican — may show how difficult it will be for republicans to enact a replacement for the affordable care act.\n\nlegislation that can pass muster in the more conservative house may not win enough support in the senate. a bill with broad appeal in the senate may fail in the house.\n\nunder the proposal, states could stay with the affordable care act, or they could receive a similar amount of federal money, which consumers could use to pay for medical care and health insurance. we are moving the locus of repeal to state government, mr. cassidy said. states should have the right to choose.
indeed, members of the freedom caucus — which is supported by outside conservative groups — have often claimed the mantle of pure conservatism, but their tactics have been seen by many in their party as uniformly counterproductive.\n\ntime after time, they undermined republican leaders' efforts to secure wins for the conservative cause by overreaching and demanding the impossible.\n\nthey have anointed representative mark meadows of north carolina as their leader and principal spokesman. but they occasionally get help from three senators sympathetic to their cause: ted cruz of texas, rand paul of kentucky and mike lee of utah.\n\nat critical times, house conservatives have forced their party to make deals with representative nancy pelosi of california, the democratic leader — an idea anathema to most republicans, who would seethe.\n\nthis time, by negotiating with mr. trump on the complex issue of health care, a measure whose complexity he did not seem to fully grasp, they moved an already contentious bill further and further to the right, eliminating too many benefits to keep moderate and other conservative members on board. even mr. trump was said to be taken aback by their attempts to remove things republicans have long promised to keep, like health insurance benefits for children up to 26 years old.\n\ngiven that the house and senate majorities were built on a promise to repeal and replace mr. obama's signature health care law, many lawmakers fear electoral repercussions. it is painfully ironic that members from safe, conservative congressional districts who can't ever quite seem to get to 'yes' make it harder to enact good, conservative public policy like repealing obamacare, said michael steel, a republican strategist and former aide to mr. boehner.\n\nthis seemed lost on many freedom caucus members on friday. part of the legislative process is working with people who have different ideas, said representative justin amash, republican of michigan. this process from the beginning wasn't designed to do that.
yet public opposition to the law has ticked up again in recent months, in part because the cost of coverage from the law's insurance exchanges is rising in many states for 2016. the most recent kaiser family foundation tracking poll found 46 percent of americans had an unfavorable opinion of the law, compared with 40 percent who viewed it favorably. this has left the law a weapon of choice for republicans in congress, particularly in an election year in which speaker paul a. ryan is seeking to set the policy agenda.\n\na lot of what members on my side of the aisle predicted has come to pass, said senator susan collins, republican of maine, citing increased premiums, higher deductibles and confusion among employers as to what constitutes full-time work. a lot of the issues that directly affect people's pocket books have turned out to be negative. i continue to believe, however, that our party must have a plan for replacing and fixing obamacare and not just repealing it.\n\nrepublicans concede that if they win the white house, simply repealing the law will no longer be sufficient. republicans in congress have yet to offer a comprehensive replacement for the law. instead, much of their focus, beyond the health care law, has been on attacking planned parenthood.\n\nwe were elected on a pledge to try and repeal obamacare, said representative david jolly, republican of florida. if we are unsuccessful in a veto override, i think we should turn our attention to other matters like national security. but if we get a republican in the white house, then we need to turn to solutions. the focus can't be just on repealing obamacare. it has to be, 'what is our health care plan?'\n\nrepublicans say that the health law remains potent for them in part because some of its flaws, like rising premium costs, have only begun to be revealed, even as many of its more popular provisions were quickly clear.\n\neven though the law was passed many years ago, the rollout is much more recent, and some components haven't even been implemented, said representative lee zeldin, republican of new york. for a few years the debate over obamacare was one about how it was going to impact individuals, families and businesses in the future. and when it actually started, the debate shifted and people had their own personal stories to tell.\n\ni would say constituents have been very upset with the failure of the new york co-op, he said, referring to the health republic insurance of new york.
any one of these changes individually is moderate, but stack one on top of another and you get a big boost to the affordable care act, said jonathan cohn, author of the ten year war, a new history of the health law. it doesn't change the law's structure, but it does make it much more generous.\n\nthose close to the effort say its ambitions — and its limits — reflect the preferences of those leading the way. mr. biden, who was involved in the passage and rollout of obamacare as vice president, ran on the idea of expansion, not upheaval. and leaders in congress who wrote obamacare have been watching it in the wild for a decade, slowly developing legislation to address what they see as its gaps and shortcomings. many see their work as a continuing, gradual process, in which lawmakers should make adjustments, assess their effects, and adjust again.\n\nwhen you think about where we thought the a.c.a. was headed four years ago, and contrast that to where we are right now, on the cusp of a massive expansion of affordability, it's pretty exciting, said christen linke young, deputy director of the white house domestic policy council for health and veterans affairs.\n\nbut bob kocher, an economic adviser in the obama administration who is now a partner at the venture capital firm venrock, said that beyond the current changes, mr. biden's mission on obamacare seemed more modest, more like don't break it.\n\ni don't think he has any ambition in mind beyond managing it, he said.\n\nto aid in the effort, president biden has recruited a host of former obama administration aides. his picks for top jobs at the centers for medicare and medicaid services, the office of management and budget, as well as key deputies at h.h.s., all worked on the first rounds of obamacare policymaking. many key congressional aides working on health care now also helped write the affordable care act.\n\nfrequently asked questions about the new stimulus package how big are the stimulus payments in the bill, and who is eligible? the stimulus payments would be $1,400 for most recipients. those who are eligible would also receive an identical payment for each of their children. to qualify for the full $1,400, a single person would need an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or below. for heads of household, adjusted gross income would need to be $112,500 or below, and for married couples filing jointly that number would need to be $150,000 or below. to be eligible for a payment, a person must have a social security number. read more. what would the relief bill do about health insurance? buying insurance through the government program known as cobra would temporarily become a lot cheaper. cobra, for the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act, generally lets someone who loses a job buy coverage via the former employer. but it's expensive: under normal circumstances, a person may have to pay at least 102 percent of the cost of the premium. under the relief bill, the government would pay the entire cobra premium from april 1 through sept. 30. a person who qualified for new, employer-based health insurance someplace else before sept. 30 would lose eligibility for the no-cost coverage. and someone who left a job voluntarily would not be eligible, either. read more what would the bill change about the child and dependent care tax credit? this credit, which helps working families offset the cost of care for children under 13 and other dependents, would be significantly expanded for a single year. more people would be eligible, and many recipients would get a bigger break. the bill would also make the credit fully refundable, which means you could collect the money as a refund even if your tax bill was zero. that will be helpful to people at the lower end of the income scale, said mark luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at wolters kluwer tax & accounting. read more. what student loan changes are included in the bill? there would be a big one for people who already have debt. you wouldn't have to pay income taxes on forgiven debt if you qualify for loan forgiveness or cancellation — for example, if you've been in an income-driven repayment plan for the requisite number of years, if your school defrauded you or if congress or the president wipes away $10,000 of debt for large numbers of people. this would be the case for debt forgiven between jan. 1, 2021, and the end of 2025. read more. what would the bill do to help people with housing? the bill would provide billions of dollars in rental and utility assistance to people who are struggling and in danger of being evicted from their homes. about $27 billion would go toward emergency rental assistance. the vast majority of it would replenish the so-called coronavirus relief fund, created by the cares act and distributed through state, local and tribal governments, according to the national low income housing coalition. that's on top of the $25 billion in assistance provided by the relief package passed in december. to receive financial assistance — which could be used for rent, utilities and other housing expenses — households would have to meet several conditions. household income could not exceed 80 percent of the area median income, at least one household member must be at risk of homelessness or housing instability, and individuals would have to qualify for unemployment benefits or have experienced financial hardship (directly or indirectly) because of the pandemic. assistance could be provided for up to 18 months, according to the national low income housing coalition. lower-income families that have been unemployed for three months or more would be given priority for assistance. read more.\n\nborn in the great recession, the affordable care act was drafted with a focus on costs. political compromises and concerns about runaway deficits kept the law's overall 10-year price tag under $1 trillion, and included enough spending cuts and tax increases to pay for it. those constraints led its architects to scale back the financial help for americans buying their own coverage. staffers who wrote the formulas said they ran hundreds of simulations to figure out how to cover the most people within their budget.\n\nthose who wrote the regulations that interpreted the law also recall drafting rules that erred on the side of spending less to avoid blowback or litigation.
at 3:30 p.m. on friday, mr. ryan called republicans into a closed-door meeting to deliver the news that the bill would be withdrawn, with no plans to try again. the meeting lasted five minutes. one of the architects of the house bill, representative greg walden, republican of oregon and the chairman of the energy and commerce committee, put it bluntly: this bill's done.\n\nwe are going to focus on other issues at this point, he said.\n\nthe republican bill would have repealed tax penalties for people without health insurance, rolled back federal insurance standards, reduced subsidies for the purchase of private insurance and set new limits on spending for medicaid, the federal-state program that covers more than 70 million low-income people. the bill would have repealed hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes imposed by the affordable care act and would also have cut off federal funds to planned parenthood for one year.\n\nmr. ryan had said the bill included huge conservative wins. but it never won over conservatives who wanted a more thorough eradication of the affordable care act. nor did it have the backing of more moderate republicans who were anxiously aware of the congressional budget office's assessment that the bill would leave 24 million more americans without insurance in 2024, compared with the number who would be uninsured under the current law.\n\nthe budget office also warned that in the short run, the republicans' legislation would drive insurance premiums higher. for older americans approaching retirement, the cost of insurance could have risen sharply.\n\nwith the house's most hard-line conservatives holding fast against the bill, support for the legislation collapsed friday after more and more republicans came out in opposition. they included representatives rodney frelinghuysen of new jersey, the soft-spoken chairman of the house appropriations committee, and barbara comstock of virginia, whose suburban washington district went for the democratic presidential nominee, hillary clinton, in november.\n\nseven years after enactment of obamacare, i wanted to support legislation that made positive changes to rescue health care in america, mr. frelinghuysen said. unfortunately, the legislation before the house today is currently unacceptable as it would place significant new costs and barriers to care on my constituents in new jersey.
when sanders is pressed on how he will accomplish his ambitious goals, he often responds with the nebulous answer that it will require a political revolution, which seems to mean energizing and engaging an unprecedented number of new voters who would not only ensure his election but flip control of the senate and possibly the house.\n\nimage\n\ninteresting, but also unlikely. go talk to all the blue dog democrats who lost their seats in the wake of obamacare passage. go talk to all the voters who are being disenfranchised by new voter suppression laws. go talk to all the poor people who live in states where conservative voters ensure republican leadership, and therefore prevent medicaid from being expanded in their states.\n\nthere are political realities that exist in america that can be changed sometimes, and often are, but that are not often subject to sea changes.\n\nfurthermore, sanders likes to tout that he doesn't have a super pac and doesn't want one. that is a principled position. but the republican candidate will have the support of many super pacs, awash in hundreds of millions of dollars in dark money, and the republican nominee himself might even be a billionaire. they are going to beat sanders like he is a nail with the socialist label and his proposal on new taxation. middle of the spectrum middle america is likely to be very susceptible to this negative messaging.\n\nbut instead of clinton finding a way to express that her plans are more tangible than sanders's, and her chances in the general election are stronger than his, she and her campaign have made some incredulous inferences about sanders's honor.\n\nthe swipes at him as being soft on the gun industry as some way of cozying up to it, or of being anti-obama because he wanted obama to be stronger in pursuing a liberal agenda, or that he wants to scrap obamacare, simply do not connect.\n\nsanders may be a dreamer, but he's not dishonorable. trying to sully him in this way only sullies her.
it's an odd moment for liberals to mourn justice kennedy, who'll turn 82 next month, and for conservatives to relish his departure. he did nothing important for liberals this term, failing to provide even one crucial fifth vote to swing the outcome of a case in their direction.\n\nafter he had appeared to invite a challenge to partisan gerrymandering way back in 2004, a case finally arrived in the just-concluded term, with the social science measures of partisanship he had asked for. but justice kennedy ducked without even writing to explain why as the court decided the case on narrow technical grounds. and though his principal left-leaning legacy is his expansion of gay rights, especially marriage equality, he settled for another narrow resolution this month, writing the majority opinion that favored the religious objections of a colorado baker over a gay couple's right to be treated like anyone else when they walk into a store and order a wedding cake.\n\njustice kennedy also voted with his conservative allies this week to dilute the power of minority voters in texas. he helped to expand the reach of private, case-by-case arbitration, making it more difficult for employees to band together to confront their employers about wage theft and other problems. on wednesday, hours before announcing his retirement, he helped diminish the influence of unions. and let's not forget justice kennedy's vote in bush v. gore and his opinion in citizens united, with its blindness to the reality of how money corrupts our political process.\n\nand yet, the difference between a court with justice kennedy and one with a trump-chosen replacement for him is likely to be the difference between incremental and drastic change in crucial areas of law, between baby steps and giant ones.\n\nthe path of reasoning the court takes from case to case often matters as much as the outcomes. some justices with a vision (and a majority behind them) are more patient than others. justice kennedy was of the slow-cook variety. before his majority opinion in obergefell v. hodges, justice kennedy's gift of same-sex marriage to the country, there were his majority opinions in united states v. windsor, which granted some rights to gay couples, and lawrence v. texas, which struck down the sodomy laws that targeted them.
el problema es que para trump las normas no significan nada. desde un principio dejó muy claro que quería erradicar cualquier rastro de la presencia de obama en el ala oeste. tenía el peor gusto, le dijo trump a un visitante a principios de 2017 mientras presumía sus nuevas cortinas (que no eran muy distintas de las de obama, en opinión de otras personas que entraron al despacho durante ese periodo caótico).\n\nesos esfuerzos por hacerlo desaparecer fueron más enfáticos en lo referente a las políticas. un exfuncionario de la casa blanca comentó que trump interrumpió una presentación para verificar que una propuesta del personal no fuera una cosa de obama.\n\ndurante la transición, en lo que en retrospectiva parece un anticipo de la presidencia, a un colaborador de trump se le ocurrió imprimir una lista detallada de las promesas de campaña de obama del sitio web oficial de la casa blanca y utilizarla como una especie de lista de objetivos a abatir, según dos personas con conocimiento de la medida.\n\nes algo personal para trump; todo se trata del presidente obama y de acabar con su legado. es su obsesión, explicó omarosa manigault newman, veterana del programa apprentice y, hasta su abrupta salida, una de las contadas funcionarias negras en el ala oeste de trump. el presidente obama no podrá descansar mientras trump respire.\n\ncuando los dos hombres se encontraron en noviembre de 2016 para una forzada reunión posterior a la elección, el presidente electo fue cortés, por lo que obama aprovechó la oportunidad para aconsejarle no desmantelar obamacare. mira, puedes quitarle mi nombre; no me importa, le dijo, según los asesores.\n\ntrump asintió sin comprometerse.\n\ncuando la transición comenzó a hacerse eterna, obama experimentó una creciente inquietud ante una actitud que le parecía la alegre indiferencia del nuevo presidente y su equipo de novatos. muchos de ellos ignoraron por completo los documentos de información que el personal de obama había preparado con tanto empeño, recuerdan sus antiguos colaboradores, y en lugar de centrarse en la política o en el funcionamiento del ala oeste, preguntaron por la calidad de los tacos en el comedor del sótano o dónde encontrar un buen apartamento.\n\nen cuanto a trump, no tiene ni la menor idea de qué está haciendo, obama le dijo a un asistente después de su encuentro en el despacho oval.
affluent young people might end up saving some money as a result of these changes. but the effect on those who are older and less affluent would be devastating. aarp has done the math: a 55-year-old making $25,000 a year would end up paying $3,600 a year more for coverage; that rises to $8,400 for a 64-year-old making $15,000 a year. and that's before the death spiral.\n\nfor the combination of price hikes and weakened penalties would lead many healthy americans to forgo insurance. this would worsen the risk pool, causing premiums to rise sharply — and remember, subsidies would no longer adjust to offset this rise. the result would be even more people dropping out. republicans have been claiming that obamacare is collapsing, which isn't true. but trumpcare, if implemented, would collapse in a mar-a-lago minute.\n\nhow could house republicans under the leadership of paul ryan, who the media keeps assuring us is a smart, serious policy wonk, have produced such a monstrosity? two reasons.\n\nfirst, the g.o.p.'s policy-making and policy analysis capacity has been downgraded to the point of worthlessness. there are real conservative policy experts, but the party doesn't want them, perhaps because their very competence makes them ideologically unreliable — a proposition illustrated by the rush to enact this bill before the nonpartisan congressional budget office can estimate either its costs or its effects. basically, facts and serious analysis are the modern right's enemies; policy is left to hacks who can't get even the simplest things right.\n\nsecond, republicans seem to have been undone by their reverse-robin-hood urges. you can't make something like obamacare work without giving lower-income families enough support that insurance becomes affordable. but the modern g.o.p. always wants to comfort the comfortable and afflict the afflicted; so the bill ends up throwing away the taxes on the rich that help pay for subsidies, and redirects the subsidies themselves away from those who need them to those who don't.\n\ngiven the sick joke of a health plan, you might ask what happened to all those proclamations that obamacare was a terrible, no good system that republicans would immediately replace with something far better — not to mention donald trump's promises of insurance for everybody and great health care.\n\nbut the answer, of course, is that they were all lying, all along — and they still are. on this, at least, republican unity remains impressively intact.
here's a brief history of president trump's record on pre-existing health conditions.\n\ndid he pass the affordable care act?\n\nno. the president was not in washington and not in politics when the affordable care act was written, debated and passed in 2009 and 2010. the health law established consumer protections for americans who buy their insurance, including a rule that health insurers must offer coverage to anyone who wishes to buy it, with prices varying only by region and the age of the customer.\n\nbefore obamacare, some states protected people with pre-existing conditions in this way, but most did not. americans with prior illnesses like cancer, asthma, even acne, often had trouble buying insurance for themselves and their families. one state that did protect people with pre-existing conditions was new york, where the media executive and presidential candidate michael bloomberg currently resides and where mr. trump did at the time. (mr. bloomberg's recent television advertisements, which attack mr. trump's health care record, appear to have prompted the tweets.)\n\nthe affordable care act was a large and complex law, with many provisions that have proved controversial. but the protections for people with pre-existing conditions enjoy widespread public support.\n\nhas he tried to weaken pre-existing conditions protections as president?\n\nyes. president trump's first legislative priority after his election was to repeal and replace the affordable care act. republicans in congress voted on several different bills, but each of them had provisions that would have substantially eroded the current protections for americans with prior health conditions, by weakening the regulations that make such insurance available, affordable and useful.\n\nthe bills would have weakened rules that require insurance to cover a standard set of health benefits, for example, and would have established policies that would have raised prices for people with a history of health problems.
this year, the media has been focused largely on the election process — campaign managers, speaking styles, every slip and misstep. that's been entertaining, but the policy differences between the two sides are much more important, and the most crucial difference may be over economic policy.\n\ndonald j. trump has campaigned very clearly for change — a policy upheaval to promote faster growth, repair the economic stagnation and end the corrupt pay-to-play system that favors the well heeled. hillary clinton has pledged to extend and build on the policies of the obama administration.\n\nthere is no doubt who has the better plan. our economy is growing at only 1.1 percent per year, a fraction of our average rate, and the congressional budget office forecasts just 2 percent annual growth (in inflation-adjusted gross domestic product) for the next 10 years.\n\nyes, we went through a deep recession, but it ended in 2009. the recovery has been the weakest in decades, and the first that has actually pushed median incomes down. business investment and profits are lower now than a year ago. counterproductive federal policies squash small businesses with inane regulatory sprawl that affects hiring, taxes, credit and medical care.
much of that was how america had always been. we changed it, many of us, through some of the proudest struggles of our history. it wasn't easy, and sometimes it wasn't pretty, but we did it, together. we won voting rights for all. we ended jim crow, and we pushed open the golden door again to welcome immigrants. we achieved full rights for women, and fought to let people of all genders and sexual orientations stand in the light. and if we have not yet created the america that langston hughes swore will be — the land that never has been yet — if there is still much to be done, at least we have advanced our standards of humanity, hope and decency to places where many people never thought we could reach.\n\nwhat old men know, too, is that all that is gained can be lost. lost just as the liberation that the civil war and emancipation brought was squandered after reconstruction, by a white america grown morally weary, or bent on revenge. lost as the gains of our labor unions have been for decades now, pushed back until so many of us stand alone in the workplace, before unfettered corporate power. lost as the vote is being lost by legislative chicanery. lost as so many powerful interests would have us lose the benefits of the social welfare state, privatize social security, and annihilate obamacare altogether.\n\nif he wins this tuesday, donald j. trump would be, at 70, the oldest president ever elected. but there is much about mr. trump that is always young, and not in a good way. there is something permanently feckless and immature in the man. it can be seen in how he mangles virtually the same words that langston hughes used.\n\nwhen hughes writes, in the first two lines of his poem, let america be america again/ let it be the dream it used to be, he acknowledges that america is primarily a dream, a hope, an aspiration, that may never be fully attainable, but that spurs us to be better, to be larger. he follows this with the repeated counterpoint, america never was america to me, and through the rest of this remarkable poem he alternates between the oppressed and the wronged of america, and the great dreams that they have for their country, that can never be extinguished.\n\nmr. trump, who is not a poet, either in his late-night tweets or on the speaker's stump, sees american greatness as some heavy, dead thing that we must reacquire. like a bar of gold, perhaps, or a bank vault, or one of the lifeless, anonymous buildings he loves to put up. it is a simplistic notion, reducing all the complexity of the american experience to a vague greatness, and his prescription for the future is just as undefined, a promise that we will return to winning without ever spelling out what we will win — save for the exclusion of others, the reduction of women to sexual tally points, the re-closeting of so many of us.
die-hard opponents of the 2010 health reform law, the affordable care act, have often used its real and imagined problems to argue that it is fatally flawed. now they are seizing on an announcement by aetna that it will reduce its participation in the health insurance marketplaces set up by the law. donald trump's campaign called aetna's move the latest blow to this broken law that is slowly imploding under its regulatory red tape.\n\nthis is hyperbole. the law has survived many setbacks, and it will overcome aetna's decision, too.\n\nthe law set up federal and state-run marketplaces where people who don't have health insurance through their employers or government programs like medicare can buy coverage. despite initial problems with healthcare.gov, the federal program's website, and some state sites, the marketplaces have helped many americans become insured. about 11 million people have bought policies, and the government provides tax credits to 85 percent of them to make the coverage affordable.\n\nbut some big national insurers like unitedhealth, humana and now aetna say they are losing too much money on marketplace policies. the reason is that the customers they signed up used more medical services than the insurers had anticipated. on monday, aetna said it would reduce the number of counties where it sells such policies to 242, from 778, citing a $200 million pretax loss on those policies in the second quarter. the company had sold marketplace policies to about 911,000 customers as of april.\n\naetna's decision will cause problems in some places. for example, pinal county in arizona might have no insurer selling marketplace policies for 2017 unless another company steps in to replace aetna. but competition is more robust elsewhere. a kaiser family foundation report published in july said that in 16 states and the district of columbia, there would be an average of 5.8 insurers selling policies for 2017. that number was down from 6.5 in 2016 but about the same as in 2014.
campaigning recently at a recreation center in murray county — a rural, mainly white bastion of republicanism on the tennessee border — she stood before tv news cameras, reminding people of her work helping to pass a bipartisan billion-dollar transportation bill, and her support of legislation that supports grandparents and other family members raising children.\n\ni know how to work across the aisle when we need to, she said.\n\nms. abrams, 44, who favors the expansion of medicaid under obamacare and the extension of state scholarships to the immigrants known as dreamers, has given republicans many opportunities to argue that she is too far left for a state like georgia. senator david perdue recently called her the most radical liberal.\n\nsupporters like gerald griggs, a vice president of the state n.a.a.c.p. chapter, reject such descriptions as inaccurate — and also hear in them a coded effort to scare off white voters.\n\ndefinitely, it's a dog whistle embedded, he said.\n\n[democrats see opportunity for gains at the state level.]\n\nms. abrams was elected to the general assembly in 2006, two years after republicans had taken control of the georgia house for the first time in more than a century. she was young, but not green. she had served as student president at spelman college, atlanta's storied african-american women's college, and kept her life ambitions, eventually including the goal of becoming president, listed in a spreadsheet. the sheer boldness of my ambitions gnawed at me, she recalled in her 2018 autobiography, minority leader: how to lead from the outside and make real change.\n\nstyle-wise, she was more of a listener than a glad-hander, more policy wonk than enforcer. she was a careful, prepared speaker with a bookish quality, a wry sense of humor and a tendency toward efficiency.\n\nshe engendered a sense of loyalty in a lot of people that way, said brian thomas, who was a member of the house democratic leadership at the time. a lot of people just respected the fact that she was just a lot smarter than some of us, and able to use that intellect in ways that were really effective.
i want to point out one theme that keeps popping up in altman's piece — and existed long before obamcare: a lot of americans are deeply frustrated by the logistical headaches built into our health care system.\n\nas altman writes: they were especially upset by surprise bills for services they believed were covered. they said their coverage was hopelessly complex. if they had their way, altman says, their insurance would become much more understandable.\n\ni share their frustration, and i imagine most of you do, too. just this week, a member of my family endured the kafkaesque experience of being told that she needed to show up for an appointment even if she were no longer sick or face a penalty, thanks to insurance rules.\n\nstrikingly, some of the trump voters told kaiser that they resented lower-income people who were enrolled in medicaid, which they viewed as a better deal. medicaid has its own complexities (and its own problems), but government-run programs do tend to be simpler than private ones. it's true of medicare, and it's true of single-payer systems in other countries.\n\nobamacare looks the way it does because its designers wanted to cause the least possible disruption to the status quo while providing insurance to many more people. by that measure — and others, as a new times editorial notes — the law has been a big success.
the answer is, laugh in their faces. the g.o.p. recently rammed through a tax cut, disproportionately benefiting the wealthy, that will probably cost $2 trillion over the next decade — with no offsetting savings. enhanced health care could easily be paid for by rescinding just part of this big giveaway. if republicans won't do that, it's not democrats' problem.\n\nand if this proposal's advocates are willing to be relaxed about funding, as they should be, the plan is basically ready to go. if democrats take the senate and the white house next year, they could enact the plan, easing the burdens of millions of americans, almost immediately.\n\nwhat about progressive hopes for a more fundamental health care overhaul? representative alexandria ocasio-cortez got it exactly right: while still calling for hearings on medicare for all, she declared herself happy to support any provision that strengthens the a.c.a. and plugs some of the gaps that we're seeing. (so far, bernie sanders has refused to support the plan. let's hope he walks that back.)\n\nso democrats have a realistic plan to expand health care, while republicans are still pursuing their jihad against obamacare. the question is why.\n\nwe have, after all, gone well beyond the point where trying to kill the a.c.a. was a smart if cynical political strategy. the act has become increasingly popular since trump took office. health care was central to the 2018 midterms, and 75 percent of voters who considered it the most important issue voted democratic.\n\nso why can't the g.o.p. just cut its losses and accept that obamacare has become part of our social fabric? after all, there was a time when people like ronald reagan insisted that medicare would destroy american freedom; these days republicans pose as defenders of the program (even if they're still trying to undermine and privatize it on the sly).\n\nwell, political scientists have some interesting thoughts about the reasons the g.o.p. won't just throw in the towel on the a.c.a. but details aside, modern republicans just hate the idea of using public policy to help americans get the health care they need, even when people's inability to get insurance is a result of pre-existing medical conditions over which they have no control.
but make no mistake: the public is with biden now. the covid-19 relief package — with its direct payments to families and aid for businesses, the unemployed and local governments — is backed by nearly 70 percent of americans, according to a recent quinnipiac poll. in a nation that can't agree on a simple set of facts, this is staggering.\n\ntwo-thirds of americans supported raising the federal minimum wage before the pandemic, by august, that figure had risen to 72 percent. that level of support has only gone up since covid set in, as people realize that many of their beloved essential workers have been living on poverty-level wages.\n\nin florida, a state run by republicans, the $15 minimum hourly wage won more than 60 percent of the vote last november. let republicans in congress continue to defend a federal wage floor of $7.25. they can't. nor can they go after the popular central elements of the american rescue plan.\n\nbiden's plan to provide tax credits in the form of payments of up to $300 per month to poor families could lift 10 million children above or closer to the poverty line. people who have long argued that the best way to help the poor is simply to give them money are going to have their moment.\n\nbig majorities also support rejoining the paris climate agreement, offering a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and expanding obamacare with a public option. one month in, biden's presidency gets the approval of well over 50 percent of americans, something trump never had in the aggregate of polls in his four years.\n\nwhat could doom democrats is fellow democrats. seattle was a laudable pioneer in raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. but now its city council is never far from a bad idea. a recent proposal would make it the first city in the nation to appear to incentivize misdemeanor crime. assaults, trespass, stalking — all could be excused if their offense is linked to poverty or a behavioral health disorder.\n\nand then there's the san francisco school board, which can't find a way to put children back at their desks but plans to wipe out a third of the city's school names, including one named for abraham lincoln, because of character flaws of the honorees.
it is not clear whether the administration will establish a special enrollment period for the 32 states with markets it manages. (there are also six state-run exchanges that use the federal platform, and those states can't proceed without federal sign-off.) the administration continues to argue in court for the law's invalidation. in a press briefing on sunday, president trump reiterated that he would like to eliminate obamacare altogether and replace it with an unspecified program he prefers.\n\nwhat we want to do is get rid of the bad health care and put in a great health care, he said, in response to a question about the lawsuit.\n\nthere are also an estimated 17 million people already uninsured but eligible for marketplace coverage, according to a recent study from the kaiser family foundation. that study found that more than a quarter of those people were eligible for a bronze plan that would cost them nothing in premiums after federal subsidies were applied (they would still have a high deductible). a broad special enrollment period could protect that group from big bills, too, if they contract the disease known as covid-19.\n\nif open enrollment were more broad, and there were fewer barriers, that could make it easier for people to sign up, said cynthia cox, a vice president at kaiser and a co-author of the study.\n\npeople in so-called short-term, limited-duration health plans — those offering skimpier coverage that doesn't meet all the requirements of an a.c.a. plan — could also sign up. although the administration has encouraged the availability of alternatives, many may now want more comprehensive coverage.\n\nwashington state, which has been enrolling people since march 10, has had 2,973 residents indicate they plan to sign up as of last thursday. about 500 have actually done so. in new york, during the first four days of the enrollment period, 150 people signed up, according to state officials.\n\nin rhode island, which has had open enrollment since march 14, we've had a really strong response, ms. lang said. as of friday, 233 people had enrolled, with a further 150 or so in the process of doing so.
health care is consistently near the top of the list of issues voters care about. while republicans and president trump tend to have an edge on the economy, democrats won the house in 2018 in large part by emphasizing health care — a playbook they intend to revive in 2020. the pandemic has also put republicans at risk of losing the senate, said jessica taylor, who analyzes senate races for the nonpartisan cook political report.\n\nthere are a lot of factors that have put the senate into play, but the pandemic and how it has affected health care and the economy is a major one that have made these races competitive, ms. taylor said.\n\ndemocrats need to win three senate seats to take the majority if they also win the white house, four if they do not. although cook political deems one democratic incumbent, senator doug jones of alabama, an underdog in his race, it also rates senate races in five states — north carolina, maine, colorado, arizona and montana — as tossups. all have republican incumbents.\n\nin montana, gov. steve bullock, a democrat, jumped into the race to defeat the republican incumbent, senator steve daines, in march, just as the pandemic was exploding. three days later, a liberal group, protect our care, announced a $250,000 ad campaign attacking mr. daines as dead set on taking away montanans' health care after voting five times to repeal the health law. cook political moved the race to its tossup column last week.\n\nthe public has been deeply divided over the affordable care act since it became law in march 2010, according to surveys by the kaiser family foundation. but with people now worried that infection with covid-19 will become a pre-existing condition, democrats say the health law — which requires insurers to cover such conditions — is becoming more attractive to voters.
these reflections on the court's instinct for self-preservation lead me to a final question: what to do about the census case? as the world knows, the deeply contested question of the validity of the trump administration's plan to ask about citizenship has become even more fraught with revelations from the computer files of a recently deceased republican redistricting specialist, thomas hofeller. the documents appear to validate the conclusion reached by federal district judge jesse furman, whose ruling against the trump administration is before the justices, that the administration's purported good-government reason for adding the citizenship question was a pretext. the real reason, the documents indicate, was to provide a statistical basis for entrenching republican power by disregarding noncitizens in the population counts for future redistricting.\n\nthe court heard argument in the case in april, a month before the new information surfaced in an unrelated redistricting case. judge furman, responding to a request by one set of plaintiffs to reopen the census case for further discovery, said that with the case now before the supreme court, he lacked authority to do so. those plaintiffs, represented by the american civil liberties union, have now asked the justices for a limited remand that would send the case back to the district court to allow exploration of where the truth lies.\n\neven if the justices were so inclined, the request presents obvious logistical difficulties, with the clock ticking toward the date when the census forms have to be in final shape for distribution. it was that deadline that led the court to grant the administration's request to hear the appeal directly from the district court without waiting for a decision from the court of appeals.\n\nbut there is another option, suggested by the plaintiffs in a final footnote to their latest brief: just dismiss the appeal. the procedure is known as a dig: dismissed as improvidently granted. the justices use it once or twice a term, usually when a case turns out, on further reflection, not to be what they thought it was when they granted it. in fact, the court used a dig on april 23 to dismiss a securities case, emulex corp. v. varjabedian, that had been argued a week earlier.\n\nthe court deployed a dig on the last day of the term in june 2012 to dismiss a case, first american financial corp. v. edwards, that had been argued a full five months earlier. that case presented a question with important implications for the separation of powers: whether congress can enact a law that confers standing — the right to sue — on people who, while they can point to a legal violation, did not suffer a concrete injury traceable to the violation. circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that after the case was argued on nov. 28, 2011, the assignment to write the majority opinion went to justice clarence thomas.\n\nfor reasons never revealed, justice thomas apparently failed to keep the four colleagues he needed on board with his analysis of the case, and a decision was never published. did he overreach and scare the others away by trying to make too big a statement about the relationship between congress and the judiciary? did the court, tormented that term by the first obamacare case, just throw up its hands? the fate of first american financial is one of the little mysteries i'd like to see solved one of these years.\n\nfor the time being, it's a reminder that the court knows how to get itself out of a tight spot when it needs to. a dig requires no explanation. its effect is to wipe the supreme court slate clean, as if the appeal had never even reached the court. a dig here would leave judge furman's opinion in place and would enable the professionals in the census bureau, who strongly objected to adding the citizenship question, free to go about their business counting us — all of us. if i'm right about these recent signals that the court knows how to save itself, now is the time.\n\nthe times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. we'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. here are some tips. and here's our email: letters@nytimes.com.\n\nfollow the new york times opinion section on facebook, twitter (@nytopinion) and instagram.
the number of americans without health insurance did rise during the trump presidency, because of his attempts to diminish the law. his administration did little to advertise obamacare policies and weakened some of its provisions, like protections for people with certain medical conditions. but this increase in the number of uninsured reversed only a small portion of the decline caused by obamacare.\n\neven after trump, an additional 20 million or so americans have health insurance today largely because of obamacare. others have better benefits — like maternity care and addiction treatment — or face lower costs.\n\nwhat biden did yesterday\n\nbiden's orders still matter, because trump's actions mattered.\n\nbiden will try to strengthen protections for people with medical conditions. he will also create a new three-month sign-up period for obamacare, starting next month, aimed partly at people who lost their jobs during the pandemic. the most recent sign-up period was in the fall.\n\nperhaps most significant, the biden administration plans to promote the sign-up period heavily, through advertisements, email and other outreach, according to my colleague margot sanger-katz, who's been covering obamacare for most of its existence. biden's people think the trump people bungled the regular enrollment period, margot told me.\n\nby the end of trump's presidency, the uninsured rate probably rose close to 10 percent, from 8.6 percent in the obama administration's final year. through executive action, biden may be able to reduce it to about 8 percent over the next four years, according to my reporting.
democrats, eyeing potential turmoil in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, have little political reason to cooperate. one thing is clear, said the house democratic whip, representative steny hoyer of maryland. house republicans are going to have to find the votes on their own to dismantle the protections incorporated in the affordable care act that the american people now have.\n\na growing chorus of republican policy experts and senators are pleading to slow the process down or risk a political blood bath.\n\nbut republican leaders and mr. trump appear to be laying the groundwork for blaming the law they are annulling for the fallout likely to come in the repeal's wake.\n\nmr. trump asserted on friday that 2017 would be a disaster for the health law. that's the year it was meant to explode, because obama won't be here, he said, adding that as bad as it is now, it'll get even worse. on saturday, he took to twitter: obamacare is imploding and will only get worse. republicans coming together to get job done! and vice president mike pence traveled to louisville, ky., on saturday to assure residents that the obamacare nightmare is about to end.\n\nwhat is clear is that 2018 — a year that republicans say will be messy — will loom large for them as they move toward a vote on the measure. but republicans say that gives them nearly a year of time, since people will experience few changes with their health care in 2017.\n\nunder the proposed house legislation, individuals would no longer be subject to a penalty if they go without health insurance, a politically popular change that would be retroactive to 2016. but they would still enjoy the protections of the affordable care act: insurers would have to offer a suite of essential health benefits, could not deny them coverage because of pre-existing conditions and could not impose annual or lifetime caps on coverage.\n\ninsurers would be free to raise their premiums to meet these requirements, but because current policies are locked in for the year, voters would not see the effects until 2018. if young, healthy americans flee the market, freed from the mandate, premiums could soar next year.
medicare for all isn't a new idea. it may be defined, basically, as universal health insurance under a single government-run, taxpayer-financed plan. it would certainly alter, and probably limit, the role of private health insurance companies like unitedhealth. senator bernie sanders of vermont has supported the idea for years. but it wasn't much of an issue for investors because it never went anywhere in congress.\n\nnow, however, mr. sanders is the front-runner among the announced aspirants for the democratic presidential nomination. what's more, he appears to have moved the entire political conversation into territory that is exceedingly uncomfortable for health care companies.\n\nwhen he introduced a new version of his medicare for all legislation in the senate on april 10, the stock market noticed that his co-sponsors included at least four senate democrats who are also running for president: kirstin gillibrand of new york, cory booker of new jersey, elizabeth warren of massachusetts and kamala harris of california.\n\nit's far too early to divine whether medicare for all — particularly a version that bans or severely limits private insurance — has even a modest chance of coming into existence after the 2020 election. even now, amid all the hoopla, the odds may not be propitious.\n\nthe current democratic leaders in congress — senator chuck schumer of new york, the minority leader, and nancy pelosi of california, the house speaker — have not supported it. president trump and republican leaders in congress have been demanding a smaller government role in health care, not a larger one. and the giant health care companies, which have enormous wealth and influence, are, for the most part, committed to blocking the idea.
you have to be seriously geeky to get excited when the internal revenue service releases a new batch of statistics. well, i'm a big geek; like quite a few other people who work on policy issues, i was eagerly awaiting the i.r.s.'s tax tables for 2013, which were released last week.\n\nand what these tables show is that elections really do have consequences.\n\nyou might think that this is obvious. but on the left, in particular, there are some people who, disappointed by the limits of what president obama has accomplished, minimize the differences between the parties. whoever the next president is, they assert — or at least, whoever it is if it's not bernie sanders — things will remain pretty much the same, with the wealthy continuing to dominate the scene. and it's true that if you were expecting mr. obama to preside over a complete transformation of america's political and economic scene, what he's actually achieved can seem like a big letdown.\n\nbut the truth is that mr. obama's election in 2008 and re-election in 2012 had some real, quantifiable consequences. which brings me to those i.r.s. tables.\n\nfor one of the important consequences of the 2012 election was that mr. obama was able to go through with a significant rise in taxes on high incomes. partly this was achieved by allowing the upper end of the bush tax cuts to expire; there were also new taxes on high incomes passed along with the affordable care act, a.k.a. obamacare.
but if the trump administration allows arkansas to scale back its medicaid expansion population, some of the other 31 states that expanded the program will likely want to follow, as a way to save money and appease conservative legislators who think the obamacare expansion went too far. other states may be tempted to expand medicaid, after holding back for years, if they can limit it to those earning at or below the poverty level. the federal government initially paid the full cost of the expansion, but now states are on the hook for 6 percent of the cost; their share will gradually grow to 10 percent over the next few years.\n\nthe arkansas proposal would move about 60,000 people out of the program, by lowering the income threshold to the federal poverty level.\n\nmr. hutchinson wants those earning between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level to move to the affordable care act marketplace, where they would get federal subsidies to buy private insurance. but that could end up costing the federal government more money — another reason the trump administration may be slow to approve it. president trump frequently refers to the marketplaces as failing and has taken a number of steps to weaken them.\n\nregardless, mr. hutchinson said monday he was optimistic about winning approval to shrink the expansion population after meeting recently with alex azar, the new health and human services secretary.\n\nmr. hutchinson has long been under pressure from conservative republicans in the arkansas legislature who say the medicaid expansion has proved too expensive, with far more people enrolling than originally estimated.\n\narkansas is anticipating spending about $136 million in general revenue on its medicaid expansion in the coming fiscal year, with the federal government spending an additional $2 billion. the state uses federal medicaid funds to buy private insurance for the poor — an alternative that conservative republicans found acceptable when it was first passed in 2013. about 285,000 people are now enrolled in the medicaid expansion.\n\ncindy gillespie, the director of the arkansas department of human services, said the state was planning to activate an online portal on march 30 where those subject to the requirement will be expected to record how they're meeting it each month. in june, the state will start phasing it in, relying largely on its department of workforce services to connect job seekers with employment, education or training.
that first debate seems to have helped hillary clinton move ahead of donald trump in the polls. however, i know that many of you are asking yourselves: why is this even a question?\n\nwhy isn't she leading 3 to 1? this is not a normal race between a democrat and a republican. one of the candidates has made it clear that he has no attention span or self-control. world security experts in both parties are terrified by the idea of a trump presidency. he's screwed small contractors in his business dealings and bought dumb presents for himself with money from his charitable foundation — a charitable foundation, by the way, that appears to have been managed by a team of gerbils. also, he keeps changing his positions on critical issues and has paid settlements to people alleging he discriminated against them on the basis of race or not being attractive enough.\n\nand you know that's just the beginning.\n\nit's possible trump is just riding a swell of white-male alienation, but there's a less depressing answer for his staying power. americans have always been pretty pragmatic about the presidents they pick. mostly, they go for change or not-change.\n\ngiven all the complications out there, it's a pretty pragmatic approach. if the same president has been in office for eight years, they pick his successor from the other party. give or take a few vice presidents, it's a rule that goes back to rutherford b. hayes.
bruni: joe trippi, you mentioned something that has greatly concerned me, too: the dangers of stridency. what qualifies as too strident when it comes to democrats and the right messaging and positioning and candidates for the midterms? what are a few things you've observed recently — tactics, statements — that made you wince and think: that's too strident. that's not wise.\n\ntrippi: a partisan from either party who is in a marginal district and lashes out at the other side is likely to hurt themselves with these voters. how is this candidate not going to add to the chaos and hostility in washington? how is this candidate going to get anything done for me?\n\ndemocratic activists want someone who is going to attack and fight the republicans at every turn. that will work great in a democratic district — it may work to attract support and money and win praise from the base. but in marginal districts, particularly places that have voted republican for years (like alabama, for instance), that will squander an otherwise winnable district or state.\n\nwe can't be a one-size-fits-all party. i should point out that doug jones did not have a competitive primary, whereas the g.o.p. had exactly the ideological fight we need to avoid in marginal districts. it's the candidates we nominate in the primaries of 2018 that will determine how successful we are.\n\nbruni: governor patrick, but aren't the means really everything? single payer and medicare for all are a world apart from obamacare, and when it comes to how things play out in the political arena, republican strategists tell me they're champing at the bit to have their candidates campaign against any plan that they can brand socialized medicine.\n\npatrick: i get that, but it doesn't trouble me. for example, obamacare started out as a republican idea, conceived by a right-leaning think tank and tried out (successfully) in massachusetts. when president obama proposed and passed it in congress, it soon became clear that the only thing republicans didn't like about it was the obama part. now they want to fuss about alternatives, including medicare for all or even a medicare option in the marketplace. but they have yet to propose any idea to ensure health care for everybody. that's the revealing truth. and that's what's wrong.\n\nbruni: as a member of the (very populous) camp of americans who believe that president trump is a great danger to us and that we desperately need him to be checked by at least one chamber of congress in democratic control, i have to admit that i'm spooked by some of what i've seen recently. a washington post/abc news poll over the weekend showed that 58 percent of americans rate the economy good or excellent — that's a 17-year high. another recent poll showed that the generic-democratic versus generic-republican difference had collapsed from over 10 points to just six. tell me why i shouldn't — or should — be hugely worried.
while sanders's fellow candidates didn't parrot his vocabulary and denounce oligarchs and oligarchy, they spoke expansively about gross income inequality and the need to tackle it. that largely reflected how wealth had been concentrated over recent decades. but it owed something, too, to sanders's right and righteous demand that america have this conversation.\n\nbiden's proposed tax increases of about $3.4 trillion over a decade are more than double what clinton was advocating in 2016, while buttigieg's were more than quadruple. how is that moderate?\n\nthe scare that sanders put into clinton four years ago and the organization that he built have transformed the party, moving it even further left than the questionable electoral successes of his movement justify. although there is scant evidence in recent elections that a democrat running on sanders's platform can win anywhere but in decidedly blue districts and states, that platform colored the democratic primary in a bold and indelible way. candidates disrespected it at their peril.\n\nas the democratic race narrowed to about half a dozen plausible contenders, klobuchar asserted herself — and was frequently characterized as — a sort of common-sense centrist. but her actual positions and proposals told a different story. as my fellow times op-ed columnist david leonhardt recently wrote: she wants to raise taxes on the rich, break up monopolies, vastly expand medicare, fight climate change, admit more refugees, allow undocumented immigrants to become citizens, ban assault weapons and require universal background checks. a klobuchar administration would probably be well to the left of the obama administration. it would be closer to sanders territory.\n\nall the lead contenders are running on the most progressive agendas to ever dominate a democratic primary, wrote vox's ezra klein and roge karma late last year. they noted that this primary's moderates would have been considered leftists in the recent past. as a result, they added, if biden or buttigieg actually win the nomination, they will be running on the most progressive platform of any democratic nominee in history.\n\nbuttigieg was designated a moderate despite his support for abolishing the electoral college and expanding the supreme court, both of which would be profound changes in american politics and governance.\n\nbiden was designated a moderate despite declaring that the equality act, which would offer sweeping federal protection against discrimination for l.g.b.t.q. people, didn't merely have his support; it would be his top legislative priority. he was designated a moderate despite being among the 10 candidates at a democratic debate early on who all raised their hands when asked if they supported extending health care benefits to undocumented immigrants.
the trump administration plans to use money from the recent stimulus bills to pay hospitals for treatment of uninsured coronavirus patients. it says the plan is more efficient than reopening enrollment in the obamacare markets to achieve the same goal.\n\nthe money would be drawn from a $100 billion fund to help hospitals respond to the crisis that hospital groups expected would be spent on their more immediate financial needs.\n\npresident trump announced the policy on friday at his daily briefing. that should alleviate any concern uninsured americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment, he said.\n\nusing the hospital funds to pay for uninsured coronavirus patients could be a targeted way to pay for coronavirus care for the growing number of americans who lack health insurance. but critics say it may not go to hospitals in the states hit the hardest so far and does little to address concerns over the millions of people now without coverage for medical care unrelated to the virus.
and third, the bill lowers the value of cost-sharing subsidies for plans, so most people purchasing it would have higher out-of-pocket spending on health care than under current law, the budget office estimated.\n\nhe falsely said that people with pre-existing medical conditions will have better coverage than under obamacare.\n\nas under the current law, the senate bill states that insurers cannot refuse coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, nor can they charge higher prices. but it allows states to apply for waivers to change essential health benefits, a set of services insurers now must provide.\n\nso someone who needs certain drugs or treatments could not be denied or charged more for insurance, but their health plan may not cover those services if the state waived the rule. as a result, people may experience substantial increases in supplemental premiums or out-of-pocket spending on health care, or would choose to forgo the services, according to the budget office.\n\nof course, it is up to states what insurers would cover, but mr. trump's claim that the plan is better than the current law for people with pre-existing conditions is unfounded.\n\nhe falsely said the bill will provide better coverage for low-income americans.\n\nthe affordable care act intended to expand medicaid eligibility to 138 percent of poverty level from the previous threshold of 44 percent, and provide tax credits for those making between 100 percent and 400 percent of poverty. but the supreme court ruled in 2012 that the federal government could not compel states to expand their programs, and 19 states declined to do so. this created a gap in which people making between 44 and 100 percent of poverty neither qualified for medicaid or subsidies in those states.\n\nthe senate bill seeks to close that gap by expanding making tax credits available to people making between 0 and 350 percent of poverty. but because the benchmark plan under the senate bill would pay only 58 percent of benefits, deductibles would increase. therefore, despite being eligible for premium tax credits, few low-income people would purchase any plan, the budget office said.\n\nthe senate bill also reduces funding to medicaid — the health program for poor and disabled americans — by more than $800 billion over the next decade, leading to 15 million fewer enrollees by 2026 than under the current law.
if you are receiving unemployment insurance, the legislation entitles you to a special discount: regardless of your income, your premiums will look similar to that of the person earning $19,000 on our maps. and if you lost your coverage at work and want to keep it, the bill will also pay the full cost of your premiums for six months under the federal cobra program.\n\nnotes: premiums and subsidies displayed here are for individuals buying a silver plan at the second-lowest price in their market. but subsidies are calculated differently depending on family sizes. a family of four earning around $40,000 would pay the same premium as an individual earning $19,000, for example.\n\nin a handful of states, people earning $19,000 won't qualify for new subsidies because they already qualify for other low-cost state insurance programs — medicaid in alaska, hawaii and the district of columbia; and the basic health plan in minnesota and new york (the basic health plan is medicaid-like coverage with low premiums for a sliver of low-income americans in certain states).\n\nif you want to calculate the premium you would pay for your income, household size and location, this online tool may be helpful.\n\nhere are answers to other frequently asked questions about the stimulus package.
[read more on the history raphael warnock is chasing.]\n\natlanta — ebenezer baptist church bills itself as america's freedom church, a reflection of its lofty stature as the house of worship where the rev. dr. martin luther king jr. once preached. over the decades, the 6,000-member congregation just east of downtown atlanta has become a favored stop for national politicians seeking to make their case to the african-american community and pay homage to the slain civil rights icon.\n\nbut this week, ebenezer transformed from political venue to political launching pad when its senior pastor, the rev. dr. raphael g. warnock, a democrat, entered the race for the united states senate seat recently vacated by johnny isakson, a republican who cited ailing health as his reason for resigning with three years left in his term. the move is likely to alter the way the powerful king legacy resonates in the state, particularly because dr. king declined to run for public office, preferring to effect change through direct social action.\n\nin a phone interview on thursday afternoon, dr. warnock, 50, said he respected that position, but noted that he had also spent a number of years before coming to ebenezer as a pastor at new york city's abyssinian baptist church. it was there that another of dr. warnock's civil rights heroes, the rev. adam clayton powell jr., once preached, and mr. powell had no reservations about entering the political fray, serving in congress from 1945 to 1971.\n\nyes, it is, for some people, an extraordinary step for a clergyperson to operate beyond the pulpit and enter the rough-and-tumble of politics, dr. warnock said. i am aware of the risk. but i am embracing it because i think the times demand it.
the american health care act, which narrowly won passage in the house on thursday, could transform the nation's health insurance system and create a new slate of winners and losers.\n\nwhile the senate will probably demand changes, this bill, if it becomes law in its current form, will repeal and replace large portions of the affordable care act (obamacare). it will change the rules and subsidies for people who buy their own insurance coverage, and make major cuts to the medicaid program, which funds care for the poor and disabled.\n\nany sizable change in our complex health care system leaves some people and businesses better or worse off. for some, insurance will become more affordable — or their taxes will be lower. others will lose out on financial support or health care coverage. you can see how you might be affected in our summary of winners and losers.\n\nwinners\n\nhigh-income earners: the bill eliminates two taxes on individuals earning more than $200,000 or couples earning more than $250,000: a 0.9 percent increase on the medicare payroll tax, and a 3.8 percent tax on investment income. it also allows people to save more money in tax-excluded health savings accounts, a change most useful to people with enough money to have savings.
president trump gave a bravura performance on tuesday night. among presidential speeches, the state of the union address comes closest to the long, disjointed, episodic form of the campaign rally — the form of oratory at which he excels. so even though virtually every word of the speech is scripted, it has the shout-outs, the self-applause, the knowing smiles and mugs that this president enjoys and that allow him to engage the congressional and the television audience over a long evening.\n\nhe became almost as much a conductor as a speaker, expertly cuing the soloists, as it were, a dozen or so times during the speech — surely the largest number of hero-witnesses crammed into one of these events since ronald reagan had the dubious idea of turning the state of the union into a report card on the state of the people.\n\nthe rhetorical flourishes in last night's address owed much to reagan: not merely the heroes and volunteers, but above all the business and personal tax cuts, the largest in a generation, and with them the whirring and turning of economic gears, lifting citizens (in a nice phrase) from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity.\n\na few hard edges were smoothed away. the phrase radical islamic terrorism did not appear in the speech, as it had in mr. trump's inaugural address and his message to the joint session of congress last year. he did not mention the news media, libel laws or russia (except to criticize it alongside china as rivals that challenge our interests, our economy and our values). the phrase america first is gradually softening (another reagan touch?) into putting americans first. as mr. trump put it winningly: i want our youth to grow up to achieve great things. i want our poor to have their chance to rise.
■ two weeks later, mr. trump declared he would not run, citing his passion for business and a new contract with nbc for celebrity apprentice.\n\nhe was gone, but the anger of many g.o.p. voters remained. rick santorum, not mr. trump, wound up being the insurgent who gave the party establishment fits. he came a lot closer to beating mr. romney than a lot of people remember (and it's not hard to imagine that mr. trump could have done even better).\n\nin 2011, mr. trump had a chance to give his media strategy a test run. the new york times article on his farewell from the race suggested that the most noteworthy element of his flirtation as a candidate was a media culture that increasingly seems to give the spotlight to the loudest, most outrageous voices. stuart spencer, a former political strategist for ronald reagan, was quoted as saying, the media made him, the media kept him, the media kept promoting him.\n\nmr. trump also demonstrated his willingness and ability to mine racial and ethnic resentment. in 2011, mr. trump said, china is raping us. four years later, he said mexico was sending rapists to the united states.\n\nin the run-up to the trump candidacy of 2016, gabriel sherman reported in new york magazine that an employee of mr. trump, sam nunberg — who was later fired for racially charged facebook posts under his name — measured the base's pulse.\n\ni listened to thousands of hours of talk radio, and he was getting reports from me, nunberg recalled. what those reports said was that the g.o.p. base was frothing over a handful of issues including immigration, obamacare and common core. while jeb bush talked about crossing the border as an act of love, trump was thinking about how high to build his wall.\n\nbut maybe more than anything, mr. trump showed in 2011 how he would deploy conspiracy theories. being a birther was merely a start. he associated with conspiracy purveyors like alex jones, a syndicated radio host. among many examples in the last year, the times wrote in march, mr. trump reposted information on twitter from the website infowars, hosted by mr. jones, to support his unsubstantiated claim that thousands of muslims in new jersey cheered the sept. 11 attacks.
the decision to work together was fueled by the pandemic, the coalition said, and by the need to address longstanding inequities in health care access and disparities in health outcomes. millions of americans lost their insurance during the downturn, and the virus has disproportionately affected communities of color, which have experienced high numbers of cases and deaths.\n\nthe recommendations signal a strong show of support for the beleaguered health care law, which had been under fierce attack not only from republicans under the trump administration but from progressive democrats who have urged replacing it altogether with a government-run medicare for all system.\n\nwhile the hospitals, the doctors and the insurers, which benefit when more people have coverage, had previously united to fight the attempts to repeal obamacare by the republicans in 2017, the new coalition also includes the chamber, which had not been a proponent of the law.\n\nwe have always believed that there are better approaches to expanding health care coverage and lowering costs than the a.c.a., but it is the law of the land and as such we want it to function as smoothly and efficiently as possible, neil bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer for the chamber, said in an emailed statement.\n\ngiven the election of mr. biden and the change in the composition of congress, we now have an opportunity to see something actually happen, said chip kahn, the president of the federation of american hospitals, which represents for-profit hospitals and, along with the american hospital association, is a member of the coalition. in addition to the american medical association, the american academy of family physicians is also a member of the coalition.
unitedhealth group, one of the nation's major insurers, reported on wednesday that its earnings actually increased this past quarter, adding that the costs of the coronavirus pandemic were offset by the cancellations of routine medical appointments and elective surgeries for hip replacements and other conditions.\n\nthe company's report provided an early glimpse of how the crisis is affecting the u.s. health care industry, which in many regions has been overwhelmed by emergency and intensive care of patients infected by the virus. tens of billions of dollars in federal funds are now flowing to hospitals dealing with the crisis as part of the $2 trillion stimulus bill passed by congress last month.\n\nthe company, which operates one of the nation's largest health insurers as well as physician groups and surgery centers, announced on wednesday that the coronavirus pandemic had minimal impact on its earnings.\n\nunitedhealth reported earnings from operations increased by 3 percent, to $5 billion, for the first quarter of 2020, compared with the same three months of 2019, on revenue of $64 billion.
the biographical video from senator david perdue's first campaign, in 2014, celebrated a narrative arc that many fellow georgians either related to or have aspired to: the story of a humble boy from rural america whose hard work catapulted him into a global business career, navigating free markets and faraway lands, all the while gathering stores of wisdom and wealth.\n\nthe embrace of global commerce has been a hallmark of modern georgia, showcased in the 1996 atlanta olympics, dissected by the novelist tom wolfe and promoted by, among others, mr. perdue's nafta-loving cousin, sonny perdue, governor from 2003 to 2011. three years later, in his maiden run for office, david perdue would boast of his international experience as a consultant and chief executive while speaking to a gathering of republicans in bibb county, close to his middle georgia hometown.\n\nthere's only one candidate in this race that's ever lived outside the united states, mr. perdue said. how can you bring value to a debate about the economy unless you have any understanding about the free-enterprise system and what it takes to compete in the global economy?\n\nnow, facing one of a pair of jan. 5 runoff elections in georgia that will determine control of the senate, mr. perdue has continued to make his global business experience the essence of his brand. but that has highlighted the contradictions that emerge — in his career and in his character, but also in his party and his region — as he embraces the populist, america-first strains of trumpism.
in the first weeks of the democratic primaries, bernie sanders was the only candidate to win big. and to win repeatedly.\n\nwe won the popular vote in iowa, we won the new hampshire primary, and according to three networks and the a.p., we have now won the nevada caucus! [cheering]\n\nin nevada, he did it through sheer popularity by proving he'd built a coalition, one made up of union workers, people with college degrees and hispanic voters. in iowa and new hampshire, he did it by narrowly beating out his moderate rivals who split the majority of the vote, with the leading moderate candidate, joe biden, losing support and stumbling badly.\n\nthe only gas that powers a candidate to the nomination is these delegates, and sanders now has 43 of them. that's more than his closest rival pete buttigieg at 26. and now you can see sanders also has more than triple the number of delegates of most other people in this race.\n\ndown-ballot democrats are very worried about bernie ending up at the top of the ballot, but there's speculation that the rest of the folks — the moderates and others — can't get it together, and they can't stop bernie.\n\n— and the only one who could walk away from super tuesday, today, as the likely democratic nominee.\n\njust days ago, the press and the pundits had declared this candidacy dead. now, thanks to all of you, the heart of the democratic party, we just won and we've won big because of you.\n\n— joe biden offered a vision of a different coalition, this one made up of black voters, older voters and suburbanites.\n\njoe biden lapped the field with 48 percent of the vote, winning every single county in the state, crushing bernie sanders by more than a 2-1 margin, with everyone else trailing badly. biden's big win helped him close the delegate gap considerably with sanders. it's very close.\n\ndespite biden's big night, the confetti could stop for him on super tuesday, as sanders is much better organized and positioned to take a potentially commanding delegate lead.\n\nand so the question now is, will sanders sweep? or, will the moderate wing of the party coalesce around biden, and will the voters who had left him come back in time for super tuesday? it's tuesday, march 3.\n\nno one's ever going to invite me to their home after hearing this. [laughs] they've still got a christmas tree.\n\nso this house right behind us — four beds, three baths, 2,600 square feet. estimated price: $1.3 million.\n\nyou would not be the first new yorker to do that.\n\nto look up how much these homes sell for?\n\nwe are on a residential street in arlington, virginia. it's a quite lovely neighborhood of colonial houses. i think it's safe to say well-off. an affluent suburban community.\n\nof course, of course. nice to meet you.\n\nso on sunday night i went with my colleagues jessica cheung and clare toeniskoetter to meet brian keane at his house in arlington, a suburb about 15 minutes outside washington, d.c.\n\nso cute in here. they've even got a fire going on.\n\nthere are so many of you!\n\nso you met tommy. and this is julia, and this is maddie, and this is jack.\n\nand his dog, a yellow lab named annie. and then we sit down in his living room.\n\nso my name is brian keane, and i'm 52 years old. we're here in arlington, virginia.\n\ntell me who you are and what you do.\n\nso brian, like a lot of people in arlington, used to work on capitol hill. his wife is a partner at a law firm that represents, among many clients, the democratic national committee. he now runs a nonprofit organization and a software company, both of them focused on renewable energy.\n\nwe have a sense that if we're going to be voting, we understand that you want to vote for somebody who can be elected, and so you don't want to kind of just say like, oh, let's just go crazy and vote for mr. potato head because i think he's great, and see what happens.\n\nand you said left of center. my sense of this community is that that center word is important. that it's left of center, but it's not liberal liberal. i went back and looked at the 2016 primary for arlington county and saw that hillary clinton won this county by a 2-to-1 ratio over bernie sanders. it wasn't really even close. he got 32 percent. she got twice as much, 66 percent.\n\nwhat's the kind of character of people's political identification, if you could summarize it?\n\nsure. it's a wealthy community. and it's a very well-read community, if you will. and the reason a lot of people kind of live here is because of the politics. and so they move to washington — certainly that's why i came here, because i love politics.\n\nso tell me about the politics of this community — arlington, virginia.\n\nbut in the most recent polling, which was conducted before south carolina, sanders is actually leading the state of virginia with 28 percent of the vote. joe biden has 19 percent, and michael bloomberg has 17 percent, which, as you can probably gather, is not welcome news to brian.\n\nwell, look. let's be clear. the establishment is freaking out. the establishment is worried. wall street is worried. the drug companies are worried. insurance companies are worried.\n\nwhen he and his friends hear sanders going after the establishment —\n\nwhen you say washington's the problem, he's probably talking about us, and that's not really well received.\n\n— they hear that as him going after them.\n\nyou mean it will trickle down over the whole party.\n\ni don't think, for every — and i really, really think trump is bad for america — a socialist revolution is not what we're asking we need. and if we have a nominee to stand up against trump that says we need a socialist revolution, we're going to lose. and we will lose our senate. we'll lose any strong candidates we have in the senate, and we have a lot of strong candidates.\n\ni think it would be really, really bad for the party.\n\nwhat about as your democratic nominee? i mean, what do you —\n\nhe's just a little mean. i don't think i'd like him as my neighbor.\n\nyeah, like any industry town would be, right? so if you're going to say, the car manufacturers stink, i think detroit would take umbrage to that.\n\nthis is how you hear a lot of establishment democrats talking right now, that a sanders nomination would trigger a meltdown inside the party.\n\nplease tell a long story. we didn't come here for a short story.\n\nwell, i came to washington, d.c. to go to college here at american university. and this is a long story. can i tell my long story?\n\nyou say i'm a joe guy with so much conviction that i kind of want to go back to understand what you mean by that.\n\ni love the guy, but can you win? and then in that case, it's like, so i need to go with a guy that's a person who's going to win. and so now i'm, like, ping-ponging back and forth of who can win, who can win, and i have to give up the guy i love, you know?\n\nso it's, i've been all over the board, though. like it just moves so fast. and my personal thing is so interesting, though, because i've always — my heart has always been like, i'm a joe biden guy at heart.\n\ngiven what you just laid out, who do most of your neighbors tend to support in this primary?\n\nbut, to summarize: brian went to college at american university, where he was the head of an undergraduate group that brought speakers to campus, and joe biden was one of them. this was in 1988, and biden had just dropped out of his first presidential run after being caught plagiarizing a speech. and then he had a brain aneurysm that he barely survived.\n\nand the guy was just great. like it's just me and joe. and then he just says to the bartender, hey, how late are you guys open till? last call, maybe 2 o'clock. oh, great, great. can i borrow your phone? yeah. so he gives him his phone, and joe dials and he goes, hey beau, it's dad. i'm here at american university with brian keane. come on over. get hunter. come on over, and let's have a beer with brian keane at american university.\n\nand so, they shut the room down. so it's, like, 11 o'clock at night now. and he says, hey, is there like a bar around here? and so i said, well, actually, there's a tavern on campus. he's like, oh, you got time? let's go get a beer.\n\nthey actually had to shut it down. they were like, we got to close the room.\n\ni'm serious. i'm serious. i'm serious. don't make me laugh. the answer is yes, i do see the possibility of uniting us so that we can win.\n\nhe took every single question that was there.\n\ni don't see no leader right now of the democratic party who's able to unite everyone. the southern conservatives, the northern liberals —\n\nmost of we public officials, when we're about to speak somewhere, we start off and we say, i'm really happy to be here. well folks, i'm happy to be here. i'm happy to be anywhere in light of [laughs] the last 8 or 10 months. [applause]\n\nsenator joseph r. biden, jr. first entered public service in 1970 when he was elected to the council of newcastle county — excuse me — in new jer— in delaware. [laughter] sorry.\n\n[applause] thank you. good evening, and welcome to tonight's program. my name is brian f. keane, and i am the director of the kennedy political union.\n\nyes, right. so i'm there. i'm just a senior in college, i'm a kid. and he shows up. he gets out of this car, and he's like my best friend. he's like, brian, it's so great to see you! you have no idea how glad i am to see you. and i'm like, senator biden, so nice to meet you. no, you have no idea how glad i am to meet you — uh, to see you. not meet you. you know, he's very good. it's like, in case he has met me before, he's like, so glad to see you! and it was like [gasps], we're best friends. this is amazing.\n\nand so the speech he gave for the kennedy political union at a.u. was his first speech after having been driven out of the race and his aneurysm. so he shows up —\n\nso the boys came over. and really, he was calling for a ride. [laughs] and i was like, that was unbelievable. it was, like, the best night of my life.\n\nthis is actually not the end of the story.\n\nyeah, yeah. and that he is a democrat's democrat to me.\n\npartly because of the relationship you had, partly because of his politics, all of it?\n\nyes. so joe enters 2020, and i said, well i got to be with joe.\n\nbut i think it's amazing that there's a person that can make you feel like that.\n\nwell, i said to my wife, well, i got to go with joe. we're like best friends, you know? and she's like, you don't talk to the guy.\n\nso this time around, 2020, did you know right away? did it feel like he was going to be your candidate?\n\nthat he is the best politician. he loves people. and, actually, that is what the job is. and if you love people, you're going to do well by people.\n\nand i go, oh my god! how do you remember that? that was 1989. he goes, that was a great night, wasn't it? how are you man? how's it going? how are you? and i said, well, are you running for president? and he's like, well, why not? like, why not? and so we got coffee, and then we waited in line for the amtrak. and it was unbelievable.\n\nto make this long story longer, that was 1989. so fast forward to 2007. there's rumors that he's going to run for president. so i'm taking the amtrak, and i get to 30th street station and i go up the escalator. and i'm like, i think, just to myself, i'm like, i think that's joe biden over there. and there's a guy just holding the newspaper. he's holding it up. and i said, excuse me, mr. president. and he folds the newspaper down, and he looks at me. he looks me in the eye, and he goes, american university.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\ntell me about what's happened since then.\n\nbrian keane\n\nso i love joe. joe's my guy. but he has not been a strong candidate. i think he doesn't look good. i think he's not sounding good. and joe biden, who is a great guy, is playing by a rulebook that was written in 1980 maybe, 1972. and that's really concerning to me because donald trump's going to fillet him very quickly. i mean, we're seeing these debates. joe biden's version of kind of hand-to-hand combat is to just say it louder, is to yell.\n\narchived recording (elizabeth warren)\n\n— things that touch people's lives.\n\narchived recording (anchor)\n\nmayor, mayor —\n\narchived recording (joe biden)\n\ni agree. let me she referenced me. i agreed with the great job she did, and i went on the floor and got you votes. i got votes for that bill. i convinced people to vote for it, so lets get those things straight too.\n\nbrian keane\n\ni kind of feel like i'm walking through a nursing home and seeing an old friend, and he's just yelling at me. and it's like, you're an old friend, why are you yelling? he just says it louder, you know, and it's like, stop yelling.\n\narchived recording (bernie sanders)\n\n— separate health care plan.\n\narchived recording\n\nsenator klobuchar, i'm going to come to you.\n\narchived recording (joe biden)\n\nmy name was mentioned.\n\narchived recording\n\ni'm going to come to you for 45 seconds. 45 seconds for vice president biden.\n\narchived recording (joe biden)\n\ni'm the only guy who's not interrupted here, all right? and i'm going to interrupt now. it costs $30 trillion. let's get that straight.\n\nbrian keane\n\nit's like he doesn't know how to take on his opponents without just yelling it. and he was stumbling on these words.\n\narchived recording (joe biden)\n\ni agree that everybody, once they, in fact — anyway, my time is up. i'm sorry.\n\narchived recording\n\nthank you, vice president.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nyou just felt he was faltering.\n\nbrian keane\n\nyeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nso as you're confronting what you see as his weaknesses, you're watching these debate performances, it sounds like you're starting to flirt with other candidates around this time. and where is your eye starting to drift?\n\nbrian keane\n\nto everybody, actually. and then along comes bloomberg. and there's a guy who really does understand social media, and he has the money to understand social media. and that's really kind of cool. and on an electoral level, he really can go toe-to-toe with trump on that and put his money behind the whole thing to win this thing.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nso when it comes to bloomberg, for you he has this combination of values and resources. that's the appeal.\n\nbrian keane\n\nyeah. and as such, he could win.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nand what about his candidacy so far, if anything, has given you any reservations, given you pause?\n\nbrian keane\n\nthat he so quickly got off message and kind of got sidetracked.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nin the debates.\n\nbrian keane\n\nyeah, in the debates. and to me, the problem there is, oh, so now you're going to go one-on-one with trump? maybe you're not the guy. this is a problem. this all a game-day decision for me, right? so it's — election's tuesday. so, you know, can trump destroy bloomberg? can he destroy biden? yes and yes, perhaps. who has kind of the better heart, and i think i have that answer, because joe is the guy. i love joe. who has the money to be able to do this? bloomberg does. but biden's victory in south carolina, game changer for me.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nreally?\n\nbrian keane\n\nyeah.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nwhy?\n\nbrian keane\n\ni didn't believe he was going to be able to do that. i didn't believe him when he said, it's a firewall. and the numbers are unbelievable. it's like, wow. joe did it. so then you come back to bloomberg, and it's like, well, i don't know.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nsounds like the thing that matters most you was just victory. is seeing joe biden, this person who was faltering onstage, you didn't like the way he was presenting, suddenly seeming electable because he had won an election?\n\nbrian keane\n\nno.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nno?\n\nbrian keane\n\nthe winning was really important, but that speech —\n\narchived recording (joe biden)\n\nthank you, thank you, thank you, south carolina!\n\nbrian keane\n\n— really grabbed me.\n\narchived recording (joe biden)\n\nlet me talk directly to democrats across america, especially those who will be voting on super tuesday.\n\nbrian keane\n\nand it was hopeful, and it laid out an agenda.\n\narchived recording (joe biden)\n\nif democrats want to nominate someone who will build on obamacare, not scrap it; take on the n.r.a. and gun manufacturers, not protect them; stand up and give the poor a fighting chance and the middle class get restored, not raise their taxes and keep the promises we make, then join us. and if the democrats want a nominee who's a democrat [cheering], a lifelong democrat, a proud democrat, an obama-biden democrat, join us.\n\nbrian keane\n\nand so now, he's back.\n\narchived recording (joe biden)\n\nso here's the deal. let's get back up. we're decent. we're brave. we're resilient people. we can believe again. we're better than this moment. we're better than this president. so get up, take back our country. this the united states of america. there's nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. god bless you all, and may god protect our troops. thank you, thank you, thank you.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nso at the moment — this is sunday night, almost 9 o'clock — you are leaning toward joe biden. ok. what are the odds that you change your mind between now and super tuesday?\n\nbrian keane\n\nit's really amazing because i'm just so back and forth and back and forth every day. and every hour of every day.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\ni want to talk about what i'm hearing you say, because i think this is a larger question happening in virginia on super tuesday and part of the reason why we're here, which is that it seems like aside from defeating trump, which is your number one priority, a big priority for you is not having bernie sanders be the nominee. is that fair to say?\n\nbrian keane\n\na equals b, and b equals c. because if my number one issue is to beat trump, then we need the candidate who can do that. so that's really the calculus that's happening here.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nbut i'm hearing you waffling over these two moderate candidates, biden and bloomberg. and the latest polling has sanders with close to what he had in 2016 in arlington. biden and bloomberg are around 20 percent too, because they're sharing a lot of voters. so if on super tuesday, sanders sweeps a bunch of these states, and he wins in places like virginia, it will likely have been because biden and bloomberg split the vote. and i wonder if you're thinking about that at all.\n\nbrian keane\n\ni am thinking about that. i think every other election has been like, oh, i don't watch the polls. i just vote. i vote my heart. i vote the issues, you know? but now we're all watching the polls. we're all kind of —\n\nmichael barbaro\n\ngaming.\n\nbrian keane
we can't have a weapon system take 22 and a half years. we have 800,000 bureaucrats working for dod, performing bureaucratic functions when we ought to be putting...\n\nblitzer: ... thank you...\n\nkasich: ... these resources into strengthening the military. so, we can do it all...blitzer: dr. carson, how would you deal with north korea?\n\ncarson: ok. well first of all, people say that i whine a lot because i don't get time. i'm going to whine because i didn't get asked about taxes, i didn't get asked about israel. hugh, you said you're going to be fair to everybody, you didn't ask me about taxes. i had something to say about that.\n\nnow...\n\nblitzer: go ahead. this is your moment.\n\n(applause)\n\ncarson: ok. we have a system of taxation in this country that is horribly wrong. you know, i never had an audit until i spoke at the national prayer breakfast, and then all of a sudden, they came in, they said we just want to look at your real estate dealings. and then they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the whole year. and they didn't find anything, so they said let's look at the next year and the next year. they didn't find anything and they won't find anything because i'm a very honest person.\n\nbut he fact of the matter is the irs is not honest and we need to get rid of them.\n\n(applause)\n\nand as far as israel is concerned, you know, when i was there several months ago, i talked to a lot of people. i couldn't find a single one who didn't think that we had turned our backs on israel. you know, they are a strategic partner for us but also recognize that we have a judeo christian foundation, and the last thing we need to do is to reject israel. it doesn't mean that we can't be fair to other people. we can always be fair to other people, but, you know, it's like when you have a child, you know, you want to be fair to all the children around but you have a special attention for your own child.\n\nand now, as far as north korea is concerned, you know, kim jung un is an unstable person, but he does understand strength. and i think we have to present strength to him. we should be encouraging the alliance with japan and south korea. we should be encouraging the placement of the thaad, the terminal high-altitude area defense, that seems to disturb not only the north koreans but the chinese as well.\n\nand we also need to have a much more robust naval presence in that area, and i think we need to be developing strategic defense initiative because this man is going to have long-range missiles, he is going to have nuclear capabilities. we need to be able to defend ourselves. and lastly, we should make sure that he knows that if he ever shoots a missile at us, it will be the last thing he ever does.
