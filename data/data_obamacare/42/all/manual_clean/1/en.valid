over the weekend, trump tweeted: obamacare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for the people. this reaffirmed what he'd said on friday, which is that the law will soon cease to exist — that democrats will own the fallout and will be desperate to deal. as many quickly pointed out, this suggested trump may go further than merely standing by as the law supposedly implodes, as he had previously contemplated doing, and may seek to actively harm the law. on fox news sunday, reince priebus declined to divulge the strategy.
with that in mind, biden then unloaded on sanders, warning that if senator sanders is the nominee for the party, every democrat in america up and down the ballot – blue states, red states, purple states, easy districts competitive ones – every democrat will have to carry the label that senator sanders has chosen for himself.
that last requirement, implemented by house speaker nancy pelosi's top health care staffer, wendell primus, according to sources, is particularly an issue for some single-payer advocates, because they believe the hearing could turn into an exercise in which witnesses seem to endorse all sorts of different approaches to health care ― the aca, a medicare buy-in situation, and perhaps, maybe, medicare for all.
7. oppose private school vouchers. there is growing support for school vouchers that allow students to escape failing public schools in their local districts by choosing alternative schools — including private and religious schools. vouchers are especially popular with minority families, who are desperate to escape the failing system in which the teachers' unions have trapped their children. democrats also want to restrict the expansion of charter schools, too.
there we found a group of small business owners, veterans, and retirees who all support the president. however, sue greenstreet is feeling dread. she's on medicare.
bruce haynes said pence's comments about arpaio are the type of thing that could be used as a semi-endorsement in the gop primary where both the president and vice president hold sway. haynes is a republican strategist and who worked on the republican national committee's 2008 presidential independent expenditure campaign.
biden's aides were also ever present as the dozen house committees moved through the process of considering each piece of the legislation, there for technical guidance, and on some of the thorniest issues like the qualification threshold for stimulus payments, even more than that, sources say.
in april, federal district court judge rosemary collyer ruled in favor of the house republicans. such an appropriation cannot be inferred, she wrote of the payments, and insurer reimbursements without an appropriation thus violates the constitution. however, collyer declined to enforce her decision, pending an appeal to a higher court. that appeal was filed in july and is still months away from resolution.
for most young americans, socialist ideas are appealing because they genuinely want to help those who are suffering. they believe single-payer health care, a green new deal, and other similar policies are compassionate. conservatives have a tendency to dismiss these ideas without providing alternatives. this leaves younger people feeling frustrated.
maine's co-op, maine community health options, has contracted with a new pharmacy benefit manager, express scripts, with the aim of saving about $14 million annually by paying lower drug prices.

but their tangles are an extension of the fight sanders and clinton were having in 2016. at the time, clinton suggested medicare-for-all could never happen.
that said, sarah miller, a health economist with university of michigan, pointed out there are still real financial and health impacts.
the former vice president needs to change it up to get more people to come out and vote for him by getting them more excited about his candidacy. he can't just count on states like south carolina with large minority populations.
but if the trump administration allows arkansas to scale back its medicaid expansion population, some of the other 31 states that expanded the program will likely want to follow, as a way to save money and appease conservative legislators who think the obamacare expansion went too far. other states may be tempted to expand medicaid, after holding back for years, if they can limit it to those earning at or below the poverty level. the federal government initially paid the full cost of the expansion, but now states are on the hook for 6 percent of the cost; their share will gradually grow to 10 percent over the next few years.
trump's and biden's plans for health care
this bill will result in higher costs, less care and millions of americans will lose their health insurance, particularly through medicaid, schumer added.

-- vladimir putin has made it his mission to reestablish his country as a dominant, indispensable player in the middle east, one that can rival the influence of the united states. moscow correspondent andrew roth reports. by some measures, he is succeeding … not only has russia's 15-month-old airstrike campaign likely saved the regime of bashar al-assad, but it also spawned this week's negotiations sponsored by russia, iran and turkey to agree on a mechanism to support a delicate cease-fire in the syrian conflict. it was a russian-led diplomatic effort testing moscow's improbable role as peacemaker, with a twist that must draw smiles in the kremlin: no formal role for the united states. but for a world leader who has so often embraced the role of spoiler and antagonist to the liberal west, converting military force into diplomatic sway will prove complex. russia is seeking to show it has national interests … everywhere, throughout the middle east, said middle east experet alexei malashenko. it is a very important symbol.
the report also concluded that to stave off warming beyond 1.5 degrees celsius above pre-industrial levels — and avoid the many climate change effects — the world would have to cut carbon dioxide emissions by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and be net-zero by 2050.

are you recalibrating your assessment of how you can work with this president?
obama's stupid economic policies — higher taxes and the looming threat of even higher ones, over-regulation, the obamacare boondoggle, and all the uncertainty — put a boot on the throat of what should have been a robust recovery after the 2008 recession. overseas, obama was unsure (syria) or stupidly interventionalist (libya) while allowing isis to flourish.

if trump loses the nomination at the convention, failing to win the primary outright and then losing when gop delegates are freed to cast votes for someone else, a few of his supporters say they'll follow him if he starts a third party. a few say they wouldn't vote republican again. but a number sigh and admit they would give the party another chance in four years.

but even as gop presidential candidates lambasted the deal, republican foreign policy leaders on capitol hill understood that an international agreement that put the iranian nuclear program on hold through at least 2025 was better than no deal at all. they passed a law that allowed obama to go forward with the agreement while also providing political cover to republicans who believed they needed it.
republicans have been very busy lying about health care: lying about their policy agenda, lying about democrats calling them liars and lying about who said who was really lying about all this.
and there's more evidence that trump hasn't prioritized protecting patients with preexisting conditions. back when congressional republicans tried to replace obamacare in 2017, they came up with plans that would have weakened those protections — which the president supported.

trump sees china as joe biden's weak point
another way trump could undermine the health law would be by simply not enforcing its provisions, particularly the individual mandate that requires most people to have insurance. that requirement is supposed to ensure that healthy as well as sick people sign up, thus spreading the costs of people with high bills across a larger population. but executive branch non-enforcement could make a real difference to the vitality of the exchanges going forward, bagley said. if healthy people don't sign up, sick people would need to pay more money for their insurance.
president-elect donald trump said during his trip to washington, d.c., we can't get started fast enough. he has yet to name any cabinet members. there's been a lot of speculation. he did announce his transition team yesterday. those are the people who will help him make those choices. npr's sarah mccammon has been covering the trump campaign and joins us now. thanks for being with us.
rubio told conservatives that under his bill, the size of the future population of the united states will not be significantly impacted by this legislation. however, schlafly notes that the cbo, migration policy institute, numbersusa, center for immigration studies, and senator sessions' office all painstakingly documented the massive immigration increases in the bill.
yet there are some reasons to think expanding medicaid could stand a better chance of gaining wider acceptance than growing medicare, as my colleague colby itkowitz explained here. medicaid is a program run by states — something republicans favor — plus a number of gop governors have embraced medicaid expansion under the aca.

the individual mandate is unconstitutional because it can no longer be read as a tax, and there is no other constitutional provision that justifies this exercise of congressional power, the ruling said. the court sent the case back down to a lower court to decide on whether the mandate is severable from the rest of the law, which would allow other parts of obamacare to survive.

equality has remained a flash point for inter-state conflict, a story kettl traces through the constitutional convention, the civil war, the adoption (and decades-long judicial annulment) of the 14th amendment and its equal-protection clause, and virtually every big domestic policy battle throughout american history. federalism's balance of power has shifted back and forth, he observes, with inequality increasing whenever the federal government has taken a hands-off approach.
the discussion focused on the individual insurance mandate and congress' power to regulate commerce. roberts went first, as was the custom, laying out his views. he emphasized that he believed the constitution's commerce clause never was intended to cover inactivity, such as the refusal to buy insurance.
one thing i know when i was out there, anderson, hillary clinton the remembers the pain of this.
it's more than that, though. barrett is willing to go the extra mile when necessary — for instance, going to bat for laura wolk, a blind student who upon entering the law school, found the school computer software didn't allow her to access law books and other legal material in a format she needed to read for her classes. as wolk recounts, when she told barrett about it, barrett replied, this is one i absolutely can take off your plate.

in june, when close to half a million americans had lost health insurance through their employer due to the economic shutdown brought on by the pandemic, the trump administration urged the supreme court to overturn the affordable care act, which authorized obamacare. by august, the number of americans who had lost their health insurance jumped to six million — or, at least 12 million when spouses and children are taken into account, according to research from the economic policy institute.

finally, americans are living with the virtual stagnation of the economy since the early 1970s (interrupted for about a decade by the information revolution). this continuing malaise lies behind wage earners' increased frustration over their relative standing in wage distribution—a sentiment that, more than anything else, accounted for trump's rise. there can be no question that a president biden—unlike president trump—would want to restore the economy to its former glory.

a president whose primary health policy objective is scrapping his predecessor's law that brought the uninsured rate to a historic low can't plausibly claim to be fixing the health care system. obamacare is bad is not a policy, and anyone who expected trump to finally, at long last, explain to the public how he would replace that law ― if such a person still exists ― has been disappointed yet again.
love the guy, he said of george w. bush: some conservatives have said one of the reasons they don't trust kavanaugh is his closeness to washington, d.c., politics and former president george w. bush. at this year's catholic university law school commencement address, he noted what a fan he is of the former president, as highlighted by the national law journal:
but experts say that's unlikely. under the aca, consumers who have discrepancies with their application have 90 days to resolve the issue with documents that establish their eligibility.

we all know what happens with single payer. you get -- you get lower quality, higher costs, less choices, less innovation; and it costs lives and money. and so that's his -- those are donald trump's words.

betsy mccaughey: sanders gets it wrong on 'medicare-for-all'
at any given moment in american history, the lives and rights of people who were theoretically american, but not white, centered on where their group could be plotted in relation to whiteness. that relationship could fluctuate over time.
overall, however, the mood was notably more subdued than past gatherings. after eight years out of power in the white house, attendees seemed thrilled to have finally reached the mountaintop. but, as even the organizers conceded, they still didn't know what to make of the sherpa.
a lot of people have already discussed [the tax changes], openly stating that it's going to benefit the top 1%, which it will. they're mostly going to gain from it. however, the middle class people are going to receive child tax credits. that's big. that is big for a family. also we're going to see a little alleviation from the taxes – they say we're going to start seeing it on our paychecks very soon. … i honestly believe that trump is doing this to bring corporations back to america. i think he's trying to make it easier for these big companies with the money to say, hey we could do this in the united states for a lesser price now because he's given us this tax back.
the republican argument against obamacare - with which mister ip closes his article - is not wrong. i am sorry to report that obamacare, in its current incarnation, does function as a tax on the middle class to subsidize healthcare for the lower class. but when the white male ceos of all of the major health insurance companies earn $10 million to $15 million dollars per year and their companies are leaving the healthcare exchanges because they are supposedly losing money, is it really the lower class citizens who are bilking the system?
spicer: well, look, i don't -- i think, he's gonna increase market access wherever he can. he's in the process of reviewing all of our current trade agreements. and looking at potential bilateral options going forward, whether it's in the e.u., or in the asia- pacific arena, or in the middle east.
trump also wasted little time in criticizing ex-rival elizabeth warren's decision to drop out of the race only after super tuesday, saying she may have sabotaged bernie sanders' struggling presidential bid by siphoning the progressive vote.
bash: thank you so much for watching state of the union. i'm dana bash in washington.
tolson: if you really talk to people outside of all of it, they really don't care, and they're turning it off. and what they really care about is the big-picture things and how it affects them, you know, how it affects their day to day. and we're all caught up in - is he contradicting himself? look, we contradict ourselves every day. we say one thing. we do another. the next day comes, and we feel differently about it. and i understand that we put the president in this position where he has to be perfect or be consistent. i understand that. but at some level, we need to be a little bit more gracious.
even if you were able to keep your health insurance, experts say you could face caps on your coverage that expose you to enormous medical bills. preventive care and birth control could cost you more. medicare beneficiaries could face higher premiums, deductibles and copays. insurers could cancel your policy retroactively for even minor mistakes on your application.
more broadly, women are shaking the foundations of our culture. since day one of this administration, women have been persisting, reclaiming our time and saying once and for all that #timesup. the radical power of the #metoo movement has demonstrated that we are done accepting the status quo. it's time. an america where everyone has an equal shot at success means our country is more likely to live up to its promise.
to get a broader understanding of barrett's views on abortion, democrats will likely ask whether she believes roe and planned parenthood v. casey, a major abortion case from 1992, were rightly decided, as well as for her views on stare decisis, the legal principle that says courts must follow precedent.
biden was referring to the u.s. strategy for engagement in central america, which began under obama in fiscal year 2016 at a level of $750 million, according to a june 12 report by the congressional research service, an arm of the library of congress. (see table 5, page 13.)
cost-sharing subsidies reduce consumers' insurance payments — an important feature of the affordable care act, because deductibles are rising. under the law, subsidies are available to people who earn between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level, with extra assistance available for those up to 250%. for a family of four, that's about $24,000 to $61,000.
breitbart news foes, added courrilche, further demonstrate this news media outlet's impact. hollywood, big tech, our far-left education system, and the political establishments of both parties have all unsuccessfully tried to take [breitbart news] down — or at least quiet them — but they've all failed, he said.
the caucus is not all about power
a big unknown is how aggressive trump would remain in going beyond rhetorically opposing obamacare, said thomas miller, a resident fellow at the conservative american enterprise institute. his report card as a presidential candidate reads, 'donald needs to improve his attention, effort, and study habits. he is easily distracted and seems to prefer just picking fights with others.' 
i am not willing to pay $930 for coverage and to pay a $3,000 deductible, he said. so he's going to shop around on healthcare.gov for a better deal. but if he doesn't find one, he said he may skip buying insurance and hope for the best.
medicare now reimburses doctors $86 to discuss end-of-life care in an office visit that covers topics such as hospice, living wills and do-not-resuscitate orders. known as advance care planning, the conversations can also be held in a hospital.
before the affordable care act marketplace launched in 2014, people with chronic diseases who tried to buy their own insurance were routinely denied coverage based on their medical history.
at the same time, the white house largely moved on to other things after passing the stimulus legislation. the conversation in congress turned to the health care reform effort that would eventually become obamacare. and while economists broadly came to realize that even the then-unprecedented $787 billion stimulus law wasn't enough to jump-start the economy, unified republican opposition and defections from conservative democrats prevented the white house from passing a second piece of legislation aimed at creating jobs.
tom hanks voices the post's 2019 super bowl spot. (the washington post)
that's not all. the white house budget request this year called for $250 billion in medicaid cuts over a decade. the house republican budget proposal called for reviving the american health care act's medicaid cuts. and the trump administration is encouraging states to impose work requirements on medicaid enrollees, a policy designed to reduce enrollment in the program. that plan is already working as intended in arkansas.
harper: so in early 2015, the state announced that people in austin, ind., were contracting hiv. austin's a small rural town sort of near the kentucky border. it has little more than 4,000 people, but that outbreak eventually grew to more than 200 who were infected with hiv. the virus was spreading through injection drug use. people were taking this painkiller, injecting it. at the same time, they were sharing their needles and spreading hiv.
neither the senate nor the house brought the resolution up for a vote – and it is still sitting on capitol hill.
what's more, republicans are trying to push the bill through before the congressional budget office can weigh in with an analysis of how much it would cost and how many people could lose insurance. prior versions of republican health bills care all showed millions more would no longer be insured compared with under the aca.

enter sanders, who wasn't even a democrat, and who had spent most of his two-decade career in washington, d.c., as more of a backbench gadfly than anything else. sanders had begun to emerge as a national figure several years before, when he protested a bipartisan tax deal with an eight-hour filibuster.
in 1978, the government shut down for 18 days when democratic president jimmy carter found himself at odds with congress even though democrats controlled both the house and senate. carter vetoed a defense bill that included funding for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier and public works legislation that included funding for water projects. funding for the department of health, education and welfare was delayed because of a dispute involving medicaid funding for abortion.
criticism on the right -- from insiders and outsiders -- was swift, including from the wall street journal editorial page, which described the decision as shot through with confusion.
if they're going to impose this on us, we better prepare to protect the state from it, rubio said, referring to efforts in florida to create a cap-and-trade program. i have never supported cap-and-trade, and i never thought it was a good idea, and i was clear about that at the time.
with the eyes of the world set to be on trump and biden later on tuesday, the goldman strategist said the first debate could be an important catalyst for investors to assess risks.
serious republicans like bob gates and john mccain chortle at the idea:
short-term health insurance plans do not have to comply with onerous obamacare insurance regulations, meaning that short-term insurance plan premiums can cost a third of the cost compared to obamacare plans. the average monthly premium for a short-term insurance plan in the fourth quarter of 2016 cost $124 per month, while an unsubsidized obamacare plan costs $393 per month.

cooper: mayor nutter, you're a clinton supporter.
simmons-duffin: yeah. it's a reminder of the politics here. the very law that expanded medicaid and created these insurance exchanges is the affordable care act - obamacare. so trump feels he was elected in part on his promise to get rid of that law. congress wasn't able to do it back in 2017. the administration is still fighting to strike it down now in court. this fall, the supreme court is planning to hear the trump administration's arguments against the law. so this might all explain the reluctance here to make use of obamacare by making a special enrollment period that could be seen as an admission that the law is helpful during this crisis.
a final decision from the court is expected by june.
employing many of the same themes and talking points he had used in his state of the union speech and to rile up crowds in new hampshire and iowa, he touted low unemployment and new jobs, boasted about improved life expectancy and mocked his democratic opponents.
the west calumet housing complex was built in 1972 atop a former lead smelting plant. even after the environmental protection agency discovered high levels of lead in 1985, hud's indianapolis field office did not conduct the required environmental reviews, according to the report.
the white house has long expected that the fierce politicking around the law would wane as millions of people got coverage and other issues took center stage. but while some republican governors have decided to take advantage of the law's provisions to expand medicaid coverage in their states, republican legislators in congress remain persuaded that the law is collapsing and are determined to help it fail. republicans also showed they could use arcane budgetary rules to circumvent a democratic filibuster and pass repeal legislation for the signature of a republican president.
according to the kaiser family foundation, 85 percent of those who applied were considered eligible for some type of financial aid, which comes out to about $10 billion in subsidies in the first year.
president-elect joe biden has nominated california attorney general xavier becerra to serve as his first secretary of health and human services. becerra was a leading advocate for passage of the aca as california's attorney general, and has defended the law in federal court, including before the supreme court.
a year after the women's march, i wish i could find my flight attendant friend and ask her what she thinks. i hope she's seen for herself the power of women standing up and taking charge. i hope she exercises her own power to vote. and i hope she knows that when she does, she won't be alone.
trump claimed it's never been done before.
and this certainly raises the same profile. the president's expressing frustration that congress is not doing what he thinks congress has to do. but of course he's a different branch. and we have three branches in this system. and no president can take on the powers of all three branches. and that's what he seems to be doing. he certainly seems to be taking on legislative authority. he isn't being particularly coy about this. you know, he says this is what i wanted to get out of legislation. and i'm going to do it on my own. and that does become a government of one.

a sales associate takes a gun from a display of shotguns at the gun store november 14, 2008 in las vegas, nevada. store manager cliff wilson said he's seen a large spike in sales since barack obama was elected president on november 4, with customers citing fears about the president-elect's record on firearms.
— and here are a few more good reads:
yes. president trump's first legislative priority after his election was to repeal and replace the affordable care act. republicans in congress voted on several different bills, but each of them had provisions that would have substantially eroded the current protections for americans with prior health conditions, by weakening the regulations that make such insurance available, affordable and useful.
evidence from single-payer systems abroad indicates that all the gigantic tax increases needed to pay for medicare-for-all would simply buy us all places on waiting lists for health care.
the number of americans without health insurance did rise during the trump presidency, because of his attempts to diminish the law. his administration did little to advertise obamacare policies and weakened some of its provisions, like protections for people with certain medical conditions. but this increase in the number of uninsured reversed only a small portion of the decline caused by obamacare.

that massive edge for democrats reflects just how much the political landscape has tilted on the issue over the past decade. opposition to what many conservatives viewed was a massive government overreach into what should be best handled by the private market led to republicans winning control of the house in the 2010 midterms. by 2012, public opinion on the law had stabilized somewhat and obama was re-elected relatively easily. two years later, however, amid implementation problems and the famous/infamous backtracking on if you like your health care plan, you can keep it, republicans again ran on their opposition to the aca and made more seat gains in congress. in the 2016 presidential election, trump ran explicitly on a plan to repeal and replace the aca. by 2018, democrats were able to capitalize on the fact that house republicans had approved a repeal and replace package that never became law because it failed in a late-night vote in the senate.

shutting down the law would mean shutting down the center and its programs, with unknown consequences for the health care providers participating in them.

where we disagree is the solution. the favorite new reasonable plan is medicare for america, a bill from reps. jan schakowsky and rosa delauro that has won the support of big names like texas presidential hopeful beto o'rourke and the center for american progress, the left-of-center think tank where the plan originated as medicare extra for all. it has been extolled in opinion pieces for some of america's largest newspapers as a realistic plan to fix what's broken in our health care system.

one of the hidden morals of the great republican health care crackup of 2017 is that the american people flatly rejected replacing the aca with something substantially more regressive. the gop plan would have cut medicaid spending by $800 billion, leaving 14 million fewer people with medicaid coverage, while delivering an enormous tax cut to the rich. americans clearly disapproved of this outcome. a recent quinnipiac poll found that a majority opposed the gop plan, but more to the point, 74 percent of voters, including 54 percent of republicans, opposed cutting medicaid. the public broadly opposed the gop plan's most prominent mechanism for rolling back spending to cover poor people.

you're correct. the state department advises against travel in that particular part of the region right now. it is dangerous. people need to be cautious. and we do what we can to ensure the safety of americans who travel. that part of the world right now is obviously a very, very challenging situation.
patrick: i get that, but it doesn't trouble me. for example, obamacare started out as a republican idea, conceived by a right-leaning think tank and tried out (successfully) in massachusetts. when president obama proposed and passed it in congress, it soon became clear that the only thing republicans didn't like about it was the obama part. now they want to fuss about alternatives, including medicare for all or even a medicare option in the marketplace. but they have yet to propose any idea to ensure health care for everybody. that's the revealing truth. and that's what's wrong.

listen to his constituents he certainly did. after he toppled boehner—a remarkable achievement for a then-second-term congressman—meadows soon after became the chairman of the house freedom caucus, replacing its first chairman and founder jim jordan. meadows weaponized the freedom caucus, leveraging the group's approximately 40 members in the gop majority for the last year plus of obama's administration and for the first two years of trump's first term to steer the party away from now former speaker paul ryan's failed visions for republicans and to guide the party toward successes on major issues ranging from taxes to healthcare to immigration.

ouch: republican lawmakers are threatening to withhold u.s. funding for the world health organization's cancer-research program, charging that its 2015 finding that monsanto's herbicide roundup could cause cancer in humans is flawed and biased, the ap reports. house science committee chairman lamar smith (r-tex.) said yesterday the finding is fundamentally flawed, relying on cherry-picked science and demonstrating anti-industry bias, citing a separate epa review in december that glyphosate, the active ingredient in roundup and other products, is not likely to cause cancer at typical levels of exposure.

-- but chuck schumer has called on trump to rescind barr's nomination over the nominee's past criticism of the mueller probe. citing a memo barr wrote last year that described mueller's investigation of possible obstruction of justice as fatally misconceived, schumer said on the senate floor, the senate … should subject mr. barr's views to the strictest of scrutiny next week, and i still believe, after the revelations about mr. barr's unsolicited memo, president trump ought to withdraw this nomination. (politico)
the facts: trump is talking about sayfullo habibullaevic saipov, an uzbekistan-born immigrant charged with killing eight people in new york city on oct. 31. but, as we have written, there is no evidence that saipov brought 22 people with him to the united states. in fact, as a green card holder, saipov could not have sponsored anyone other than a spouse and children, and he married and had children in the united states — so he could not have been responsible for bringing in the relatives cited by trump.
that's what he's fighting for is that man or woman out there that's doing everything they can right but can't catch a break. and i think he addressed that in his inaugural speech when he talked about shifting power outside of washington d.c. back to the american people because for too long it's been about stats more (ph) and it's been about, what number are we looking at as opposed to what face are we looking at?
over the next two weeks i'll be pursuing a major executive order requiring health insurance companies to cover all preexisting conditions for all customers, trump crowed at a news conference friday at his bedminster golf resort in new jersey. that's a big thing. i've always been very strongly in favor. we have to cover preexisting conditions.

and 62 percent of legislative staffers said they would view letters from employees of a hypothetical large company in their district as representative of public opinion, versus 32 percent who said the same about letters from ordinary constituents not identifying any business affiliation. perhaps most strikingly, 1 in 10 staffers told the researchers letters from ordinary citizens were not at all representative of public opinion in their districts.
montanaro: well, you know, the - this green new deal is obviously something that democrats want to be able to try to push at least some on the left because it does frame a blueprint of something that's big and bold and broad - to be able to try to break through this sort of gridlock of what to do about climate change. they know that there's something big that has to happen, but nothing has been able to be agreed to.
for the midterms, trump has refused to sign onto the campaign-on-taxes midterm plan, instead, sticking to his populist immigration and trade agenda in recent campaign speeches.
sciutto: well, i spoke to the precinct chair, and he says they're expecting a record turnout tonight. in fact, they're prepared to accommodate as much as twice as many voters as they had just four years ago. it doesn't mean they'll get there. but they're prepared for it.
most immediately, to deal with the economic crisis that has erased millions of jobs and left many americans struggling to pay their bills, biden says he will expand the child tax credit to $3,000 for each child ages 6 to 17 and $3,600 for the youngest children. that would mean, according to his website, that a teacher and electrician with a baby and middle-schooler would receive $6,600.
jimmy fallon scrutinized the opening line of trump's immigration address:
supporters of the law immediately said they would appeal. california attorney general xavier becerra expressed confidence that the ruling could be overturned, saying the aca has already survived more than 70 unsuccessful repeal attempts and withstood scrutiny in the supreme court.

the stock market has gained almost 3 trillion dollars in value since the election on november 8th, a record. we've saved taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars by bringing down the price of the fantastic new f-35 jet fighter, and will be saving billions more dollars on contracts all across our government. we have placed a hiring freeze on non-military and non-essential federal workers.
republican officials from 20 states are asking a federal judge in texas to overturn the entire affordable care act, which would include its provisions guaranteeing access to insurance for people with pre-existing conditions.
that could be a switch that you're going to see here in little bit. but as far as the give and take on cruz and trump, most of those folks, no, i think most of those folks have already committed. it may fire up the wrong crowd in some of those cases. [18:10:05]
it is uniformly accepted dogma that our health cost crisis is caused by skyrocketing insurance premiums. this idea is completely false. it aids the most powerful lobbying group, health care, in continuing to protect hospitals, drug companies, labs and physicians from price competition.
on the other side of the aisle, republicans used social media to champion the president as a destroyer of democrats.
in may 2016, in the wake of the death of justice antonin scalia, the supreme court unanimously decided to send back to the lower courts the case of the little sisters, in effect ordering the government not to fine the sisters for noncompliance with the hhs mandate and for not informing the government that the mandate is in conflict with their beliefs.
this isn't a zero sum world that we live in, her, partner john shepherd, said of what he hopes republicans will understand. and it doesn't have to be that way, yet it seems as though it is. if i have a primary motivator it's that everyone's lives should be better. not just mine – everyone's.

she said sanders would dismantle obamacare, the children's health insurance program, and medicare -- along with private insurance programs.
judge barrett's views on precedent, however, appear to be closer to those of justice clarence thomas, who has little regard for precedent and has urged overturning many long-established decisions.
trump reacted furiously and said the democrats would 'kill us' on health care, according to the four people, who requested anonymity to candidly describe the private meeting. the president then picked up the phone, called azar and put him on speakerphone in the middle of the meeting, josh and yasmeen write.

biden supports a variety of steps to expand caregiving including ensuring access to preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds and also supporting caregivers through job training and improved benefits and protections. the biden campaign says these initiatives would cost $775 billion over 10 years and would be paid for, in part, by rolling back tax breaks on high earners.
pound for pound, it's undeniable that breitbart news is the most influential media outlet in america, determined courrielche. this media organization that started in the basement of its founder's home has helped propel a man into the white house, retired politicians, cratered the popularity of bad legislation. [it] has even sent a movie box office soaring and helped tank a few others. the list of alumni and early contributors to breitbart news looks like a who's who of conservative media: steve bannon, milo yiannopoulos, ben shapiro, steven crowder, dana loesch, james o'keefe, sebastian gorka, larry o'connor, greg gutfeld, andrew klavan, christian toto, [and] kurt schlichter.

3. judges: hiring many thousands of judges, and going through a long and complicated legal process, is not the way to go - will always be disfunctional. people must simply be stopped at the border and told they cannot come into the u.s. illegally. children brought back to their country. (6/25/18)
florida sen. marco rubio then pushed back against bush, saying, the authorization that barack obama asked for was not against isis, it was against (syrian president bashar al-) assad. john kerry described it as attacks that would be unbelievably small. i don't think the united states should be engaged in symbolic military activity. it was not against isis, it was against assad.

roberts said he believes that if congress had wanted the full act to fall, it would have struck it down itself, adding that it's not the supreme court job's to do so. it's hard for you to argue that congress intended the entire act to fall if the mandate were struck down when the same congress that lowered the penalty to zero did not even try to repeal the rest of the act, roberts told texas solicitor general kyle hawkins, who argued on behalf of the 18 red states challenging the law.
the swipes at him as being soft on the gun industry as some way of cozying up to it, or of being anti-obama because he wanted obama to be stronger in pursuing a liberal agenda, or that he wants to scrap obamacare, simply do not connect.
3) decision time: spending debates will force strategy decisions by democrats
gerhart warned consumers in a rate hearing in july that if he rejected insurers' proposed premium increases for 2017, the carriers would likely decline to sell policies in the state. no carriers made an explicit threat to leave iowa, but the implication was clear, he says: it gives you less room to maneuver. iowa law, he said, requires him to judge proposed premium increases on whether experts find them to be justified by carriers' projected costs

glenn beck, the conservative pundit, made a similar case on his radio show: i would rather have my children stay home and all of us who are over 50 go in and keep this economy going and working, even if we all get sick, said beck, who is 56. i would rather die than kill the country. 'cause it's not the economy that's dying, it's the country.
(reuters) - uncertainty surrounding the republican plan to replace obamacare is forcing someu.s. hospitals to delay expansion plans, cut costs, or take on added risk to borrow money for capital investment projects, dealing an economic blow to these facilities and the towns they call home.
and that's where republicans are still trying to overturn the entire law, which they weren't able to undo when they controlled both the house and senate.
either way, it's a lot more like a death panel than anything democrats and their supporters ever tried.
that's a chance i have to take, richard morrell replied.
they may have failed to repeal the law, but they have endeavored to make it harder for people to get coverage. the centers for medicare and medicaid services issued a report demonstrating the effects of the sabotage ― and the higher premiums it has created ― just last week: lower enrollment, especially among those who earn too much to qualify for subsidies.

one year ago, i took a flight from miami to washington, hoping to arrive in time for the women's march the next morning. our flight attendant leaned over to me and asked, do you think it's going to make any difference, this march? she wore a pin commemorating her 20 years of airline service, and i could hear the skepticism in her voice. i understood her uncertainty – was the anger and passion shared by so many women across america in the wake of the 2016 presidential election enough to inspire real change?
one of the first lady's longtime friends and confidants, winston wolkoff was previously the events director at vogue magazine, orchestrating high-wattage events like the met gala.
the law's expansion of medicaid eligibility remains, although more than a dozen states have chosen not to go along.
the news that collins, 67, will launch a bid for a fifth term came a day after she told npr that she was undecided on whether to convict trump in a potential senate trial, which could start as soon as next month, over his conduct with ukraine.
if biden wins the election, you would see an approach that's driven by science and by scientists, says physician vivek murthy, who is a key adviser to the biden campaign on covid-19.
we all agree that some of president trump's proposed policies are not going to line up very well with our conservative policies, texas rep. bill flores told an inside-the-beltway audience on dec. 1. let's do the things where we agree — let's do tax reform, lets do obamacare, lets replace obamacare, let's start dealing with border security, let's rebuild our national security and then, on those areas where his agenda is not exactly aligned with ours … then, we'll figure out the rest in the next six months, flores told arthur brooks, president of the american enterprise institute. … flores also said that if the gop takes the lead, trump also will be less likely to push his populist agenda by changing agency policies and regulations. the gop leadership will just tell him, 'hey, we'll take the lead on this, and we will give you the legislative and constitutional support to go forward,' and that way, he's not inclined to use a pen, to try to follow the obama model, said flores.
doctors, not the government, should be helping women decide what to do in these situations.

when he announced his resignation last week, he was still very much in the middle of these efforts, and much remains to be decided.
during the 2016 campaign and in the early days of his presidency, trump had promised not just to repeal the affordable care act, but to replace it with great health care and insurance for everybody. but when the congressional budget office analyzed an early version of the gop proposal, it predicted the number of people without insurance would increase by 24 million over the next decade, going up by 14 million in 2018 alone.

question: thank you. what did mr. (ph) curtis (ph) mean when he said that he would work through congress to get special something - we don't what it is (inaudible) recipients? and when can we expect that to happen? and also when can we expect the white house spanish site to be back up?
though clinics didn't close because they had other funding sources, services were curtailed, said alina salganicoff, director of women's health policy for the kaiser family foundation.

davis: you know, that kind of bipartisan consensus doesn't seem like it's going to happen right away. there are some early signs that things are going to move next in that direction. lamar alexander, who's a committee chairman, announced that he's going to start having hearings soon on what they can fix in the health care system.
i have so much respect for everyone that works within the administration and they all just truly work hard. i was just an intern but i was always on white house grounds. everyone was just really friendly. everyone was just head deep into their work and just focused on making president trump's job much easier.
i'll be curious to see how the lawyers try to square trump signing this executive order while simultaneously arguing before the supreme court that the affordable care act's protections for pre-existing conditions be annihilated. — steven dennis (@steventdennis) august 8, 2020
bash: ... that we're talking about.
in addition to those slurs against trump supporters, sethi's campaign chairman's friend wrote that trump was lying when he promised to build a wall. trump knows well there will never be a physical wall built across our entire border with mexico, he wrote, adding that trump's promise was fantasy not policy.
martin: and what was their response?
stephanopoulos: both senators warren and sanders want to replace obamacare.
4. trump's claims around patients with preexisting health conditions (including one that glenn gave four pinocchios) have attracted the most ire from democrats. that's because it was they who first passed such protections within obamacare — the law trump tried initially to repeal and subsequently modified through regulatory action.
question: i don't -- i don't mean to beat a dead horse on the issue of the u.s. embassy in israel.
it has instructed epa officials to freeze all grants and contracts, a move that could affect everything from state-led climate research to localized efforts to improve air and water quality to environmental justice projects aimed at helping poor communities. each year the epa awards more than $4 billion in funding for grants and other assistance agreements. for now, it appears, that funding is on hold, casting a cloud of uncertainty over one of the agency's core functions, as well as over the scientists, state and local officials, universities and native american tribes that often benefit from the grants, brady and juliet report.
nearly 29,000 residents have purchased health plans through covered california, the state's insurance exchange, with coverage heavily subsidized by the federal government.

the outcome of the fight won't be determined solely by messaging: american families will determine if the $1,400 checks and expanded child tax credit included in the plan will help them or not; the schools biden is promising will soon open will either begin allowing students to return or keep their doors shut; the inflation republicans predict will either arrive or it won't.
even though he's not on the ballot in nevada, being on the debate stage could benefit bloomberg – with super tuesday less than two weeks away.
donald trump, three years from launching his presidential run, went right to twitter: wow, the supreme court passed @obamacare. i guess justice roberts wanted to be part of georgetown society more than anyone knew.
johnson: as long as we're on a continuing resolution, we are, first of all, restricted to last year's spending levels. but we are not allowed to fund new initiatives, new initiatives for border security, for example, new initiatives to hire more secret service agents for the coming presidential election cycle, new initiatives to fund grants.
the payments do not go all out at once. those whose bank information is on file with the irs would likely get the money first because it would be directly deposited into their accounts. others may receive paper checks or prepaid debit cards in the mail.
the benefits of restoring the csrs, as they've come to be known, are more ambiguous than the benefits of funding reinsurance.
even if the justices were so inclined, the request presents obvious logistical difficulties, with the clock ticking toward the date when the census forms have to be in final shape for distribution. it was that deadline that led the court to grant the administration's request to hear the appeal directly from the district court without waiting for a decision from the court of appeals.
if no candidate gets a majority of votes, there will be a runoff election between the top two candidates. espy's path to victory is surprisingly plausible: if espy and mcdaniel are the top two candidates, mississippians may choose the moderate democrat over the conservative provocateur.
more fact check: did sen. mcgee do enough on taxes?
furthermore, history has repeatedly shown that government can't fix many of our most complex societal issues, even when it socializes just one part of the economy. for example, since the obamacare health insurance exchanges first opened, insurance premiums have doubled and deductibles have skyrocketed.
why medicaid? schatz wrote in a usa today piece touting his bill. frankly, this program — already serving 69 million people — is underrated. it has a large provider network and the same ratings as private insurance but at a much lower cost to the government … medicaid also gives states the flexibility to adapt services and models of care based on their individual needs.
the former vice president then emphasized that president trump is champing at the bit to label the democrats as socialists. and he pointed to his own efforts in the 2018 midterms in helping the democrats win back the majority of the house of representatives.
marianne rafferty, correspondent, fox news: live from america's news headquarters, i'm marianne rafferty. a location is being narrowed down for president trump's second summit with north korean leader, kim jong-un. bloomberg news reporting the meetings is expected to be held in the vietnamese capital of hanoi. two other cities in vietnam are also being considered. the white house on friday said the president will meet with kim in late february. the leaders will continue talks on north korea's nuclear program.
the question now is whether the torching that unfolded after bloomberg's first turn on the debate stage in las vegas will matter more than the billions of advertising dollars he's doling out to purchase a poll surge and saturate the airwaves with a positive image of himself.
in a single year, the president said more than the total number of false or misleading claims he had made in the previous two years, our colleagues glenn kessler, salvador rizzo and meg kelly write. put another way: he averaged six such claims a day in 2017, nearly 16 a day in 2018 and more than 22 a day in 2019.
kaine: well, partly because the congressional leadership went to the administration in july. both houses in both parties and i'm sad to say this, dana, but the leadership went to the white house and said, do what you need to do. we would rather not take this up before a mid-term election.

the freedom caucus is not driven solely by a desire for more power. policy goals also matter. one caucus member told me that hardball tactics were necessary because we have some serious [policy] issues that face us, while another observed that the group's meetings were often productive because no one's questioning anyone's conservative credentials.

at the start of the day, we got a cbs news poll that tested the popularity of washington's leaders. pelosi scored a 39 percent approval rating. that was shy of her disapproval — 50 percent — but it was significantly better than trump's split (36-59) and far better than senate majority leader mitch mcconnell's (r-ky.) 25-55. it also appears to be her best mark in a poll since the last time she was speaker a decade ago.
so when it comes to bloomberg, for you he has this combination of values and resources. that's the appeal.
the ad, aired by the committee to defend the president super pac, includes audio of obama reading from his memoir, dreams from my father, about democrats who court black voters only at election time. in the book, obama paraphrased the words of someone else.
so my dad told me, don't ever live your life trying to please people you don't know and that's -- but you know, i've lived. you know, you can go back and look at 22 years of my career and you know, every -- i've never had an incident with a teammate. i meant, not a serious incident. every day, you have so fans, clubhouse guys --
the overall results of this study are that after expansion of medicaid in 2014, the areas in the country that did expand had a significantly lower mortality rate compared to if they had followed the same trajectory as the areas in the country that didn't expand, said dr. sameed khatana, a fellow in cardiovascular disease at the hospital of the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia, who was first author of the new research.
coger: it's gotten worse and worse and worse. and now whenever i get up in the mornings, i have to push myself up to sit down on the bed. and then, whenever i get up, i've got to push myself up and sort of limp and lose my balance everywhere until finally my left side starts working properly.
in addition to signing an order rescinding that policy thursday, biden began the process of undoing a similar restriction on domestic groups.

on sept. 1, trump nominated rep. tom marino (r-pa.) to be his first permanent white house drug czar. marino, a former prosecutor, had been one of trump's earliest and most ardent supporters in congress.
pragmatic, but conservative: overall, however, based on some 300 opinions in 12 years on the federal bench, kavanaugh is considered a pragmatic but conservative judge, who believes in textualism and originalism. he also often weighed in against president barack obama's environmental protection agency, including, notably in one case — in which he was in the minority — that said the epa should have considered costs to power plants. scotusblog notes that his argument was a signal to late justice antonin scalia to take the case. the supreme court did, and reversed the d.c. circuit's opinion, quoting kavanaugh's dissent.
newt gingrich: well, i think he needs to set a direction that allows people who are deeply opposed to obamacare to realize it's gradually going to be reformed and rethought. a lot of the initial phase, frankly, i suspect - i don't know for a fact - but i suspect that the opening 48 or 72 hours will have so many executive orders repealing obama's executive orders that the average conservative will be giddy with excitement.
by the middle of 2009, jim demint, the arch-conservative south carolina republican who had riled up tea party activists by promising that defeating reform would be obama's waterloo, was setting the tone on health care. grassley, facing the threat of a conservative primary challenge, started talking about death panels at events back home. and in a meeting obama later described in his memoir, the iowa senator told the former president there was no concession that would win his vote.
matthew fiedler, a fellow at the brookings institution who suggested this approach, said that this comparison was probably too generous to mulvaney for several reasons.
madden: if trump wins tonight, it will be because he had a better ground game than many people thought.
the national academies of sciences, engineering, and medicine holds a public session of the committee on implementing high-quality primary care on wednesday.
let's start with one big difference: the american rescue plan is starting off a lot more popular than the 2009 stimulus. a cnn poll released wednesday found 61% of americans support the plan, including 58% of independents and 26% of republicans. only 37% of americans were firmly opposed to the legislation. other polls, including one from the pew research center, have found even higher levels of support.
he also pledged to send $200 drug cards to all americans using medicare in an effort to supplement the cost of prescription drugs — though health experts are skeptical of the plan's long-term benefits for lowering prices. plus the white house's suggested process for paying for the plan remains uncertain.
johns hopkins university virologist andrew pekosz compared such viruses to particularly destructive burglars, our colleagues write. they break into your home, eat your food and use your furniture and have 10,000 babies. 'and then they leave the place trashed,' he said.

schumer's office plans to move on their resolution soon, but did not indicate an exact timeline for introduction. with democrats in the minority, schumer's office continues working to reach out to senate republicans to get support for the measure.
— in an editorial last week, the wall street journal's editorial board argued that federal and state officials need to start adjusting their anti-virus strategy now to avoid an economic recession that will dwarf the harm from 2008-2009.
where has biden been lately? according to matt, he has spent the last week at home making calls to lawmakers and meeting with advisers, but has kept a relatively low public profile. some have criticized his absence over the past week amid a national crisis. his campaign announced 10 days ago that biden himself has not taken the test for the coronavirus because he has no symptoms and hasn't come into contact with anyone who has tested positive.
when mccain announced he had brain cancer in july 2017, the revelation rocked washington, d.c. — but it particularly touched graham. it was graham who, after being on the phone with mccain, broke the news to a meeting of fellow senators discussing health care.
if a republican did what schumer did, they'd be in jail right now, trump said to applause.
the 307,000 number comes from a veterans affairs report released last september and it represents the number of pending records that belonged to veterans who had died in previous months. however, that number does not necessarily represent veterans who were actively seeking treatment in va health care, according to the va's inspector general.
given the sick joke of a health plan, you might ask what happened to all those proclamations that obamacare was a terrible, no good system that republicans would immediately replace with something far better — not to mention donald trump's promises of insurance for everybody and great health care.
we need universal healthcare in this country, right, klobuchar said to applause. health care shouldn't be a privilege. that means the most immediate way to do this is a public option, something that barack obama wanted to do … a public option with either with medicaid or medicare that would bring the prices down for everyone. we need to take on the pharmaceutical crisis and bring down the cost of prescription drugs.

spicer: but -- but again, part of it is economic team is gonna look at a multitude of statistics and drive economic policies. his goal is obviously, to get as many americans working together. that's his ultimate goal.
— biden and trump have allowed their campaigns to launch deeply personal offensives against the other in recent days as they confront a likely general election clash before a nation grappling with a viral pandemic, our colleagues matt, michael scherer and josh dawsey report. the faceoff comes as much of the presidential campaign has been either put on hold or shifted online as the contenders retool for an new era of economic crisis and social distancing. fundraisers have been postponed, rallies have been canceled, and new technologies are under consideration.

while mr. trump invested no small degree of political capital in the louisiana and kentucky only to watch republicans come up short, neither deep-red state is expected to be competitive in 2020's presidential race. still, national parties are looking for takeaways from saturday's result.
between january and april 2017, 9,442 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. elizabeth loranzo, 25, a mother and beautician from middletown, pa., was one of them.
we all recognize that the status quo isn't working. we spend more per person than any other country on health care, but we aren't getting any bang for our buck. we have lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality rates and more preventable deaths, and too many personal bankruptcies are due at least in part to medical bills.
mr. trump campaigned against donnelly during a may rally in elkhart, indiana, calling the incumbent sleepin' joe. meanwhile, donnelly continues to steadfastly project an image as a moderate, and even trump-friendly. in july, donnelly released an ad that quotes mr. trump's praise of the senator at a bill signing later in may.
here is a glimpse of their friendship, in photos:
coverage for those who make the deadline will begin january 1, a handful of weeks before the program's most prominent opponent, president trump, leaves office. mr. trump campaigned on repealing and replacing obamacare during the 2016 election, and kept on message, albeit unsuccessfully, throughout his presidency.

but the outlook is troubling for other americans. if they are insured, they'll mostly be covered after meeting their annual deductible, but they'll still cause a boost in health-care spending that will make future premiums more expensive for everyone else.
if we don't cut taxes and we don't eventually repeal and replace obamacare, then we're going to lose across the board in the house in 2018. and all of my colleagues running in primaries in 2018 will probably get beat, south carolina sen. lindsey graham said on cbs' face the nation over the weekend. it will be the end of mitch mcconnell as we know it.
they also create extra costs for providers who need large administrative staffs to deal with billing systems, accounting for as much as $100,000 per physician.
we couldn't need it more in terms of this pandemic, house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) said on a call yesterday hosted by the democrat-connected group protect our care. as we prayerfully go into this further discussion on the coronavirus challenge, thank god for the patient protection and affordable care act.
many of us campaigned on the same core promises: to defend american jobs and demand fair trade for american workers; to rebuild and revitalize our nation's infrastructure; to reduce the price of healthcare and prescription drugs; to create an immigration system that is safe, lawful, modern and secure; and to pursue a foreign policy that puts america's interests first.
story highlights affordable care act helped vital but financially troubled rural hospitals a full repeal of the law could signal their death knell
for the previous pandemic stimulus bill, the internal revenue service started sending out the second round of payments -- that were worth up to $600 -- three days after then-president donald trump signed that billn late december. but it's possible that tax filing season , which is currently underway, could slow down the process this time.
when you hear that from officials, they have no plan, and they have no plan because they're afraid of being wrong and they're afraid of being wrong because they care more about getting re-elected than they care about our children's futures, he explained. that's wrong. they should be accountable.
senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-new york, noted that the president had asked for a bill with more heart than the house bill, but this bill, schumer said, is every bit as bad as the house version and maybe meaner. the way this bill cuts health care is heartless, he said on the floor.
polling showed that new hampshire democratic voters are angry and want the democratic party to nominate a candidate who can defeat president trump in november.
harris on people working multiple jobs
-- the center for american progress has tracked more than 100 contacts between members of trump's campaign and transition team and russian-linked officials. usa today's christal hayes reports: 'this wasn't just one email or call, or one this or that,' said talia dessel, a research analyst for the left-leaning organization. 'over 100 contacts is really significant because you don't just have 100 contacts with a foreign power if there's nothing going on there.' … dessel noted the group's list of contacts is on the 'conservative' end and the 'very minimum amount of contacts' between russian-linked officials and those within the trump campaign and transition.
advocates for reproductive rights are pushing the new administration to go beyond simply reversing trump administration actions affecting abortion services and put in place new protections and expanded services.
nyt: on friday, gov. andrew m. cuomo told new york's 19 million residents to stay indoors as much as possible and ordered nonessential businesses to keep all of their workers home. the measures, the state's most drastic yet, come as confirmed coronavirus cases in new york topped 7,000, by far the most in the nation. 'these provisions will be enforced,' the governor said at a briefing in albany. 'these are not helpful hints.' they will take effect sunday night. even as he told new yorkers to stay indoors, mr. cuomo added that if they did go out — whether to do essential shopping or to exercise — they must stay six feet away from each other.

reality check: christie on new jersey job growth
bet noted that the uncommitted african americans who asked mr. trump questions at the philadelphia town hall did not seem convinced by his answers on a range of topics from health care to inequality. blaque, the voter suffering from sarcoidosis, told cnn later that the president did not answer her question, and she's now decided who's getting her vote.
as you know we're all about big viewerships and large audiences here. so i want to tell you about an effort that we're undertaking here in the press briefing room to offer up more access to a group of journalists from around the country.
gergen: right. but won't we know sort of how many votes were cast and who they went for? one person could win the delegate count and somebody else could win the popular count on that basis.
obamacare:supreme court appears unlikely to topple affordable care act
according to the new document, there would be no increase in that minimum rate. households would be able to avoid taxes on their first $25,200 in income for a married couple (the figure for individual taxpayers would be half that), but on top of that, there could be additional exemptions depending on the size of the household, as in the current system.
christie had told trump that his administration was inheriting an out-of-control opioid epidemic that blew up with the arrival of fentanyl during the obama administration — between 2013 and 2017, more than 67,000 people died from the synthetic drug.
trump: we're going to very much try and keep that in. adds cost, but it's very much something we're going to try and keep.
question: some of them were not?
corlette noted that the obama administration insisted that state waivers not hurt certain vulnerable populations, including those with severe medical needs. this is saying that so long as things work out in the aggregate, then it's ok if certain subpopulations are harmed, she said.
4. adjust your budget for your new salary
6. mitch mcconnell: can you believe that mitch mcconnell, who has screamed repeal & replace for 7 years, couldn't get it done. must repeal & replace obamacare! (8/10/17)
it's an ideal situation, one that the aca tried to replicate in many ways.
indeed, cruz sounds much more diplomatic these days. he said monday that a lot of work remains, but the talks in a working group that he started earlier this year with sen. lamar alexander (r-tenn.) have been productive.
in another early executive action, trump signed an order seeking to ensure that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable federal law do not receive federal funds, except as mandated by law.
the conversation with obama, inside an office building not far from the white house, lasted for nearly an hour. he looked more relaxed than i'd ever seen him. he was wearing a black, open-collar shirt, casual dark gray pants and loafers ― and, as he gleefully pointed out, no socks. the best part of not being president anymore, he said of his attire. but he talked like he always did, with that deliberate, professorial cadence and sentences full of dependent clauses in order to capture every last nuance.
as we speak, we are removing gang members, drug dealers and criminals that threaten our communities and prey on our citizens. bad ones are going out as i speak tonight and as i have promised.
you've indicated that you will hit the ground running. my question is: in what direction will you be running? asked sen. debbie stabenow, d-mich., before pressing azar on whether the $255 sticker price on a vial of the company's fast-acting insulin humalog is too much.
amid those lies, however, gop officials and candidates have occasionally lapsed and told the truth: the party, like it always has, wants to cut federal health care programs. they want to repeal the affordable care act, still without having any idea how to replace it, and they're working hard to make the law worse in the meantime. they want to slash medicaid. they want to shrink medicare.
during the campaign to date, the media has treated sanders as an entertaining oddity, and has rarely challenged him. count on that to change in coming months, as his rivals fight his ascent and president trump goes after him. film clips of sanders defending communist countries, or defending his campaign against sexism, will become more prevalent. he may still succeed in winning the nomination, but the bernie bubble will burst.
the ballot measures do have their opponents. in nebraska, a republican state senator and a former legislator unsuccessfully challenged the expansion initiative in court. the idaho republican party passed a resolution in june opposing the ballot measure.
gingrich: well, i suspect - i don't know this - but i suspect that they got drowned in picking the cabinet. but they're going to have to do it sooner or later. i mean, the longer they wait, the greater the irritation will be and the more concerned people will be. so it's not to their advantage, you know, to get to the inaugural without having sorted this out.
as part of the promotional campaign for obama's visit to milwaukee, the white house shared a letter a former opponent sent the president about his experience with the affordable care act.
-- spicer also took the first question at his briefing from a reporter who works for lifezette, a tiny website founded by trump supporter laura ingraham that published some untrue stories during last year's campaign. spicer's move also breaks with the longtime tradition of calling upon a famous mainstream organization, such as the ap or a major television network, first. (ap)
i hope i can earn your trust and your confidence, azar said tuesday.
sagal: bill, how did roxanne do on our quiz?
it provides a check on a lot of this. but again, i -- he's always gonna be fighting for the interest of the country and the american worker. so where -- how we engage and with whom, is gonna be decided on whether or not we can get a deal that benefits our country, economically and in terms of national security. that there are there things that we can do economically, that actually end up also benefiting us from a national security standpoint because of the economic relationship that exists between the two countries.
it's an axiom of the tv news business that if it bleeds, it leads, so it's no surprise that the bloodletting within the republican party is at the top of the charts these days. it's also true that good news is hardly considered news at all, even when it affects millions of people and undermines a core argument in a presidential race.
even as the high court prepares to issue major rulings on abortion, immigration and affirmative action, u.s. solicitor general donald verrilli — the president's supreme court advocate — is relinquishing the lectern to his deputy, ian gershengorn. by monday, when the justices may deliver the term's final verdicts, he will be jetting to italy for a three-week vacation.
san diego used to have the most illegal border crossings in the country. in response, and at the request of san diego residents and political leaders, a strong security wall was put in place. this powerful barrier almost completely ended illegal crossings.
it's important to remember that securing the white house compound, the protection of the first family and other national leaders is a balance between providing for their physical safety, but we live in democracy where people want transparency, they want access to their national leaders and the buildings and the structures of government. and so it means striking the appropriate balance.
-- trump also maintained that he has the absolute right to declare an emergency and construct the wall without congressional authorization. asked what his threshold will be for usurping legislative authority, he answered: my threshold will be if i can't make a deal with people that are unreasonable.
in a letter filed with the fifth circuit u.s. court of appeals, justice department lawyers said that a lower court's ruling that the health care law is unconstitutional should be affirmed and that the united states is not urging that any portion of the district court's judgment to be reversed.
on medicaid work requirements, who will judge the character judges?

coming up next, about a half hour from opening time at the caucus locations throughout iowa. and about 90 minutes from the actual caucusing,/ we'll check back in with the democratic and republican caucus site for a closer look at what is about to unfold. the first real contest in this amazing presidential election. we'll be right back.
the gop's latest proposal to repeal and replace the affordable care act hews closely to the earlier bill that didn't win enough support among lawmakers to bring to a vote.
but he needs to see those numbers perform for him tonight. in his final pitch, it was a very direct message to evangelical voters, all about character, questioning to point-blank to people out there on the trail saying the person you plan to caucus for, do they have integrity? do they have character? really trying to make that direct contrast with donald trump with evangelicals out here on the trail -- wolf. blitzer: sunlen, you're there in des moines where cruz will be
question: and follow up to don carls (ph) question. so are you retracting your claim on saturday that it was the largest crowd in person for the inauguration?
the level of democratic vs. republican hostility in the house chamber, where the speech was delivered, was palpable.
now, in 2020, if she is confirmed, barrett would likely be a sixth conservative vote on the court, making it plausible that there will be a majority to overturn roe v. wade outright.
a fair compromise, is how team trump advocates of such a move characterize it. it allows the president to edge closer to his campaign promise to relocate the embassy but stops short of a move that would anger palestinians – and upend years of us policy treating jerusalem as a so-called final status issue to be settled by the israelis and palestinians through negotiation.
it's a dynamic the white house is keenly aware of -- biden and his team have stayed in close contact with manchin and his aides in recent weeks.
kettl demonstrates that federalism has always been a dynamic experience, with fuzzy and shifting lines between federal and state powers. key supreme court decisions — mcculloch v. maryland (1819), plessy v. ferguson (1896), brown v. board of education (1954) — have shifted the relative powers forward, back and forward again. federal grants, an early-19th-century innovation that lured states to become agents of national policy through offers too good to refuse, had an enormous impact, allowing federal powers to build interstates, set public school standards and insure the poor.
sen. susan collins, the maine republican who is one of the few members of her party willing to buck president trump, announced wednesday she would seek reelection. her announcement comes the same day the u.s. house of representatives began debate on impeaching the president.
brat explained why the senate cannot pass any significant legislation: we passed that a couple months ago. the senate is the issue on everything. the senate bombed on health care. the senate bombs on everything. that's where everything goes to die. we could if we use budget reconciliation and pass something with 51 votes, but this year, i don't know if people know, but the senate did not put that in the budget; we gave up our only ability to pass legislation as republicans. so we gave up budget reconciliation unilaterally.
democrats would be foolish to think, however, there is no way for them to lose. first, if trump makes the election a choice between himself and a far-left candidate, instead of a referendum on his presidency, he may well survive. second, if the economy is humming along, voters can decide a good economy outweighs all the things they dislike about him. a good economy is the most valuable asset an incumbent president can have.
and for all of their bluster, trump and his advisers might be worried about the consequences of weakening the mandate.
left-wing groups such as planned parenthood claim women should obtain free birth control and that the trump administration is forcing women to pay for their own birth control when they choose to have sex. the obama administration itself, however, actually exempted from its own rule at least 25 million americans – including large corporations such as chevron, exxon, visa, and pepsi bottling, as well as the u.s. military and large cities like new york city – through various exemption allowances, with little pushback from the left.
here tonight, we have legislators from across this magnificent republic. you have come from the rocky shores of maine and the volcanic peaks of hawaii; from the snowy woods of wisconsin and the red deserts of arizona; from the green farms of kentucky and the golden beaches of california. together, we represent the most extraordinary nation in all of history.
but that won't be true until 2027, when most of the individual income tax changes will have expired.
school closures due to the coronavirus pandemic are going to set an entire generation back, former michigan u.s. senate candidate john james warned on fox news primetime thursday.
question: i said the first three rows.
9:35 p.m. et clinton was asked to address her husband's comments from this past week about obamacare being a crazy system. the former president later clarified the comment and said he supports the system.
chris lu, deputy secretary of labor under obama:
trump said that he would try to talk bannon out of declaring war on some of his primary targets saying, i'm going to see if we can talk him out of that, because i think they're great people.
i also believe i'm somewhat different from some of the other democrats in the field. and i can't speak to obama, but i've been on fox news any number of times. i'll talk to anyone. and one friend of mine, whose mother is an avid fox [news] viewer, said that yang is the only democrat i would support because he is the only one who does not seem to be judging me. that is enough for us to get a critical mass of donald trump supporters to get around a solution that would dramatically improve their way of life. they can see it.
can you clarify that? and generally, is the president open to joint action in syria with the russians?
in other words, the administration, unchastened, stands by and will continue to stand by trump's inaccuracies if they're in service to trump's policy goals.
except that it's not. the trans-pacific partnership included all three of the countries in the usmca -- the us, mexico and canada -- plus nine others. also, it's worth noting that the usmca mostly makes incremental tweaks to the previous north american free trade agreement. you can read a full fact check here
i would be glad to do that. i think, you know, russell was a powerhouse here but most people don't know who he was. and mccain? mccain was a hero whether you liked some of his approach is or not. i liked them and i'd be for that, hatch said.
while the rules committee and pelosi's staff contest leadership's role in choosing witnesses, sources close to the process insist primus was intimately involved.
mcgann even called out washington post columnist glenn kessler for pointing out how some of her statements since arriving in the spotlight have been false, including calling the premium for an obamacare policy a tax.
kaiser's cox noted that there could be some uptick in the enrollment rates in the next or following years, since a phased-in penalty on being uninsured reached its cap this year. (households will pay $969 on average for remaining uninsured in 2016, according to a kaiser family foundation analysis.)
meadows served as the second chairman of the house freedom caucus, taking the reins from the group's founder and his close ally, rep. jim jordan (r-oh). together, meadows and jordan have been a pair of the president's fiercest defenders in the house, but even before president trump's 2016 election, the soft-spoken firebrand conservative from western north carolina has helped pave the future path of the republican party—pulling the gop away from swamp deals and failed establishment politics towards populist, grassroots conservative policies that are much more popular with the electorate.
the republican-controlled house voted to sue obama over his executive actions in july 2014. the health care lawsuit was initiated four months later.
newsom derided trump's recent state of the union speech as rife with fear-mongering about a so-called border emergency.

when asked if the president supports democrats' calls to use a legislative process known as budget reconciliation to get another stimulus package expedited through congress, biden said, i support passing it with support from republicans if we can get it.
as the trump administration has stepped up deportations and workplace raids around the country, there's been a drop at the spanish catholic center in all immigrants applying for food stamps, said case manager rodrigo aguirre. many fill in the gaps by picking up bags of donated groceries from the center's food pantry.

the african-american vote was key in south carolina, and biden scored a critical endorsement on wednesday from rep. jim clyburn, the highest-ranking black member of congress. buttigieg, klobuchar and warren have performed poorly in polls of black voters — who make up about 60% of south carolina's democratic electorate.
governor greg abbott today held a press conference in houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session. the governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his state of the state address in february. governor abbott was joined for the press conference by senator paul bettencourt and representative briscoe cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in texas
under the lran deal legislation passed by congress, trump must certify every 90 days whether iran is in compliance to prevent the reapplication of u.s. sanctions. trump did this twice since taking office but made it clear he was unhappy about not being able to fulfill his campaign promise. last october, he refused to certify that iran was in compliance, bringing about the new, may 12 deadline about whether to re-impose sanctions.
spicer: i mean the bureau of labor statistics puts (ph) it out.
just like hillary in 2016, who was obviously old and unwell, biden is running a part-time political campaign.
in 2019, we also celebrate 50 years since brave young pilots flew a quarter of a million miles through space to plant the american flag on the face of the moon. half a century later, we are joined by one of the apollo 11 astronauts who planted that flag: buzz aldrin. this year, american astronauts will go back to space on american rockets.
insurers could go back to screening customers for health status, as they did before the health care law took effect, charging higher premiums or denying coverage altogether to people who have histories of cancer, diabetes or even plain old allergies.
question: welcome. question following on what she was asking about the tpp. you know, part of the thinking of tpp was to encircle china economically and i wonder if the president has thought a little bit about what kind of bilateral relationships in the region -- trade relationships would accomplish a similar goal, and secondly, i heard you talking about nafta and a trigger, but i didn't hear you say you had triggered the trigger.
in charlotte, north carolina, on thursday, trump signed executive orders he claims address two of the biggest concerns americans have about the health care system: coverage for people with preexisting conditions and surprise medical bills.
clinton utilizó el último debate antes de las votaciones en iowa y new hampshire -el 1 y el 9 de febrero respectivamente- para dirigirse a los fieles partidarios de obama, quienes según algunos aliados de clinton podrían estar cambiando sus preferencias hacia sanders.
ryan williams, a republican strategist who worked on romney's presidential campaign, said, the governor is a statesman and has an independent voice he lends to certain issues. when he thinks the president is saying something undermining america's ideas or principles, he'll speak out.
the fifth circuit court of appeals ruled in december that part of the law is now unconstitutional and their decision cast a cloud over the rest.
( michael e. miller kuwait hanged seven prisoners in a mass execution, the first death sentences carried out in several years in the oil-rich emirate. one was a member of the royal family who was convicted of premeditated murder. another was convicted of setting fire to a wedding tent after her husband took a second wife. the ensuing blaze killed more than 40 women and children inside.

there are more than two dozen senate democrats and independents up for re-election in november. ten of those are in states president trump won, five of those by double-digits with the margin of victory going as high as 42 percentage points. that's compared to just nine gop-held seats that are up; and only four of those are considered even slightly competitive.
bruni: joe trippi, you mentioned something that has greatly concerned me, too: the dangers of stridency. what qualifies as too strident when it comes to democrats and the right messaging and positioning and candidates for the midterms? what are a few things you've observed recently — tactics, statements — that made you wince and think: that's too strident. that's not wise.
through gehrke, as well, all of the never trumpers including himself exposed in this article refused interviews and would not even say if they still hold the views they have expressed against the president over the years. they all—from gehrke to barnwell-hagemeyer to the wamps to devaney—refused any questions at all about their never trump histories or whether they still hold those views.
advocates were forced to dramatically scale back their plans to celebrate the aca's decade of existence on march 23. president obama released a video message instead of delivering an address at american university, which was canceled.
in the new hampshire primary, sanders and buttigieg each picked up nine delegates to the democratic national convention, while klobuchar picked up six. no other democratic picked up a single delegate. so while sanders won slightly more popular votes, the contest was a draw between him and buttigieg in the delegate count.
nearly 150,000 service members are fully vaccinated, a panel of defense officials told lawmakers in a house armed services committee hearing on the pentagon's coronavirus response. about two-thirds of troops who were offered the vaccine accepted it, the post's alex horton reports.
white house senior adviser cedric richmond said during a cbsn interview on monday that the white house will keep pushing for the $15 minimum wage increase and that biden believes he can work with both sides to get work done, preferring not to change filibuster rules.
y trump, quien ha criticado el proceso de las asambleas electorales desde que perdió frente a cruz en iowa, le dijo a sus partidarios que se olvidaran del proceso –un poco más arduo– de las asambleas electorales, el cual implica que los votantes se reúnan en una ubicación para la asamblea y que escuchen discursos para cada candidato antes de emitir su voto.
he's never come up with a plan, the former vice president said. i guess we're going to get the pre-existing conditions plan at the same time we'll get the infrastructure plan.
via cbs news campaign reporter jack turman at a nevada democrats first in the west event sunday night, new jersey senator cory booker said the presidential election is not about left or right. it is about right and wrong. at the last debate, booker kept his focus on mr. trump and mostly avoided criticizing his fellow democrats. and at a california democratic party convention in long beach this past weekend, booker reiterated that democrats need to concentrate on winning back the white house instead of infighting. i'm happy to be in this field and plan on winning, but the one thing i'm going to stop is us tearing each other down, booker told reporters. after months of struggling in the polls, will booker look to throw some punches at his democratic competitors? or will he continue to focus on mr. trump?
gordon's resignation came less than eight hours after he lifted the coronavirus-related suspension on indoor dining in restaurants. both he and whitmer have refused to say why he stepped down.
of course, this reflects tax returns, not people. we cannot assume that 5 million taxpayers represent just 5 million people, so we cannot easily make an apples-to-apples comparison. but let's give it a shot.
that, of course, was not the public position of the candidates in the summer of 2015 and through the primary season the following winter and spring.
lewis, prompted by matthews — who likened him to a character out of the bible — went on to claim that trump's election arrested that movement toward goodness and openness that had characterized race relations under his predecessors.
in march, however, trump told reporters, i've ended payments to guatemala, to honduras, and to el salvador. no money goes there anymore. he directed the state department to withhold appropriated aid funds. but that was a response to — not a cause of — the renewed surge in immigration.
in one opinion, they argue, he laid the groundwork for upholding the affordable care act as constitutional because he recognized the mandate as a tax. (a law professor from the university of louisville defended kavanaugh to conservatives, writing at the federalist under the headline brett kavanaugh said obamacare was unprecedented and unlawful.)
rather, the speaker of the house wants to be perceived as someone who is measured and comes around to support the witch hunt against the president after reviewing what she deems are facts.

biden made a direct appeal to super tuesday voters in remarks in columbia, s.c., and jabbed at sanders by saying people don't want a revolution.
the court's action is the apparent culmination of a lengthy legal battle that had already reached the high court once before.
gingrich: i think they're going to have to find some system that convinces most reasonable people that they're operating within bounds of integrity and bounds that prevent corruption and prevent misuse of power.
the poll also notably tested her head-to-head with trump, asking who was doing a better job with shutdown negotiations. forty-seven percent chose pelosi, while just 35 percent chose trump. it also affirmed previous polling that showed the american people blame trump and the republicans for the shutdown by more than a 20-point margin — the kind of margin that has forced republicans to fold during past shutdowns.
the affordable care act strengthened medicaid by funding new home-based care options for the disabled and elderly. these initiatives would lose their authorization, leaving decisions about whether to continue the programs in the hands of cash-strapped state officials.
barrett, in her jacksonville lecture, said she expected that the supreme court's roe v. wade decision would be hollowed out, but not reversed.
in his state of the union address tuesday night, president trump tried to make it sound like everything's coming up roses for the united states – and of course, he said all the credit belongs to him. but as a democrat, i believe the state of the union is not good – our nation is divided, and there is too much hatred and too little forgiveness.
mr. trump said in february that the 15 coronavirus cases in the u.s. would soon be zero. he's also said repeatedly that the virus will eventually disappear, without citing evidence.

we've defended the borders of other nations, while leaving our own borders wide open, for anyone to cross — and for drugs to pour in at a now unprecedented rate.
while the senate will probably demand changes, this bill, if it becomes law in its current form, will repeal and replace large portions of the affordable care act (obamacare). it will change the rules and subsidies for people who buy their own insurance coverage, and make major cuts to the medicaid program, which funds care for the poor and disabled.
totenberg, an atlanta judge appointed by president barack obama, wrote that the government and the nonprofit agency that runs the u.s. transplant system had provided the plaintiffs due process and an opportunity to have their views heard, even if the new policy did not work in their favor, lenny writes. those patients and hospitals, in places such as georgia, kentucky, kansas and virginia, have said they would face the prospect of fewer available organs under the new rules, as more livers are taken by transplant centers in cities with greater demand and higher insurance payments.

that was locker room talk. i'm not proud of it. i am a person who has great respect for people, my family, the people of this country, trump said.

but the weakest argument, the one that has prompted so many of the law's critics to dismiss it, is about a concept called severability. under a well-established doctrine, judges ruling part of a law unconstitutional are supposed to do minimal damage to the rest of the law if they can.
health care is consistently near the top of the list of issues voters care about. while republicans and president trump tend to have an edge on the economy, democrats won the house in 2018 in large part by emphasizing health care — a playbook they intend to revive in 2020. the pandemic has also put republicans at risk of losing the senate, said jessica taylor, who analyzes senate races for the nonpartisan cook political report.
it's not clear that they've actually laid the groundwork in the arab world or in the middle east at all for this kind of a speech, which is going to be a very significant statement. there's a possibility, too, that it could actually violate some un security council resolutions that do not recognize the sovereignty of israel.

speaker pelosi ushered in a new era of divided government in the midst of a government shutdown – 800,000 federal government employees furloughed or working without pay, national parks and museums closed.
the shutdown rolled into the new year, and ended only after clinton agreed to balance the budget within seven years and submit a balanced budget plan to the congressional budget office.
glenn — who awarded trump three pinocchios for this claim he's made 73 times — writes that this assertion is simply wrong.
— his liabilities total between $15,001 and $95,000 (chase credit card $15,000 or less; thrift savings plan loan between $15,001 and $50,000; bank of america credit card $15,000 or less).
james argued that safely and sensibly opening is the democrat version of 'repeal and replace [obamacare]'.
that's as much why democrats aren't defecting, or more so, than the left's growing moral opposition to the very concept of walls. don't forget that trump couldn't get his wall money even when the gop had unified control of government during the past two years — when 10 senate democrats were up for reelection in states he had carried.
it has, in fact, been debunked. he said it on howard stern's radio show.

make no mistake, our education system was far from perfect before the pandemic in places like detroit, he added. the literacy level was far below, far below the national average. in fact, our state had to settle with former students who believe and i agree, that literacy is a basic civil right. i believe that a quality education means a basic civil right and anyone who stands in the way of that should be held accountable.
a strong debate performance, coupled with the massive buy, could provide a one-two punch for yang and help him connect with voters who really haven't paid much attention to him yet. he will likely stick to his vision of human-centered capitalism to help workers navigate the changing economy and talk about his plan for a new way forward in the 21st century, but voters could also hear more personal stories from yang. he's recently started branding himself as a parent and a patriot in his ads and on the

mcghee: ...health care, which is what the republicans want to do.
we all bleed the same blood.
yet, under his plan, the nation's 8.5 million seniors over the age of 65 and already eligible for medicare would also get hit with tax increases. with more of the nation's baby boom generation working into traditional retirement years, the concern is that the costs to seniors are higher than sanders' plan suggests.
though i didn't see much in what i read in the bible to justify this litmus test, i was new to the faith and trusted those who seemed more theologically knowledgeable. while i came to describe myself as pro-life, i felt frustrated by how disinterested the people around me were in actually helping women reduce abortions. i believed, as i do now, that to reduce abortions, overturning roe v. wade was not the answer. what was needed was providing women the resources they need, which at a minimum involves universal health care, something most abortion critics oppose because of their fealty to republican ideology. the costs of maternal care and a pregnancy alone could bankrupt a woman with no health insurance.

but, by that point, the politics of health care in michigan was shifting in the same way it was shifting nationwide. voters started to appreciate what the affordable care act, for all of its flaws, had achieved. and they got angry at republicans for trying to take those things away.
the decision is a rare victory for the government in a case that has been ongoing since 2018, reuters's kanishka singh and mica rosenberg report.
if the irs 'delays' the individual mandate, the insurance markets in many states could go into a tailspin. rates for 2018 will skyrocket and some insurers could fold, nicholas bagley, a law professor at the university of michigan and expert on obamacare, explained at the incidental economist blog.

in march, the justice department sided with 20 republican-led states seeking to invalidate the entire act as unconstitutional. trump then said senate gop leaders were writing legislation to repeal and replace the aca. but republicans quickly signaled that they had little appetite for raising an explosive issue just as the 2020 political season was getting underway.
flake calls for a trump challenger: during an appearance on nbc's meet the press on sunday morning, arizona sen. jeff flake again called for a republican to challenge president donald trump in 2020. flake has long been a trump critic, and has said he himself would not rule out a 2020 challenge to trump.
cnn's brianna keilar explains why many republicans are hesitant to take the coronavirus vaccine.
as we speak, large, organized caravans are on the march to the united states. we have just heard that mexican cities, in order to remove the illegal immigrants from their communities, are getting trucks and buses to bring them up to our country in areas where there is little border protection. i have ordered another 3,750 troops to our southern border to prepare for the tremendous onslaught.
of course, a president sanders would not get all of his spending and tax proposals enacted. in 2005, president george w. bush proposed a partial social security privatization only to see it die amid fierce opposition. and the affordable care act passed by a single vote. a decade later, republicans are still fighting in the courts to repeal it.
but to achieve this future, we must enrich the mind –- and the souls –- of every american child.
washington – endorsing the idea that the courts should strike down all of former president barack obama's health care law, president donald trump said tuesday that he and the republicans will embrace the issue ahead of next year's elections.
this effort will be guided by two core principles: buy american, and hire american.
1. a bigger tax cut for the middle class
there's a lot of things at play right now that are not left or right ― they're iowa issues, he said. it's our tariffs, it's these farmlands all around us.
cornish: e.j., last hard minute to you.
van hollen also said trump, not the democrats, will shoulder the blame if a shutdown occurs. if the president of the united states, whether by design or incompetence is going to shut down the government, that is a big problem, van hollen said. i hope he will show some leadership; he says he's the great negotiator.
trump said at the iowa rally: i took care of the vets. we got choice. he added that people had unsuccessfully tried to get this veterans health care program approved for 52 years, claiming: what i am good at is getting things approved, and i got it approved.
lee argued that presidents will continue to assume broader powers unless congress fulfills its constitutional duty to protect the american people from exactly the kind of arbitrary, unaccountable government-without-consent that congress now for its own selfish reasons enables the executive branch to practice.

the supreme court on wednesday upheld rules issued by the trump administration that allow employers with religious or moral objections to deny women access to free birth control coverage.
bagley said that the trump administration's move does not signal the end of obamacare, although it does further cloud its future. states such as california will take up the law's defense, and the legal battle will continue.
we're developing a strategy now, baum said.

fair also included in its $2.4 billion estimate costs such as k-12 education, which amounted to $1.3 billion, or 54% of the total, and the cost of limited english proficiency education, which amounted to another $279 million, or nearly 11% of the total. those figures didn't distinguish between children born in the u.s. (and, thus, u.s. citizens) whose parents were in the country illegally, and immigrant children who are not u.s. citizens.
so, we'll get there. we -- we got a lot of calls to return. there's a lot of excitement through the world. and a lot of people who are really excited, both to come here, and have the president visit them.
as we've noted before, democrats advocating for medicare-for-all face challenging questions about exactly how they'd fold more people into the program, how it would be paid for and what benefits would be covered. if the goal is more generous benefits, medicaid could be a more obvious model than medicare, experts say.
why so few people? that's because many more people qualified for exemptions from paying the fee. in 2015, 12.7 million taxpayers claimed one or more exemptions. exemptions are granted for a number of reasons, but the most common one is that an individual has income below a certain threshold and lives in a state that did not expand the eligibility for medicaid. the second-most common exemption is if a citizen lives outside of the united states. people also did not need to pay a penalty if they would have had to pay more than 8.05 percent of their income (in 2015) to obtain health insurance.
statements like these are just rhetoric. but they are consistent with a long-standing approach to policy ― promoted by conservatives, implemented by republicans ― in which protecting the elderly and the frail has been a secondary priority, at best.
barnwell-hagemeyer is not the only never trump ideologue on sethi's payroll. sethi's campaign chairman and senior adviser chris devaney in august 2015 tweeted praise for an op-ed that cast doubt on trump's promise to build a wall along the u.s. border with mexico and bashed trump's candidacy for the white house. devaney tweeted that the op-ed, from his friend veteran presidential campaign staffer dean rice, was good.
biden, having grown up in the steelmaking region of pennsylvania, can hardly be blind to the deprivations and pain of low-paid workers. so, if elected, we would have a president responsive to legislative initiatives for subsidies designed to pull up these workers' meager compensation.

by lunchtime, trump's electoral antennae were twitching as the return of obamacare as a driving political issue trampled all over his end-of-the-mueller investigation victory party and hinted at trouble ahead.
such suggestions run strongly against the current political tides, with democrats pushing hard for even more centralized political control of medicine and ever-larger bureaucracies, with an eye toward midwifing the birth of the doomsday bureaucratic monstrosity known as single-payer socialized medicine. imagine how bad the opioid crisis will get if everyone gets medicaid.
the sanders campaign calculates a savings, said gunnels, for seniors earning $50,000 a year even including the employer tax. fdr had a word for this line of attack, said gunnels. fdr called it 'deceit.'
the law in question requires a doctor providing abortion services to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the procedure. a similar law in texas was struck down by supreme court in a 5-to-3 vote in 2016.
to president donald trump and his supporters, however, crazy bernie is a godsend, a guy they'd love to run against. south carolina gop leaders have urged republicans to vote for him in the state's open democratic primary. and republican senators have refrained from investigations into his background.
so what were his major promises?
i served in ronald reagan's white house and managed his reelection campaign in 1984. then, like now, the occupant of 1600 pennsylvania avenue was more than a transformative political figure — he was the face of a national revolution. president reagan won more than 54 million votes in 1984, carrying 49 out of 50 states. americans overwhelmingly trusted him to roll back government bureaucracy, unleash economic prosperity and pursue peace through military strength.
that resistance hasn't changed. sanders found that out when the culinary workers in nevada failed to endorse him, even as he was the obvious front-runner in their state.

but james has also run into a familiar political problem for republicans. back in 2017, he called for repealing the affordable care act, describing the law as a monstrosity. now he is under attack for trying to take away the law's protections for people with preexisting conditions.
the money would be drawn from a $100 billion fund to help hospitals respond to the crisis that hospital groups expected would be spent on their more immediate financial needs.
second, kaufman argues that what's been happening in wisconsin has historical significance because it made the state a model for conservative activists who, with corporate backing, were remarkably successful in reversing the state's deeper tradition of progressive populism that dates from the 1800s.
kavanaugh is a connected washington insider with roots in politics in the george w. bush white house. he has written almost 300 opinions for the d.c. circuit in 12 years — and he is only 53, which means he could serve on the high court for a very long time.
republican leadership has vowed to repeal obamacare within president-elect donald trump's first 100 days in office, but have said that it could take years before those who have access to health insurance because of the law will have to transition to a new program.
there were 70 local television appearances by senior administration officials and surrogates during a three-week period. an oval office meeting between biden and a bipartisan group of governors and mayors garnered major local coverage.
protect our care today is launching a coronavirus war room with a veteran group of operatives to drive its accountability and advocacy efforts on the coronavirus crisis with a focus on president trump's ongoing failure to prepare the nation for this pandemic, the group said in a press release.
full employment doesn't mean that everyone who wants a job has one. it's a term economists use to describe, roughly speaking, the lowest the unemployment rate can be expected to go at any given time. try to pull it even lower, the idea goes, and inflation would be the result.

senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky) said on the senate floor on monday, i think if we learned anything is that a strategy of shutting down the government over the issue of illegal immigration is something that the american people didn't understand.
is it any wonder that americans are turning to candidates like ward after years of disappointment? she is a true representative of the trump revolution that americans voted into power. after years of broken promises from used-car salesmen posing as politicians, the trump republicans will shake things up by trying a different tactic. they'll keep their word.
second, with her coaching tip, pelosi was essentially instructing the anti-trump washington post to blow the statement up and make sure everyone talked about it. it's a lovely example of a liberal politician colluding with the liberal media.
arkansas is anticipating spending about $136 million in general revenue on its medicaid expansion in the coming fiscal year, with the federal government spending an additional $2 billion. the state uses federal medicaid funds to buy private insurance for the poor — an alternative that conservative republicans found acceptable when it was first passed in 2013. about 285,000 people are now enrolled in the medicaid expansion.
levin: i use pronouns because i don't know what else to say.
in a blistering critique, covered california's executive director, peter lee, said unitedhealth group inc. made a series of blunders on rates and networks that led to a $475 million loss in 2015 on individual policies across the country. the company estimates a similar exchange-related loss of $500 million in 2016.
joel b. pollak is senior editor-at-large at breitbart news. he is a winner of the 2018 robert novak journalism alumni fellowship. he is also the co-author of how trump won: the inside story of a revolution, which is available from regnery. follow him on twitter at @joelpollak.
this issue is essentially a health care issue, said kim baker, a co-chair with indivisible midlands (sc2), which is also fighting at the state level to stop the legislature from restricting abortion rights. then you bring in the extra attacks on women's autonomy and reproductive rights, and i think it will be a very big issue going into the 2020 elections.
that disease started in my skin, moved to my eyes, into my optic nerves, and when i went to graduate school, into my brain, she said.
in 2001, i won the roberto clemente award which is still the highlight of my career. a quick story, my dad, i went to one game as a fan in my lifetime -- in my lifetime. it was roberto clemente's final game in 1972. he doubled off john madden like for his 3,000th hit and he died in the plane crash not long after.
biden's stop in western pennsylvania was not just a stump speech, but an opportunity to offer a glimpse of how he'd approach 2020 if he runs for president again: by working to rebuild a democratic coalition that includes white, rural, blue-collar voters. he slammed trump for the tax bill, saying it would lead to cuts in medicare and social security, and tried to appeal to voters dissatisfied with the president in a district he won by 20 points in 2016.
this is cruz's last push for voters, sunlen. what is his game plan? what has it been like so far today on the ground there in iowa?
the brave agents of ice and border patrol risk their lives every day keeping us safe, cruz said. it is troubling to the extent it appears that marco shut out ice and law enforcement leaders just to appease the democrats on his gang of eight amnesty bill. that reflects a lack of judgment, and an alarming willingness to advance the interests of the washington cartel at the expense of public safety and national security.
washington, dc - may 7: former u.s. president barack obama speaks after receiving the 2017 john f. kennedy profile in courage award from caroline kennedy at the john f. kennedy library may 7, 2017 in boston, massachusetts. obama was honored for his enduring commitment to democratic ideals and elevating the standard of political courage in a new century, with specific mention of his expansion of healthcare options, his leadership on confronting climate change and his restoration of diplomatic relations with cuba.

trump's budget also includes other provisions – such as medical liability reform and drug industry changes – that would indirectly affect medicare and bring federal savings down to roughly $515 billion, goldwein said.
but the move also upends a longstanding legal and democratic norm that the executive branch will uphold existing laws.
so you mentioned earlier that if you look at public opinion about the affordable care act just among white people, it has never been popular. though the affordable care act is now above 50 percent in polling, it is not above 50 percent among white people. i mean, if you at, say, votes for donald trump, donald trump would have won if only white people voted. and one way of reading this that i see sometimes, it's just like, white people are conservative. but something that you draw out, and that you see, i think, if you look at europe, is that that is a reaction to america's particular history with race and its racial divide. so there's obviously nothing genetic about white people that causes them to favor these politics, or else canada would not have a universal health care system, the uk wouldn't have it, denmark wouldn't have it, switzerland wouldn't have it. in other places, white people do not have the politics that white people in america have.
i'm about done here, ok? i just want to tell you this, kasich said, recognizing he had lost many of the republican faithful as they dug into their dinner. i'm going to leave cleveland as the nominee. whether you believe it or not, it's going to happen. (worth noting: the gop's second-place candidate, cruz, fared even worse at the gala. when cruz talked about defeating trump in wisconsin, only one person clapped.)
twice, ryan has declined the opportunity to run for president on his own. but for republicans frustrated with trump's success, and unwilling to accept cruz as an alternative, ryan is a possible plan b.
a day later and a mile away, the other candidate was more punctual. he reached out to his 1,000-person crowd, seated in the round with his podium in the middle, with a more personal, visceral appeal. to raised hands: who sent in checks? wow! to an audience question about stopping heroin: build a wall. to all who would listen: an outsider candidacy, shunning a request for more specific plans and flaunting his use of twitter, consequences be damned.
to say that these are difficult and contentious times is most certainly an understatement, she said. but our country has confronted much more challenging times in our history.
that has not been debunked, trump responded.

after a standing-room-only rally over the weekend at iowa state, sanders, scholten and iowa secretary of state candidate deidre dejear headed to the school's sports complex to shoot some hoops for the cameras.
as congress becomes increasingly mired in gridlock, states have become increasingly empowered and motivated to act on issues of national importance. and more state legislatures have fallen under one-party control; after the 2018 midterm elections, only one state -- minnesota -- has a divided legislature. democrats control 19 legislatures while republicans control 30. and after democrats made gains in governorships via november's elections, 13 states have one party controlling the executive and the other in charge of the legislature.
in a town where male politicians are allowed to get policy facts wrong without losing credibility, ocasio-cortez's mistakes are held up as evidence that she's not up to the task, mcgann wrote.
biden wants you to think he's a moderate who favors a much less costly plan that would build on obamacare. but the former vice president's plan still features its fair share of tax increases that would hamstring our economy and take a bite out of the average family's wallet.
the situation is a loss for healthcare workers, a loss for most consumers, and a loss (allegedly) for aetna, blue shield and most other insurance companies who are threatening to leave the exchanges because they are no longer earning enough money. hey, nobody is intentionally trying to sabotage obamacare and make the first black president look bad - right?
anderson cooper, cnn anchor: and it's interesting. i mean, a lot of people are saying, even at the last debate, the gop debate on fox, that a lot of the candidates were -- they were in iowa, john kasich in particular, they were focused on how they are going to do in new hampshire and trying to appeal to a new hampshire audience, and here on this incredibly important day in iowa. these folks are already in new hampshire trying to get out the vote there.

since the video of trump making lewd comments in 2005 surfaced friday, many republicans have either condemned their nominee, withdrawn their endorsements or called for him to drop out of the race to allow mike pence to take over. trump released a video late friday attempting to apologize for his comments, but it didn't go far enough for many republicans.
am i still a pro-life christian? my faith is as strong as ever, but today i'd say i'm like many americans who see themselves both as pro-choice and pro-life. personally, i don't think i would have ever have had an abortion if i faced an unwanted pregnancy. but i know enough women who swore they were anti-abortion all the way up to the point when they saw the plus sign on that little white stick to know it's pure hubris to say with certainty what decision i would have made.
mike flynn has been allowed some freedom of movement as he awaits his sentencing:
spicer: infrastructure, of course, yes. that's definitely -- and he's continued to bring that up. he talked with the business executives today about how so many of our airports, that are so important to our commerce system, getting planes to land in and out, roads and their ability to truck things across the country, even our freight system. that if our infrastructure is not strong, it inhibits our ability to have free commerce, it inhibits -- it drives up the cost of goods and services, when someone's got to take a different route. or is limited in the opportunities that they have because their runway might be closed or it can't be expanded or a rail line breaks down. or highways just not -- the wear and tear it puts on trucks or shut down. so infrastructure continues to be huge priority for him. yes sir?
and if this proposal's advocates are willing to be relaxed about funding, as they should be, the plan is basically ready to go. if democrats take the senate and the white house next year, they could enact the plan, easing the burdens of millions of americans, almost immediately.

many members of meadows' freedom caucus unit have gone on to much bigger and better things. of course, mulvaney is the outgoing acting white house chief of staff, a position he took after previously serving as director of office of management and budget (omb) under trump. but he was one of meadows's allies and fellow freedom caucus fighters back in the early days for both of them. florida gov. ron desantis, a republican who's currently america's most popular governor, was a freedom caucus member when he served in the house. former rep. cynthia lummis (r-wy), now the frontrunner for u.s. senate in wyoming, was a freedom caucus member too.
activists sat in first street in an act of civil disobedience, reported the washington blade , an lgbtq news outlet that quoted us capitol police saying the demonstrators were charged with crowding, obstructing and incommoding.
the question is whether he can pair such ideas with concessions to the right that would make the broader deal acceptable to enough senators. one possibility conservatives have identified is to use a different index to calculate how medicaid should be funded, which would mean deeper spending cuts to the program.
his claims, some of them specifically geared toward an arizona crowd, generated plenty of enthusiasm — although the build the wall! chant heard at past campaign events was absent.
lindsey graham, your colleague who's there with you in munich, has called for 10,000 u.s. troops on the ground back in iraq to confront isis. is that a good idea?
the thing that this pandemic has really brought home to people is that our health is dependent on our neighbors health more than we like to have thought about in the past, jones says.
biden won 10 of 14 states on march 3, then five of six the next week, including a romp in michigan, a state at the heart of sanders' 2016 success.

a company spokesman declined to comment on lee's criticism, and referred to unitedhealth's previous statements on the exchange business.
we know the workforce is changing and we believe that our associates want to be in the position to come along on the ride with us, she said.
to the memory of pocahontas, i apologize, he said.
the proposal from alexander and collins seeks to mitigate those kinds of increases, primarily through two new spending initiatives. one would allocate $30.5 billion over three years for reinsurance and invisible high-risk pools, each of which would reimburse insurers for the beneficiaries with the biggest medical bills ― thereby allowing insurers to reduce premiums.
yet others, including goolsbee, say the idea assumes that most people will value the health-care benefits they will receive over the tax increases they'll experience. goolsbee, who helped craft obama's affordable care act and wants to see it continued, estimates the sanders plan would raise the government share of the economy by $20 trillion over ten years.
but, to summarize: brian went to college at american university, where he was the head of an undergraduate group that brought speakers to campus, and joe biden was one of them. this was in 1988, and biden had just dropped out of his first presidential run after being caught plagiarizing a speech. and then he had a brain aneurysm that he barely survived.
'those at the top are not doing their part:' wh looks to raise taxes on wealthy
-- trump has not been the great dealmaker as president that he promised he would be as a candidate. yes, he's made millions off writing the art of the deal. but ronald reagan at reykjavik he is not.
that was a mistake. i take responsibility for using a personal email account. obviously if i were to do it over again, i would not, she said. i am very sorry about that.
nations around the world, like canada, australia and many others — have a merit-based immigration system. it is a basic principle that those seeking to enter a country ought to be able to support themselves financially. yet, in america, we do not enforce this rule, straining the very public resources that our poorest citizens rely upon. according to the national academy of sciences, our current immigration system costs america's taxpayers many billions of dollars a year.

i think we need to tee it up and give those senate democrats an opportunity to go on record to demonstrate...
the longer they're there, the less likely you are to listen. for me, i've had to redouble my effort and not say, okay, pay attention to what are the priorities in washington, d.c., but really try to listen to what are the priorities here? there are some of them that have been difficult for me. a prime example is on the syrian invasion, where really they were bantering back and forth on should we invade syria or not? i had my own personal view, the fact i believed that isis was going to continue to grow and that we had to go in and put an end to it right away, really quickly. i was war weary, but i felt like we needed to do that. my district started calling the office and sending in surveys and other things as well—87 percent of the people that contacted us, or it could have been 82 – 82 or 87 percent of the people said, 'we don't want you to do that.' we're tired of wars. it shifted where we were to saying, just listen, the people back home… and it wasn't just republicans. it was democrats, independents, everyone. for us, it's just about trying to have an open ea, then going to washington, d.c., and voting the way the people here want you to vote.
you add all of that together and you've got sort of this toxic mix of political decisions, policy decisions, resource limitations that just create an opportunity for a pandemic to really just rage in the south, laveist says.
here's how those numbers stack up against presidents obama and george w. bush at similar stages of their first terms:
congress acted within weeks to authorize war, pass the patriot act and establish the department of homeland security — a sharp contrast to the administration's failure to move on domestic initiatives such as overhauling social security and reforming immigration. what made the difference, hagin said, was public opinion, and trump's knack for blunt communication could be an effective defense against efforts by congress to rein him in.
the appointment of conservative justices to federal courts. broad tax cuts. building a border wall on the southern border and making mexico pay for it. massive deregulation. replacing obamacare with a health coverage plan that's far less expensive and far better. bringing back manufacturing. reinvigorating fading industries, such as coal and steel. renegotiating trade deals in a way that helps the u.s. moving the israeli embassy to jerusalem. curbing immigration. reducing the national debt. withdrawing from the paris climate accord.
another sign said, this grandmother drove 165 miles to be in your grill, mr. brat and no one paid me to be here! — a nod to a comment brat made to a richmond paper in which he dismissed protesters as paid activists.
it costs more to shut down the government than to keep it running. standard & poor's estimated that the 2013 government shutdown, lasting 16 days, cost the economy $24 billion and shaved 0.6 percent off the economic growth for the fourth quarter that year.
susan collins of maine announces she will seek reelection
phoenix-area rep. kyrsten sinema, the likely democratic nominee, has tried to carve a niche as a more moderate democrat. according to fivethirtyeight, sinema votes in line with president trump's policies around 60 percent of the time. she is also a member of democrats' blue dog coalition, a group of more moderate congressional democrats. however, local democrats see sinema as the party's best chance of taking a still-red state.
that representational bias may partly explain why congress has often been willing to advance pro-business legislation even in the face of strong opposition from the public.
the dinner was first lady melania trump's first time officially hosting a major social event at the white house, which trump noted in his toast.
sen. sheldon whitehouse, d-r.i., scolded republicans for what he called the screaming-tire 180 they'd pulled since 2016, when they declined to hear president obama's nominee for the court that year until after election day.
then ryan applied some public pressure. we as republicans have been waiting seven years to do this. we as republicans, who fought the creation of [obamacare], and accurately predicted it would not work, ran for office in 2010, in 2012, in 2014, in 2016, on a promise that if given the ability we would repeal and replace this law.
most of we public officials, when we're about to speak somewhere, we start off and we say, i'm really happy to be here. well folks, i'm happy to be here. i'm happy to be anywhere in light of [laughs] the last 8 or 10 months. [applause]
nextgen's research into young voter opinions about biden found many knew little about the former vice president, especially those whose political awakening post-dated former president barack obama's successful 2008 campaign. some were unaware of biden's stances on issues such as gun control, immigration and health care, and saw him as little more than another career politician.
reid said he does not think republicans will mind a marketplace collapse because it will pressure democrats into compromising to create a replacement.
blitzer: senator ted cruz just wrapped up a pre-caucus rally at a baptist church in marion, iowa. earlier today he spoke with the town of jefferson, where he explained an accomplishment that he called the full grassley.
the trump administration is not the first to drop the defense of a federal law. but when past administrations have decided against defending a law, they have generally argued that a case raised highly important moral issues ― or was clearly unconstitutional.
the new bill builds upon the previous versions of the vawa by providing grants and support to various groups that work on issues relating to sexual assault, domestic violence and prevention, expanding protections, among other things.
and while fdr's battles with the justices were more intense, verrilli said, we haven't exactly seen eye to eye now on everything.

9. james mattis, secretary of defense, and h.r. mcmaster, assistant to the president for national security affairs. last week's ranking: ―
these steps include dramatic cuts in funding for enrollment outreach and promotion, as well as a change in federal regulations that will allow people to hold on to limited-benefit, short-term plans for nearly three years. that change, along with repeal of the individual mandate's financial penalty for people who don't have comprehensive coverage, makes these short-term plans a more viable alternative for people.
sanders' medicare-for-all plan will require back-breaking tax hikes that will pick the pockets of every american to cover its $46 trillion cost over 10 years. by way of comparison, president trump has proposed a budget of $4.829 trillion for the entire federal government in the 2021 fiscal year.
biden's legislation faces an uphill climb in a narrowly divided congress, where house speaker nancy pelosi has just a small margin and senate democrats do not have the 60 democratic votes needed to pass the measure with just their party's support.
i just spoke to general mattis, who reconfirmed that, and i quote, ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies. ryan's legacy is etched into eternity. for as the bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one's life for one's friends. ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country, and for our freedom –- we will never forget him.
the gradual shift to a government-run program is very similar to a proposal from the center for american progress, a moderate left-leaning think tank. it provides the most politically viable path to universal coverage, while respecting those who like their employer coverage, said topher spiro, the center's vice president for health policy.

cornish: julie, thanks so much for walking us through it.
democrats have been pointing to a case related to the aca that is set to go before the supreme court on nov. 10, which a newly appointed justice could weigh in on. in a 2017 article in the notre dame law journal, barrett pushed back against the court's ruling on obamacare.
kumar said kaiser encourages both doctors and patients to think of end-of-life planning as a routine part of care, just like you'd get a mammogram or colon cancer screening.
pelosi says she's opposed to impeaching trump: 'he's just not worth it'
hospital and emergency care are considered essential benefits and must be covered, but patients may still have to meet the annual deductible of their policy and pay things like copays and coinsurance on top of that. some large commercial insurers have pledged to waive these patient costs for covid-19 treatment, and several nonprofit community health plans have as well. the limited availability of diagnostic testing may make it tricky to prove you qualify for these benefits, levitt points out.
schilling: you have to play ten years in --
such headaches are helping to drive the early stages of the presidential race and help suggest why trump, while currently vulnerable on the issue, could reap some political advantage with a serious effort to address the crisis.
democrats who lost the battle are still convinced they may win the political war. as the republicans reached a majority for the bill, democrats on the house floor began chanting, na, na, na, na ... hey, hey, hey ... goodbye. they say republicans could lose their seats for supporting a bill that could cause so much disruption in voters' health care.
on health care, schmid said existing practices should be defined and clearly prohibited, but he said the groups are pleased hhs said it will review discriminatory practices on a case by case basis.
but the gambit failed, and it failed spectacularly.
the house voted primarily along party lines this month to block the administration from letting states offer looser plans. and the package of bills being considered thursday would roll back the expansion of short-term plans, as well as provide new funding to help people enroll in obamacare plans.
across the table, diane nickel fears social unrest.
the host of morning joe, a former republican congressman, reflected on the future of the gop:
american footprints on distant worlds are not too big a dream.
so brian, like a lot of people in arlington, used to work on capitol hill. his wife is a partner at a law firm that represents, among many clients, the democratic national committee. he now runs a nonprofit organization and a software company, both of them focused on renewable energy.
what they want is a hearing that's not about medicare for all, one source involved in planning the hearing told huffpost. they want someone to say, 'hey, there's all these different ways of doing things, none of them are bad, they're all equally good.'
question: so i have a follow-up on the housekeeping question about nafta. are we not to expect, then, an executive order today to renegotiate nafta or will he wait until he meets with president pena nieto next week? and on the other -- the other question i had is, he didn't mention latin america at all in his -- you know, in his inauguration speech. does he plan to visit latin america this year?
obama also said future democrats need to make different policy design decisions. specifically, he said, they should expect no more cooperation for implementing their reforms than he got for the affordable care act ― although, he warned, without such cooperation, making government programs work is bound to be a lot more difficult:
ip writes, so how can the aca be fixed? democrats' solution is, essentially, more subsidies. mr. obama has called for a public option, a federal health plan to supplement private insurers. hillary clinton, the democratic nominee for president, goes even further: she wants anyone over 55 to be able to opt into medicare. both would nudge the u.s. closer to a 'single payer' model like canada's that liberal activists have long sought. yet this would require a lot more money and further erode market forces in health care. (fyi, just as family values is republican code for anti-abortion and anti-same-sex marriage, canada is republican code for socialism.)
worked on the starr report: he was part of independent counsel kenneth starr's team during the investigation of then-president bill clinton, specifically assigned to investigate deputy white house counsel vince foster's suicide. the baltimore sun notes that he argued unsuccessfully before the supreme court that attorney-client privilege did not apply to foster after his death by suicide.

you may not have thought america's health care system could get any more dysfunctional. if obamacare goes away, prepare to be unpleasantly surprised.
bernie sanders seemed to escape the debate without a significant blow to his now front-running campaign -- and had the advantage at least four other centrist rivals arguing he's too radical to beat trump but who have failed to slow him down.
the dueling forces came into sharper focus tuesday afternoon, when cruz and other gop senators participated in a health-care meeting with president trump at the white house. at the capitol, mcconnell was expected to deliver more clarity and options to republican senators on the bill that is taking shape. leaders are racing to try to hold a vote as soon as this month, with some eying next month as a more realistic goal. meanwhile, the contours of the senate bill slowly are emerging. last week, mcconnell proposed a more gradual rollback of the expansion of medicaid than a bill that passed the house, as many gop senators have advocated. he also proposed maintaining some protections under obamacare for people with preexisting conditions, another departure from the house bill. that last possibility, however, worried some conservative groups.
true love for our people requires us to find common ground, to advance the common good, and to cooperate on behalf of every american child who deserves a brighter future.
but the effects of invalidation of the aca would be devastating to our entire health care system, said timothy jost, a law professor emeritus at washington and lee.
trump repeatedly claimed that electing rosen to the senate amounts to backing house minority leader nancy pelosi and senate minority leader chuck schumer.
oh, and that new big-screen hdtv? prices of televisions tumbled 15%.
in truth, biden and sanders are both calling for the same thing – a government takeover of health insurance. they just differ on how to deliver that outcome.
second, it means furloughing at least 30,000 of our department and cutting back very significantly on our operations, our operations to pursue homeland security. so, this is not a situation to make light of. in these challenging times, we need a fully funded department of homeland security right now.
when we are talking about healthcare, the details really matter and therefore we have been raising questions about the nine bills he introduced over 20 years, as to how they would work, clinton said. he didn't like that, his campaign didn't like it either and tonight he's come out with a new plan and again we need to get into the details.
rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y., has embraced 'medicare-for-all' and pitched a 70 percent tax on top earners to fund an expansive green new deal -- which aims to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture and dramatically expand energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable resources.
when asked in an april interview with huffpost whether he had grown more sensitive to the need to speak to the particular challenges facing black americans ― who comprise just a sliver of vermont's population ― sanders admitted that he had.

it's in fact that decisions were made long before many black people and white people were born, and when we ended the era of explicit racial wealth stripping policies — i'm going to put a caveat in that around the subprime mortgage crisis, which we may come back to — we didn't take that into account. and that's why there's such a vocal call now for reparations, because no amount of education or income that black families do is going to make up for generations of racism in our wealth building markets.

levin: i want to circle back to where we began the program -- the hall of fame. for people who don't know, who decides who gets into the hall of fame?
— democrats are pushing for bigger government, feeling liberated from years of countering attacks on big spending ideas after republicans made some high-cost moves themselves. in recent months, democratic lawmakers and candidates have endorsed plans allowing anyone to buy in to medicare, to make college effectively debt-free, to replace the payday loan industry with small government banks and to provide a 'job guarantee' that would spend to put people to work, our colleagues dave weigel and jeff stein report.
and what these tables show is that elections really do have consequences.
two years later and still bashing the agreement, trump is now on track to effectively end it next month ― with an unintended possible consequence of triggering a resumption of the iranian nuclear program.
and the move would particularly help those likely to have lost income during the pandemic who are buying marketplace coverage because they don't have it through their workplaces.
democrats flipped 15 seats in the virginia house of delegates. eleven of those races were won by women, including the first openly transgender state legislator, the first vietnamese-american legislator, and the first two latinas to serve in the house of delegates.

biden hailed a commitment from pharmaceutical giant merck to help make johnson & johnson's single-shot coronavirus vaccine, comparing it to world war ii efforts. the administration also said johnson & johnson and its contract manufacturers would move to a round-the-clock production schedule.
mr. bloomberg, like anybody else, has a right to run for president, sanders said. but, the populist senator who's making his second straight white house run emphasized, he does not have a right to buy the presidency, especially after being mayor of new york and having a racist stop-and-frisk policy.
fellow palm beach county democrat u.s. rep. lois frankel said the measure, after a year of stress and hardship on millions of people, ranked as the most important, impactful piece of legislation she has ever voted on.
six months after our tax cuts, more than six million workers have received bonuses, pay raises, and retirement, said trump.
there are a lot of factors that have put the senate into play, but the pandemic and how it has affected health care and the economy is a major one that have made these races competitive, ms. taylor said.
the media and the left-wing political establishment want us to see the homeless as victims of a cruel american capitalism that allows good people to fall through society's cracks. naturally, the only solution to this problem is big government socialism.
vote as if your life, your choice depends on it – because it does, harris said. he knows he can't win if the people vote. donald trump is weak so he is throwing up every roadblock he can to try to suppress the vote. we the people cannot let him get away with it.
for many, fewer obamacare choices doesn't mean higher prices
this new era of cooperation can start with finally confirming the more than 300 highly qualified nominees who are still stuck in the senate – some after years of waiting. the senate has failed to act on these nominations, which is unfair to the nominees and to our country.
spicer: again, i think part of is it that he's already spoken to both the president of mexico and prime minister of canada about his desire to -- to renegotiate. and i think as he meets with both of these individuals over the next 30 days or so, that's gonna be a topic.
-- the white house has beefed up its legal team and plans to aggressively invoke executive privilege in a bid to contain the potential fallout of the mueller report and curtail oversight by house democrats. carol d. leonnig reports: the strategy to strongly assert the president's executive privilege on both fronts is being developed under newly arrived white house counsel pat cipollone, who has hired 17 lawyers in recent weeks to help in the effort. he is coordinating with white house lawyer emmet flood, who is leading the response to [mueller's] report. … of particular concern to democrats: whether the white house will seek to use executive privilege to keep private any portions of mueller's report that addresses alleged obstruction of justice by the president.
trump's insistence that climate change is a hoax has put the world economy and the viability of the planet in further danger. he says that the wildfires ravaging the american west are the result of poor forest management. he has depreciated american soldiers' heroism and sacrifice, and has no appreciation or understanding that the economy needs people's heroism to dream up new ideas and risk investing in their development and market entry.
this message draws a clear line in the sand: republicans want to strip you of your health insurance, while democrats want to offer low-cost, universal coverage. it's an endorsement of universal health care that doesn't waffle, and isn't complicated.
the latest uproar came after alabama passed the strictest anti-abortion law in the country last week, banning the procedure with no exceptions for victims of rape and incest. seven other states have also passed new anti-abortion laws, with additional measures pending in state legislatures.

colorado sen. michael bennet is the latest democratic contender to enter the packed field of 2020 hopefuls, announcing on cbs this morning on thursday that he's running for president.
trump has misled the public about his approach to patients with preexisting conditions a total of 73 times, our fact checker says. he frequently alleges that republicans — not democrats — are the longtime champions of such protections.
tax and legal advice: if you're intimidated by all this or just worried you're leaving something out, don't panic. the irs allows a deduction for tax-preparation expenses, as well as other professional legal and accounting services necessary for the efficient operation of your business, said greene-lewis. in fact, turbotax just launched a software service specifically for the self-employed that can find deductions you may not know about simply by browsing through transactions in your bank account. it helps discover deductions that they didn't even know were possible, said greene-lewis of turbotax, which means you not only get a tax break for buying the software but plenty of other deductions thanks to the added advice. don't overlook the benefit of accounting software or a hiring a tax professional like a cpa, particularly since these expenses are tax deductible themselves.
that means the mandate is an unconstitutional command, according to the lawsuit. and because the law's component parts are so interconnected, the lawsuit says, the whole thing has to come off the books.
and in a statement through the job creators network, a pro-business group where he is a health care fellow, price said repealing the individual mandate was exactly the right thing to do. forcing americans to buy something they don't want undermines individual liberty as well as free markets, according to politico.
the public option plan is described as available to all americans, whether you're covered through your employer, buying your insurance on your own, or going without coverage altogether, adding that the option is like medicare — but is not medicare.
borger: here is the fascinating thing about ted cruz. here is a man who was against nsa surveillance. and he is the most data-driven candidate, bar none, even including barack obama. this is somebody who knows everything about every voter in all of the 99 counties of iowa.
republicans in congress had been fighting the law dubbed obamacare at every turn for two years, and all the gop presidential candidates in 2012 had vowed to repeal it. and now roberts, a nominee of president george w. bush, had saved it.
question: thanks for being here at (inaudible), it's great to see you.
cruz: you know, unfortunately right now, dana, the democrats are working as a unit to filibuster funding for the department of homeland security. and it's one of the patterns we've seen the last six years that's really unusual, is that senate democrats have consistently been unwilling to take on the president. it's part of why harry reid and the democrats shut down the senate. and i got to say it's unprecedented.
the candidates will likely have to answer whether the party is in a place to win over the roughly eight million voters who went for mr. obama in 2012 and mr. trump in 2016 as well as motivate turnout among african americans and latinos, a major problem for hillary clinton in 2016. democrats scored big wins in louisiana and kentucky's gubernatorial races this month. but in both cases, the democratic candidates did not focus on the ambitious policies frequently discussed in the primary field, such as medicare for all.

we have to acknowledge what happens to women in leadership positions across fields, mcgann said. they face bias that holds them back. and it's holding the country back too.
trump pointed to several guests gathered on stage and allowed two to give accounts of how the tax cut law has benefitted them personally and professionally.

companies are forming to help facilitate partnerships between businesses and colleges. one is denver-based guild education, which was founded in 2015 and works with companies like walmart to streamline the system students use to access the programs, offer support services and the process by which companies pay the tuition.
people who have health emergencies can't wait for us to have a theoretical debate about some better idea that will never, ever come to pass, she said a few days before the 2016 iowa caucuses.
the obama administration, he said, citing the health care law, fundamentally doesn't believe in that american experiment. the administration distrusts the idea that states are where the power of government resides, he added.
health care is complicated; it's boring; i don't want to talk about it, kimmel said. the details are confusing, and that's what these guys are relying on. they're counting on you to be so overwhelmed with all the information, you just trust them to take care of you. but they're not taking care of you. they're taking care of the people who give them money like insurance companies, and we're all just looking at our instagram accounts liking things, while they're voting on whether people can afford to keep their children alive or not. most of the congresspeople who vote on this bill probably won't even read it. and they want us to do the same thing. they want us to treat it like an itunes service agreement. and this guy, bill cassidy, just lied right to my face.
more recently, some covid-19 relief measures have extended or built upon part of the affordable care act ― which is yet more proof, as university of connecticut professor john cogan has argued, that congress understood the law would stay in place and supports that.
coronavirus is a key campaign issue: what's joe biden's plan?
democrats say it is one of several provisions in the house bill that might not pass parliamentary muster in the senate.
beginning later this week, i'm excited to announce that we're going to have four -- what we call skype seats, live here in the briefing room. this will open up the briefing to journalist's who live beyond 50 miles of the washington d.c. area and to organizations that don't currently have a hard pass. as always any organization is welcome to apply for a day pass. but we're excited to open up into the field and fold here, a diverse group of journalists from around the country, who may not have the convenience or funding to travel to washington. i think this can benefit us all by giving a platform to voices that are not necessarily based here in the belt way.
the individual mandate, which required americans to obtain health insurance, was indeed a key part of obamacare -- but trump hasn't killed obamacare, essentially or otherwise. he has not eliminated obamacare's expansion of the medicaid insurance program for low-income people, the federal and state marketplaces that allow people to shop for coverage, or the consumer subsidies that help many of them make the purchases.
bash: senator, let's just quickly drill down on the content of this resolution. there are differences over how specific congress should be about the question ever boots on the ground because...
working longer: the platform is sketchy but says that democrats will invest in career and technical education and high-quality job training programs.
spicer: i don't think that's accurate at all. in fact i think if you list to the audio of it, you can hear the excitement that exists there. there were some people that had to be off camera for obvious reasons, but i think when you look at the number of people that were there, the audio alone tells -- tell -- you know, speaks volumes to what had happened.
as south carolina's feb. 29 democratic primary approaches ― the nomination race's fourth contest in a state where black voters make up the majority of the party's base ― biden's lead in polls has not wavered. it's the state that was hailed as having solidified obama's path to the nomination in 2008, and this year's primary comes just days before super tuesday, when voters in many of the big states — including texas and california — go to the ballot box.
trump this morning denied that he slammed the table when he left his meeting with democrats:
the study provided further evidence that the democratic party is swinging to the left, adopting positions in its mainstream that were once on the fringes of party debate—particularly on health care, economics, and immigration.
trump, may 29: it was done, and then, early in the morning, somebody turned the hand in the wrong direction. that cost our country a lot. that was a very, very terrible thing that happened that night. that was a very terrible thing. that cost our country $1 trillion in entitlement saving that nobody would have known.
in the senate, republican leaders are expected to make the case that the process of writing the bill has been flawed. while the bill went through house committees, it's expected to go straight to the floor in the senate.
trump wasn't my first choice. however he is doing a hell of a good job. … the things that he's done – there's a lot of confidence in the economy. i.e. the jobs coming back. wages have gone up. stock market is going up. the whole attitude has changed. there's a can-do attitude that's building up here.
pollitz: that would either force them to jack up premiums or to just face tremendous losses.
courrielche contextualized his profile of marlow against the backdrop of breitbart news's ascendance within the news media landscape.
the team said it would take more investor optimism around growth for stocks and other risky assets to breakout in a more sustained way. that would likely require falling uncertainty around the u.s. election and positive vaccine developments, said the strategists, led by christian mueller-glissmann.

no one will be safe in biden's america, trump said in the closest thing the 70-minute speech had to a summary.
his answers seemed to antagonize most in the crowd of 150, who yelled back at him, at points drowning him out and prompting a few of his supporters to leave early in disgust.
a new television ad that hagerty's team launched this week claims conservatives cannot trust sethi, citing his history of serving on the board of a massachusetts medical group that supported obamacare and that shows unearthed video of sethi defending obamacare. some people call that obamacare, sethi says in the video footage. don't say that in public circles because that's a very political statement. it's the patient protection and affordable care act.
the group specifically cited her failure to take action on senate bill 1415, a bill that would have raised the minimum corporate tax from $50 to $500.
i think we all can agree that something has to be done (about daca and the dreamers). and that's what he's trying to do and what he's trying to do is to do it the right way. he's not trying to just strong-arm it and make it happen without involvement of the senate and congress. but he's trying to make this thing happen sort of just right for the children that are here in this country.
in one of the most contentious moments of the debate, harris confronted biden on two race-related issues: biden's past opposition to school busing and his recent comments about working with some civility in the 1970s with two segregationist southern democrats, sens. james eastland of mississippi and herman talmadge of georgia.
bryan mcmullin, a 47-year-old who works in connellsville's river-rafting business, got coverage last year but said good health care remains hard to come by. in this area, nothing's changed in 40 years, no matter who is president, he explained from a barstool at a pub near the now-vacant glass factory.
between january and april 2017, 9,442 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. elizabeth loranzo, 25, a mother and beautician from middletown, pa., was one of them.
asian markets finished the trading session mixed.
but what republicans don't acknowledge in this defense is that much of trump's drama they themselves privately opposed.
davis: right. and, you know, obamacare has embedded itself deeper in the nation since that vote in 2015. i talked to one of those senators who's now ready to vote no, lisa murkowski of alaska. and she is one of these senators who's saying, look, now is the time to find the bipartisan consensus on health care. this is what she said.
372 keystone pipeline protesters, march 2, 2014
— during the state of the union address, trump is planning to pledge to end the hiv epidemic in the country within the next decade or so, politico's dan diamond reports.
here are the principles that should guide the congress as we move to create a better health-care system for all americans:
the president has repeatedly said that congress must do something to avoid a health care meltdown.
asked what he might be looking for in a running mate, trump said it was too early to be making those decisions. but he added, there are some great people out there.
the two other ways to make the stage – reaching 12 percent or higher in two nevada caucus or south carolina primary-approved polls, or winning a delegate to the national convention in the feb. 3 iowa caucuses or last week's new hampshire primary – have been out of picture for bloomberg, since he's not on the ballot in any of the early-voting states.
president trump's nomination of judge amy coney barrett to fill the supreme court seat made vacant by the death of justice ruth bader ginsburg is seen as a home run for conservatives. it is a chance to move the high court in a far more aggressively conservative direction for generations.
trump then brought up president bill clinton's past infidelities.
the arguments the court postponed were scheduled for april 20-22 and april 27-29. the most high profile argument that was postponed was the hearing of the consolidated cases of trump v. pennsylvania and little sisters of the poor v. pennsylvania. those cases have to do with the mandate in the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, forcing all employers to provide contraception in the health insurance policies that they reimburse.
two bipartisan bills lawmakers passed in 2016 — one aimed at speeding the discovery of medical cures and another aimed at addiction — tossed a little more than $1 billion toward the problem. congress didn't provide any additional funding last fall after president trump declared opioid abuse a public health emergency, much to the chagrin of health advocates who have been highlighting major shortcomings in the health-care system's ability to help addicted americans.
president donald trump announced on wednesday that he picked former ronald reagan economist and longtime cnbc commentator larry kudlow as his chief economic adviser and director of the national economic council.
below are strategies for talking to young people about the dangers of communism, socialism and other progressive ideas.
we must map out a longer term energy framework, so the cost of climate change doesn't fall on those least able to afford it, newsom said.
how trump could weaken the mandate
kodjak: all of which make health insurance more expensive. pollitz says this combination would lead healthy people who think insurance is too expensive to drop their policies and sick people to buy. insurance companies will then raise prices to account for their sicker customer base, leaving more people to drop insurance.
* bring back the public option! paul krugman points out that if trump really wanted to fix obamacare, he could do so, by spending more money and taking other steps to remedy the fact that insurers have pulled out of the market in certain geographic areas:
these workers would initially help with contact tracing around the country, and would also shore up local health departments to address other pandemic needs, murthy says. we know that people are struggling, he says, and the idea is to empower local communities and local health departments to assist people with challenges such as food insecurity and affordable housing.
question: so, sean, a couple -- a couple of questions here, if you don't mind.
she raised her hand when asked whether she would abolish private insurance during the first democratic presidential debate in miami in late june, but subsequently disavowed the remark, claiming she had misheard the question.
finney: ...and what i think they were trying to get to and i hope we get to at some point in one of these debates is most people that i talk to in different focus groups, they want to understand, ok, what does that mean for me? what's - so tomorrow morning, i get up in this new system. what happens? do i get to see my same doctor? is it a different doctor? does it cost me more? does it cost me less? where do i go? and so i do worry that as we're talking so much about the system, i think there is still a portion - there's a lot of people in the electorate who are not quite sure, what does that mean for me? and that's the part that scares people, which is part of why i think kamala actually changed her plan to try to respond to what she was hearing from people, which is, what's that transition going to look like?
i had a later abortion because i couldn't give my baby girl both life and peace
romney said that more specifics about the plan would be forthcoming. but he argued that overall it lowered costs and meant less government spending than the obama plan, which he cast as a tax-raising, costly bureaucratic nightmare that forces an un-american federal mandate on the american people.
cruz: listen, i like rick perry. he was a good governor in the state of texas. he's a friend of mine. people occasionally throw rocks in politics. that's his choice. i'm going say i think he did a good and effective job as governor of our state.
meanwhile, working class americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration — reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net.
garcia-navarro: well, kevin, do you think that the gop health care bill, as passed, really does the best for the majority of americans?
the platform also would prioritize support for black entrepreneurs and other entrepreneurs of color, as well as women entrepreneurs. and it talks about exploring innovative approaches to closing racial wealth gaps, including policies that provide seed capital in order to access the economic security of asset ownership.
his $400 million push has already lifted him to second place in national polls. and bloomberg has far more cash than his rivals to play across the entire national battlefield on super tuesday.
scott, along with every congressional republican, voted against the covid-19 relief package, which democrats say was designed to combat the virus from public health and economic standpoints.
it's valuable context, for sure, and raises important discussions about police and race, but a longer view shows the blm protests were but one example where police in the nation's capital seemed ready to respond with the full force of the law.
a report that another provision of obamacare -- one that would cap out-of-pocket health care costs -- was being delayed brought a defiant challenge tuesday from a top senate republican, accusing the president of illegal and unconstitutional acts in changing laws without congressional approval.
— former vice president joe biden addressed the nation about the spreading pandemic in a new makeshift television studio in his wilmington, del., home.
people as they decide who is going to follow barack obama. i think they're going to make a rather radical shift away from a young, untested united states senator whose policies have really failed.

spicer: we did, and at the time that was provided by the inaugural committee came from an outside agency that we reported on. and i think knowing what we know now, we can tell that wmata [washington metropolitan area transit authority] numbers are different, but we were trying to provide numbers that we had been provided. that wasn't like we made them up out of thin air.
but many job guarantee programs are about more than just assuring a certain quantity of jobs; they also focus on quality.
first, the house and senate have to agree to a budget resolution, something that happened regularly until the late 1990s but now only happens when both chambers are held by the same party. in that resolution, lawmakers lay out tax, spending and deficit targets for the years ahead and give instructions to specific committees to write legislation to hit those targets.
rep. john yarmuth, chairman of the house budget committee, said tuesday that democrats will use every option available to them to pass the upcoming infrastructure bill, but the hope is they will be able to build a bipartisan package that can be passed without using reconciliation. that would mean the legislation would need to garner at least 10 republican votes in the senate.
becerra is expected to win approval in the committee, which will clear the way for his consideration by the full senate, reuters reports. the committee will also vote on biden's nomination of katherine tai as trade czar and wally adeyemo as deputy treasury secretary.
the plaintiffs insist the entire statute has to go because that is what congress intended. but it was congress, in 2017, that decided to zero out the mandate while fully aware that the rest of the affordable care act would stay in place.

trump also asked azar for an update on hhs's work on lowering drug pricing, and the two discussed the fact that drug importation was popular with the public, josh and yasmeen write. they also shared frustration about the number of health-care regulations that had been stopped by the courts — including a rule that would require drugmakers to post the list prices of their medications in television ads and state requirements that medicaid recipients work to maintain their coverage — and by the lack of media coverage of the administration's health-care and drug pricing policies.
in an attempt to address perhaps his greatest political vulnerability, likely 2012 republican presidential candidate mitt romney on thursday said there are clear differences between the health care law he signed into law as massachusetts governor and the obamacare federal health care law disdained by republicans.
washington — it's that time of the week — food pantry day — and before the doors even open at the spanish catholic center, the patrons begin queueing up, lugging roller carts and empty grocery bags, the line stretching out onto the hot sidewalk. immigrants all, they hail from the congo and costa rica, from nicaragua and el salvador, from togo and vietnam. most are seniors.
levin: so you think the country is moving in the wrong direction because of this socialist pressure that's in place in our schools, in our society, in the media even though there's a push back. the president the united states and other conservatives and so forth?
the federal government's efforts to rein in pharmaceutical prices have included bills that aim to deter pharma companies from blocking or delaying generic competition, as well as a trump administration plan to curb rebates that have gone to pharmacy benefit managers. in addition, another bill would require drug makers to justify large price hikes and high launch prices.
democrats' promise of medicare for all is remarkably misguided and unrealistic
the objections about the affordable care act have nothing to do with barrett or the supreme court, republicans argue — and it's impossible to accept the premise that a judge must be impartial but also ask her to agree to take a certain position before she is confirmed, they said.
i have further ordered the departments of homeland security and justice, along with the department of state and the director of national intelligence, to coordinate an aggressive strategy to dismantle the criminal cartels that have spread across our nation.
conan o'brien made fun of trump's header image on twitter:
and, of course, advocates feel that $6 billion isn't nearly enough to address the crisis fully – although convincing a gop-led congress to provide the hundreds of billions of dollars some have suggested would be a tall order.
approving state waivers to change medicaid funding to block grants would be among the administration's most controversial moves to reshape medicaid, a federal-state program that provides health coverage to one in five low-income americans. medicaid is the main source of long-term care coverage for americans and is a guaranteed benefit, or entitlement, for eligible individuals, she writes.
to me, the only way you're going to lift people out of poverty is with employment, and i think that's what really made me want to run for the seat, because i could see the need for career opportunities, not just jobs but actual careers, klacik said in a recent interview.
schilling: no, not now. after i watched -- you know, when you look at what the left has done to people that they don't like especially politicians, when i watch the kavanagh hearing and realized that conservative wives, spouses and children are now in play for the media, my family doesn't deserve that. and they're not -- they spent 20 years following me around baseball. i'm not going to subject them to that.

the purpose of having a limited open enrollment period in the affordable care act is to ensure that people don't only buy health insurance when they get sick, and then drop it when they're healthy. that would make insurance even more expensive.
both parties are using barrett's nomination to rally support. the republican-controlled senate is expected to be able to confirm barrett. harris, a member of the judiciary committee, didn't talk about ways to prevent barrett's confirmation during the 19-minute speech at shaw university, a historically black college in raleigh, n.c.
not all hospitals are on hold. some healthcare groups in areas with growing populations, such as atlanta and houston, are pushing ahead with capital expansion projects. others, such as maryland's prince george's county, are still planning to move forward with construction plans, thanks in part to a partnership with the university of maryland medical system.
but marino's nomination quickly fell apart. a joint investigation by the post and 60 minutes disclosed that marino had close ties to the opioid industry. the investigation found that the congressman had sponsored legislation that made it harder for the dea to penalize drug distributors and manufacturers when they failed to report suspicious orders and shipments of narcotics.
so that was a pleasant surprise, you know, he said on monday.
cruz: dana, i'm looking at it very, very seriously. i think we're facing enormous challenges in this country.
acp senior vice president robert doherty said acp released its policy framework intentionally for discussion in political debates in the 2020 election cycle, rachel writes. the medical specialty society still envisions a limited potential role for private supplemental insurance in its preferred single-payer model, and supports a public insurance option available to all, including individuals with employer-sponsored insurance.
the regulation about short-term plans isn't in place yet, but a prior regulation opened the door to more association health plans that allow businesses to band together to offer health coverage to workers but that don't have to follow all of the affordable care act's rules, including those guaranteeing a basic set of covered benefits.
in 2017, congress reduced the penalty to zero, as part of the republican tax cut bill that trump signed. twenty republican state officials then filed a new lawsuit, arguing that if the penalty was zero, the mandate ― whose language remains part of the statute ― can no longer be a tax.

adryana cortez, patrick's wife and co-host of red pilled america, recalled the acorn scandal broken by james o'keefe with help from andrew breitbart. acorn was a community-organizing group founded in 1970 purported to advocate for low-income families. at its peak, it had roughly 500,000 members in 1,200 neighborhood chapters all across the country, she explained. the group worked with the federal government for the census, and it also had ties to a [barack obama's 2008] political campaign. … perhaps the biggest under-reported scandal tied to [acorn] was its work in the banking sector. acorn played a key role in helping cause the financial crisis by pressuring local banks to lend to poor and financially unstable people.

but the shift in the expectation of free college for a majority white college-going population to a debt for diploma system for a predominantly students of color population is one of the most dramatic examples of racism draining the pool. and if i can just add, it's so frustrating, because it's seen as a colorblind issue. student debt — the rules that we changed in order to make student debt the new normal were not explicitly racist like redlining or all of that. but when you say suddenly to a generation, not only do you have to go to college to get a middle class job because of changes we've made in the labor market, but you will now have to fund that college out of your own family's wealth, knowing full well that family wealth is where history shows up in your wallet, where the amount of money you have in savings or cds or home equity absolutely tracks to what side of the color line you were on when the government was handing out free wealth building opportunities, you get what you have now, which is a widening of the racial wealth gap, which is the fact that a black family with a college degree has less wealth than a white family headed by a high school dropout. it's colorblind, but it's systemically racist, and it impacts not just the targeted community, but also the majority of white students who have to borrow now too.

frietchen, who is single and 46, says she'd likely be paying far more for private health insurance coverage, or i would not have been able to take a job with a startup that i really love, but that's too small to offer a health care benefit.

biden said he would push for a version of the affordable care act that includes a public option, deeming it bidencare. biden said his health care proposal would also allow medicare to negotiate drug prices with insurance companies and reduce premiums.

next year, navigators from across the country will have to apply and compete for a total of $10 million in funds. that's down from $37 million for the 2018 plan year and from $63 million for 2017. the trump administration has made similarly sharp reductions in funds earmarked for advertising and promoting health insurance enrollment.
democratic campaign officials say the dual threats to public health and the economy have upended an election they worried — and republicans hoped — would focus on trump's impeachment, politico's sarah ferris and ally mutnick report. campaigning has all but ceased in the traditional sense: fundraising is down, and campaign officials on both sides say they're being more careful about when and how to attack their opponents.
some of the fiercest counterattacks on barrett's behalf came from sens. josh hawley of missouri and ben sasse of nebraska, who each, in their turn, faulted what they called the attempt by critics to impose a religious test for the supreme court.
schumer argued on the senate floor on monday:
ahh: rates of opioid abuse declined in younger generations between 2002 and 2014, but they've doubled among americans over 50, our colleague joe davidson writes. unwittingly, medicare compounds the epidemic by funding needed opioids that can be abused, but, generally, not funding the care and medicines needed to fight opioid addiction, joe writes. many elderly get hooked on opiates through prescriptions, rather than street drugs like heroin.

under the judgment, between 70,500 and 126,400 women could lose access to no-cost birth control, according to government estimates.
you might think that this is obvious. but on the left, in particular, there are some people who, disappointed by the limits of what president obama has accomplished, minimize the differences between the parties. whoever the next president is, they assert — or at least, whoever it is if it's not bernie sanders — things will remain pretty much the same, with the wealthy continuing to dominate the scene. and it's true that if you were expecting mr. obama to preside over a complete transformation of america's political and economic scene, what he's actually achieved can seem like a big letdown.

la decisión de clinton de unirse tan estrechamente a obama podría ser arriesgada si clinton gana la nominación y llega a enfrentarse a los republicanos. mientras que los índices de aprobación del presidente son muy altos entre los demócratas, la mayoría de los estadounidenses todavía desaprueba el trabajo que está haciendo, por lo que los acontecimientos en la economía y en todo el mundo podrían dejar a clinton vulnerable por la asociación con su legado.
if trump wanted to seriously damage the aca, he could simply order the appeal dropped, letting the lower court ruling stand, and stop reimbursing insurers who are giving deep discounts to half their customers. that move would wreak havoc, said michael cannon of the libertarian cato institute, a longtime opponent of the health law. the insurers would still have to provide the discounts, as required by law, he said, but they're no longer getting subsidies from the federal government to cover the cost. so they are going to be selling insurance to these people way below the cost of that coverage.
i think he has a healthy respect for the first amendment and he - you know, this is what makes our country so beautiful, is that on one day you can inaugurate a president, on the next day, people can occupy the same space to protest something. but he's also cognizant to the fact that a lot of these people were there to protest an issue of concern to them and not against anything. i remember this morning, debbie dingell was on television and she's talking about - let me just, i don't want to inaccurately quote her.

the vast majority of it would replenish the so-called coronavirus relief fund, created by the cares act and distributed through state, local and tribal governments, according to the national low income housing coalition. that's on top of the $25 billion in assistance provided by the relief package passed in december. to receive financial assistance — which could be used for rent, utilities and other housing expenses — households would have to meet several conditions. household income could not exceed 80 percent of the area median income, at least one household member must be at risk of homelessness or housing instability, and individuals would have to qualify for unemployment benefits or have experienced financial hardship (directly or indirectly) because of the pandemic. assistance could be provided for up to 18 months, according to the national low income housing coalition. lower-income families that have been unemployed for three months or more would be given priority for assistance. read more.
what trump said: trump said he is working with u.s. sen. martha mcsally, r-arizona, to lower prescription drug prices and that they are making a lot of progress. he also said his administration had approved a record number of generic drugs, which are much cheaper than non-generics.
republicans argue consumers need more options because the obamacare plans are too expensive. democrats say the alternative plans mislead people into thinking they will get the care they need if they get sick – while also driving up the premiums of more comprehensive obamacare plans by siphoning away healthier customers.

the outlays to influence the federal government hit $3.47 billion in 2019, the biggest total since 2010's spending of $3.51 billion. the annual figures, shown in the chart below, come from a center for responsive politics analysis of lobbying disclosures filed through last week.
everybody is talking about how democrats need to avoid the traps that ensnared them during former president barack obama's first term, when they repeatedly got bogged down in bipartisan negotiations, made all sorts of substantive concessions on policy, and still got virtually no gop support for their initiatives.
he appreciates the ideas and opinions that come -- that come through the oval office or small groups, where he gets to share their prospective and their ideas and their opinions. i think that's what he's gonna continue to do later this afternoon.

the idea is that the job guarantee program could be what economists call an automatic stabilizer — a program that grows when the economy is in a downturn and shrinks when things are going well.
the former new york mayor knew he'd face fierce heat wednesday night from rivals who resent his stunning spending spree and his failure to take part in the first four nominating contests. bloomberg tried to keep his focus on his central argument of the night: that the presidency is a management job, and he is a proven manager, unlike trump.
2. french election finale: far-right candidate marine le pen and independent centrist emmanuel macron went head-to-head in a televised debate on wednesday.
-- robert barnes reports on the short list: sources involved in the process say a handful of federal appeals court judges have emerged as top contenders, including william pryor of the u.s. court of appeals for the 11th circuit in atlanta, neil gorsuch of the 10th circuit in denver, thomas hardiman of the 3rd circuit in philadelphia and raymond kethledge of the 6th circuit in cincinnati. here's the scoop on some of his top picks:
so senator cory booker and congresswoman ayanna pressley have this idea for baby bonds, which is a wealth generating proposal. and they calculate that it would close about a half to two-thirds of the racial wealth gap, at least if you're measuring that from the median, not the mean. and for a long time in the democratic party, there was this idea that because the politics of race are so difficult, because framing things for race creates these drain the pool mentalities. so what you want to do is you want to have racially progressive policies that you sell in a colorblind way. and in recent years, there's been an almost reversal, i think, having to do with the dynamics inside the democratic party, where policies that are literally colorblind, like this baby bonds policy, are being sold in a very race-conscious way, as a way of, say, closing the racial wealth gap. given the research you've done here, and so the grappling you've done with the politics that happen when you frame things around race, where do you come down on that?
the idea of defunding planned parenthood and repealing obamacare was so unpopular that, just before the legislation came to a vote, a usa today/suffolk university poll found that only 12% of americans supported trumpcare.
it's about a boy named jerome — it's a little black boy — who collects words. some people collect stamps and coins and rocks. jerome collects words. and my son collects words. he pauses on words he's never heard. he ruminates on them, and then he loves to throw them back out at us. and it's a really beautiful story of a little black boy who collects words that he hears and comes across. and then at the end — hate to give away the ending — it's only like 10 pages long — he spills all of his bag of words off a mountaintop to give them to other children. and he has no words to describe how happy that makes them.
vice president biden is there. and he's sounding and talking tough, sort of like ronald reagan.
fix the so-called family glitch in the affordable care act, which bases a family's eligibility for marketplace subsidies on whether an employee's offer of workplace coverage was affordable for the individual but not necessarily affordable for the whole family.
mccammon: well, there are a lot of rumors, among them steve bannon, trump's campaign ceo, and rnc chairman reince priebus, who are both on the transition team. there has been speculation that one of them might be a candidate for trump's chief-of-staff. bannon is, of course, the former head of breitbart news, and he has said he would go back there. choosing him, though, would elevate a key figure in the alt-right movement, which has been associated with white nationalism. his website, for instance, has promoted many conspiracy theories that have been debunked. some of the people leading the committee, also, are names we have heard before during the campaign - dr. ben carson, former new york mayor rudy giuliani, former house speaker newt gingrich - and chris christie is still part of the team. there are also some names that are familiar in washington and wall street - you know, two big establishment cities that trump has promised supporters he would tear down the establishment during the campaign.
pushing back against president trump's claims that the economy is doing great, sen. kamala harris said, well yeah, people in america are working — they're working two and three jobs. the percentage of american workers who hold multiple jobs is virtually unchanged from when trump took office, according to the bureau of labor statistics.
the president doesn't get to write legislation, and it's illegal and unconstitutional for him to try and change legislation by himself, sen. rand paul, r-ky., told fox news.
with polls showing the democratic race tightening in the crucial leadoff states of iowa and new hampshire, chelsea clinton on tuesday took aim at bernie sanders -- her mother's chief rival for the nomination -- saying that sanders would dismantle the health care system as we know it.
going back to 2015, i've kept a close eye on the right track/wrong track numbers. the gap in these numbers over the previous ten years, reaching all the way back to george w. bush's presidency, told me people were desperate for change, and that 2016 could not be a match-up between jeb bush and hillary clinton (as the experts predicted). people desperately wanted something new. why would they go back to clinton and bush?
sanders' transformation is evident in his policy agenda. the inclusion of abortion coverage in his single-payer health care bill won plaudits from women's groups. he commemorated the 50th anniversary of martin luther king's assassination in memphis, tennessee; held an anti-poverty rally with civil rights leader rev. william barber, in durham, north carolina; and convened a live panel discussion on economic inequality that prominently featured people who specialize in the unique barriers facing americans of color.
9:16 p.m. et after clinton outlined how she would help americans, including minorities across the u.s., trump said, it's just words, folks. it's just words.
of those four witnesses, perhaps only nahvi is actually an advocate for medicare for all, the single-payer health care system that would transition everyone to medicare. and even then, sources tell huffpost that nahvi's testimony is supposed to be limited to how patient experience would change. that means that when the rules committee convenes this hearing on tuesday, there may not be any witness testifying who will make the case for medicare for all over other health care plans.
but in the latest cbs news battleground tracker, just 12% of all voters in the early primary and caucus states through super tuesday say they are considering yang. the campaign has done well to build support in online communities, but it is trying to spread the candidate's message to a wider audience. last week, the yang campaign launched a 7-figure ad buy in the early primary states with glossy ads focused on his health care policies and economic populism.
what is the price of a human life, mister ip? if your son or daughter needed a million dollars worth of brain surgery this week to survive, i am sure you could pass the hat around to your fellow white co-workers at the wall street journal and raise your $12,000 deductible or maximum out-of-pocket costs, but could the average minority in america do the same?
actuaries for covered california, the state's aca marketplace, estimated that patients hospitalized because of coronavirus would stay an average of 12 days, generating an average bill of $72,000.
the president will be putting forward plans this year that we hope to introduce into congress, marc short told blitzer. but, the reality is the court decision is likely not until the summer of 2020, by the time it would reach the supreme court.
trump critics have warned that he would be emboldened if he were acquitted by the senate. in the hours before republican sen. lamar alexander announced he would vote against calling witnesses, likely ensuring a quick acquittal , it was at least clear that trump was not at all chastened.
i do think it is further to the left than what you've seen from democratic politicians probably since the obamacare debate, said adam jentleson, who served as deputy chief of staff to former senate majority leader harry reid. but that represents where the party is headed and not just where the party is right now, but where democrats think the party is likely to be in the heat of the 2020 campaign.
sanders came out of 2016 as a national leader in the party he still hadn't joined. top democrats embraced him and sought his validation — even when it was awkward.
joel is a civil servant through and through ― principled, dedicated to his country and nonpartisan, nicholas bagley, who served at justice from 2007 to 2010 and is now at the university of michigan, told huffpost. if people like him are jumping ship, it's a troubling sign of institutional rot at the justice department.
the draft platform says democrats will cap out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors, but doesn't offer a dollar amount for the cap. it also talks about ensuring that effective treatments for chronic health conditions are available at little or no cost, but doesn't explain how that would happen.

trump: i never was a fan of mccain, i never will be
in some cases, the employers acknowledge these challenges. over the course of offering its program, starbucks realized that roughly one in five of its employees had an academic history that would mean they couldn't get into asu, novoa said. in response, they launched a program in 2017 called pathway to admission, which offers employees who don't meet asu's admissions standards the opportunity to take up to 10 courses for free to qualify.
six states withdrew entirely from the title x network: hawaii, maine, oregon, utah, vermont and washington.
in the end, exit polls found 89% of 2010 midterm voters said the economy was in bad shape, and 41% said their family's financial situation was worse than it had been two years ago, compared to just 14% who said their financial situation had improved. republicans gained six seats in the senate and took control of the house, picking up a whopping 63 seats.

opinion: biden can forge bipartisan cooperation with a bold infrastructure program
here's the full text of the discussion draft of the bill.
photo: cnn president donald trump (right) and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell speak monday in the white house rose garden.
in the house, gop leadership has urged their conference to vote no on the package, pointing out a series of issues with abortion-related language and the bill's overall effect on the federal deficit.
listen, what we needed here and what we have needed for six years is strong american leadership. the obama-clinton-kerry foreign policy has been consistently wrong. it's been wrong on russia. it's been wrong on isis. it's been wrong on iran.
researchers at the kaiser family foundation dispute that ominous picture. they argue the individual insurance market is stabilizing in most parts of the country, although deliberate moves by the administration could undermine that. npr's danielle kurtzleben made the same point in march.

president donald trump has fortified his white house with a new chief of staff, former house freedom caucus chairman and retiring rep. mark meadows (r-nc).
the cbo's estimate makes clear that trumpcare will cause serious harm to millions of american families, said schumer. tens of millions will lose their coverage, and millions more, particularly seniors, will have to pay more for health care.
i don't think 180 million americans want to give up the insurance they already have through their work or their union, said bennet.
thirdly, we should give our great state governors the resources and flexibility they need with medicaid to make sure no one is left out.
this is what the obama administration argued in 2011 when it declined to defend the defense of marriage act (doma), which denied federal benefits to same-sex couples. the decision was controversial, with even some of the administration's own lawyers cautioning that it set a bad precedent.
a provision that would close the  boyfriend loophole , prohibiting dating partners convicted of assault or stalking from purchasing firearms, has been a sticking point between democrats and republicans. the new bill would prohibit those convicted of misdemeanor stalking from buying a firearm and makes it illegal for a person to transfer or sell a firearm or ammunition to a person they believe has been convicted of misdemeanor stalking.
gingrich: sure. the constitution gives the president of the united states an extraordinarily wide grant of authority to use the power of the pardon. i'm not saying he should. i'm not saying he will. it also allows the president, in a national security moment, to say to somebody - go do x, even if it's technically against the law. and i'm - here's your pardon because i'm ordering you as commander in chief to go do this.
to any american who's got a problem with john mccain's vote, all i can tell you is john mccain was willing to die for this country, and he can vote any way he wants to, and it doesn't matter to me, the south carolina senator said.
then comes super tuesday on march 3, when voters in alabama, american samoa, arkansas, california, colorado, maine, massachusetts, minnesota, north carolina, oklahoma, tennessee, texas, vermont and virginia cast ballots for their choice for the democratic presidential nominee.
if the court decides to throw out the affordable care act, even in part, devising a replacement will fall to whoever is in the white house and whoever is running congress. in other words, a lot would depend on who wins in november and what they are prepared to do.
it's will be seven months before of any leadership race. ryan was emphatic wednesday that he plans to remain in his job, but members say even before his formal announcement, the fight for speaker was playing out in subtle ways behind the scenes. with ryan officially out, the race is expected to go into overdrive.
trump is not telling the whole story when he says the bill could have saved the country $1 trillion in entitlement saving. in addition to reducing health care spending, mostly on medicaid, the senate health care bill would have repealed or modified tax provisions in the aca that provide increased revenues to the federal treasury.
finally, biden plainly wants this to be about a contrast in leadership styles. in place of trump's bombast, irrationality and vindictiveness, biden presents a calm and empathetic figure. who do americans want to listen to for the next four years, and who do they trust to guide them through the recovery from america's worst domestic disaster in a century? on that, biden is betting the contest won't be close.
polling shows that health care, followed by climate change, followed by the desire for a president who can unite our country are the three big concerns of many voters.
rubio claimed his bill was the toughest border security and enforcement plan in u.s. history, yet schlafly writes, the final product surely was one of the worst bills mashed together in the history of legislation itself… rubio traded shamelessly on the affection and trust conservatives had placed in him.
the nonpartisan congressional budget office hasn't yet analyzed the new bill. it weighed in on the earlier senate bill, saying that proposal would result in 22 million fewer people having health coverage in the next 10 years, compared with under the affordable care act. of those, 15 million would lose medicaid coverage. that version was projected to lower the deficit by billions over 10 years — but that may have changed as the latest version offers billions more for state grants and also doesn't repeal as many of the obamacare taxes.
the election initially was going to be an all mail-in vote, but limited in-person voting was allowed after concerns were raised about people who can't cast ballots by mail, including the disabled and homeless. more than 85,000 votes already have been mailed in.
«olvídate del término asamblea electoral, solo ve y emite tu voto, ¿de acuerdo?», dijo trump. «¿qué diablos es una asamblea electoral? nadie sabe siquiera lo que significa».
the latest blow, and surely not the last one
the claim: we lose with mexico over $100 billion a year with this crazy nafta deal.

borger: and among young women too.
i'm afraid people can lose their lives without the coverage they need, he added.
biden says he will create a national standard for housing appraisals. he will also pursue legislation that will prohibit the lending industry from pushing buyers into mortgages they cannot afford and restore power to the office of fair lending and equal opportunity to hold lenders who've discriminated against home buyers accountable.
by the time biden took office, his legislative affairs team -- made up of several former capitol hill hands who brought with them significant bipartisan credibility from their past staff work -- was already deeply engaged in the process.
i think what you'd have to do is grade him just like you'd do any student and that would be on many levels, not just one. we're hopeful as far as the tax reform … we're positive about that. we have grave concerns about other facets of his administration and his actions verbally. some of the statements that he makes. there's just, there's just a lot of disrespect for a large number of people in different avenues, different times, different days, that affect us all here in the united states but they affect us internationally as well.
sen. dick durbin (d-il), argued on monday that amnesty for millions of illegal immigration is the civil rights issue of our time.
former vice president joe biden falsely claimed president trump immediately discontinued an aid program to central america, and implied that's the cause of surging immigration across the u.s.-mexico border. the aid was reduced about 23 percent during trump's first two years.
-- back in 2013, right after the gop forced a shutdown in a failed effort to defund obamacare, trump criticized barack obama for allowing it to happen. the future president defined leadership this way. whatever happens, you're responsible, he tweeted five years ago. if it doesn't happen, you're responsible.

marlow's introduction to the drudge report via his father added to his political progression. my dad recommended to me — when i was in the tenth grade — that i start going to the drudge report, he shared. i fell in love with drudge report almost instantly. … this was the greatest hack in the history of information, that i could go to this page and i could get updated on almost the entirety of what's happening on planet earth in a heartbeat.
i commend @freedomcaucus for staying united against obamacare lite. enough no votes to stop bill and restart negotiations w/ conservatives — senator rand paul (@randpaul) march 22, 2017
that's partly because trump is now the personification of the government – he bears responsibility for the state of the health care industry and the struggle many americans are facing in affording spiraling costs of treatment.
cornish: so president trump's response to this story has been varied, to say the least. in the last few hours, speaking about the arrest, as we heard, he had this to say.
president obama joined the chorus of democrats calling for the creation of a government run health insurance program as obamacare is facing growing problems.

remington unveiled the first typewriter. an early attempt was made at electric light.
dakota workman, 22, from west virginia, said the white house was not operating, as trump insisted, like a fine-tuned machine, though he noted that no administration is this early on. but he appreciated the new coal regulations, the ban on lobbying and trump's supreme court pick even more. if the president backpedaled on obamacare repeal, he said, he'd be upset with congress and start thinking about ditching trump. i sucked up my pride and voted for him more because it was about beating hillary clinton, workman explained.
washington state, which has been enrolling people since march 10, has had 2,973 residents indicate they plan to sign up as of last thursday. about 500 have actually done so. in new york, during the first four days of the enrollment period, 150 people signed up, according to state officials.
azar told trump he was doing everything he could but that much of his work was being stopped or hampered, they add.
i don't -- i don't think that there's any question about that.
these days, given globalization, technological change and other forces, it's rare that an employee will be able to survive in their career long-term without adding new skills, whether that's a full degree or some kind of certification.
when kennedy and the other justices declined to sever the individual insurance requirement from the rest of the law, roberts turned to congress' taxing power as grounds to uphold the mandate, which carried a penalty for people who did not buy insurance. roberts was joined by the four liberal justices to uphold the law.
this sounds ... out of the ordinary as far as policies go.
hickenlooper, who studied to be a geologist, and is a two-term former governor of colorado, said in response to a question about climate change, i share the sense of urgency. i'm a scientist, so i recognize that we're within 10 or 12 years of actually, you know, suffering irreversible damage.
the trump administration argues that because the new tax law eliminates the penalty for not buying insurance, the supreme court's previous ruling permitting the mandate as a tax no longer applies.
now when these legal immigrants come in [to the u.s.] and potentially get a green card or citizenship, the american taxpayer is expected to bear the brunt of allowing them to immigrate here. they're allowed to use medicaid, obamacare subsidies, and a whole host of other programs that we foot the bill for. [emphasis added] the question is, why has the government — down the line — when did they get rid of this common sense approach… the administration is just trying to restore the integrity of our immigration system and help out the american taxpayer. [emphasis added]
even the nonpartisan congressional budget office projects this new healthcare legislation would cut our federal deficit by $337 billion. while obamacare drove up premiums, the republican-led healthcare reforms would lower premiums by 10%. obamacare forced small business layoffs, but the repeal and replace bill would lower taxes by $883 billion. these are real reforms that our country needs, and stands in sharp contrast to the out of control spending obamacare inflicted on our economy.
without the whole thing with the individual mandate, it's a whole different ball game, trump said. he promised that the gop would come up with an alternative, but didn't offer specifics other than that pre-existing conditions would be covered.
this goes to a serious problem with the brain-dead conservative movement: its failure to recognize that freedom is one value but not necessarily paramount to others, such as preventing cruelty or eradicating racism.
sanders claimed that trump tried to throw 32 million people off their health care that they have, a figure that includes people who would choose to no longer purchase insurance if congress repealed the affordable care act without replacing it.
martin: did you take offense as an alligator?
the facts: in september, then-acting homeland security secretary kevin mcaleenan announced an end to catch and release. but, since then, dhs has continued to release hundreds of asylum seekers into the interior of the country.
on wednesday, the departments of health and humans services (hhs), labor, and treasury released a final rule that expands short-term, limited-duration health insurance from their previous maximum period of three months. under the new rule, a short-term health insurance plan can cover a patient for up to a year and can even be extended to a maximum three years.

the polarization on spending comes amid rumors that both desantis and scott have eyes on the white house in 2024. at odds on numerous issues, desantis has for almost a year blamed scott for the massive failures of the state's unemployment system, which was developed and implemented when scott served as governor.
the super pac has also hired 150 organizers spread across 11 battleground states and is also aiming to register tens of thousands of young voters in 2020. they also created a simple fact sheet they plan to digitally pass out to voters at online organizing events, aiming to answer questions about biden's and trump's records.

newsom orders california's nearly 40 millions residents to stay home - sacramento bee: all californians need to stay at home and avoid nonessential social contact to slow the spread of the deadly coronavirus pandemic, gov. gavin newsom ordered thursday. 'it's time for all of us to recognize as individuals and as a community we need to do more to meet this moment,' he said at an evening press conference. newsom said he hopes not to have to enforce the order, instead encouraging californians to influence one another to do the right thing. 'i don't believe the people of california need to be told through law enforcement to home isolate, protect themselves,' he said. more than a quarter of the state's residents were already under some type of shelter in place or stay at home orders, including in sacramento county.
the interior department reactivated its official twitter accounts after an abrupt shutdown that followed the national park service account retweeting two items viewed as unsympathetic to the new president. one referred to the size of the inauguration crowd on the mall, while another addressed policies that were excised from the white house website after trump's swearing in.

joining us in the audience tonight are four very brave americans whose government failed them.
1. how much of obamacare survived under trump?
about 30.4 million americans did not have health insurance in 2018, up from 29.3 million in 2017, according to the cdc's national health interview survey. that means about 1.1 million more americans lost insurance coverage last year.
two weeks of the major party political conventions delivered 16 hours of prime-time programming, more than 120 individual speakers, dozens of pre-produced glossy videos and zero fundamental change in the race.
obama's promise of choice has turned out to be fiction for people living in more than 1,000 counties who are left with one insurance provider on their state exchanges. no one can deny obamacare is in a 'death spiral' when the number of americans with only one insurer from which to choose jumps from 2% to 17% in one year. this is not choice.

obama said in 2009 that increasing the us share of trade with asia from 9% to 10% could mean 250,000, 300,000 jobs, but he was not specifically attributing that estimate to the potential effects of a trade deal with south korea.

editor's note: a version of this story was first published by kaiser health news on oct. 7.
now its control of the senate in doubt, and the affordable care act is a top issue again, thanks in part to a new lawsuit challenging its constitutionality that the supreme court is expected to hear in november ― quite possibly, with trump nominee amy coney barrett in the seat that justice ruth bader ginsburg once occupied.
this decision reflects cms' commitment to put federal dollars for the federally facilitated exchanges to their most cost-effective use in order to better support consumers through the enrollment process, verma said.
the republican insisted that what is best for our children, according to the cdc and according to science, is in-person education.
the previous longest shutdown took place during former president bill clinton's time in office – lasting a total of 21 days.
in a 15-page memo outlining rubio's betrayal of the conservative movement, grassroots heroine and living legend phyllis schlafly documented rubio record of lying to conservative media and the many falsehoods he told at the time. his deceptions about his immigration bill rivaled and exceeded obama's claims about disastrous obamacare, schlafly wrote.
blitzer: all right. take a look at this. these are live pictures coming in. john kasich, jeb bush, they're at events in new hampshire right now. both candidates putting in a lot of work in there.
— a few more good reads from the post and beyond:
this gets down to one of the biggest battles, i think, that needs to be confronted in the republican party, which is the idea that somehow, through sheer force of will and presentation of numbers, we're going to get americans to accept a level of federal government involvement that we have not seen since 1928. that idea is a fantasy, determined olsen.
the senate bill seeks to close that gap by expanding making tax credits available to people making between 0 and 350 percent of poverty. but because the benchmark plan under the senate bill would pay only 58 percent of benefits, deductibles would increase. therefore, despite being eligible for premium tax credits, few low-income people would purchase any plan, the budget office said.
the former new york city mayor has been beset by accusations that he made sexually suggestive comments in the 1990s, and that bloomberg lp was a hostile workplace for women. his campaign has said that he sometimes made comments that did not reflect his values and that his company has always elevated women.
this guidance suggests the federal government will allow states to target assistance differently, as verma confirmed monday, which could mean giving people more assistance if they buy short-term or other alternative plans ― and less assistance if they stick with comprehensive coverage.
trump brought up clinton's remark from a month ago when she called his supporters deplorable. he said that he would help members of the black community and hispanic community.
late this week, trump and gop leaders agreed to modify the bill by eliminating a requirement that all insurance plans cover essential benefits, such as mental health and maternity care, and then offering special funds to cover the costs of precisely those services. experts immediately warned that making these changes could dramatically alter health insurance markets, making it difficult to find comprehensive coverage as insurers would gravitate toward offering less generous policies.
sitting in the front, biden was a newcomer here at bethlehem baptist church. but rev. anthony mccallum, an early endorser of obama's in 2007, had already called him family. on sunday he told his congregation that he sees in biden what he saw in obama, to roaring cheers.
research shows that inequality breeds distrust in government, kettl notes, which decreases electoral participation and compliance with tax collection while increasing political polarization and corruption. it is expensive, since more distrust leads to more regulation and litigation, he writes. combined with the erosion of madison's other great invention, the separation of powers, the republic has created a crisis it may well not be able to survive.
air travel has been hampered by the shutdown. aviation groups have warned of longer wait times and possible checkpoint closures at major airports and have raised concerns that passenger safety and security has been compromised. miami international airport is closing one of its terminals saturday through monday because many transportation security administration officials are not reporting to work, and airport officials weren't confident they would have enough screeners on duty.
rep. lauren underwood (d-ill.), who worked at the department of health and human services as the aca was being passed, said it's really important we leverage all existing authorities to ensure the american people have access to the care and coverage they need.

sen. rand paul (r-ky) lauded the expansion of ahps and short-term health insurance as the biggest free-market health care reform in a generation.
a recording that surfaced last week sheds light on some current approaches to washington lobbying, even as it mostly got attention for its implications in trump's ongoing impeachment trial. the tape — which was released by a lawyer for lev parnas, an indicted associate of rudy giuliani — features donors to a trump super pac making requests such as backing for a 500-mile highway that would be used just by self-driving trucks, a new york times report said. another donor pushed the president to further limit steel imports.
in nine years, the united states will celebrate the 250th anniversary of our founding — 250 years since the day we declared our independence.
biden is also attentive to the existential threat of continuing climate change. there is a vast litany of problems, such as the burning of fossil fuels causing increased levels of carbon dioxide and rising temperatures. addressing these problems will require government intervention and international cooperation, such as that mandated by the 2015 paris climate agreement, from which trump withdrew the u.s.
levin: socially your view is be and let be.
cuando un manifestante de black lives matter fue golpeado y pateado por los asistentes en una manifestación de trump en el otoño pasado, el día siguiente trump observó que «quizás le deberían haber dado una paliza».
mcconnell responded to bannon's criticism by citing past republican primary challengers who failed to make it into the senate and stressing his relationship to trump.
levin: but now we get to talk to each other and i'll tell you why i wanted you here because you fascinate me. a great athlete. you know, i'm from philadelphia. you played for the phillies for some time. you played for the diamondbacks. you played for boston, and a tremendous record. and also you're an outspoken conservative.
if you dressed up for the restaurant, however, take heart. the cost of buying a men's suit dropped 4% and women's dresses fell almost 10%.
now, with narrow majorities in both chambers and biden in the white house, democrats are renewing the push. vermont sen. bernie sanders' proposal to get a federal $15 minimum wage increase from $7.25 back into biden's covid relief bill failed last week, with eight democrats siding with republicans to vote down the amendment. the senate parliamentarian had ruled the hike could not be included in the measure under the strict rules of budget reconciliation.
— in a dungeon-like jail in the center of this depressed farming town, 18 women in orange-and-white-striped prison uniforms are crammed into a two-story cellblock. many of them are withdrawing from fentanyl.
-- virginia gov. ralph northam (d) delivered a state of the commonwealth speech in which he urged republican legislators to consider his proposed budget. laura vozzella and gregory s. schneider report: the governor wants to spend some $1.2 billion that could flood state coffers because of changes to the federal tax code under the tax cuts president trump signed last year. he wants half of that amount to fund tax breaks for virginian households making less than $54,000 a year, the state's median income. he would use the other half to shore up the state's reserve funds and make 'historic' investments in schools, the environment, rural broadband and other priorities. republicans, though, want to change virginia tax code so that much of that money goes back to taxpayers at middle- and higher- income brackets.
we rate rubio's claim that obama's resolution was not about targeting isis as false, but we also rate his claim that obama also asked congress to authorize the use of force against assad as true.
a police officer quoted in the report observed that pharmacists are more likely to fill dubious prescriptions when medicaid is involved. the justice department launched a program over the summer to study the role played real and fraudulent prescriptions for opioids in the drug crisis.
in middle tennessee, where lori woodard-hoyt does health care consulting that includes insurance assistance to doctors, she says many consumers are choosing to remain uninsured — especially considering the challenges many face finding in-network specialists in their rural areas. with high-deductible plans, others also can't afford to pay what they owe when go to the doctor.
question: ...how does he reach out to them (ph)?
the covid-19 pandemic is about to enter its most treacherous phase
in attacking institutions from the fbi to the centers for disease control and prevention, trump is hollowing out the governmental structure. in imposing pointless obstacles that lead to trade wars, he has alienated america's allies. in his admiration for dictators and authoritarian leaders, he is helping them to establish 21st-century fascism. and his chronic lying from the office of the president undermines the people's confidence in their government.
the trump administration guidance means that it can interpret the law's rules more loosely, in ways that will effectively let people move into less comprehensive coverage ― even though that means more exposure to medical bills.
-- trump has said it's better to be feared than loved, but democratic leaders simply aren't scared of him. pelosi called him petulant after the meeting and then took a dig at trump's false narrative that he's a self-made man. noting that federal workers are about to miss a paycheck, the house speaker said: he thinks maybe they could just ask their father for more money. but they can't.
the [democratic] party is pushing a socialist nightmare. their plans will result in rationing care, denying choice, putting americans on waitlist, driving the best doctors out of medicine permanently and delaying cures, trump said.
when one of them continued to interupt biden, he responded saying don't act like the trumpers, ok.
and i'm doing this for a reason. so you have the major league record when it comes to that. you also struck out over 3,000 batters. one behind gibson. you're tied for third or one behind.
if enrollment is shrinking, why are costs increasing? as always, you can blame the economy.
realistically, covid-19 will be here for the next 18 months or more. we will not be able to return to normalcy until we find a vaccine or effective medications. i know that's dreadful news to hear. how are people supposed to find work if this goes on in some form for a year and a half? is all that economic pain worth trying to stop covid-19? the truth is we have no choice. if we prematurely end that physical distancing and the other measures keeping it at bay, deaths could skyrocket into the hundreds of thousands if not a million. we cannot return to normal until there's a vaccine. conferences, concerts, sporting events, religious services, dinner in a restaurant, none of that will resume until we find a vaccine, a treatment, or a cure.
washington desk editor arnie seipel contributed to this report.
the link from mccain to trump goes something like this: the republican senator from arizona elevated palin, then the gop governor of alaska, by picking her as his vice presidential nominee in 2008. palin in turn helped stir up and elevate certain factions on the right -- notably the kind of people who called barack obama an arab. eight years later, america elected a man to the white house who had questioned obama's birth certificate and whose base of voters fit neatly into the same categories as those who supported palin.
senator, i want to bring it back home to the stalemate in congress over homeland security funding. the government again, that part of the government, runs out of money in just a few weeks. republicans are looking at you and wondering what is your end game here because this is a strategy crafted by you, the idea of holding up funding for the department of homeland security in order to try to stop the president and his executive order on immigration.
much of the emerging image of dysfunction has been painted by trump's own staff. the calls are coming from inside the white house – and they are going to reporters, who have been flooded with accounts of a frenetic and angry president, who bounces from political frustration to personal grudge – often in his bathrobe, according to a new york times account disputed by the white house – in the space of a few minutes.
have concerns 13 these senators are considering voting against the bill unless their concerns get addressed, or they clearly expressed opposition to the first version of the bill and haven't changed their position yet.

senate republicans unveiled their answer to obamacare: a 142-page bill drafted in secret that includes deep cuts to medicaid, impedes access to abortion and shifts resources from the poor to the rich.
paul ryan ran with mitt romney as his vice presidential candidate.
the impact of subsidies makes hickman's case pretty typical, says shelli quenga, director of programs for the nonprofit palmetto project, which hires navigators to help enroll people in obamacare.

the gop will never stop trying to destroy the affordable health care of america's families.
significantly, new polling shows former new york city mayor mike bloomberg's is picking up support among african-americans – a constituency that has been strongly supportive of biden in earlier polls.
3. decide what to do about your workplace retirement plans
thank you so much for your time.
these findings, based on several surveys, are merely the latest proof that, whatever its shortcomings, the affordable care act has succeeded in its primary goal of reducing the number of americans who lack health insurance. the share of adults aged 18-64 without health insurance was 11.5 percent as of february, down from 20.3 percent in october 2013, according to the report. other polls that include children and people over 65 show an even lower uninsured rate.
the special enrollment period, which extends to may 15, allows americans in need of health insurance to sign up for coverage through healthcare.gov. mr. biden signed an executive order in late january allowing the department of health and human services to establish the special enrollment period for uninsured and underinsured americans to seek coverage through the federal marketplace in light of the exceptional circumstances caused by the pandemic.
another orangeburg resident, mary hampton, 58, said that she can trust biden for standing strong with obama.
nebraska organizers also collected far more signatures than they needed using similar tactics. some 90,000 residents will gain coverage, more than two-thirds of whom work but their jobs don't provide health insurance, said meg mandy, campaign manager for insure the good life, which is promoting expansion in the cornhusker state. also, expansion will bring the state $1.1 billion in federal funding over four years and sustain 10,000 jobs, many of which are in rural areas.
for workers without access to employer-sponsored retirement savings plans, biden would offer employers incentives to create automatic 401(k)s for employees.
of the 11 bills cited by the ward campaign, only three provide a pathway to permanent legal residence. two of the bills have yet to receive a vote, leading az fact check to rate the claim zero out of four stars, false.
when devos declined to commit to proceeding with the gainful employment rule at her confirmation hearing in january, senator elizabeth warren (d-ma), said, swindlers and crooks are out there doing back flips when they hear an answer like that.
officials have been urging the electorate to vote by mail for weeks, after roughly 484,000 ballots were mailed earlier this month to registered voters in the state's 7th congressional district to choose a candidate to finish the term of the late rep. elijah cummings. he died in october.
but so what is one of those you'd recommend if people don't know their history?
campaigns and super pacs are not allowed to coordinate on advertising, but the unified front against trump comes just one week before the iowa caucuses and continue cruz's theme of painting the new york billionaire as out-of-touch with iowa values.
medicare-x leaves out one biden proposal: lowering the medicare eligibility age from 65 to 60.
de blasio's comments come as democrats already have been trending further left in policy proposals and as recent polling suggests they're responding to the wishes of the democratic base.
mccaskill received another political godsend in 2018 thanks to the meltdown of the state republican party. gop gov. eric greitens, a conservative rising star, resigned earlier this year amid after being accused of blackmailing and assaulting a woman with whom he had had an affair.
some trump initiatives, such as repealing obamacare, cutting taxes or expanding social security, would require extensive, close work with congress. but presidents already have the power to do much of what trump has proposed. congress has given the president the authority to make trade deals, for example, and trump could try to renegotiate the nuclear deal with iran.
republicans have tried highlighting some specific projects ― they attacked a bridge in upstate new york and funding for a subway system in california as pet projects for house speaker nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and senate majority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) before both items were stripped from the bill for parliamentary reasons ― but have generally made broader critiques, often arguing that only 9% of the bill's spending goes toward covid-19 relief. (that charge is overstated at best, since $1,400 checks make up more than one-fifth of the bill's total spending.)
i think we have a long way to go before we know the answer to that question, sen. tim scott, r-south carolina, said when asked if it could pass next week, adding that the draft version could be modified before a vote happens. i'm open to moving forward on the legislation. we have a lot of time now -- seven days -- to figure out what parts we like about it, what parts we plan to keep. this is only a draft legislation. we're going to make a lot of changes over the next seven days.
and i think it's because the senate has become a proving ground of sorts, where people can show where they are on the positions and prove to voters where they stand.
whether she's weighed the ups and downs of the law appropriately, whether her sometimes vague proposals would improve access to health care at a reasonable price ― these are subjective questions, about which reasonable people can disagree. but the facts she cited on sunday night were correct, and she's outlined her policy plans clearly, if not always with much detail.
ryan was welcomed by conservatives as mitt romney's choice for running mate in 2012. the pro-life fiscal conservative had led the charge to reform entitlements, and used his policy prowess to point out the deep flaws in obamacare during the intense debates of 2009-10.
democrats have noticed what the trump administration is doing and are hoping voters do, too. nationally, democratic candidates have made rising health care costs a central plank in their platform during this year's midterm elections, and tuesday's announcement provides them more fodder for their case that the gop is mishandling the health care system.
democrats on monday executed an old move from the playbook used by a party when it doesn't control the majority during a big hearing: changing the subject.
the koch brothers have begun running this six-figure ad campaign for amnesty, in which daca illegal aliens are described as patriots to the u.s.
he won -- finished third place. he was soaring for so long and crashed. but all the sanders advisers believe that so much is different now, because the social media, how we communicate is different now.
paul ryan said in a statement released friday:
steel noted that biden's assignment of implementing the recovery act was an implicit admission that job creation wasn't obama's top focus.
so what that's reflecting is the hard fact that the majority of white americans have not voted for democrats since the civil rights movement. and so when we were growing up and there was this fear of the white center all the time in politics, it was a cold calculation. the new calculation is that what the democrats are riding to victory is a new, multiracial, anti-racist coalition, the backbone of which is black people, and then the white people who join are progressives who don't mind sitting in a meeting with and swimming in a pool with black people. they came for obama, they stayed to fight against trump. now they like it. so that is, i think, what explains that shift. i think the idea is we've got to deal with these racial disparities. i think it is a genuine desire to see this country prosper by making sure that all families have what they need and that we don't keep holding back millions of american families because of bad public policy decisions. but i think the politics of it are, yes, we can actually talk about the race impacts of this, because there's a clamoring for racial justice. and the white democrats who are with us are basically there because of their racial attitudes.
i sat next to him, i said, 'hello,' trump said, describing the funeral. then i said, 'goodbye' that's about it. i didn't like the job he did. i didn't like the job he and biden did. i didn't like the position he put us in. i didn't like what he did to our military. ... right now we have more ammunition than ever before.
for instance, rubio said border security would precede amnesty– a fact he later admitted was not the case in a 2013 spanish language interview.
the trump administration's views on what parts of the aca might be kept or replaced if the law is overturned have shifted over time. but in legal arguments, it has always supported getting rid of obamacare provisions that prohibit insurance companies from discriminating against people on account of their medical history.
pipes suggests addressing the crisis by rolling back the medicaid expansion and block-granting funds to states, which could help to drain the bureaucratic swamp that hides so much medicaid corruption and strongly incentivize states to watch their health-care dollars more carefully.
one thing that touches on is that i think in politics for a long time, it's been believed there are two ways of approaching this. one is to deal directly with racism and the fact that you're trying to close racial economic divides, and the other is to ignore it, to pretend you don't know anything about racial economic divides, and you've just got this economic policy. but you've been involved with ian haney lópez in some research that has this other idea, which is to say that in fact, the human mind does have a us-versus-them tendency. it is a powerful thing to harness in politics. this is how i read it. i don't think this is how ian or you would frame it. and that the most powerful messaging is to say that there are powerful economic interests that are using racial division to enrich themselves and keep everyone else down. and so there's actually a different synthesis here that is more effective, but it's not one that ignores division. it is one that recasts division. i'm curious to hear you talk a little bit about that.
the evening's theme, per the white house, was spring's renewal, drawing upon nature and florals for inspiration. tables covered in white tablecloths were adorned with white and green floral arrangements, tall white candlesticks, and white house china (it was not immediately clear which administration's table setting was used sunday evening).
the house bill, wrote the republican governors of ohio, michigan, arkansas and nevada in a letter to house and senate leaders, provides almost no new flexibility for states, does not ensure the resources necessary to make sure no one is left out, and shifts significant new costs to states.
the party endlessly crowed about repealing and replacing obamacare, only to come to power without a viable plan and then quickly accommodate itself to the reality it had vowed to overturn. this strategy has led millions of republicans to feel cheated and lied to by their leaders, creating an atmosphere of paranoia and suspicion toward anyone who is not utterly extreme. it also feeds the notion that true conservatism fails because of some kind of collusion, treason and betrayal. it is a short and direct line from gingrich to the jan. 6 capitol riot.
but i think that this is -- this is not a deal that was in our country's best interest. the president could have come into office -- a president could have come into office and renegotiated it and sent people back to the drawing board. it hadn't gone to congress yet because it wasn't finalized. i think this president pulling out of the agreement is not just about this one agreement, but i think it's symbolic both here in america and around the world of a new era of trade policy, one that's going to put american workers first and foremost and one that assures the rest of the world that the way that we negotiate bilateral agreements is going to ensure that we get something out of these deals.
democrats may have leverage, but do not have the sway to get everything they want. some might also object to what conservatives demand in exchange.

the american armed forces would refuse to act, former cia director michael hayden said earlier this year. you are required not to follow an unlawful order.
in kenya, public health experts raised immediate concerns about the new policy. women here often resort to dangerous methods to end their pregnancies, including drinking battery acid and using wire coat hangers. in parts of rural kenya, young women have hired local healers to stomp on their stomachs until the pregnancy is deemed over. 'trump's policy means even fewer services will be offered,' said chimaraoke izugbara, a researcher at the african population and health research center (aphrc) in nairobi. 'some women will not be reached, and providers may not be available to offer services. i think we are headed to a major disaster.' nearly 8,000 women in kenya die every year from complications caused by pregnancy and childbirth. at least a fifth of those deaths are caused by self-induced abortions, according to izugbara.
and none are greater or braver than those who fight for america in uniform.
this might sound like hypocrisy coming from a punk rocker, but it's really not. the whole ethos of '70s and '80s punk rock is live and let live. no rules … at least until you interfere with me living the life i want to live, which is exactly what is happening to rotten.
mr. trump, who is not a poet, either in his late-night tweets or on the speaker's stump, sees american greatness as some heavy, dead thing that we must reacquire. like a bar of gold, perhaps, or a bank vault, or one of the lifeless, anonymous buildings he loves to put up. it is a simplistic notion, reducing all the complexity of the american experience to a vague greatness, and his prescription for the future is just as undefined, a promise that we will return to winning without ever spelling out what we will win — save for the exclusion of others, the reduction of women to sexual tally points, the re-closeting of so many of us.
president trump said pence will work with professionals, doctors and others working on the response to the disease known as covid-19 and will report back directly to him.
trump ha criticado en repetidas ocasiones a cruz ya que el senador de texas subió en las encuestas antes de las asambleas electorales de iowa y desde entonces ha incrementado sus ataques contra él puesto que cruz venció a trump en la contienda de iowa.

the little sisters are hoping the high court will finally end their seven-year legal battle against the obama-era mandate that requires them to provide free contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs to their employees through health insurance plans.
kumar said kaiser encourages both doctors and patients to think of end-of-life planning as a routine part of care, just like you'd get a mammogram or colon cancer screening.
when he first ran for president, donald trump blasted the obama administration for hurting senior citizens by slashing billions from medicare.

i wouldn't count him out, but there's certainly been some troubling signs, said former democratic political operative grant woodard, who worked on hillary clinton's 2008 iowa campaign. a top iowa democrat said the former vice president doesn't have the intensity of support that other candidates have shown, adding, if he's not in the top three it's over.
washington — republicans have some serious pick-up opportunities in the senate — so why do they keep giving ammunition to democrats?
heller, for example, is facing a major challenge to his re-election in large part because of his flip-flopping on affordable care act repeal and eventual support for the last version of the legislation to replace it. that bill was the brainchild of cassidy and graham and absolutely would have weakened pre-existing condition protections.
but, how's that border wall paid for by mexico coming? he asked, a reference to one campaign pledge trump has not yet made good on.
many insurers suffered significant financial losses during the first few years of the program, because they attracted fewer healthier customers than they anticipated. this year, those carriers responded with larger-than-usual premium increases and, in some places, by withdrawing offerings altogether.

the democratic presidential candidate has said his universal health-care plan would result in a tax increase, including for middle and lower-income americans. but, he argues, that would be more than offset by savings from ending high-cost private health insurance plans.

after the latest attempt to repeal the health law failed with arizona sen. john mccain's dramatic thumbs down vote last july, the trump administration has taken other steps that obamacare advocates say weaken the law.
while republicans claim they want the law to protect both people with pre-existing conditions and people who rely on government programs for health coverage, those ideas are ideologically at odds with fundamental tenets of american conservatism. lower taxes, fewer regulations and a smaller federal government are incompatible with a safety net worth its name.
biden directed the department of health and human services to review those changes. the agency would need to write new regulations to undo the trump rules.

we must also call out the destruction this would place on the nation's public health priorities. president donald trump has claimed dedication to addressing the opioid epidemic and ending hiv/aids transmission. but if critical health systems are dismantled and patients lose health insurance, how will people afford treatment for opioid use disorder and prevention services for hiv, not to mention prevention and care for communicable diseases such as tuberculosis, chlamydia or even the flu?
'president trump and his party and judge barrett will overturn the affordable care act. and they won't stop there. they have made clear that they want to overturn roe vs. wade and restrict reproductive rights and freedoms.' 
ahead of wednesday's debate, warren has released two more plans on health care: one indicating that her plan would not increase taxes on middle class families and the other detailing a health care bill that includes an expansive public option that she says she would work to pass before medicare for all. meanwhile, two polls in the last week, including a cbs news battleground tracker poll, showed buttigieg rising in iowa. and with less than 80 days until the iowa caucus, buttigieg's competitors may start redirecting their fire toward the millennial mayor. how will buttigieg fend off potential attacks now that polling shows him in the top tier of candidates?
as under the current law, the senate bill states that insurers cannot refuse coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, nor can they charge higher prices. but it allows states to apply for waivers to change essential health benefits, a set of services insurers now must provide.
coverage for preexisting conditions is already the law of the land, he said. now, not only is he lying to you about giving you something you already have, he's actively trying to take it away, cuomo added.
but 1969 is not 6,000 years ago. my parents were alive. my brother would be born in a couple of years. that is in living memory. so i want to talk about the psychology that would lead white people to brick over their own public goods rather than share them. at that moment in 1959, when you have leaders in montgomery, alabama — white leaders closing their park department, telling their own children, there will be no pool for you to go to — how do they see themselves as doing the right thing for their children, for themselves? the book, both in this metaphor and in everything else we're going to talk about, is about this idea that this mindset leads to not just black people getting less, but white people getting less. and it literalizes right here. so how are they the heroes of their own story?
what he said next overshadowed his other remarks.
the next few weeks are crucial in determining whether the outbreak announced in may can be brought under control, according to the world health organization, saleh writes. complicating factors include its spread to a major city, that health workers are among those infected and the existence of three or four 'separate epicenters,' making finding and monitoring the contacts of infected people more difficult.
another historic trade blunder was the catastrophe known as nafta.
phrma and bristol-myers declined to comment, while abbvie, j&j, merck and pfizer didn't respond to requests for comment.
for seven years, i've been hearing repeal and replace from congress, trump said. and then when we finally get a chance to repeal and replace, they don't take advantage of it. so that's disappointing.
kaiser permanente uses physician extenders – nurse practitioners, registered nurses and social workers – to work with patients on various stages of what the hmo calls life care planning. the hmo also offers a website to guide people through the process.
rep. thomas garrett (r-va.) announced may 28 he is not seeking re-election, joining a growing list of gop lawmakers on their way out. (elyse samuels/the washington post)
he's talking about destroying your medicare and destroying your social security, and this whole country will come down, the president said.
he continued, i have my own views of the word socialist, and i'll be glad to share them with you in private. they go back to the early 1950s. i have an attitude about them. i remember the cold war. i have an attitude towards castro. i believe if castro and the reds had won the cold war, there would have been executions in central park. and i would have been one of the ones executed, and certain other people would be there cheering. so, i have a problem with people for the other side. i don't know what bernie means by socialism. one week it's denmark. we're going to be like denmark. i'm like that's harmless, a capitalist program with a lot of good social programs.
trump then turned to say that with the tax law in place, his administration is looking to make progress on trade with other nations. our trade has been a disaster. we were being taken advantage of as a country by many, many countries, he said.
pollitz: you can't be turned down based on your health status. you can't charge customers more based on their health status.
today, their street has recovered and the jenkins would like to see more black-owned businesses.
what has changed: the u.s. government has generally not released migrants from central and latin america. they are, for the most part, sent back to mexico under the migrant protection protocols or to guatemala under an agreement with the u.s. to take in asylum seekers — even though guatemala is one of the countries where most people are fleeing gang violence and poverty.
-- sadly, this is part of a broader trend. the ap reports that a wave of public officials – mostly male – have been reprimanded, called out, or disciplined over social media postings this week about the women's march protests. one indiana state rep posted a photo showing a women being sprayed in the face with pepper spray and a caption reading, participation trophies. now in liquid form. another suggested trump has already gotten more fat women out walking than michelle obama did in 8 years. and an illinois teacher was suspended after suggesting the protesters all had to go home to make dinner.
harris, who is black, accurately noted that biden worked with them to oppose busing, and told the story of her own school integration experience as an elementary student. as we have written, berkeley public schools in california began busing students to fully integrate the school district in 1968, and harris began attending school in 1969.
we're not finished fact checking the transcripts, but here are the 27 false claims we've identified already:
he speaks his mind and tells the truth, and he talks about keeping manufacturing jobs, said matt dziak, a 23-year-old steelworker from north versailles, southeast of pittsburgh.
and so, you have spoken out about this through president bush's years and now through president obama's years and talked about the rise of an uber presidency. is the president in your view about to violate the separation of powers if he goes ahead and does this?
several days of protest over the nomination of kavanaugh to the us supreme court yielded hundreds of arrests, but many of them came on a single day, as lawmakers reviewed an fbi report outlining allegations against the would-be justice.
in truth, one federal district judge ― rudolph contreras ― in 2012 found fault with parts of the gainful employment rule, but that was an earlier, different version of the rule, and the judge nevertheless upheld the authority of the department of education to issue it. after that decision, the department of education undertook a brand-new rule-making process and issued a brand-new gainful employment rule that eliminated the provisions that contreras rejected. when the for-profit college industry then challenged the new rule in court, two other federal district judges and three federal appeals judges all upheld the rule in its entirety. then, last week, judge contreras issued a narrow ruling in yet another industry lawsuit, directing the department to give certain cosmetology programs that had sued more flexibility to file appeals of adverse results, but the judge noted that his order avoids upending the entire ge regulatory scheme.
so on sunday night i went with my colleagues jessica cheung and clare toeniskoetter to meet brian keane at his house in arlington, a suburb about 15 minutes outside washington, d.c.
the facts: trump was referring to 26-year-old victor garcia, an unauthorized immigrant who was charged with shooting 34-year-old jesus valazquez last year. garcia had served six years in an arizona prison after being convicted of aggravated assault in 2011, and had previously been deported.
the feud appears to have cost warren votes – exactly the opposite effect she likely expected.
we don't know how they would rule, short said. the president has said repeatedly he would not sign any law unless it would protect pre-existing conditions.
biden: i'm the guy that got a bipartisan agreement … to spend $740 million to deal with the [border] problem, and that was to go to the root cause of why people are leaving in the first place. it was working. we saw, as you know, a net decrease in the number of children who were coming. the crisis was abated. and along came this president, and he said — he immediately discontinued that.
some people raised signs that said not my president, while others held up a large american flag. protester reg brookings warned the crowd that trump is trying to divide the country by making such groups as immigrants the enemy.
and you said left of center. my sense of this community is that that center word is important. that it's left of center, but it's not liberal liberal. i went back and looked at the 2016 primary for arlington county and saw that hillary clinton won this county by a 2-to-1 ratio over bernie sanders. it wasn't really even close. he got 32 percent. she got twice as much, 66 percent.
fetal heartbeat laws are all the rage right now.
inskeep: each one of those is for a minority of people, in other words.
that relationship grew stronger when trump appointed rep. mick mulvaney (r-s.c.), a caucus co-founder, as his budget director and then as his acting chief of staff, one of the most powerful positions in the white house.
national parks across the country have been feeling the shutdown's impact. the national park service has been relying on charities, nonprofit organizations and others to keep national parks open. but many of the rangers and others who staff campgrounds and keep the parks running have been furloughed, causing trash to pile up and creating other unsanitary conditions at treasured landmarks.

sanders has led a marvelously fact-free campaign. when asked how he will fund his programs, he dismisses the question and acts as though trillion-dollar price tags are insignificant details.
the draft platform backs a national minimum wage of $15 an hour for the caregiving workforce. in addition, they'd get up to 12 weeks of federally provided paid family and medical leave.
we have a sense that if we're going to be voting, we understand that you want to vote for somebody who can be elected, and so you don't want to kind of just say like, oh, let's just go crazy and vote for mr. potato head because i think he's great, and see what happens.
in subsequent remarks, both trump and ryan indicated they were ready to move on from health care to other issues.
bentlage said he's glad he doesn't have to go without insurance like he did before the affordable care act. at that time he couldn't find coverage because of his diabetes.
u.s. crude oil futures were trading 0.8% down early thursday, at $47.45 per barrel.
i look forward to soon re-introducing my legislation re-naming the senate russell building after american hero, senator john mccain, schumer wrote in a tweet.
biden hopes for some wins in southern states, states that specifically have a large, sizable population of black voters. we saw in south carolina, he seems to have a strength there. his intent is, obviously, to collect delegates in as many states as he can, and he will need to reach a 15% threshold in order to collect any delegates. prior to some of these other candidates getting out of the race, there were some questions about whether he could reach that delegate threshold in a state like california. things are certainly looking much better for him in terms of reaching that 15% viability in a lot more places.
together, we can break decades of political stalemate. we can bridge old divisions, heal old wounds, build new coalitions, forge new solutions, and unlock the extraordinary promise of america's future. the decision is ours to make.
and so you had the advent of these high-cost loans. the idea was, they were supposed to be marketed and sold to people with lower credit scores. but in fact, the majority of subprime loans before the crash went to people with credit scores that would have allowed them to get prime loans. it was just, the limit was what you could get away with selling people. and this mechanism was first test it out in black neighborhoods of existing homeowners. i mean, it's the thing that i actually get the most emotional about in terms of this book and all of these ideas. it's these communities that had just been excluded out of the american dream for so long that finally got their piece of it, and then there was a knock on the door, and brokers came in and said, you could really consolidate your debt. we could get you a better interest rate. and they just lied and they cheated and they swindled — and cascading losses in black and brown neighborhoods that then once the mortgage market saw how much money was being made and how much the government was not going to stop them — and in fact, the federal government took actions only to make it easier for lenders to avoid consumer protections in the early 2000s — then the wheels were off. and then it was a open season on the wider and whiter mortgage market.
partisan investigations such as these should not be treated as legitimate exercises of congressional oversight. no one should participate in these taxpayer-funded witch hunts because the final report by special counsel robert mueller will put to rest many of the questions that democrats and their associates in the mainstream media have been hyperventilating over for two years – and its answers will not fit with their false narrative.
but both mccarthy and scalise tried wednesday to redirect the ryan news away from them, downplaying questions about their futures and refusing to state explicitly their plans.
that's not a plan. it's a plan to come up with a plan that won't work because the white house can't just order hospitals not to bill people. again, that's why lawmaking exists.
as americans, we cannot allow this to continue, trump said in an oct. 26, 2017, white house speech. it is time to liberate our communities from this scourge of drug addiction. never been this way. we can be the generation that ends the opioid epidemic.

ian millhiser, thinkprogress: as a general rule, the justice department has a duty to defend any federal statute challenged in court, regardless of whether the incumbent administration agrees with that statute. the justice department will disregard this duty in rare cases, such as when no reasonable arguments can be made in favor of a law. but, in this case, no reasonable argument can be made in favor of u.s. district judge reed o'connor's position.

dionne: i think that the voters disagree with david, that the - if you look at all of the polling, the top - of the top three issues, health care and economics rank one, two or two, one in where - where the voters come from. i think trump's cultural message appeals to a minority of the electorate which he is trying to mobilize. and i think national unity does not come simply from defending pluralism, which, by the way, democrats do.
voters seem to be in a mood for outsiders, and it's hard for dynasty candidates to claim that mantle. some iowans express weariness with candidates whose family foibles have become all too familiar.

3.) before he became president, obama told pastor rick warren, i believe that marriage is the union between a man and a woman.
part of mcconnell's strategy in trying to get to 50 votes is an effort to line up support from the many republicans who come from states where medicaid is expanded and want to see a softer blow against obamacare than cruz. the republican leader's proposal for a three-year wind-down of the expansion last week — many of them are pushing for seven — reflects this.
a third potentially problematic element of the original house bill would allow insurers to charge older adults five times more in premiums than younger adults — up from a ratio of 3 to 1 under the affordable care act. that provision could be viewed as not directly affecting federal spending, some analysts predict.
trump campaign blasts media for 'massively dishonest' claim potus called coronavirus a 'hoax'
question: a couple things if i could. later this week, in his executive actions, does the president plan to take action to green light the keystone xl and dakota access pipelines? and on tpp, joe mccain says it was a serious mistake to do what the president did for america's economy and for our strategic position in the asia- pacific. why was tpp the right thing to do?
question: and also, there has been (inaudible) ...community. my question is around the last two days i have gone to a number of balls - nation balls (ph) including the nation and india (ph) american ball (ph). and most of those people were supporting president modi's (ph) actions and also creating (ph). but most important, across the street from u.s.-india business council, most gain again (ph), he represents 500 fortune companies to and from india.
schumer's need to keep every member of his party in line on major votes may give extra power to conservative democrats such as joe manchin of west virginia, who might be able to win concessions on initiatives they consider too liberal.
kodjak: well, our poll shows that people think their care hasn't much changed in the last few years. the majority of them say that the law hasn't really affected them directly. they believe that it helps a lot of people. they hear that more people have insurance, but they say that it doesn't really help them specifically.
the muslim ban is something that in some form has morphed into some extreme vetting for certain areas of the world, trump said.
so even if kennedy was replaced with someone more like gorsuch, we do not know if there would be five votes for a broader religious-liberty claim than the limited one accepted in masterpiece.
the cato institute hosts a discussion on needle exchange programs.
on your point about the democrats, yes, they are holding up the bill. they're not allowing debate, but in the reality that if there were a debate, this bill still wouldn't pass and, again, when i say this bill, it's funding the department of homeland security but also stopping the president for his executive action on immigration.
overall enrollment was surprisingly resilient despite the trump administration's rollbacks of advertising for the marketplaces. the report shows that almost 11.8 million americans chose aca health plans for this year — just a half-million fewer than for 2017 and about 900,00 fewer than in 2016, amy notes. but there are several reasons why state-run marketplaces tended to fare better than the federal ones: some of them extended enrollment beyond the federal six-week sign-up season and some states chose to run robust advertising programs.
for ohio voters, i'd like to see him lay out a plan, said steve howard, 61, a retired police officer from columbus. plus, he said, despite the khan comments and the rhetoric about keeping out radical islamic terrorists, trump seems tolerant of all people.
the kaiser analysis also shows that so far, marketplace premiums are rising faster for 2017 then they have in years past.
as a result of ... what everybody would agree is a fair level of dysfunction in the legislative process, the executive branch has had to decide how it's going to use executive power in order to try to protect and advance the country's interests, verrilli said. that's created conflict.
the measure's modest sum for opioids, to be spent over two years and allocated by congressional appropriators, is nonetheless congress's largest investment yet toward fighting opioid addiction and overdose, a problem now so massive that it claims the lives of more americans every year than car accidents.
meanwhile, abbvie laid out $2.68 million during this year's first three months, astrazeneca spent $1.06 million, bristol-myers paid $1.2 million, j&j shelled out $1.46 million, merck ran through $2.76 million, pfizer disbursed $4.2 million and sanofi, $1.67 million.
i actually want to start with kayla mueller, the u.s. aid worker whose fate is unknown, and diane foley, who is the mother of one of the man who was beheaded, one of them, said this, kayla, along with our son and others were held for nearly two years and there were many opportunities along the way, several times when the captors reached out, several times when returning hostages brought sensitive information. and yet nothing was done to save our young americans.
benjamin: it sounds to me that there's a communication lack there, where either he doesn't understand his course of care or they've not explained a course of care for him. yeah, it can be very frustrating if you don't really understand what the end goal is for your care.
the party needs to do something, holler said. it's not entirely their fault, [but] they have no answer to it. the left is sort of extraordinarily motivated, and the republican base is demoralized.
– on trump's new tariffs – 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports – sanders, who campaigned on protectionist policies like trump, said: do we need radical changes in our trade policy to rebuild american manufacturing and protect the american worker? absolutely, positively. that's exactly what i campaigned on. do i think that trump's approach of just putting tariffs on steel and aluminum, is gonna solve the problem? the answer is no, it is not. we need a more comprehensive approach.
donald trump's deregulation presidency has been an aggressive assault on the protections americans need in order to live healthier lives. he may have gotten a boost last week with the sudden resignation of his food and drug administration commissioner scott gottlieb — a conservative but serious-minded reformer who was willing to embrace regulations on vaping and tobacco companies and to publicly call out the pricing tricks of pharmaceutical companies.
question: were those conversations about anything else other than setting up that discussion? and why has that discussion not yet happened between the president and president putin?
when huffpost reached baker by phone, he made it clear that he thinks a medicare buy-in approach makes more sense financially and pragmatically from a health care perspective. he also said it was reasonable that single-payer supporters may want a more forceful advocate of medicare for all.
schilling: no, my father was -- i grew up an army brat and i grew very lower middle class and i was fortunate enough to have a father who taught me the pride in ownership and what it feels like to work for something and i played sports. i was always about the winners and losers.
gergen: but that suggests it's going to be a much lower turnout overall.
but harris didn't buy it. if you have a pre-existing condition, heart disease, diabetes, breast cancer, they're coming for you, she said during the debate.
the good folks over at realclearpolitics (rcp) also keep track of this number in their poll of polls. as of now, the rcp average is that 39 percent see us on the right track, while 54 percent say the wrong track. that's a 15 point spread.
almost a third of all counties in the united states have just one insurer in the marketplace for people buying individual coverage for 2017. in 2015, just 7 percent had one insurer, according to a kaiser family foundation analysis. twenty percent of obamacare consumers will choose 2017 plans in counties served by a single insurer, according to the government.
and iowa voters care a lot about health care. forty-five percent of iowa caucus-goers say it is their no. 1 concern, according to the monmouth poll released this week. that's down from 56 percent in august but still ranks above any other single issue – including beating president trump and climate change.
trump said in michigan that hillary clinton had a small gathering of about 400 people at her final michigan rally of the 2016 election.
blindsided by the latest collapse of a republican health care bill, president trump took to twitter to voice his frustration. trump complained of being let down by a handful of republican lawmakers. and he insisted that the fight over the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, is not over.

some southern states, including georgia and south carolina, are among the first in the country to ease restrictions to try get back to business despite factors that make the south particularly vulnerable to the coronavirus pandemic.
we believe this path could get majority support in congress and show the american people that members understand their distress, they wrote. congressional republicans are right to worry about obamacare's problems. they would be wise to consider this plan as the true solution to the problems facing america under obamacare.
i think the important thing is that people have a choice in their selection of a plan, added sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif.)
they know first lady clinton. they know secretary clinton. she is not a new person. but you can change campaign styles, campaign tactics, and the things that you do on the ground. and, again, as has been one of the themes of this campaign, i think experience does matter. and you learn from the things that have happened in the past, and see what others have done. secretary clinton knows how to do that.
over the weekend, the sanders campaign also launched a second digital ad featuring ocasio-cortez. we're building the largest grassroots movement of working class iowans our state has ever seen, said sander's iowa field director michael fasullo in a statement. with these new offices, we're expanding our reach across the state and giving our supporters the tools they need to bring new folks into the political process and win the caucus in february.
this isn't an argument to hold members of congress to a lower standard, mcgann wrote. we should scrutinize their ideas and their plans and question whether they should represent us.
michigan, ohio, louisiana and oregon are the latest states to announce stay-at-home orders. massachusetts also ordered nonessential businesses to close, and virginia's governor said schools would be closed for the remainder of the academic year.

if we repeal it as donald has proposed and start over again, all of those benefits i just mentioned are lost to everybody, she said.
republican sen. bob corker's departure has left tennessee open to democratic takeover. rep. marsha blackburn, the republican candidate, is facing a challenge from former gov. phil bredesen, a popular moderate democrat. bredesen is ahead of blackburn in early polling.
that's exactly right. this idea that racism has a cost for everyone animated a massive public opinion and political messaging project that ian haney lópez, who was my law professor at berkeley, and anat shenker-osorio, who's a linguist and political message strategist, led to try to square the circle of the divide in progressive messaging. so you have the race left, which is talking about racial disparities and racial injustice, and which definitely galvanizes many people of color, though not all, and many white people who've made it part of their identity to be anti-racist, and then you have the class left that often says, you know what, that's divisive. let's talk about economic populism, and let's talk about the plutocrats and the 99 percent. there's no difference among the 99 percent. it's the 1 percent versus everybody else. and what we found was that given how overwhelmingly powerful the megaphone is for the zero-sum scapegoating story, it wasn't effective even with persuadable, slightly progressive voters, to ignore that zero-sum story and just say, hey, no, it's about the 1 percent and the 99 percent. ignore those divides. ignore the stereotypes that are deeply ingrained in your brain about immigrants and poor black people. ignore what donald trump is saying and what fox news is saying and what your neighbor is saying. you have to actually give people a new way to think about that dominant narrative, because it's not like they can ignore the dominant narrative.
on jan. 2, 2019, the senate confirmed james w. carroll jr. to be trump's first permanent drug czar. a former washington-based counsel to the ford motor co., carroll had served as trump's deputy chief of staff. it had been two years since trump took office.
spicer: ...well again, he's been - this is his first working day. i think it's been pretty busy and robust not just today but in the 2 1/2 other days that we had. and i think you're going to see a lot more come - come out but, you know, there's a lot of things that have to get done and a lot of things that we're working on as a staff to get him prepared. he's going to continue to have very, very robust weeks.

romney said that while pundits have been pushing him to simply admit his decision to sign the massachusetts law was a boneheaded mistake, he would not do so. that's because, he said, it wouldn't be honest.
one whose name may already be familiar is randy bryce, an ironworker who grew up in milwaukee and now lives in the congressional district of paul ryan, the speaker of the house. bryce had been running a long-shot campaign against ryan this year until the speaker decided to retire. now bryce, known as ironstache for his facial hair and social media handle, has at least a chance to go to washington.
this entire tax return debate is somewhat confounding to me, in the following sense: i don't think that it creates one job, gets one more individual who does not have health insurance covered by health insurance, particularly under the disaster that has been obamacare with these private insurers pulling out our exchanges now and reporting billions of dollars of losses, she told cnn.
more than 100 utility companies have lowered prices as a direct result of our business tax cuts, saving americans three billion dollars on their utility bills, said trump.
the lens widens to take in the struggles of the upper midwest, the hollowing out of small-town america and the complicated ways in which working people sometimes work against their own best interests.
in april 2015, most democrats saw former secretary of state hillary clinton as the party's inevitable 2016 nominee. president obama was urging vice president joe biden not to mount a bid, and many other prominent democrats, including massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, decided not to run either.
unite the country spent heavily in iowa (approx. $5 million) and new hampshire (where the group spent roughly $900,000 to run ads) on behalf of biden.
the portland press herald reports that turnout in maine was higher than expected at the polls, with voters driven primarily by the medicaid expansion measure, although the newspaper reports that voters statewide were [also] considering referendums on a casino in york county, a $102 million transportation bond and a constitutional amendment dealing with changes to state employee pensions.

week in politics: midterms, suspicious packages and the migrant caravan
inside the sliding-glass doors of the hotel, others were similarly passionate. kira innis, 30, of los angeles, who claimed to have wanted trump to run for president since she was 13, said the only thing that would force her to question her support would be if trump sanded down his infamously rough edges.
e j dionne, byline: good to be with you.
at the center of the case before the supreme court is the constitutionality of the so-called individual mandate, an original statute of the act that required those who could afford health insurance, but opted out, to pay a fee when they filed taxes. congress passed tax legislation in 2017 that eliminated the unpopular fine, and a federal appeals court determined the mandate was unconstitutional at this time last year. texas and other conservative-led states have since argued that the mandate's unconstitutionality renders the entire aca unconstitutional.
it's a big risk for trump because voters are hungry for health care solutions.
until this year the bill wasn't destined to go anywhere, with president donald trump in office and republicans controlling the senate. it will still be hard for democrats to pass partisan legislation this congress, with only 50 democratic senators and vice president harris serving as the tiebreaker.
verma, who addressed reporters in a conference call monday, insisted that the new rules would not hurt people with pre-existing conditions. in so doing, she echoed claims that trump and countless republican candidates for federal and state office have made with increasing insistence over the past few weeks, as their longstanding support for repealing the affordable care act has become a clear, possibly fatal political liability.

and so what the work that the landing teams have been doing is going into these agencies and departments and talking about way that we can create greater efficiencies, eliminate duplicity and find - maximize the tax dollar. so it's more a question instead (ph) of (ph) just cutting, it's about how do we spend and respect the american tax payer dollar more than - more - more going forward.
democrats had just passed a law spending unprecedented amounts of government money to help americans going through an equally unprecedented crisis. republicans almostly unanimously opposed the legislation, but opinion surveys showed a strong majority of the public had favorable views of the plan.

at various points, the biggest threat to democratic unity was the desire among some members to fight for bipartisanship. many rank-and-file members sought to hold onto the idea that there was a middle ground, potentially willing to reshape the ultimate direction of the bill. biden himself had made clear before he took office that, as a 36-year veteran of the senate, he would seek bipartisan consensus.

but the justice department changed the shape of the health care debate and allowed democrats off the defensive. they again stressed the mantra that trump is bent on ripping health care away from americans.
the law's protections for people with preexisting conditions would no longer be in effect, less-visible reforms covering everything from billing fraud to food calorie postings would vanish, and the entire health care system could plunge into chaos.

it was a far cry from the government-run insurance plan that harry truman once championed, but democratic leaders embraced it as the best they could get ― and so did obama, who repeated in our interview his belief that something like a government-run, single-payer system would probably work best, but creating one right away would be too difficult.

overall, i think the question a lot of our viewers at home are going to have is how long is that going to take? when is that going to take place? when can i see that in my community and this president was not getting into those kinds of details. as we saw during this press conference, this was the take-no-responsibility president.

the trump administration introduced a proposed rule wednesday that includes provisions aimed at addressing one of insurers' complaints about obamacare -- the special enrollment periods that allow people to sign up for health coverage outside of the open enrollment period. insurers have complained that people wait until they are sick to sign up for health coverage, and the proposed rule would require people to supply documentation that they are eligible to enroll.

payment for such discussions was initially included in the affordable care act, but removed because of the controversy over so-called death panels. medicare ultimately changed its policy, independently of obamacare, to allow reimbursement for the end-of-life planning sessions.
eliminating the aca would end medical insurance for more than 20 million americans. it would also end widely popular provisions of the law, such as extending parents' coverage to children up to the age of 26 and prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions.
finney: i think, in part, the economy, just writ large, sort of the economic vision. you know, biden had his line in there - it was referring to health care - about bernie is a socialist, trusting corporations. and i'll be honest. i think when we talk about the understanding of things like systemic racism, obviously, we didn't hear enough about - we didn't hear anything about women and choice. but - so those are some of the issues where i don't - i think we could have heard more, frankly. and i think we heard some differences, mostly in people's adeptness at being able to talk about the nuances.

trump is once again trapped in the unique new york city culture wars of the 1980s and '90s, when he first tried his hand at right-wing demagoguery. in 1989, trump took out a full-page ad in new york city newspapers calling for the state to revive the death penalty to punish the central park five ― a group of black and latino teenagers accused of raping a woman in manhattan. when the young men were exonerated by dna evidence decades later, trump declined to apologize for whipping up public sentiment against them.
schilling: yes, it fluctuates. you lose -- if you don't vote, you lose your ballot and there's rules.
because of the intricate procedures that govern budget legislation and the inherent complexity of health care, republicans appear unlikely to undo the health law as quickly as they had hoped. mr. trump said congress must tackle the affordable care act before it can overhaul the tax code, also a high priority for republicans. and those delays could slow work on other priorities like a trillion-dollar infrastructure push.

at the same time, my administration has answered the pleas of the american people for immigration enforcement and border security. by finally enforcing our immigration laws, we will raise wages, help the unemployed, save billions of dollars, and make our communities safer for everyone. we want all americans to succeed — but that can't happen in an environment of lawless chaos. we must restore integrity and the rule of law to our borders.

no one was sure whether the president had himself been involved in the decision, johnson writes. some said it was a snub to britain. some said it was a symbol of the part-kenyan president's ancestral dislike of the british empire — of which churchill had been such a fervent defender.

the ballot measures come a year after maine's residents gave the thumbs up to expansion by a 59% to 41% margin in a first-of-its-kind referendum. however, it has yet to go into effect there as republican governor paul lepage continues to resist implementing it. the maine supreme judicial court last week ordered the governor to submit an expansion plan to the federal government.
john mcdonough: last fall and january of this year, they demonstrated quite convincingly that they could frame a budget reconciliation bill, get it through the house, get it through the senate, get it to the president's desk, which they did. president obama vetoed it. president trump would sign that bill.
we have begun to drain the swamp of government corruption by imposing a five-year ban on lobbying by executive branch officials — and a lifetime ban on becoming lobbyists for a foreign government.
as dan balz explained this morning: there is no benign explanation.… it is either a deliberate attempt to undermine faith in the democratic process, an exhortation to those who favor new restrictions on access to the ballot box or the worrisome trait of someone with immense power willing to make wild statements without any credible evidence. by repeating as president what he had said as a candidate, for whatever purpose, trump is now striking at the foundation of a democratic society. this is yet another example of trump being willing to cast doubt on information, individuals or institutions that he believes threaten his legitimacy, challenge his authority or question his actions.... this is not a debate about the size of the crowd at last week's presidential inauguration. that is a piddling controversy compared to his claim that the election system overseen by the states is somehow riddled with fraud. trump prefers his own reality, even if that damages the very system of government atop which he now sits.
this is all things considered from npr news. i'm robert siegel.
still, it's a response, which is more than james has offered. it is one more reason to treat his promises on health care, like those from so many other republicans, with extreme skepticism.
last week, some conservative outside groups, including the senate conservatives fund and freedomworks, called on mcconnell and other leaders in the senate to step aside.
democratic activists want someone who is going to attack and fight the republicans at every turn. that will work great in a democratic district — it may work to attract support and money and win praise from the base. but in marginal districts, particularly places that have voted republican for years (like alabama, for instance), that will squander an otherwise winnable district or state.
those numbers explain why house democrats ran hundreds upon hundreds of tv ads during the 2018 midterm elections making the case that republicans, if they had their way, would have eliminated obamacare altogether. republicans will do absolutely anything to divert attention away from their votes to take away americans' health care, then house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-california) said in the days leading up to the midterms. and, following democrats' takeover of the house in 2018, pelosi was just as clear; health care was on the ballot, and health care won, she said.
u.s. public opinion of the law was mostly negative from its passage in march 2010 until trump became president and sought to repeal it, according to tracking surveys by the kaiser family foundation. the threat of elimination – which failed when the late senator john mccain of arizona gave a memorable thumbs down in an early morning vote -- put a spotlight on popular provisions of the law, notably its prohibition on insurers charging sick people more for coverage and its list of essential health benefits, like hospitalization and maternity care, that must be covered. kaiser's tracking survey found in october that 55% of americans viewed the law favorably, while 37% viewed it unfavorably.
spicer: well, i think - yeah, what the - what those people should know is that the president's laid out a list of priorities and the priorities are focused on making sure that people who can do harm or have done harm and have a criminal record are the focus. and as he said throughout the campaign, we've got a series of individuals who we've got to figure out. people who've overstayed their visas, people who have committed crime, and we're going to go through that in a very systematic and methodical way.
actually, the system will work just fine — as it is supposed to under the constitution — if a democratic majority takes its oversight responsibilities seriously, in contrast to the gop-controlled house, which hasn't lifted a finger to stop president trump's conflicts of interest or his unconstitutional receipt of foreign emoluments, nor to demand that he disclose his tax returns (which every modern president has done). house republicans have not issued a single subpoena to investigate a plethora of financial concerns involving environmental protection agency administrator scott pruitt, and they have not called on secretaries of treasury, interior or housing and urban development to testify under oath about their abuses of taxpayer funds.
in addition, newsom's new budget proposes increasing the size of the subsidies for families who already receive it, and it would make california the first state to make subsidies available to middle income families, his office said.
as he's risen in national polls the past couple of weeks and as onetime-unrivaled front-runner biden has slipped – bloomberg's come under increased fire from his rivals as well as president trump's re-campaign over past controversial comments in support of the stop-and-frisk policing he once oversaw during his tenure as new york city mayor. and, he's also taken hits as more and more past remarks deemed sexist have been unearthed.

harris didn't answer pence's question. harris and biden say they want to build on obamacare by adding a public health insurance option and lowering the medicaid eligibility age to 60 from 65.
but at the same time, it's very unpredictable. they've said that here in notaway (ph) valley, in springfield -- greenfield, rather, they correctly predicted, correctly voted for the winner of the iowa caucuses going back to 1996. precinct chair says, though, tonight completely unpredictable. he doesn't have a real sense of who's going to come away a winner tonight.
dean heller ( nev. ) heller has said he'd concerned republicans' overhaul would pull the rug out on some of nevada's most vulnerable people, like medicaid recipients: i cannot support a piece of legislation that takes away the insurance from tens of thousands of nevadans. but he said monday he'd vote for a procedural vote to debate various health-care options. read more »

00:54 - source: cnn trump hints at new security measures
in 2014, obama announced a prisoner swap in which army sgt. bowe bergdahl was brought home from afghanistan in exchange for five taliban commanders who had been held at the u.s. facility at guantanamo bay, cuba. congress had passed a law requiring the president to notify it 30 days before the release of any guantanamo detainee, but obama insisted he had a higher duty to protect american lives and u.s. soldiers.
to make this long story longer, that was 1989. so fast forward to 2007. there's rumors that he's going to run for president. so i'm taking the amtrak, and i get to 30th street station and i go up the escalator. and i'm like, i think, just to myself, i'm like, i think that's joe biden over there. and there's a guy just holding the newspaper. he's holding it up. and i said, excuse me, mr. president. and he folds the newspaper down, and he looks at me. he looks me in the eye, and he goes, american university.
spicer: but that's right, but again i didn't say in person. both in person and around the globe, to witness it.
spicer: oh, i think i said it, because i think the multi -- when you enter into these multinational agreements, you're allowing any country, no matter the size -- any one of those 12, including us, to basically have the same stature as the united states in the agreement. so we're basically on par with some very small companies who are getting access to an amazing market, the united states. and in return, we're negotiating at the lowest common denominator. and i think that when you look at big multinational agreements -- multilateral agreements -- they're not always in the best interest of the united states.
bash: ok, senator, we're going to take a quick break.
finally, i have kept my promise to appoint a justice to the united states supreme court — from my list of 20 judges — who will defend our constitution. i am honored to have maureen scalia with us in the gallery tonight. her late, great husband, antonin scalia, will forever be a symbol of american justice. to fill his seat, we have chosen judge neil gorsuch, a man of incredible skill, and deep devotion to the law. he was confirmed unanimously to the court of appeals, and i am asking the senate to swiftly approve his nomination.
he added that border crossings are currently the lowest they've been since 1971, and cited studies indicating that immigrants commit fewer crimes than native-born citizens.
question: what is the u.s. strategic interest in moving the embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem?
the company will sell new versions of its humalog junior kwikpen and humalog mix75/25. the medicine will cost $265.20 for a pack of five kwikpens and will be available by mid-april, reuters's manas mishra and michael erman report.
(this is a frozen in time number that dates from 2013, indicating the increase in young adults with insurance before the rest of obamacare kicked in. the number of people without insurance in ages 19-25 has declined significantly since 2010, from 33.9 percent to 14.8 percent in 2018. but much of that improvement stems from other factors related to the law, not the provision that allows young adults to stay on parents' plans. the 2.3 million estimate, as we have noted in the past, is not universally accepted. a 2014 article in the new england journal of medicine calculated a figure of 1 million.)
in addition to the affordable care act, barrett will likely be pressed about roe v. wade, the 1973 supreme court decision that established a woman's right to an abortion.
americans were also able to pig out more cheaply, as size of the u.s. pig herd hit the highest level since the government began keeping track in the late 1980s. the cost of pork fell 7%, mainly because of the cheapest ham prices in several years. shoppers can buy fresh hams for $2 a pound or less in stores now.
in a filing with the u.s. supreme court, the trump administration has reaffirmed its position that the affordable care act in its entirety is illegal because congress eliminated the individual tax penalty for failing to purchase medical insurance.
[18:50:00] but bernie sanders wants to expand that and essentially take apart a system that is not working for people. so, health care is a great example. he says thank god that barack obama got the affordable care act passed. that still leaves 29 (inaudible) people not covered by that health care plan and we're still paying premiums and co-pays that are outrageous.
trump made it clear several months before conway's interview with cnn in april that his returns are under audit and that he wouldn't release them until it is completed.
but it's no wonder why trump and many republicans running for office this year would try to make voters see something that's not there and deceive people about what the gop actually wants to do to the u.s. health care system.
reporters got a barbecue lunch on the bus. i didn't spill any on myself, so 2016 is starting out well. the iowa landscape is bleakly beautiful — snow on farmland under a gray sky.
the new research is preliminary and still in its early stages, but it comes as the trump administration appears to be doubling down on trying to overturn obamacare.
i was forcing myself to stay awake and work on the opinion, ginsburg said.

the wall has never been a popular idea, a fact known to most republicans in congress. a litany of public and private polling shows that over 50 percent of americans oppose building a wall. support is in the high 30s to low 40s. public support for shutting down the government to force construction of a wall is lower.
eisbrenner: you know, i think it's a slight improvement. i don't think it's the answer, though. i really don't. i don't think it's going to help everybody across the board - no. and that's why my belief is keep the government out of health care. the government, really, anything they get involved in, for the most part, in my opinion, they don't do a good job at it. you know, my daughter had to go get an obamacare policy, and it saved her bacon, you know, with some things going on. she got a policy. but then, for every story of my daughter, there's 50 where people went the opposite way. it really screwed them over.
republican gov. rick scott, who is prevented from seeking a third term due to term limits, is challenging democratic sen. bill nelson in one of the country's most contentious races. state and national democrats are concerned about the prospects of victory for nelson, who has been in office since 2001.
hillary had no idea what she believed in, she just wanted to win.
that hasn't been happening, however. the country is so politically polarized that many members of congress are now elected on a promise to resist the kind of compromise that is necessary to build majorities and be an effective check on executive power .
trump's plan also increases the federal budget deficit and the national debt. the plan trump has proposed, which was set out as a one-page proposal without any financial justification to back it up, never stated anything at all about how the federal budget will be impacted nor how the national debt either increases or decreases. according to the analysts from the tax policy center, federal revenue is estimated to decrease by $6.2 trillion over the next ten years. the trump economic team should hope that there will be the 4 percent economic growth they projected that will make up for the federal revenue decrease. but if there is a recession or economic downturn, then trump's proposal will suffer serious consequences.
the case the high court ruled in involves a grand jury subpoena for more than eight years of trump's personal and corporate tax records. vance has disclosed little about what prompted him to request the records. in one court filing last year, however, prosecutors said they were justified in demanding the records because of public reports of possibly extensive and protracted criminal conduct at the trump organization.

pamela brown to biden: why not carve out time to answer tough questions?
these days, the costs of those health-care plans are enormous, and the coverage is excellent – far better than would be available under bernie's nationwide government-run system. union workers are not stupid; they know this would be a loss for them, and they will resist it.
the resolution was introduced into both chambers of congress in february, and is most closely associated with new york freshman congresswoman alexandria ocasio-cortez. in march, the resolution did not advance in the senate, after nearly all democrats voted present.
two candidates, former colorado gov. john hickenlooper and sen. bernie sanders, mentioned time frames in their discussions of climate change that could use some additional context.
here are five of the biggest flashpoints that could make trouble for the bill in the senate.
gingrich: that he was elected by people who believe washington has too much power. the washington bureaucracy is too arrogant and imperial. this was an election that had consequence. it probably rivals the reagan election of '80 and the fdr election of '32 in that sense.
the trouble is that those changes also made coverage more expensive, since insurers are now covering people and services they used to avoid. and although millions benefit from tax credits that offset these higher prices, millions do not. they face prices much higher than they expected or feel they should pay ― and one side effect is that many of these people are electing to go without coverage, upsetting the delicate actuarial balance insurers need to cover their costs.
two years after the affordable care act began requiring most americans to have health insurance, 10.5 million who are eligible to buy coverage through the law's new insurance exchanges were still uninsured this fall, according to the obama administration. that number appears to be shrinking: administration officials said last month that about 2.5 million new customers had bought insurance through healthcare.gov, the federal exchange serving 38 states, since open enrollment began on nov. 1. the number of new enrollees is 29 percent higher than last year at this time, suggesting that the threat of a larger penalty may be motivating more people to get covered. but plenty of healthy holdouts remain, and their resistance helps explain why insurers are worried about the financial viability of the exchanges over time. they say they sorely need more healthy customers to balance out the costs of covering the sicker, older people who have flocked to exchange plans.
columbus, ohio — welcome to the general election, ohio-style. twenty-four hours. two candidates. one state that can deliver the white house.
wow, it seems almost too good to be true, says hickman, who makes about $16,000 a year.
in late october he was pretty upset because he got a letter from his insurer, anthem blue cross and blue shield, saying his policy was going up about $200 a month. even after his subsidy, he thought he'd be paying $500 a month just for his premium. on top of that he spends about $300 a month on medications to control his diabetes.
consumers may not realize until december 15 that there's no one here in the market and may ask the question: 'where were the insurers when consumers needed them?' says huff. that's a potential reputational risk for health insurers.
the cuts proposed today raise serious concerns about how hospitals and health systems can ensure they serve as the safety net for their patients, wrote rick pollack, chief executive of the american hospital association, in a blog post after the budget proposal was released.
u.s. district judge wendy beetlestone, an obama appointee, said the state was likely to suffer serious and irreparable harm if she did not order a preliminary injunction.
we can't be a one-size-fits-all party. i should point out that doug jones did not have a competitive primary, whereas the g.o.p. had exactly the ideological fight we need to avoid in marginal districts. it's the candidates we nominate in the primaries of 2018 that will determine how successful we are.
question: (inaudible) political priorities. what would be the message for the hispanic commune in the u.s. taking into consideration that one of the priorities has been the wall?
i don't believe he would go there again, meghan mccain said in an interview for politico's women rule podcast. i don't think at this point in his administration it would be beneficial to him in any way.
asked whether the white house has a proposal for replacing obamacare in the event the law is struck down in court, a senior white house official told cnn not as of yet. the official pointed to the proposal from sens. lindsey graham of south carolina and bill cassidy of louisiana, the previous obamacare repeal bill which was ultimately unsuccessful.
the chief justice then turned to breyer and kagan, the liberals most likely to work with him on contentious issues, to see if they could find common ground.
likewise, we need a strategy, connolly said. any idea when a strategy will be submitted to the congress?
but how do you get at least 50 votes in the senate, especially after efforts to repeal and replace obamacare failed to garner the support of all republican senators?
it's a head-scratching political move. during an election year that's shaping up to be a disaster for the republican party, its national leader and prominent officials around the country are taking a strong stand against enabling sick people to go to the doctor.
simply declaring in an executive order that people with preexisting conditions should be able to buy health insurance if the high court knocks down the aca is entirely meaningless. if it were that simple, some other president would have done it already and become extremely popular. more than that, no president can just order an entire industry to not do something. that's why there's a congress that passes laws.
a little more than a week before his inauguration, trump declared at a wild press conference in new york that russia, china, japan, mexico, all countries will respect us far more, far more than they do under past administrations.

we have an election coming up in november, the midterms so i'm not really sure you're going to see a lot of productivity from the congress anyway, but you know lame duck speakers, that's an additional challenge to the conference, womack said.
here tonight is debra bissell. just three weeks ago, debra's parents, gerald and sharon, were burglarized and shot to death in their reno, nevada, home by an illegal alien. they were in their eighties and are survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren. also here tonight are gerald and sharon's granddaughter, heather, and great‑granddaughter, madison.
there is nothing on the table to mitigate the vast harm that ruling would create, despite assertions from trump like this: if we win, we will have a better and less expensive plan that will always protect individuals with preexisting conditions.
wacky jacky, trump said at the nevada gop convention, in reference to rep. jacky rosen. you don't want her as your senator.
the defendant in the case is the u.s. government, because the affordable care act is a federal law. customarily, the justice department would file a brief arguing why the states are wrong, since it is part of the executive branch and defending federal statutes in court is part of the executive's constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.
-- conservative radio host hugh hewitt thinks trump is on constitutional thin ice and could face impeachment if democrats retake the house of representatives in 2018. president trump has to be aware of the constitutional thin ice on which he skates, he told katie couric in a yahoo news interview, referring to ethics concerns over the handling of trump's vast business network. i think it would occur after midterms and only if the house flips to the democrats. so the potential is there, yes. ... if you abuse power, if you do anything — you don't have a lot of goodwill in the reservoir.

united will be looking at what their prospects are in california, lee said.
as altman writes: they were especially upset by surprise bills for services they believed were covered. they said their coverage was hopelessly complex. if they had their way, altman says, their insurance would become much more understandable.
no issue better illustrates the divide between america's working class and america's political class than illegal immigration. wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards.
we know that there are millions more who are eligible for coverage but haven't gotten it yet, obama said.
in the run-up to the trump candidacy of 2016, gabriel sherman reported in new york magazine that an employee of mr. trump, sam nunberg — who was later fired for racially charged facebook posts under his name — measured the base's pulse.
ouch: the controversy surrounding a failed measure in virginia that sought to loosen restrictions on late-term abortions has reawakened a fierce debate, and partly disrupted plans by abortion-rights advocates to push initiatives and make it a defining issue heading into the 2020 elections, our post colleagues annie linskey and ariana eunjung cha report.
they are equating me and something they think i've done or said with guys who willingly did -- lance armstrong, in a sense destroyed other people's lives to preserve their legacy. we're on the same moral turf somehow.
the administration cut in half the amount of time people have to enroll in plans. and the department of health and human services dramatically reduced funding used to make people aware of the enrollment period and to offer in-person assistance to enrollees.
mcsally does have a history of supporting protections for daca recipients, something that she has tried to hide this election, but the mainstream definition of amnesty requires a pathway to permanent legal residence, something that the daca program does not do.
but then, somewhere along the line, the likelihood of an individual becoming a public charge is hardly ever even considered anymore in the immigration process, hauman continued.
i'm serious. i'm serious. i'm serious. don't make me laugh. the answer is yes, i do see the possibility of uniting us so that we can win.
in comparison, the american health care act (ahca) pending in the house drives up the cost of individual insurance by an estimated 15% to 20% next year, according to the non-partisan congressional budget office, and higher for older and rural americans, to levels that can reach half of their income or more. about 24 million americans would become uninsured over the next decade, including 7 million who get insurance through their employers. medicaid funding would be cut by 25%, with hard caps put in place by the federal government. that would effectively ration care for millions of low- and moderate-income americans, from needy children to seniors in long-term care facilities.
their protests and efforts to make this into a huge deal is as likely to contribute to fear in the immigrant community as anything else, vaughan said. then, too, she said, the decline in food stamp enrollment could also be attributed to eligible family members leaving to be with loved ones who were deported.
kodjak: that's because the parts of the law that can be repealed in a budget bill are the ones that make the health insurance market function, says karen pollitz, a senior fellow at the kaiser family foundation.

uh, yeah, say longtime republican critics of trump. what took so long, asks former republican national committee official douglas heye in a cnn op-ed, when all of this was so predictable? trump has incited violence and sown division since he declared his candidacy in 2015.
he falsely said that people with pre-existing medical conditions will have better coverage than under obamacare.
many found themselves asking wednesday: where are the police and military?
in recent decades, however, presidents of both parties have aggrandized their power and usurped congress to legislate from 1600 pennsylvania avenue. for example, presidents ronald reagan and george h. w. bush abused their prosecutorial discretion authority to provide executive legalization to tens of thousands of unlawful immigrants. executive overreach has accelerated at an alarming rate under the obama administration. obama has failed on numerous occasions to enforce acts of congress that he disagrees with for policy reasons and has also stretched his authority to put in place policies congress has refused to enact. he has delayed the obamacare employer mandate unilaterally, essentially stopped the enforcement of our immigration laws, provided quasi-legal status to unlawful immigrants, and released terrorists from guantanamo bay without notifying congress as required by law, just to name a few examples.
there is no way you could lay this at the feet of the president of the united states, said mick mulvaney, the director of the office of management and budget, in a press conference friday morning.
a 2017 report by the united nations children's fund, or unicef, did note that the united states is above average when it comes to the relative child poverty rate — which shows the proportion of each nation's children living in a household where disposable income is less than 60% of the national median.
we do meet a few republicans. one is eric o'keefe of the wisconsin club for growth, who has been involved in the republican revolution of the past 10 years and makes a case for lower taxes and paring back the power of public employees. another is dale schultz, who represented a rural southwestern wisconsin district in the state senate for decades but bailed out after resisting walker.
what trump said: democrats' open borders policies are harming and killing innocent lives, trump said, citing a phoenix case where an illegal alien chased a man through a parking lot and shot him in cold blood, and then walked over to the victim and shot him four more times right in the face as he lay dying in the street. trump said the shooter had previously been deported after serving six years in prison.
former trump administration officials said the white house did not trust the career staffers at the office. one former official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations, said the president and his aides wanted to transcend the drug czar and raise the issue to a higher level.
-- senate finance committee chairman chuck grassley (r-iowa) said he's looking into whether he could obtain trump's tax returns. from bloomberg news's laura davison and kaustuv basu: grassley said he's planning to meet with nonpartisan congressional tax advisers to learn more about the process. … still, the iowa republican cautioned that he hasn't yet made a decision about whether he would ask treasury to release the documents. 'don't interpret this as looking into it, but i'm going to have a briefing by joint tax on what all of this involves before i answer any questions,' grassley told reporters on wednesday, referring to the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation.
people were led to expect an immediate and overwhelming impact of that legislation, and that as the recovery dragged on with year after year of very slow employment growth, the popularity of the bill just plummeted, said michael steel, a republican operative who worked as a spokesperson for then-house minority leader john boehner at the time.
plus, the cost of the provision is flying under the radar amid the broader debate in congress over the $1.9 trillion relief package.
question: what would be the relation between this administration and the hispanic community in the u.s.?
the scheme promoted by the administration and embodied in the tennessee waiver proposal would threaten beneficiary access to care in many ways, including all but ensuring medicaid dollars are diverted by purposes not allowed under federal law, pallone and wyden wrote. we strongly encourage you to exercise vigorous oversight of this and other medicaid waiver requests that if approved would provide states vast sums of federal dollars with no accountability.
the republicans are all but certain to nominate as their candidate the incumbent, trump, who is deeply unpopular nationally and loathed by democratic voters. just as trump benefited from antipathy by some toward hillary clinton in 2016, trump's eventual opponent will certainly benefit from trump's unpopularity. what's more, trump will probably again dominate much of the news coverage before the election — but this time, much will be focused on his administration, which is unlikely to appeal to many democrats or independents.
trump singled out one person killed by one immigrant. but in fact, many more americans are killed by people born in the u.s.
the tuition coverage also fell in line with starbucks' history of offering generous health insurance and other benefits to its baristas — a move that helped them attract and retain talent. but by 2014, when the company announced the program, obamacare had made access to health insurance more of a norm for a wider swath of workers. the asu program helped to keep starbucks at the top of the heap when it came to benefits packages, the company's then-ceo howard schultz told the atlantic in 2015.
so, let's go back to 2012 to say what are we going to look for. see all this gold? this is when rick santorum, remember how late that night was, iowa 2012. rick santorum won very late because like mike huckabee in 2008, that green is mike huckabee, in 2012, rick santorum won almost all the small rural counties. that's where you find your evangelicals, your social conservatives, to a degree, the tea party voters.
a republican congressman explained the reason for the gridlock to a post reporter:
i also want you to look at the calendar to -- so people understand how close we are to the deadline for that happening. it's february 27. here we are, just a little more than two weeks away, and we should note that, by the way, congress is out of town. they're not working for one of those weeks, so it makes it incredibly difficult.
washington ― it's supposed to be the first congressional hearing ever on medicare for all ― a huge win for single-payer advocates and progressives in congress. but next week, when the house rules committee holds that landmark hearing on the expansive health care legislation, medicare for all advocates may actually be getting screwed.
one federal employee explained how the shutdown is forcing her to continue paying for day care she can't access:
his guarantee that the mexican government would foot the bill, which could, according a reuters report out thursday, cost more than $20 billion, had been one of the pitch's key selling point. but their president, under pressure at home, has balked and dismissed it out of hand. when the white house floated a 20% tariff on mexican imports to cover the upfront costs, there was a rare bipartisan meltdown and the trial balloon was quickly deflated.
as to whether employers are cutting jobs because of obamacare, it's nearly impossible to determine from labor department data since the economy is recovering and adding jobs. the number of people who can only find part-time jobs has declined in recent years, signifying companies are hiring more full-time workers.
sen. cory booker (d-n.j.) has rejected donations from top pharmaceutical company executives and corporate board chairs since 2017, though his campaign did not immediately say whether he would do the same for health insurance companies.
a pelosi spokesman, henry connelly, also said in a statement that the rules committee had free rein to choose whichever witnesses they wanted to articulate the strongest case for medicare for all.
she and others seemed unimpressed with brat's recitation of his grass-roots credentials, which helped him topple house majority leader eric cantor in 2014. cantor was criticized for being aloof and out of touch with his constituents — many of the same accusations now plaguing brat.
at least, trump's supporters said, he didn't bring up his tussle over the weekend with the parents of fallen veteran humayun khan, a muslim, whose father excoriated trump and his immigration proposals at the democratic national convention last week. trump fired back, suggesting khan's mother had remained silent at the convention because she was not allowed to speak and insisting he had sacrificed for his country, despite khan's father's comparison to his family's grief. he kept the attack up on twitter, saying he had been viciously attacked, as veterans around the country expressed dismay.
first, biden will not spare president trump from the charge that he failed as commander in chief, sending troops (health-care workers) into the fray without sufficient protection and equipment. the more trump protests that governors do not need ventilators or that there are plenty of tests, the more fodder he provides to biden that trump is a derelict, incompetent commander in chief.
a small faction of gop conservatives remains ideologically opposed to the bill, saying it doesn't go far enough in undoing the current law.
the main skill biden brought to the obama administration was his ability to schmooze fellow senators — a skill that was largely neglected, as obama was uninterested in negotiating with congress.
working with one specific college allows starbucks to tailor its benefit, including with programs like pathway to admission, to meet the needs of the students participating, who are also working part-time, novoa said. there's a lot of great support that asu provides in terms of guidance counselors and tutors and mentors, she said.
trump will travel to the border for an immigration roundtable and a briefing on border security.
2. trump has made all sorts of dubious claims about the 2010 affordable care act, calling it crazy, a disaster and not working. he has made such claims 80 times.
scalia and the other conservatives were livid at the development. scalia believed the taxing-power possibility had never truly been discussed in court, calling it a fly-by-night briefing. kennedy thought roberts had presented his interpretation as judicial modesty, when it amounted instead to a vast judicial overreaching.

second, republicans seem to have been undone by their reverse-robin-hood urges. you can't make something like obamacare work without giving lower-income families enough support that insurance becomes affordable. but the modern g.o.p. always wants to comfort the comfortable and afflict the afflicted; so the bill ends up throwing away the taxes on the rich that help pay for subsidies, and redirects the subsidies themselves away from those who need them to those who don't.
now let's talk about what trump and his party are doing.
photo by samuel corum/getty images president joe biden speaks from the white house following the passage of the american rescue plan in the senate on march 6. the bill passed the house on wednesday and is expected to be signed by biden on thursday.
today, biden's political skills are obsolete. he promises to unify the country, but that promise is based on casting trump as some kind of nazi sympathizer, and his voters as racists.
meanwhile, voters in new york rejected a measure calling for a constitutional convention on the state's founding document. with most of the state's precincts reporting, the measure was easily defeated.

the landmark legislation, which is an early, major achievement for president joe biden, is intended to stimulate the economy and alleviate enormous and widespread suffering in the wake of the pandemic.
spicer: then, if won, it's oh, well he(ph) -- there is this constant theme to undercut the enormous support that he has. and i think that it's just unbelievably frustrating when you're continually told it's not big enough, it's not good enough, you can't win.
fox news channel will present an encore presentation of the trump town hall at 11 p.m. et.
the affordable care act was a large and complex law, with many provisions that have proved controversial. but the protections for people with pre-existing conditions enjoy widespread public support.
spicer: and it was reflected at the cia. i mean, they came there. they were so excited, there was 1,000 people that applied for 3,000 plus seats. and we ended up taking in 400 people. that doesn't sound like a huge feud. they were excited, they were clapping, they were cheering when he walked in.
-- money has a funny way of bringing people together: the rival campaign managers for clinton and trump are joining forces on the lucrative paid speaking circuit. robby mook and corey lewandowski will make joint appearances for tens of thousands of dollars per speech before trade associations and the like. their speaking agency promises they will be an entertaining pair sure to keep any audience engaged. it's very this town… (buzzfeed's ruby cramer)
it's unclear who decided which experts would testify before the rules committee. staffers on the rules committee say no one in leadership directly told them this person or that person couldn't testify, but sources involved with the planning of the hearing say three criteria were applied to potential witnesses: (1) is this person a leader of a single-payer group? if so, that person could not testify ― meaning gaffney was out. (2) is this person an activist? if so, they couldn't testify. that meant people like dr. sanjeev sriram, who has repeatedly advocated for medicare for all, were ruled out. and (3) has this person said anything negative about the affordable care act?
any sizable change in our complex health care system leaves some people and businesses better or worse off. for some, insurance will become more affordable — or their taxes will be lower. others will lose out on financial support or health care coverage. you can see how you might be affected in our summary of winners and losers.
so i think we will see our representatives in congress saying we still need to do something about this law, and it needs to be something that works and actually brings down costs. and i'm sure some people here are breathing a sigh of relief because the republican replacement could have forced some tough decisions for things like medicaid here in arizona.
but maybe more than anything, mr. trump showed in 2011 how he would deploy conspiracy theories. being a birther was merely a start. he associated with conspiracy purveyors like alex jones, a syndicated radio host. among many examples in the last year, the times wrote in march, mr. trump reposted information on twitter from the website infowars, hosted by mr. jones, to support his unsubstantiated claim that thousands of muslims in new jersey cheered the sept. 11 attacks.
mcconnell sets monday deadline on stimulus deal - bloomberg: senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said he wants the chamber to finish and pass a massive stimulus bill to bolster the economy by monday -- lightning speed for legislation expected to top $1 trillion. mcconnell, senate democratic leader chuck schumer and treasury secretary steven mnuchin arrived at the capitol friday morning for a blitz of bipartisan negotiations, with all sides stressing the need to act fast. 'i've tasked the bipartisan team to reach an agreement by the end of the day today,' mcconnell said at the capitol. getting a deal done friday would give bill drafters saturday to write up the text, with mcconnell planning to start the process for teeing up votes on monday. eric ueland, the white house legislative liaison, also stressed the need for speed. … he noted that mnuchin said he wants congress to complete action on the bill by monday 'to ensure that aid swiftly gets to the american people as well as to provide confidence with the american economy, and american markets.'
our families can no longer afford to support an expensive, unsustainable healthcare system, but for years democrats ignored the warnings that obamacare would increase the deficit. it was clear democrats realized opposition to the healthcare law was growing when they wasted tens of millions of taxpayer dollars last year alone in an attempt to rescue obamacare's plummeting popularity. even still, they refuse to acknowledge the legislation is hurting the very people they claimed to help.
the law set up federal and state-run marketplaces where people who don't have health insurance through their employers or government programs like medicare can buy coverage. despite initial problems with healthcare.gov, the federal program's website, and some state sites, the marketplaces have helped many americans become insured. about 11 million people have bought policies, and the government provides tax credits to 85 percent of them to make the coverage affordable.
the state of the union historically has been a platform for presidents to make bold public health proclamations — many of which haven't come to pass. former president barack obama used his final address in january 2016 to call for an end to cancer, dan writes. the strategy was heavily shaped by [cdc director robert redfield], a prominent aids researcher who was tapped to lead the cdc last year.
and if i do anything with my book, i want people to jettison this narrative that we actually heard from mayor bloomberg — that it was the financial crisis, which cost us so much as a country and as a globe, was the fault of the victims of redlining, was the fault of black and brown people who got in over their heads, who shouldn't have been in those houses in the first place, who were financially illiterate, when in fact, what happened was just a quintessentially american mix of racism and greed that was enabled by structural racism and institutional racism and that then, of course, most direly impacted the finances of black families who have still not recovered. the home ownership rate is back to what it was before the fair housing act. it's just devastating. and yet it also costs millions of american jobs of white people and foreclosures in white neighborhoods as well.
some 31 states plus the district of columbia have already expanded medicaid, which broadens coverage to americans with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level, or about $17,000 for an individual and $35,000 for a family of four. virginia will join the club in 2019, after lawmakers there approved expansion earlier this year.
biden signed an executive order for the department of health and human services to reopen insurance enrollment on healthcare.gov from feb. 15 through may 15, giving a new coverage opportunity to americans who lost their jobs and employer-based insurance during the pandemic. the annual open enrollment for the plans ended in december in most states.

what do you say to that?
the endorsement of the three progressive freshmen congresswomen gave sanders an important boost that contributed to his new hampshire victory.
finney: but i think what's missing in that...
to be sure, it's hard to make a clear comparison between medicaid expansion and growing numbers of uninsured, especially because health care providers have only recently begun loosening restrictions around preventative care checkups and other services that were deemed nonessential during the early weeks of the pandemic.
thursday democratic debate:who were the winners and losers
la campaña de trump no hizo el anuncio antes de la concentración del lunes. no estaba claro qué era lo que protestaba el hombre que causó la interrupción.
he concluded, that's a great question, what did you think of castro? we all thought he was great at first. i was cheering like mad for him when he first came in, and then he became a communist and started shooting every one of his enemies.
a stand for truth spokesman, eric lycan, did not respond to a request for comment monday about when the ad would air or how much money was behind it. the group has pledged to spend $4 million on his behalf.
harris said no other decision would dishonor and disrespect ginsburg's legacy than overturning roe v. wade. harris said striking down the affordable care act could jeopardize health insurance for 20 million people who participate in the program and for 100 million with pre-existing conditions who were assured of coverage under the law.
in rapid city, south dakota, hundreds of trump opponents and supporters also turned out. a larger anti-trump faction stood on a street corner as part of a not my president protest, similar to other demonstrations being held across the country. a group supporting the president lined up on a different corner at the same intersection.
she advocates building on obamacare and pressuring drug companies to lower costs. sanders says obamacare isn't good enough, and that presidents including franklin roosevelt have supported a single-payer system that would dramatically lower costs by cutting out insurance companies and forcing pharmaceutical companies to negotiate prices with the government.
associated press sen. thom tillis's bill allows him to say he stands with trump on obamacare repeal while maintaining his support for the health care law's most popular provisions.
she added that she wants the supreme court to reverse citizens united, to understand that voting rights is still a big country in parts of the country and she wants the high court to respect the roe v. wade ruling.
as the usa reels from the coronavirus pandemic, biden touted his and obama's efforts when they were in office to keep ebola from overwhelming the country.
harris' plan takes a middle-of-road approach, falling short of sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) sweeping plan to completely overhaul the nation's health insurance system, yet offering a bigger transformation to the nation's health care system than the reforms supported by former vice president joe biden.
the losers are nancy pelosi and chuck schumer because now they own obamacare, he explained. this is not our bill. this is their bill.
but the defeat shed light on the hurdles progressives will face in passing a $15 minimum wage legislation and a new path forward is unclear. an unlikely option is to introduce a separate bill and try to get enough senators on board to clear the 60-vote threshold, but democrats are not fully united behind the proposal. an even more difficult option would be to eliminate the filibuster, which would lower the 60-vote threshold, and therefore require fewer votes to pass the minimum wage legislation.
i hope (trump) takes the lead of california in the process, newsom said, a reference to his executive order of a month ago proposing that the state be able to negotiate directly with drug manufacturers on behalf of some 13 million medi-cal beneficiaries, as well as various state agencies that regularly buy drugs.
doctors did an echocardiogram and found that billy was born with a heart defect called tetralogy of fallot with pulmonary atresia. it's hard to explain, said kimmel, but basically the pulmonary valve was completely blocked, and he has a hole in the wall between the left and right sides of his heart.
this, i think, is such an important point. i want to hold on it for a minute, because something i was thinking about reading the book is a little bit subtle here. so if you think about the way a lot of american public policy has changed over the decades you're tracking, basically, it moves from the government does things that you just get, like public college, to you have to pay out of pocket for it. and so that's really a move from something that builds wealth in the future to takes income in the present. and so then, what looks like a fair race to people — i mean, everybody's getting this chance to go to college and get a pell grant — but in fact, as you say here, is reflecting that if you got in when the getting was good, you have the assets to then pay for the thing you need now and just have it then continue to build wealth. and that's where it seems we get into some of this widening wealth gap stuff. and i'd like to talk about the mechanisms of that a little bit, because i think it's really important, wherein if you have family who can pay for your higher education, and so then you go to college and you get a really good job, then you just start rebuilding wealth.
we should have done more to push back, both against his rhetoric and some of the things he did legislatively, one republican senator told the hill on the condition of anonymity.
selena simmons-duffin, byline: hi, mary louise.
government health care will not reduce the cost; it will simply refuse to pay the cost, she posted on her facebook page. and who will suffer the most when they ration care? the sick, the elderly, and the disabled, of course.
question: but not for in person?
polling in iowa, where democrats held their caucuses monday, showed that health care is the no. 1 issue among democratic voters – and polls show that health care is also a major concern for independents and republicans.
would trump be winning without talk radio?
in 2011, mr. trump had a chance to give his media strategy a test run. the new york times article on his farewell from the race suggested that the most noteworthy element of his flirtation as a candidate was a media culture that increasingly seems to give the spotlight to the loudest, most outrageous voices. stuart spencer, a former political strategist for ronald reagan, was quoted as saying, the media made him, the media kept him, the media kept promoting him.
trump called on the senate to change its rules so any bill could be passed with just 51 votes. he neglected to mention that the failed repeal-and-replace measure fell short of that simple majority.
trump barely engaged in the 2017 legislative fight to repeal the affordable care act and replace it with a gop plan that would have kicked tens of millions of americans off their health care. after that failed, he gave up even trying to legislate on health care, and instead, his administration turned its focus to sabotaging the aca's health insurance marketplaces, imposing onerous new requirements on medicaid beneficiaries, promoting the sale of junk health insurance policies that, unlike aca plans, do exclude people with preexisting conditions, and getting the courts to kill the aca for him.
we will not let the infection that president trump has injected into the presidency and into congress, that has paralyzed our politics and pitted americans against each other, spread to the united states supreme court, harris said. this election is about our democracy.
-- even mike huckabee, whose daughter is spicer's principal deputy, gently chastised trump. but he can do so because he's not running for anything. i have no evidence whatsoever, and i don't know that anyone does, that there were that many illegal people who voted, and frankly it doesn't matter, huckabee said in an interview on fox business network. he's the president and whether 20 million people voted, it doesn't matter anymore. he's the president, and i'm not sure why he brought it up.
jim sciutto, cnn national security correspondent: how you doing, anderson? we're at notaway (ph) valley high school. this is the southwestern corner of iowa. it is rural. it is agricultural. corn is king, they say, here.
that was a low point for obama that contributed to a distrust in the executive branch during his presidency, according to polling from gallup. that data is available back to the second term of bill clinton's administration and shows a pattern: clinton, george w. bush and obama all enjoyed general confidence in the executive branch that trump hasn't seen.
4. mailer attacking state sen. kate brophy mcgee's record on tax bill misses the mark.
but the president also tends to exaggerate his record of delivering, sabato said.
he said that as a consultant he was able to claim a change in income that allowed him to buy insurance midyear a couple of years ago, when he got some bad results on a prostate screening.
kelly: joining me now, jonathan turley, constitutional attorney and professor at george washington university. good to see you again, professor.
there is a good healthy skepticism with most people, said cpac's organizer, matt schlapp. conservatives have felt like they've taken the bait before. ... voters get told, 'oh yeah. we will do this.' and then they get into power and sometimes don't do so much because those issues are controversial. the one thing about donald trump is what he's showing conservatives, is that he doesn't seem to care that much if something is controversial. if it is something he said he was going to do, he is a bulldog about getting it done.

even if one factors in all the struggles the health-care law has faced, these are rather extreme statements. the aca cut the uninsured rate by about half (although lately the uninsured rate has been creeping back up) by providing subsidized coverage to millions of americans. it ensured more comprehensive coverage to those with employer-sponsored plans. it allowed states to expand medicaid.
a partial government shutdown now looks inevitable after the senate lacks the votes on a stopgap spending bill late friday night.
washington -- protecting his signature domestic achievement, president barack obama on friday vetoed legislation to repeal his health care law, saying the measure would reverse the significant progress we have made in improving health care in america.
-- as the difficulty of divided government sinks in, the first president in u.s. history with no prior governing or military experience has changed his tune. on dec. 11, trump said he would be proud to shut down the government: if we don't get what we want, one way or the other ... i will shut down the government, he told schumer and pelosi in the oval office. so i will take the mantle. i will be the one to shut it down. i'm not going to blame you for it.
-- from behind his podium, sean spicer defended trump's outrageous lie that up to five million ballots were illegally cast: the president does believe that. he has stated that before, the press secretary said during a tuesday briefing. i think he stated his concerns, voter fraud and people voting illegally, during the campaign. and he continues to maintain that belief based on studies and evidence that people have presented to him. when asked repeatedly to provide evidence, spicer pointed to a pew study that does not support trump's claim.

the year was 2009, and things did not end well for the democratic party. the stimulus legislation grew steadily less popular over time as job growth sputtered. the midterm election a year later would wipe out their massive house majority, and usher in a wave of austerity that further hampered the country's economic comeback.
even so, desantis and florida senate president wilton simpson, r-trilby, last week said they would consider using a portion of the money to replenish the state's unemployment fund in lieu of raising taxes on businesses.
that is why my administration has been working on improved vetting procedures, and we will shortly take new steps to keep our nation safe — and to keep out those who would do us harm.
marlow's attraction to political controversy drew him to the university of california, berkeley, given its role as a hub of left-wing ideology.
the conflation of americanness with whiteness has also determined, at times, who is seen as deserving of help, and who isn't. to create support for the postwar new deal programs that effectively created the white middle class — the gi bill, social security, etc. — legislators baked in the ability to exclude black folks. at the very moment a wide array of public policies were providing most white americans with valuable tools to gain protection in their old age, good jobs, economic security, assets and middle-class status, black americans were mainly left to fend for themselves, writes ira katnelson, a political scientist at columbia.
democrats say they won't make the same mistake again. while its legislative path remains uncertain, the white house is aiming to pass legislation built around biden's build back better plan ― which could make some of the tax credits and health care subsidies included in rescue act permanent, and also include billions in infrastructure spending ― sometime this spring or summer.
it was a difficult undertaking, he said. what they succeeded and what they did has improved the lives and saved the lives of countless, countless people.
through an outreach campaign expected to include advertising and partnerships with local organizations, the administration hopes to enroll people who may not be aware they're eligible for coverage.
former vice president joe biden, who is challenging sanders for the democratic presidential nomination, argues correctly that medicare-for-all is unaffordable.
tax loopholes. prescription drug pricing. financial rules. environmental protection. these companies define policies that are great for their bottom line, while good, honest people who work hard get squeezed harder every year. it's corruption, pure and simple.
and one of the most daunting or stressful roles that self-employed americans have to take on is that of tax planner.

frequently asked questions about the new stimulus package how big are the stimulus payments in the bill, and who is eligible? the stimulus payments would be $1,400 for most recipients. those who are eligible would also receive an identical payment for each of their children. to qualify for the full $1,400, a single person would need an adjusted gross income of $75,000 or below. for heads of household, adjusted gross income would need to be $112,500 or below, and for married couples filing jointly that number would need to be $150,000 or below. to be eligible for a payment, a person must have a social security number. read more. what would the relief bill do about health insurance? buying insurance through the government program known as cobra would temporarily become a lot cheaper. cobra, for the consolidated omnibus budget reconciliation act, generally lets someone who loses a job buy coverage via the former employer. but it's expensive: under normal circumstances, a person may have to pay at least 102 percent of the cost of the premium. under the relief bill, the government would pay the entire cobra premium from april 1 through sept. 30. a person who qualified for new, employer-based health insurance someplace else before sept. 30 would lose eligibility for the no-cost coverage. and someone who left a job voluntarily would not be eligible, either. read more what would the bill change about the child and dependent care tax credit?
i spent a lot of time grappling while thinking about the book with the way in which policies that begin with racist roots get out of control. they slip their reins, and they become broadly applied, hurting a lot of people of all different races, and also in a funny way, non-racist in their modern intent, but still terrible. so you have a discussion in the book of single-family zoning. and single-family zoning is a policy with extraordinarily racist roots, and particularly so in california, where i live. and in san francisco, where i live, single-family zoning has made it unbelievably unaffordable for basically anybody to live here — black people, brown people, but also white people. i know tons of white people who have had to leave or have not been able to raise a family here because of single-family zoning. and one of the stories about this that began to take shape in my head is that there's obviously the case of policies that are directly racialized even now, like medicaid, that the racialization of them ends up draining the pool. a lot of white people benefit from medicaid, but they're voting against it on race grounds. but then there's something like single-family vote zoning where i was talking to somebody doing survey research on this, and they were saying that in fact, single-family zoning is popular among everybody when you ask about it, voters of all races, but it's making things unaffordable for everybody.
trump indicated tuesday that he planned to take that view head-on: the republican party will become 'the party of healthcare!' he tweeted.
already, as a result of my administration's efforts, in 2018 drug prices experienced their single largest decline in 46 years.
and gop presidential candidates like donald trump continue to call for obamacare's repeal and replacement with other policies that wouldn't provide coverage to those who gained insurance because of the aca, and could even result in larger numbers of uninsured than before obama's reforms took effect.
spicer: ok. i'll find out who the other two were. (laughter) i'm sorry, i just got you the front row, give me a second, i'll get the second and the third. do you want to get to the fourth and fifth, or -- ok, let me see what i can do. look, i think that one of the things that happened, jim, was he kept hearing about this rift that existed.

even as the court is increasingly taking incoming from the trump wing of the republican party, progressives are leaning hard on president joe biden to increase the number of justices as a way to blunt the impact trump's of nominees, end lifetime appointments and impose a more rigorous code of judicial ethics.
according to polling and election data, biden has overwhelming support from black voters. some black voters pointed to his history of support for their community and his relationship with obama. biden has received the endorsement of several black leaders, such as rep. jim clyburn, d-s.c., and civil rights icon rep. john lewis, d-ga.
planned parenthood engages in partial-birth abortion, in late term abortion, former hewlett-packard ceo carly fiorina said. they alter those abortion techniques to harvest and sell body parts, they have admitted that they are not going to accept compensation for this anymore.
no, he said quickly, because it passed, and 20 million people got health insurance, and it's still there. then he paused, opened his eyes a bit wider, and started up again: but i think what it does reveal is some major structural problems in our current political system that make it much harder to do big things than it used to be.
trump was welcomed by a white house east room packed with supporters. they gave him a loud and prolonged standing ovation and cheers:
and once again it is a subset of conservatives and republicans resisting these steps, by seeking to end extensions of unemployment benefits and fighting aid to state and local governments that would finance other public services.
even though i was a bernie supporter, you know he's still my president. i'm not going to be anti-trump just because he got in. i'm still hoping for the best. we'll see down the road. you know, it's not instant with the tax reform. defunding obamacare, that's going to be interesting to see how that goes moving forward.
the savings, however, would have been offset by the repeal and modification of certain taxes. the senate version analyzed by congressional budget experts would have, among other things, repealed a surtax on net investment income and annual fees imposed on health insurers. the repeal of the investment income surtax, for example, would have reduced revenues by $172 billion, budget analysts said.
that vow, not to support a plan that pulls the rug out from under people, may sound familiar. it's the same promise republicans kept making in 2017 after donald trump became president and they were trying to write repeal legislation.
all of the jobs would give people paid family and sick leave, pay that eventually phases up to $15 an hour, and — according to booker's website — health coverage like that enjoyed by members of congress.
new mexico health connections, a co-op with 47,000 members, is seeking to raise money from investors, which the obama administration only recently allowed co-ops to do, said the ceo, dr. martin hickey. it's also adding larger employers and labor groups, including some teacher unions, to its client base.
protestors target fed policies at meeting in wyoming
anyone can qualify for medicaid based on income, household size, disability, family status and other factors, but the aca allows states to expand medicaid eligibility so that residents can qualify based solely on whether their household income level is a certain percentage below the federal poverty level.
while republicans were trying to repeal the health care law, price said the individual mandate was behind the rise in premium costs. gop lawmakers failed to get rid of the affordable care act in full, but they did nix the individual mandate in their tax reform bill which passed late last year.
he's shaking things up and i truly think we needed to have a little shakeup in this country. you know the health care has hurt the american farmer something terribly [and] the small business owner. he's the one that's turning it around, trying to turn it around and help us out.
hard to be more clear than that. obama was definitely a traditional marriage guy. and then, two years into office, he said his position was evolving. finally, in 2012, he announced he had changed his mind. but had he really? according to chief strategist david axelrod, obama was always in support of gay marriage but agreed to lie about it because the truth would hurt him politically:
brad smith — who led medicare's innovation center and served as a top white house health policy official — has launched russell street ventures, the tennessean reported on tuesday. the firm is focused on creating or incubating health care companies that focus on serving vulnerable patients; the leadership team includes rachel baitel, a trump white house veteran, and eric hargarten and kara pitts, who did stints at cms working with smith.

we should make plans affordable for everyone, provide everyone with a public option, expand medicare and finish the job so that health care isn't just a right, but a reality for everybody, he said.
the human toll of the shutdown:
it may take a few days to find out whether bloomberg's rivals managed to carve out a contrast between the sunny image in his campaign ads and the sometimes terse figure on stage.
spicer: i think that the president has noted that this was a serious priority of his throughout the campaign. he has already started to work with congress on the appropriations avenue of that. and so he is doing everything he can to direct agencies and congress to commence with that work as soon as possible.
and republicans in the senate have their own internal disagreements, too.
payment for such discussions was initially included in the affordable care act, but removed because of the controversy over so-called death panels. medicare ultimately changed its policy, independently of obamacare, to allow reimbursement for the end-of-life planning sessions.
since then, she's released significant details on her plans to pay for medicare for all and get congress to pass it. but that's opened her policies to new scrutiny. with the release of a 3-year plan leading up to a push for the original medicare for all bill, warren could face attacks from both her right and her left on where she now stands on health care. but while she walked onto the stage last month as the biggest target in the field, buttigieg's recent polling surge in iowa could distract some of the candidates looking for blood. will her rivals continue to pile-on warren, or will they move on to other top candidates like biden and buttigieg?
the bill would have made some other major changes, as well ― such as ending the individual mandate, the unpopular financial penalty for people who do not get health insurance, and rolling back new taxes on the wealthy and health care companies that the government uses to finance the law's coverage expansion.
perhaps we can negotiate a different agreement, adding china and others, or perhaps we can't –- in which case, we will outspend and out-innovate all others by far.

during the presidential campaign, trump said repeatedly that he could not release his returns because he is undergoing an audit and that he would do so once that process is complete. the audit has always been a flimsy excuse. nothing is stopping him from releasing the returns any way, and he could release previous years not under audit.
2. a bigger tax cut for the rich
i also think that what people are starting to see in the occupation of palestine is just an increasing crisis of humanitarian conditions and that to me is just where i tend to come from on this issue, ocasio-cortez said.
biden tweeted shortly after obama's remarks became public, saying the endorsement means the world to jill and me.
at our meeting, i asked them, how are you doing, how is business? they said that it's good. i asked them further how they are doing with other countries, mainly international sales. they told me — without even complaining because they have been mistreated for so long that they have become used to it — that it is very hard to do business with other countries because they tax our goods at such a high rate. they said that in one case another country taxed their motorcycles at 100 percent.
nextgen's announcement comes one day after the biden campaign unveiled a new youth outreach effort, dubbed league 46. that effort, led by biden senior adviser symone sanders, includes an expansion of an existing students for biden group, along with the launch of groups of young professionals for biden and young elected officials for biden.
schilling: i think i was. i registered and when i registered in 18, i registered as an independent and i think i was -- and i think to this day, i'm probably more an independent republican because i think socially, i'm very progressive, but fiscally i'm not.
simmons-duffin: if you qualify for cobra, you will be contacted. but if not, you should just start with healthcare.gov, and that'll direct you to the right place for your state.
obama's announcement was based on a report the department of health and human services published the same day, which found 17.7 million working-age adults became insured between the beginning of obamacare's first enrollment period in 2013 and the close of this year's sign-up campaign last month. the department estimates 2.3 million adults under the age of 26 got covered through the law's provision allowing young adults to remain on their parents' policies.
and the confidence to turn those hopes and dreams to action.
for a lot of years, the threat against women's health care has been talked about, but they've never been as real as they are today, said jesse ferguson, a democratic strategist who works on health care. it's changed from a coffee table conversation to a clear and present danger. that means voters can no longer stay with republicans and assume that this won't become an issue.
i don't believe we want to go there in restricting patient access, he said.
well, that didn't happen, said sunday morning anchor jane pauley. but speaker pelosi is the most powerful woman in american history, and the most powerful woman in american politics. but you can't make the government open?
-- the wizards beat the 76ers 123-106. (roman stubbs)
that's why insurers are jacking up prices this year and why big commercial insurers are pulling out of some markets altogether. in some parts of the country, consumers have only one insurance option. meanwhile, even many of the insured still face high out-of-pocket costs ― and are finding the only affordable plans have narrow networks of providers.
but even on the issue of abortion, it could be argued that the court energized the anti-abortion groups and polarized the issue across partisan lines. that was the argument that none other justice ruth bader ginsburg has offered. she noted back in 2013 that her criticism of roe is that it seemed to have stopped the momentum on the side of change.
the research had some limitations. because it was observational, the researchers were unable to completely tease out any contributing factors that could have influenced the differences between counties in expansion and non-expansion states.
patients want their primary care doctors to have these conversations, and the poll shows that physicians recognize that it's their responsibility, said dr. sandra hernández, president and ceo of the california health care foundation and a physician who treats hiv patients. it's wonderful that medicare is reimbursing for these discussions. now, physicians need more skills and training.
trump ran against it as a presidential candidate and his administration is still seeking to void the law, which after a decade has affected nearly every corner of the health care system.

biden then used some of his most muscular language to date to criticize buttigieg, who's narrowly leading sanders in iowa as the results trickle in.
we borrowed a ream of paper from the newsroom copier (500 sheets) and measured it to be two inches thick. the average building story height is 10 feet. so, if you do the math, a three-story building would be about as tall as 90,000 sheets of paper. that's pretty close to the height of an imaginary stack of new regulations.
washington, dc - may 2: new york governor andrew cuomo holds a news conference at the national press club may 27, 2020 in washington, dc. following a closed-door meeting with president donald trump at the white house, cuomo leveled criticism at republican senators and other politicians that he said want to limit federal aid for new york to combat and recover from the coronavirus pandemic.

blackburn is focusing her campaign on her support for trump, who endorsed her in may. at a rally in nashville in may, mr. trump portrayed bredesen as a tool of chuck and nancy. blackburn has promised to wholeheartedly support mr. trump's agenda if elected. blackburn used clips from that rally in a recent campaign ad touting trump's endorsement.
the grace period apparently was granted earlier this year, though was buried in reams of regulatory material and was not publicly reported until now. department of labor guidelines published in february had addressed the delay.
no one seems to have trouble acknowledging that fact when blaming pharmaceutical companies for creating and pushing drugs, doctors for over-prescribing them, or americans for reporting remarkably high levels of pain and demanding truckloads of pills to deal with it. the senate report itself states at the very beginning that the opioid epidemic is complicated, and most agree that development, marketing, and medical training regarding drug usage – and the resulting over-prescription of opioids – have played a key role.
beyond washington, thousands of people held up signs in salt lake city, record-breaking crowds gathered in texas, and alaskans of all ages weathered subzero temperatures in fairbanks to show their support. the best part is that these marches were just the beginning.
beto o'rourke says he supports universal health care, but he wants to take a different path to get there than many of his more progressive rivals for the 2020 democratic presidential nomination.
to aid in the effort, president biden has recruited a host of former obama administration aides. his picks for top jobs at the centers for medicare and medicaid services, the office of management and budget, as well as key deputies at h.h.s., all worked on the first rounds of obamacare policymaking. many key congressional aides working on health care now also helped write the affordable care act.
so i'm going to be paying close to $10,000 on my medicine and my insurance on a $20,000 income, he said.
cnn's phil black is in irbil.
currently, there's a $19 trillion gap, give or take, between what sen. sanders has proposed and how he's articulated paying for those proposals, clinton said. so that, to me, is troubling.
one cruz adviser likened his approach to a baseball umpire with a big-strike-zone mentality right now, meaning he is giving his gop colleagues and their ideas the benefit of the doubt in the ongoing talks.
clinton said she would save what works and what's good about obamacare and provide additional help to small businesses.
sen. kamala harris, the democratic vice presidential nominee, urged voters monday to rally against president donald trump's nominee to the supreme court nominee as a threat to health care and reproductive rights, and vote against republicans in the coming election.
something terrific, trump said during a july 2015 interview with cnn's dana bash, who asked what he would push in place of obamacare.
all the news we couldn't fit anywhere else.
medicaid expansion was the major health policy that occurred in 2014, but there were some other things as well that weren't captured by our study, or that were happening around the same time, that could potentially explain some of these findings, khatana said.
opinion: trump is faking it on the economy, just as he's faking it on the pandemic, just as he's faked everything his whole life
white house conflicts with business are not uncommon. presidents have often been critical of big businesses or how they operate. more recently drugmakers have come under fire for raising prices, for example, and other firms have been assailed for moving their headquarters outside the u.s. in a process known as a corporate inversion.
the sudden pile on by democratic presidential candidates over the controversy, and the hurried scramble by trump and his aides to clean it up, offered an eloquent forecast of just how important health care will be in 2020.
the second provision prohibited insurance companies from placing lifetime limits on most benefits in most plans.
the supreme court, according to a press release, continues to be open for business, but most employees are working remotely.
worry about obamacare's repeal is not confined to residents who depend on the government for coverage.

spicer: sure, it was the most watched inaugural. when you look at -- look, you look at just the one network alone got 16.9 million people online. another couple of the networks there were tens of million people that watched that online. never mind the audience that was here, the 31 million people watching it on television.
and, given those stakes, he can't sit on the sidelines. in fact, obama said as much in the farewell address he gave in chicago in january.
cornish: npr's sue davis at the capitol. thank you.
congressional gop leaders are playing the same game. in an interview with bloomberg tv this month, senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) used one side of his mouth to say, there's nobody in the senate that i'm familiar with who is not in favor of coverage of pre-existing conditions, and the other side to say, i don't fault the administration for trying to give us an opportunity to do this differently and to go in a different direction.
we as a nation are going to get to watch, in real time, as institutions of power in america assess the value of human life against financial losses. this isn't a new or notable occurrence. but the song that's been playing quietly for years is currently being blared over a loudspeaker for everyone to hear. if the catastrophic implications of the coronavirus aren't the best possible argument for a single payer system, i don't know what is.
dr. manny sethi, a candidate for the gop nomination for u.s. senate in tennessee, decided to surround himself with never trumpers, including his campaign manager who believes president donald trump is a divisive, short-fingered vulgarian.
for walmart, part of the appeal of partnering with guild is that the organization has screened the university partners to make sure they have a track-record of success with adult and working students, malashock said. in addition, guild offers individual coaching and other resources as part of its programming.
navigators also target people with special needs, including those with complicated medical or financial situations that make eligibility for federal programs confusing. these are precisely the sorts of people who might not respond to routine advertising or find the help they need through commercial brokers.
republican tom cole, an ally of ryan's, said i think you have to go back to square one and rethink your entire legislative schedule if the bill fails.
i have seen a lot in 70 years. this is the most important event that i'm looking forward to, gusa said. after 240 years, a woman is ready (to be president). we need the new generation of americans to believe you can make it.
pennsylvania lesson for dems: get angry at trump & gop, not your own candidates
dea officials have said that most of the fentanyl pouring into the united states is coming from china through the u.s. postal service and overnight express services. the majority of mexican heroin and fentanyl is concealed in cars and tractor-trailers that come into the united states through legal ports of entry along the southern border, according to a 2018 dea national drug threat assessment. federal agents say they are also seizing increasing amounts of fentanyl that is coming across the border between the legal ports of entry.
that's not -- you know, that's a fool's errand to go to pennsylvania. why is he in michigan? how silly, they'll never vote for a him. a republican hasn't won that state since '88. and then he goes and he does it and then what's the next narrative? well, it must have been because of this. he didn't win that. and then people aren't attending anything or john lewis is the first person to skip his inauguration. not true.

-- billionaire democratic donor tom steyer announced he would not run for president. chelsea janes reports: steyer said he would instead continue with his campaign to impeach [trump], an effort that began in 2017, and on which he has already spent $10 million on television ads. … the former hedge fund manager said he will be hosting town halls across the country to discuss what he terms the dangers of trump's presidency. … steyer announced that he will invest $16 million going forward in efforts to 'deepen americans' understanding of trump's impeachable offenses.' he said he would focus those efforts on the constituents of the 22 republican senators up for reelection in 2020.
i think the trump administration propping up people like joe arpaio is not helpful to the republican party, said alex conant, a gop strategist. if mcsally is our nominee we have a good chance of keeping the seat. if it's anybody else, the democrats will pick up at least one seat.

the question now is how many people who have lost their coverage will actually enroll in a new plan. health insurance is complicated, and signing up can be hard. there are a lot of stressors on people right now, says larry levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the kaiser family foundation and an author of the report. you may be unemployed, you might be sick, you might be quarantining — and there's just a limit to how many life things you can deal with at once.
in an effort to dismiss crane's substantive criticisms, sen. rubio attacked crane on national television— implicitly denouncing crane's 13 years of service as an ice officer. he's not an ice official. he's the head of a union, rubio said. i literally don't even talk about the things they [i.e. breitbart news] report because they're basically conspiracy theories and often times manipulated. and that individual is not an ice official. he's the head of a union.
it's a position with which republicans disagree. there has been little hesitation from even moderate republicans to reject biden's plan, and the unbending nature of the white house's posture has led many gop senators to question whether biden was ever serious about bipartisanship to begin with.
immigrant advocacy groups are urging the biden administration to move quickly, and the white house announced last month an immigration bill that would provide an eight-year path to citizenship for millions of immigrants already in the country and provide a faster track for undocumented immigrants brought to the us as children. biden's proposed bill, if passed, also would remove the word alien from us immigration laws, replacing it with the term noncitizen.
in my new book about the freedom caucus, i identified 18 instances in which the organization tried to shape political or policy outcomes during its first two years. it succeeded (at least partially) 11 times, an impressive rate of success for a small group of lawmakers. but the caucus didn't only use threats to win; sometimes it developed partnerships with powerful individuals.
here's a startling fact about socialism that every child should hear: during the past century, tens of millions of people have been killed, exiled or imprisoned by socialist and communist parties, and no country has ever successfully enacted a system that matches marx's vision for the world – a reality even the staunchest marxist will admit.
one of the six members of the commission, former congressman patrick j. kennedy (d-r.i.), a recovering addict, said he was disappointed that trump did not do more to promote the report.
several other democratic members of congress have proposed legislation along these lines. sen. debbie stabenow (d-mich.) has proposed lowering the eligibility age to 50. the choose medicare act from sens. dianne feinstein (d-calif.), jeff merkley (d-ore.) and chris murphy (d-conn.) would let any american buy into medicare, including employers who could purchase medicare plans for their employees.
clinical trials showed that vaccines made by astrazeneca and johnson & johnson are effective against the coronavirus, but less so than the ones made by moderna or by pfizer and biontech. still, experts point out that the narrative is not that simple: astrazeneca's and johnson & johnson's vaccines were being tested in clinical trials after new variants of the coronavirus started to circulate widely, which may have reduced their efficacy compared to the vaccines that completed their trials earlier.
the new attitude is a concern for some democrats. members of both parties have recently moved to dreaming big dreams without figuring out how to pay for it, said sen. thomas r. carper (d-del.). i came [to congress] with the idea that we'd be fiscally responsible, and neither party seems to be. my hope is we'll get back to that sooner rather than later.

health care was the leading issue among south carolina's democratic voters, according to the associated press. sanders' agenda includes medicare for all, canceling student debt and reducing income inequality, and president donald trump has been eager to paint the vermont senator and other democrats as a threat to american prosperity and the u.s. stock market djia, -0.39% , even as it reels from the coronavirus outbreak. stocks just wrapped up their worst week since 2008.
but if the supreme court finds the individual mandate unconstitutional and rules the rest of obamacare cannot stand without the provision, mr. trump said he would put forth a brand new, beautiful health care plan — without offering any specifics.
medicare payment rules, fraud and abuse prohibitions, indian health service reforms, the medicaid expansion, fda authority over generic biologics — all would fall by the wayside, jost said.
some of the people making these decisions still have black lives matter yard signs on their lawn, and they're perpetuating the most racially divided educational system since the jim crow era all over the country, he said. this is something that is is a basic civil right that's being violated, not just of black children, of all children, but black children are disproportionately negatively affected.

after an unusual three full days of oral arguments in late march 2012 (a typical case gets one hour on one day), the nine justices gathered in a private conference room off the chief's chambers to cast initial votes. they were alone, with no law clerks or administrative staff.
in addition to his work for kasich, barnwell-hagemeyer previously worked for now tennessee gov. bill lee in 2018. a pollster connected to gehrke, jmc analytics, conducted a survey in that primary showing lee ahead of his opponent by six percent shortly before the primary. the jmc poll, local outlets reported at the time, gave lee a surge in energy in the final weeks and he ended up winning the primary. the polling firm insisted it was acting independently, but gehrke has a stake in victory phones—a company that jmc has used for auto-dialing to conduct polling in some races. similarly, in this race, jmc analytics has released a poll this week in the u.s. senate primary showing hagerty leading by just four percent over sethi. there have been a number of recent polls in the primary, but this one was the best news yet for sethi—if it were true. it seems to be what enticed cruz, who has endorsed other gehrke clients like sasse in the past, into the race.

manchin would also be more enthused if lawmakers would dedicate a permanent funding stream to opioid abuse, as he's proposed in a bill dubbed the lifeboat act, which would extract fees from the makers of prescription opioids to pay for substance-abuse treatment.
in regions with just one insurer, monthly premiums were $451 or higher in half of the benchmark silver plans on which premium subsidies are based. in contrast, in areas where six or more insurers offered plans, monthly premiums were much lower for comparable coverage: half were $270 or less.

i'm not arguing here that public opinion will definitely sway the justices. it may not. but given the coming ideological makeup of the court, public pressure might be one of the only barriers standing in the way of the of the court overturning roe.
for the first time, new historic consumer protections under the affordable care act will protect consumers from the worst insurance company abuses, by banning discrimination based on a pre-existing health conditions, ending lifetime and annual limits on what an insurance company will cover, and capping out-of pocket spending to protect americans and their families, the official said.
4. stop the practice of arresting children for behavior that ought to be handled in the principal's office. the democrats want to stop what they call the school-to-prison pipeline, arguing students of color suffer disproportionate suspensions and arrests (which would mean that liberal teachers are racist). but as andrew pollack points out, failing to arrest violent children could allow them to buy guns as adults, which is how the parkland, florida, shooting happened.
but the white house is now promising it will be a 2018 priority. the details, though, remain murky. michael warren of the weekly standard said the vague signals – and mixed signals – are creating some confusion in congress.
finney: well, maybe. i mean, you know, you never want to say you're going to raise taxes, right? politicians on all sides know that. and i think the argument that both she and bernie are trying to make is that your costs overall will end up sort of balancing out because you might pay a little more in taxes, but you'll be paying less in your health care costs. i think at some point, we're going to have to have that conversation, as i say. and people are going to want to understand that level of detail.
gloria borger, cnn senior political analyst: rubio. i think rubio.
the democratic establishment tore into spoiler jill stein after trump revived the keystone xl and dakota access pipeline projects:
— the irish backed overturning the country's abortion prohibition late last week in a landslide vote that reflects ireland's emergence as a socially liberal country no longer obedient to catholic dictates, the post's william booth and isaac stanley-becker report. with all ballots counted and turnout at a near-historic high, election officials reported saturday that 66.4 percent voted to legalize abortion and 33.6 percent opposed it.
inskeep: oh, so if you have money, you're getting good care. you think so, anyway. if you don't have money, it doesn't feel so good.
--we're keeping our eyes on the house today, where it's still unclear whether republicans can pass the spending agreement without any help from democrats. the measure would increase what's called discretionary spending — areas such as scientific research, education, roads and health care that are funded year-to-year by appropriations — by 21 percent over existing budget caps, irking some conservatives who are warning it would set up trillion-dollar-a-year deficits.
democrats, eyeing potential turmoil in the run-up to the 2018 midterm elections, have little political reason to cooperate. one thing is clear, said the house democratic whip, representative steny hoyer of maryland. house republicans are going to have to find the votes on their own to dismantle the protections incorporated in the affordable care act that the american people now have.
after nearly a week of asking about this, his campaign consultant gehrke sent a statement from campaign spokeswoman adrienne walker to breitbart news that did not address any of the questions sent to sethi's campaign about his entire senior staff. the statement simply claims that sethi supported trump in the earliest days of the 2016 presidential primary campaign and attacks his opponent hagerty—who actually did support the president and is endorsed by the president—by asserting that hagerty supported other republicans in the primary.
with tax reform passed and signed into law, republicans are entering 2018 on an unprecedented high. leave it to sen. jeff flake to be a christmas grouch.
just months after that speech, barrett was named to the 7th circuit, where she dissented in an abortion case involving an indiana law barring abortions based on fetal disability or gender. while the dissenters technically did not decide the issue, they made clear their view that what they referred to as an anti-eugenics law should be upheld by the supreme court. had that view prevailed, it would have been illegal to get an abortion in indiana because of fetal disability.
recent news stories have shined a spotlight on presidential power grabs.the supreme court has decided to hear a case challenging president obama's unilateral rewrite of our nation's immigration laws. and a federal judge recently declared that obama cannot assert executive privilege to prevent congress from reviewing documents pertaining to operation fast and furious, which allowed firearms to walk across the u.s.-mexico border into the hands of criminals.
trump said in michigan: but we had a tremendous, landslide electoral college victory, like people haven't seen in a long time.
this will very likely be one of those votes that becomes harder to explain in retrospect, particularly if the results are as bad as it looks like they will be. the american medical association and a slew of other physician groups, along with nurses and hospital groups, patient groups and the aarp, are loudly warning of dire consequences for millions of americans if the bill passed. lawmakers will have a difficult time reverting to but we ran on repealing and replacing obamacare as justification at election time, as the ahca's coming higher deductibles and higher premiums are likely not what voters had in mind.
barrett has written that abortion is always amoral, and in 2006, she signed on to an anti-abortion newspaper advertisement that opposed abortion on demand. in 2013, barrett's name also appeared in an advertisement sponsored by the group university faculty for life, which said we affirm our full support for our university's commitment to the right to life.
the views of walker will be spotlighted wednesday in the us senate during his scheduled nomination hearing for the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit.
poco después de ese incidente, la campaña de trump comenzó a hacer un anuncio al principio de sus manifestaciones mediante el que instaba a los partidarios a no lastimar a ningún manifestante, sino que en lugar de eso, gritaran: «trump, trump, trump» y que esperaran que los agentes de seguridad acompañaran a los manifestantes hasta afuera.
but graham made it clear their friendship was much deeper than politics or any single bill.
in today's hyperpartisan politics, accusations of overly expansive presidencies fly across the aisle as a matter of course. a strong presidency is one who is of your own party and an imperial presidency is one from the other side, rudalevige said.
these lightly sketched solutions may strike many readers as small bore, given the challenges facing the country, and perhaps more cautious than hamilton himself would recommend. so too is kettl's analysis that the core of the problem is what he calls the rise of light-fare television, which he says has undermined federalism by encouraging snappy national fixes to complex, context-dependent problems.
the republican candidates for president gathered in des moines, iowa, on thursday for their last debate before the first votes of the 2016 primary season are cast, and cnn's reality check team spent the night putting their statements and assertions to the test.

his favorability among republicans has dropped significantly, from two-thirds to less than half, since he became speaker, owing partly to his inclusion in the party establishment, and partly to his approval of budgets that raised spending and included funding for controversial programs.
olsen: we're just kind of hoping that, you know, as crazy as trump is, that maybe he's just got the guts to actually make things happen. we're hoping - but we're hoping it won't go too far the other way and (laughter) make too many people mad.
whatever the case, federal judges' own health coverage probably doesn't weigh too heavily on their decision-making. after all, we've been here before. the supreme court upheld the aca in 2012, saying the individual mandate -- the area of the law under dispute in the texas case -- was constitutional because of the tax penalty involved. but now that the trump administration abolished the penalty, the recent lawsuit argued the entire law was no longer constitutional.

i'd name the capitol after him, if i could, graham told reporters last year, noting though that an important piece of this was the mccain family's input in how they wanted to see mccain memorialized.
around the same time, republican sen. bill cassidy of louisiana said he would not be in support of renaming the building after mccain because he did not want to create a precedent for renaming institutions that already honor someone's memory.
of course, it is up to states what insurers would cover, but mr. trump's claim that the plan is better than the current law for people with pre-existing conditions is unfounded.
question: isn't it a fair criticism that you've got bigger fish to fry? why worry about a couple of tweets about crowd size?
what if trump cuts off medicare? what if he cuts off food stamps?
medicare currently pays hospital outpatient departments more than doctors' offices for certain services. the trump administration wants to eliminate that differential. it also wants to slow the growth of payments for skilled nursing, inpatient rehab facilities and home health services, said tricia neuman, director, program on medicare policy at the kaiser family foundation.
the issues will barrett will be questioned on
just don't expect such great deals on bacon, whose cost soared in 2014 after disease wiped out millions of piglets. americans much prefer bacon to any other cut of pork, so prices only fell slightly last year even though the pig herd increased.
for those who say kimmel has crossed over and become too political. he had a message for them, too: before you post the nasty facebook message saying i'm politicizing my son's health problems, i want you to know, i am politicizing my son's health problems, because i have to. but my family has health insurance. we don't have to worry about this, but other people do. so you can shove your disgusting comments where your doctor won't be giving you a prostate exam once they take your health care benefits away.
cornish: you mention the grassroots. how do republicans plan to explain this failure - right? - something they promised their voters for so long when they go home?
sen. john barrasso (r-wyo.) slammed the expanded subsidies during a floor speech yesterday, saying democrats would just increase government payments without tackling the heart of the issue, which is health-care costs.
and yet, the critics could find no way to refute the actual data in the report. they denounced it with thunderous virtue-signaling outrage, attacked those involved in preparing it, criticized arguments it did not make – such as pretending the report claims the opioid epidemic was caused by medicaid expansion, rather than exacerbated by it – or simply assumed that all critiques of medicaid and obamacare must be partisan hit jobs, q.e.d.
as president barack obama's administration reviewed plans for the $5.3 billion keystone xl pipeline, almost 1,000 demonstrators marched from georgetown university to secretary of state john kerry's home and then to the white house, where they acted out a human oil spill.
sahil kapur of bloomberg discussed how democrats are debating what is worth the most effort – and whether they are prepared to withhold their votes, and perhaps trigger a government shutdown, if they can't get what they want.
and i think that it's important to understand, that whether it's the president himself, the vice president, the senior team, the volunteers or the people who are out there just in america that voted for him or walked the streets or put up a sign, that to constantly be told no, no, no and watch him go yes, yes, yes every time and to come up to the next hurdle and see someone put a block up gets a little frustrating.
the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) released a report in july that average obamacare monthly premiums by 27 percent in 2018, which was even higher than 2017's 21 percent rate hike.
infrastructure: probably. while biden has indicated infrastructure will not be a part of his initial package aimed at easing the economic pain caused by the pandemic, it may be in a second round of reconciliation this year. a surge of spending on infrastructure – but limited to five or ten years like the bush tax cuts to avoid the byrd outyear deficit prohibition – could pass parliamentary muster, if written correctly, experts say. it's not a slam dunk, though — the nature of highway trust fund spending, which is not quite appropriations and not exactly direct spending, could be a problem.
president trump signed an executive order in september announcing a steadfast commitment to always protecting individuals with preexisting conditions, but the order alone can't force insurers to offer coverage if the aca is struck down.
this also does not take into account all the kinds of assistance navigators provide all year, such as helping with complex cases and issues and filing appeals. florida will definitely be hit hard by this.
trump's speech thursday nicely illustrates the convention's lack of impact. trump rattled off a long, meandering list of already well-known or politically irrelevant accomplishments and repeated well-worn attacks on biden. the speech came without any of the gusto that defines his most off-the-rails rally performances but with all of the lies and distortions he typically delivers.
despite biden's big night, the confetti could stop for him on super tuesday, as sanders is much better organized and positioned to take a potentially commanding delegate lead.
the federalist society will also host a courthouse steps teleforum wednesday at 3:30 pm et on the supreme court case little sisters of the poor saints peter and paul home v. pennsylvania.
but for now, republicans aren't interested in another health care fight.

to finance the program, the plans calls for undoing the republican tax bill, imposing a 5% surtax on adjusted gross income above $500,000, and increasing the medicare payroll tax. also, there would be levies on investment income above a certain threshold, tobacco products, beer, wine, liquor, and sugar-sweetened drinks. states would also have to contribute an amount equal to what they currently spend on medicaid.
on four separate occasions, brat awkwardly plugged his book american underdog, which details his election to congress and his fiscal and conservative principles, saying it's an effective sleep aid. the joke fell flat each time.
skyrocketing insurance premiums are caused by skyrocketing patient costs. period. president obama himself recognized this fact in 2009, stating: we spend one-and-a half times more per person on health care than any other country. ... this is one of the reasons that insurance premiums have gone up three times faster than wages.
so far this year, pharma's lobbying spending is staying sizeable. phrma spent $9.91 million to influence washington in the first quarter, according to a disclosure filed in late april. and the q1 total is $10.01 million when the trade group's subsidiaries are included, says a tally from opensecrets.org.

even as primary season continues, several senate races are taking shape, with some incumbent republicans and several incumbent democrats in danger of losing their seats. the blue wave may be coming for the house of representatives, but it is less likely to crash over the senate, where democrats are likely to lose seats and widen the gap between the majority and the minority. here is an updated look at senate races to watch as november approaches.

gergen: and it does really raise questions. will -- the obama coalition of 2008 and 2012 depended heavily on the youth vote.
i'll be candid… one of the areas of agreement in even contentious times in the obama administration was that our corporate tax rate is way too high, sayegh said on the latest episode of the takeout podcast. and it's made us uncompetitive. i mean, that is a point that both republicans and democrats largely agree on. we're going to really tackle that tax rate.
potentially dangerous clashes could develop: if trump were to ask the military to target terrorists' families — an idea he has at various times proposed and disavowed — some military and intelligence officials have said that commanders might refuse to follow such orders.
i hope we don't need it, but if needed we will have it, pelosi told reporters thursday. we want it to be bipartisan always, but we can't surrender.
one potential stumbling block for cruz and other conservatives is the increasing possibility that gop leaders will not repeal all of the obamacare taxes. rank-and-file members have discussed keeping or delaying some of the taxes to help pay for such costly programs as banning insurers from charging more for patients with preexisting conditions and extending federal payments to states that accepted medicaid expansion under the aca, according to several gop aides familiar with the talks.

now the database shows trump made 8,155 suspect claims in 2019, up from 5,689 claims in 2018 and 1,999 claims in the first year of his presidency.
the public knows them as co-ops. they're officially called consumer operated and oriented plans in the health law. eleven are still in business, but four in oregon, ohio, connecticut and illinois will disappear by fall due to financial insolvency. oregon's health co-op and connecticut's healthyct were told to close by their state's regulators last week. tuesday, the land of lincoln mutual health insurance co. in illinois was ordered to close by state regulators.
former vice president joe biden, who is considering a run for the 2020 democratic nomination, told a crowd tuesday that trump is curtailing spending to pay for the tax cut he gave the super wealthy, a reference to the 2017 gop tax law.
much of biden's plan requires legislation, which has a better chance of being approved with democrats controlling both chambers of congress.
these would take longer for federal agencies to implement so it could be several weeks, or even months, before americans receive them.
last year's cut forced navigators to lay off staff, cancel events, and, in some cases, cease operations altogether. this new cut will leave navigators with just a fraction of the money they had available for the open enrollment periods that occurred during president barack obama's administration ― in all likelihood hampering their ability to help consumers through the complicated process of choosing a health insurance policy and applying for financial assistance.
senate democrats will likely push barrett to commit to recusing herself from any election-related disputes that come before the high court. but it's unlikely she will do so, as each individual justice decides whether to sit out a case.
doctors know it's important to talk with their patients about end-of-life care.

worse still, his south carolina defeat epitomized the difficulty he had attracting support from black voters, a core constituency for the democratic party.
these populists seek to defend what the french call 'acquired rights' — health care, pensions, and other programs that benefit older people — against bankers and technocrats who endlessly demand austerity; against migrants who make new claims and challenge accustomed ways; against a globalized market that depresses wages and benefits. in the united states, they lean republican because they fear the democrats want to take from them and redistribute to americans who are newer, poorer, and in their view less deserving — to 'spread the wealth around,' in candidate barack obama's words to 'joe the plumber' back in 2008. yet they have come to fear more and more strongly that their party does not have their best interests at heart.
the early word is that the president will state publicly that the united states is officially recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel, but is holding off, for now, on moving the us embassy from tel aviv.

when using numbers adjusted for inflation, lobbying spending last year rose to an eight-year high, according to the center for responsive politics. meanwhile, the number of registered lobbyists hit a six-year high in 2019, though the nonpartisan center has warned that there is rampant shadow lobbying in washington, meaning undisclosed activities.

rep. jayapal on sen. johnson: stunning that a senator would say these things
it's just become an ideological fixation, obama said, adding: there is no doubt that in implementing the affordable care act, a program of this significance, there are going to be some glitches. ... that's true, by the way, of a car company rolling out a new car. it's true of apple rolling out the new ipad.
there are plenty of other reasons the speech's effect will be limited: the inappropriate use of the white house and lack of social distancing among the rose garden crowd will overshadow the speech's content, and two bigger news stories ― the aftermath of the police shooting of jacob blake in kenosha, wisconsin, and a major hurricane hitting the gulf coast ― may overshadow its existence entirely.
the reality of a herd immunity, which appears to be what the president meant by herd mentality, is not so clear. the scant scientific research the world has so far suggests antibodies only last several months after infection, which seem to make it possible to be reinfected.

sen. bob casey (d-pa.), meanwhile, said he believes the better approach is relying on more incremental proposals like medicare at 50, which would allow americans 50 and older to buy into the medicare program, to expand the health insurance market.
scott has a history of bucking federal funds. as governor, he refused to allow florida to accept obamacare-related money to expand medicaid health care coverage.
both parties recognize the stakes, which helps explain why the james-peters race is on track to be the most expensive in the state's history. much of that has gone toward television advertisements that focus on health care ― including one from peters that features a 2017 video of james bemoaning the gop's failure to repeal the affordable care act.
mr. hutchinson wants those earning between 100 and 138 percent of the poverty level to move to the affordable care act marketplace, where they would get federal subsidies to buy private insurance. but that could end up costing the federal government more money — another reason the trump administration may be slow to approve it. president trump frequently refers to the marketplaces as failing and has taken a number of steps to weaken them.
his hope — and possibly most powerful political argument — is that republicans simply can't afford this kind of defeat in the early stages of their monopoly on power in washington.

republican officials, who have spent the last eight-plus years trying to undermine and repeal the affordable care act and its provisions protecting those with pre-existing conditions, have in recent weeks been saying they are not actually doing the things they are doing.
sanders repeated an erroneous claim from his 2016 presidential campaign that the u.s. has the highest rate of childhood poverty. while the country does have a high relative child poverty rate, several other countries have worse rates.
starbucks is committed to helping at least 25,000 employees graduate by 2025, novoa said, which the company estimates will cost at least $250 million.
in speaking from a faith-based perspective, buttigieg, warren and others make a powerful point: what's wrong with trumpism — aside from its deceit, its authoritarianism, its rejection of the american creed and its economic illiteracy — is its rank cruelty. trump's actions routinely violate norms of decent behavior, which for many americans are grounded in a faith tradition.

the senate bill also reduces funding to medicaid — the health program for poor and disabled americans — by more than $800 billion over the next decade, leading to 15 million fewer enrollees by 2026 than under the current law.
but they're finding it tough to start those conversations – and when they do, they're not sure what to say, according to a national poll released thursday.
i believe the republican party decided that obama needed to fail, said pinsky, a 53-year-old consultant. if they worked more for america and less against obama, they'd be a lot stronger. it allowed the extremes to get a foothold in that party.

the fact that sethi has made a campaign decision to refuse to address any of this—and instead is just counter-attacking his opponent hagerty claiming hagerty is an establishment republican while claiming he is the real conservative despite mounting evidence to the contrary—lends credence to the hagerty criticisms of sethi as a fraud who is falsely claiming to be an outsider, much like sasse did when he ran as such in 2014 then got to washington and incessantly stabbed trump in the back. hagerty's team highlighted sethi's history as a bureaucratic doctor in massachusetts—where he lived before he moved to tennessee—and his prior support for obamacare.
my understanding on the howard dean thing is that that campaign did not sort of in the final moments continue to check in with their caucus-goers and kind of push them to go. and a lot of people they thought were going to come out to caucus actually didn't. and that lesson has been learned by all of these candidates.

in january 2015, a group of conservative house republicans felt shut out of power and frustrated that gop leaders made legislative compromises with democrats and then-president barack obama. they founded the freedom caucus to help move their party further to the right.
montanaro: well, and that this costs trillions and trillions of dollars. i mean, the fact is that people want to know how much their energy bill is going to be each month. and that's, frankly, as you know, the biggest thing that you can think about. it's - well, how it affects your paycheck and your pocketbook. and if you have extra money on hand, that's one thing.
the house bill, which narrowly passed in a 217-213 vote on may 4, would significantly reduce the funding for obamacare subsidies, revamp tax credits so that they're tied to a person's age, freeze the medicaid expansion in 2020 and allow states to seek waivers from a rule that requires states to offer essential benefits in their plans and a provision that prevents insurers from charging people with pre-existing conditions more money compared to healthy people. instead of obamacare's insurance mandate, the house republican bill would incentivize people to have continuous coverage. should coverage be interrupted for more than 63 days, insurers would be able to charge a 30 percent penalty over the original premium for one year.
i agree. let me she referenced me. i agreed with the great job she did, and i went on the floor and got you votes. i got votes for that bill. i convinced people to vote for it, so lets get those things straight too.
we all salute the same flag.
other stars praised clinton for exercising restraint, while criticizing trump for seeming tense.
trump's defenders argue that his statements, whether off the cuff at rallies or in his scripted acceptance address at last week's republican convention, are not policy prescriptions but rather reflections of popular frustration. when trump says he's going to fix a problem immediately, some supporters say, he's throwing down his marker, taking a stand rather than spelling out a plan.
ted cruz needs to copy the santorum map if he is to beat donald trump in iowa tonight. then you look for trump. number one, can he steal some of this? romney won a few of them, but can ted cruz -- ron paul won a few too. that's the light orange here.
rounding out today's schedule, after the reception that i mentioned, he will have dinner with -- oh we have a meeting with the house speaker paul ryan. they will discuss the republican legislative agenda and strategy going forward. early in the day the president nominated former new mexico, congress woman heather wilson as the next secretary of the air force. she grew up in key new hampshire and made history as part of the third u.s. air force academy class that included women.
sen. marco rubio, who is not up for re-election but is a prominent gop voice, said in a recent interview with the economist, that the $1.5 trillion tax bill — which he voted for in december — has yet to deliver the relief to the working class, despite the breaks given to fortune 500 companies.
facing calls to quit, burr seeks ethics probe
an energy reporter for the la times imagined this scenario:
the opioid overdose death rate, by then almost entirely fueled by illicit fentanyl, continued to climb. in 2017, fentanyl for the first time became the leading cause of overdose deaths in america.
strikingly, some of the trump voters told kaiser that they resented lower-income people who were enrolled in medicaid, which they viewed as a better deal. medicaid has its own complexities (and its own problems), but government-run programs do tend to be simpler than private ones. it's true of medicare, and it's true of single-payer systems in other countries.
the cases before the supreme court are state of california, et al., v. state of texas, et al. (19-840) and state of texas, et al., v. state of california, et al. (19-1019).
birhanzl is a recovering addict herself. she is now a director at sojourner recovery services, a treatment facility in butler county. one man she tried to help was james proffit, 40, who had lived on the streets for years. his path to fentanyl was typical. he started by taking large doses of oxycontin and then turned to heroin, not knowing it had been laced with fentanyl.
the rule provided full protection for americans with religious beliefs and moral convictions and acknowledged that the contraceptive mandate concerns serious issues of moral concern, including those involving human life.
now, more than 12,000 starbucks employees participate in the program and nearly 3,000 have graduated, she said.
yes, and with only 51 votes, but it's risky. first, there's the public relations aspect — overruling the closest thing the senate has to a neutral umpire may look bad, or even cause them to resign in protest. but also the override becomes a new precedent, which would govern future disputes.
question: sir, last week on lgbt rights. the long time republicans (inaudible) group delivered a white paper to the trump team, urging the president to maintain an executive order from president obama, borrowing anti-lgbt worker discrimination among federal contractors.

the number of people who gained because of the medicaid expansion is a bit fuzzier and open to interpretation. there are 17.1 million in the expansion group for whom states are getting enhanced federal matching payments, said larry levitt, a senior vice president at the kaiser family foundation. there are 12.7 million who were made newly eligible. the reason the numbers are different is because some states had waivers pre-aca that included some of these enrollees.
as troubling as these new moves by anti-abortion activists are, there is one upside. there is now perfect clarity on where the lines have been drawn, and the likelihood that this extremism will be embraced by the american people is close to zero.
we'll leave you with this exchange between ted cruz and deadspin:
all the problems seem to be very strongly correlated with the size of the population, said linda blumberg, a senior fellow in the health policy center at the urban institute, who co-authored the analysis. if you've got a big population, more insurers are coming in to compete for that business.
breyer and kagan had voted in the private march conference to uphold the new medicaid requirement, and their votes had been unequivocal. but they were pragmatists. if there was a chance that roberts would cast the critical vote to uphold the central plank of obamacare -- and negotiations in may were such that they still considered that a shaky proposition -- they were willing to meet him partway.
but just because biden is carrying on doesn't mean he should carry on this campaign the same way. something has to change.
highlights and analysis of the draft democratic party platform:
bennet, 54, overcame a bout with prostate cancer earlier this year. he was diagnosed in april and quickly underwent surgery, which his office said was completely successful and would require no further treatment. he told cbs his diagnosis was very clarifying, saying he was disappointed at the possibility of never being able to run.
it is the first time such an expansion has been mandated by referendum, and as npr's brett neely has written, it could energize organizers of similar campaigns for 2018 across the country, including in utah and alaska.
bernie 2020 looked very different than bernie 2016 in several ways. among them: a deliberate effort to do fewer mega-rallies — at least in the early months of the race — and instead focus on more intimate town halls where people in the audience shared their struggles with health care access and costs.
an 11-minute clip of kellyanne conway performing stand-up comedy at a nov. 1998 dc's funniest celebrity charity event (which aired on c-span 2) is going viral:
in late 2018, when it appeared that congress would wrap up its business without funding a southern border wall, meadows and other caucus members were able to leverage their white house ties and push for what became the longest federal government shutdown in american history.
most polls – especially the most recent polls – showed sanders leading or winning in new hampshire. the polls were accurate, though buttigieg came close to scoring an upset.
that has carried on through the opening weeks of the administration. since february 5, the team has met with house and senate leadership multiple times a week, directly with 33 house members and held talks with more than 100 key congressional staffers.
that question seems fair to ask in light of u.s. district judge reed o'connor's ruling on friday striking down the affordable care act -- the 2010 law passed under president barack obama that expanded health insurance to millions of americans -- as unconstitutional. o'connor's decision looks certain to be appealed by a group of democratic state attorneys general, first to the u.s. court of appeals for the fifth circuit and then likely to the supreme court.
after the speech, trump was headed to a roundtable with heller, gubernatorial nominee adam laxalt, labor secretary alex acosta and local business leaders focused on the gop's tax bill, for which heller claimed credit.
trump's new solution? an executive order that directs the department of health and human services to start coming up with some kind of plan next year if congress doesn't pass a bill by jan. 1, 2021. he will instruct me to investigate executive actions and regulatory actions that we can take that will ensure that patients are nonetheless protected against surprise medical bills, is how azar described it.

for children under 5, biden supports the child care for working families act, in which a sliding scale of subsidies will be set up so less affluent families can pay what they can afford.
kids often respond to this fact by saying that there are many examples of socialism working successfully. like sen. bernie sanders, i-vt., and rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez, d-n.y., they point to denmark, norway and sweden.
other promises put him in disputed terrain, such as his vow to bomb isis, circle their territory and take the oil. some argue that such actions must be authorized by congress under the war powers resolution, which was passed over president nixon's veto in 1973. but presidents since then have routinely ordered military action without seeking a congressional green light.
biden says he will reduce the debt burden carried by students after they graduate. after deducting the earnings they need to pay taxes and for essentials like housing and groceries, borrowers will pay 5% of their income above $25,000 toward federal loans taken out to fund an undergraduate degree.
today, americans who buy insurance on their own can get tax credits if their income is below four times the poverty line (about $100,000 a year for a family of four). those credits effectively discount premiums by hundreds and sometimes thousands of dollars a year. they would be gone if the affordable care act comes off the books, leaving millions to buy coverage on their own without that assistance.

sen. rand paul, r-kentucky, didn't appear to be a fan of the bill.
it's unfortunate that republicans have resorted to a taxpayer-funded lawsuit to re-fight a political fight that they keep losing. they've been losing this fight for six years, and they'll lose it again.
as more details play out publicly, the sponsors of the bill race against the clock. unlike the aca, which was debated vigorously in both houses of congress with 79 hearings in the house alone, repealing the aca and replacing it with the ahca has put house members in a difficult position of casting a vote with many unanswered questions.
we democrats are here today to tell our republican friends, turn back. drop this irresponsible plan.
quite aware of all the potential harm in this bill, speaker ryan has said not to worry — there will be a second and third phase that will fix everything. it's right to question how much stock to place in this. it's a bit like your teenager bringing home an f in math but telling you not to worry because he's sure he will get an a on the next test.
still, it might be more instructive if federal judges give a little thought to why their health insurance option works so well. that's primarily because federal employees are a large, diversified pool of patients, with varying ages, demographics and health care needs. such a pool helps insurers spread risk among young, healthy participants and those who are older or have more health care needs. the large pool also helps the government negotiate with insurers to keep costs down.
the credit would also become fully refundable for the year and may be paid out monthly, rather than as a lump sum at tax time.
he also spoke of the approval of anwar. he then said he almost didn't agree to including anwar because he was angry with someone, but hearing that president ronald reagan and others had tried to get anwar, he decided he wanted it included immediately.
house leaders correctly point out that their bill represents the biggest changes to the federal-state health program for the poor since its inception in 1965 — a point that appeared to be drowned out during the most recent house debate that focused on coverage for people with pre-existing health conditions.
gorsuch , 49, is seen as a reliable conservative, with a reputation for clear, lucid writing – though he does not boast the outsider credentials of some others on trump's list. his law clerks regularly move on to the supreme court for both conservative and liberal justices. he is an originalist, like scalia, and protective of religious rights.
on tuesday, shortly after being sworn in, newsom — who ran on the proposal of providing healthcare to everyone in california, though he struggled to explain how he would pay for it — signed an executive order taking steps in that direction.
hot on the left: pelosi, schumer response tops trump speech in preliminary ratings, from the hill: according to early numbers from nielsen, the quarter hour from 9 to 9:15 p.m. est that included the president's address attracted a combined 28.1 rating in metered markets on abc, cbs, nbc, fox, fox news, cnn and msnbc. the 15 minutes that followed immediately after that included remarks by pelosi and schumer registered 29.3 across those same networks. the early numbers also show that the pelosi-schumer response beat trump by 26 percent on cnn and 15 percent on msnbc, according to deadline. deadline also notes the trump address and democratic response got an equal number of viewers on fox news. hot on the right: holocaust group sought reconsideration of angela davis honor, from the ap: an alabama civil rights organization withdrew a planned human rights award from political activist angela davis after a group that educates alabamians about the holocaust asked them to reconsider the honor. the birmingham holocaust education center wrote to the birmingham civil rights institute on jan. 2 expressing 'concern and disappointment' about the plan to honor davis with an award named for minister and civil rights pioneer fred l. shuttlesworth. the letter urged the institute to 'reconsider your decision.' the holocaust group cited 'recent outspoken support' of a boycott, divestment and sanctions campaign against israel, al.com reported.
justices elena kagan and stephen breyer filed a separate opinion concurring in the judgment.
donald trump looking for delegate sweep in new york primary
— he is friends with the president of the arizona cardinals, michael bidwell, who was a classmate at georgetown prep.
trump has persuaded himself that the public will blame democrats for tanking the markets, thus forcing them to the table. but that is fanciful, because republicans currently control everything. if this strategy produces anything, it's most likely to be a set of compromises that would give both democrats and republicans some concessions while preserving and perhaps growing the aca's coverage expansion — which would be broadly unacceptable to many ideological conservatives, and would require trump to cut them loose.
i was with king abdullah earlier this week. very emotional after the death of this jordanian pilot in a horrible way. even (ph) he said this fight against isil, it is our fight. it is the region's fight. the u.s. can help us but you can't do it for us. we've got to speak out against the regional terrorism and it's up to us to do it.
an executive order he issued will create a special enrollment period for plans sold in the federal healthcare.gov market from feb. 15 to may 15, offering a path to health care for people who find themselves without insurance coverage after losing their jobs. the order also directs agencies to look for ways to strengthen medicaid, the federal health program for low-income people, and obamacare more broadly. he could also take other administrative actions, like restoring funding for navigators and reversing trump administration guidance letting states waive certain obamacare rules.
rubio also criticized cruz's campaign for putting out what appeared to be satirical photo of rubio and obama shaking hands— in an effort to highlight rubio's effort to give obama fast-track executive trade authority. although the appearance of the photo could arguably have been labeled a caricature, rubio sought to diffuse the substance of the attack—which focused on rubio's support for obamatrade— by treating the satirically-minded photo as a serious transgression. this is how phony and how deceitful the cruz campaign has become, rubio's senior adviser said.
according to court documents, garcia had a handgun and fired several shots at valazquez, who fell to the ground shortly after being struck. multiple witnesses saw garcia approach valazquez and shoot him three or four times in the face while he was still on the ground.
if the health insurance requirement is invalidated, then it necessarily follows that the rest of the aca must also fall, solicitor general noel francisco wrote thursday.
my economic team is developing historic tax reform that will reduce the tax rate on our companies so they can compete and thrive anywhere and with anyone. at the same time, we will provide massive tax relief for the middle class.
the direct aid, along with additional funding to reopen schools and speed up vaccine distribution, is meant to quickly help americans regardless of their employment status, while the stimulus's extensive funding for state governments and spending on infrastructure projects was explicitly intended to create jobs.
as part of our military build-up, the united states is developing a state-of-the-art missile defense system.
the senate didn't correct the fact that florida is getting a lot less than what we would be entitled to on a per capita basis, desantis, in an apparent jab at scott and sen. marco rubio, said monday at a press conference.
sorry, mr. abernathy. despite having legally won the electoral college, mr. trump is not the true, morally legitimate president (and he knows it).
both senators returned to work quickly, but their brief absence served as a stark reminder of just how perilous the democratic majority is in a 50-50 senate, particularly as they plan to push through a $1.9 trillion pandemic rescue package later this week, paul writes. if one democrat has a fever, breaks an ankle or takes a bad fall, the legislative process would come to a stop until all 50 were able to vote for president biden's first critical legislative agenda item.
at wednesday's debate, biden can be expected to try and turn mr. trump's accusations into an advantage. and the former vice president also says that russian president vladimir putin and north korean dictator kim jong un are worried about a potential biden presidency. north korean state media recently called biden a rabid dog, a phrase biden laughs at.
king: and they're much better organized. the question is, can organization overcome the sanders' passion?
some would end up not getting coverage at all, which is why, according to the cbo, the number of people without insurance would actually rise if the alexander-collins proposal became law, although the increase would be small.
and you'll develop — you'll develop herd — like a herd mentality — it's going to be herd developed — and that's going to happen, the president said tuesday night. that will all happen. but with a vaccine i think it will go away very quickly. but i really believe we're rounding the corner. and i believe that strongly.
sinema would likely prefer to face a more extreme figure like ward or arpaio. however, mcsally is the front-runner to win the nomination, making it less likely that moderates will flock to sinema.
kneedler said the federal government now maintains that the law's individual mandate is constitutional, but even if the court disagrees, it should sever the mandate and allow the rest of the sprawling law to stand. such a move would maintain the status quo, as the penalty associated with the mandate has been brought down to zero.
i was one of the first to run as an outsider against the establishment and the crony deals on wall street. i think we're going to drain the swamp, he said, invoking one of trump's favorite lines. the comment sent the crowd into an uproar once again.
currently, when we ship products out of america, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes — but when foreign companies ship their products into america, we charge them almost nothing.
it may not always be apparent given the outsized role of size – of hands and other body parts – in the presidential campaign, but the republican candidates routinely claim that president obama's job-killing policies are destroying the country.
haynes, the republican strategist, dismissed the comments as nothing more than a nuisance that would suck up precious campaign time up, but wouldn't do long-term damage.
at one point, trump suggested that clinton actually preferred to create a single-payer plan ― something that would come as a great shock to sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), who proposed a single-payer scheme during the democratic primaries that clinton attacked repeatedly. (trump also suggested that single-payer plans are catastrophic in certain ways, even though those systems actually outperform the u.s. system by at least some metrics, while managing to provide truly universal coverage with significantly lower spending.)
factoring in this change, medicare spending would be $575 billion lower, said marc goldwein, senior vice president at the committee for a responsible federal budget, a think tank.
sex pistols frontman johnny rotten isn't afraid to buck the establishment and sound the alarm over l.a.'s homeless epidemic, which has literally landed at his front door.
cruz: well, i think it's a good talking point for people who want to shift blame. let's be clear, the cromnibus was leadership's plan. i said at the time it is a bad plan and it is a plan that is designed to lose.
fox news' kelly phares, tara prindiville, alex rego and andrew craft contributed to this report.
the tension is over whether teachers should be required to return to classrooms before getting the coronavirus vaccine. some teachers unions – who were a major contributor to biden's campaign – are insisting they shouldn't have to return to in-person learning until all teachers have been vaccinated. yet upon becoming president, biden made reopening schools a major goal – one that he has since appeared to back away from.
the republican-proposed bill, set to come before the u.s. house of representatives on thursday for a vote, would unwind the medicaid expansion, cap federal payments to states and replaceobamacare's income-based tax credits with flat age-based credits. the bill would still need approval in the senate if it clears the house this week.
one of many large boxes of returned products that fill the warehouse. the returned products in this box will eventually be sorted and categorized.
the new bill makes some big changes from the last bcra draft, but it also leaves some major parts of the original senate proposal intact — it would still repeal the individual and employer mandates, it would still mean cuts to medicaid spending, and it would still allow states to opt out of key parts of obamacare.

in july, the fifth circuit court of appeals will hear oral arguments in the attempt by gop attorneys general to have the entire law struck down. the justice department has told the court it agrees with the challengers that the law is unconstitutional.
white house officials treated the drug czar's office as a backwater. they staffed it with political operatives who had little or no drug policy experience and installed a 24-year-old campaign worker as the deputy chief of staff. senior staffers with years of experience were sidelined. in may 2017, the administration proposed cutting the office's budget by 95 percent.
sanders campaigned across the country against president trump and congressional republicans' push to repeal obamacare, and then he reintroduced his signature medicare-for-all health care plan.
when host george stephanopoulos followed up, asking specifically whether trump intended to stop enforcing that mandate, conway responded, he may.
fixing the senate ― and democracy
our homeless crisis is becoming a public health crisis, newsom warned. we have seen typhus in los angeles, a medieval disease in california in 2019. i know mayors are working hard, but we have to have their backs. they cannot do it alone.
as republicans have been vowing for years, the house-passed bill would defund planned parenthood, although only for a year. that's likely because a permanent defunding would actually cost the federal government more money, according to the cbo, as some women who lose access to birth control would become pregnant, have babies and qualify for medicaid. birth control is vastly cheaper than health care for mothers and babies.
finally, the president issued a memorandum outlining executive branch hiring. this memorandum counters through dramatic expansion of the federal workforce in recent years. in particular, it prevents filling vacant positions and creating new positions except when necessary to meet national or public security responsibilities. it does not apply to military personnel and it ensures that the american taxpayers get effective and efficient government.
in response to the report, an obama administration official stressed that the cap on individual spending for major medical coverage will still be in place in 2014, on time. it will then be expanded to cover other benefits the following year.
5 things gop won't say about obamacare: jason sattler
for a little more than an hour, brat was heckled nonstop as he fielded questions on health care, president trump's policies and the border wall.
washington ― democrats are gearing up to turn abortion into a key issue for the 2020 elections, saying it could turn out to be an issue that mirrors the fight to preserve the affordable care act in 2018.
mara gandal-powers, senior counsel at the national women's law center, said she was worried about the uncertainty created by the ruling.
in his dec. 27 op-ed, urging president trump to respect the haters, gary abernathy utterly distorted the essence of the trump presidency. mr. trump, he says, should continue to drain the swamp, enforce immigration laws and criticize journalists but show respect. really? his apparent blindness to our president's chronic lying, justice obstruction, immorality, narcissistic impulsiveness, immigrant-bashing, press-attacking and acquiescence to authoritarian leaders places mr. abernathy among the alt-propagandists of the new alternate reality.
• free-trade agreements. the president has overseen the negotiation and enactment of the south korean trade pact, is pushing for approval of a pacific trade agreement and has started negotiations with europeans. the main beneficiaries of these trade deals are big multinationals. is that corporatist or populist?
the lawsuit was first heard in texas in 2018 by u.s. district judge reed o'connor, who struck down the entire aca as unconstitutional. at the time, the trump administration had not taken that all-or-nothing position but since then has come to support the lawsuit.
patients and their families increasingly want to talk about end-of-life care with their physicians well before facing a terminal illness, studies have shown. most also want to die at home rather than in a hospital, although cultural differences influence end-of-life preferences.
it seems increasingly clear that big, national insurers are having trouble competing in the obamacare marketplaces and making money, said larry levitt, senior vice president at the kaiser family foundation. some insurers are still doing well, particularly those that historically served medicaid beneficiaries.
regardless, now that he's in the oval office and will soon get to appoint one of his own people to run the irs, trump's team is changing course.
in this special debate edition of trail markers, the cbs news political unit gives a rundown of what to watch for from the 10 presidential candidates who made it to the stage plus other political news of the day.
it's still unclear when that health care plan, which mr. trump said would be signed weeks ago, will be released. white house chief of staff mark meadows said the plan has a legislative component and an executive action component.
president-day civil liberties advocates fear session's and trump's views on voter fraud could serve as a basis for them to support voter id laws that disenfranchise poor or minority voters, such as the one in north carolina that was overturned by the supreme court last summer. studies have shown in-person voter fraud, which the laws are designed to prevent, is exceptionally rare. they are also concerned that sessions hailed as 'good news, i think, for the south' a supreme court decision that gutted a critical section of the voting rights act.… one of sessions's early tests will be how — if he is confirmed — his justice department handles a voter id law in texas considered one of the strictest in the country.
otherwise individuals could wait until they become sick to purchase insurance, thus driving up premiums for everyone else, sessions said in his letter to pelosi.

my question is why are we including it and burning up time and promising people they will get a $15 minimum wage increase when we know it is not going to happen, one democratic member told cnn.
simmons-duffin: so like all things health insurance, it's a bit complicated. it depends on where you live, but there are three big buckets to look at. and the first is cobra; so if you worked for an employer with 20 or more workers, you have access to cobra. it's basically exactly the same coverage that you had before, but it can be really expensive - hundreds of dollars in premiums - and your employer isn't chipping in to defray that.
the constitution affords congress several remedies to counter the executive branch's power plays, such as the power of the purse. however, the rapid acceleration of executive overreach warrants a deeper congressional review of this threat to the separation of powers and its checks and balances. just last year, a federal judge indicated the obama administration had used federal funds that weren't appropriated by congress to fund obamacare. when the president does that, the power of the purse wielded by congress is empty and other remedies are needed.
for people losing health insurance coverage due to lost jobs resulting from the pandemic, the federal government would pick up 100% of the cost of cobra (the federal law extending employers' health insurance for workers who lose it).
remember, a giant public works spending package was a key trump promise for the first year of his presidency. but it never moved from talking point to policy proposal so – along with obamacare repeal – will be high on the list of promises not kept when the president's first year in office is scored.
according to a poll conducted last month by the henry j. kaiser family foundation, 64 percent of americans surveyed said they do not want the courts to do this, with 62 percent of respondents saying a candidate's position on pre-existing conditions is very important or the most important factor in whom they will support.
president trump has taken a number of steps to confront the crisis, stem the flow of fentanyl into the country from china and mexico, and step up prosecutions of traffickers. congress also has increased spending on drug treatment.

medical experts, when the policy was first proposed by the majority of democrats running for the presidential nomination in 2019, have admitted that providing taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits to illegal aliens would likely drive a never-ending migration flow of foreign nationals with serious health problems to the u.s.
schilling: i would -- yes, but that's -- i mean, that's why i chose boston over new york to play.
the recommendations signal a strong show of support for the beleaguered health care law, which had been under fierce attack not only from republicans under the trump administration but from progressive democrats who have urged replacing it altogether with a government-run medicare for all system.
trump's disregard for this fiscal profligacy has set a precedent for unnecessary deficits in future administrations. (of course, the deficit incurred more recently in responding to the pandemic was unavoidable and, under the circumstances, beneficial.)
republicans are running on the notion that america is on the ropes and it's obama's fault. they blame him and his policies, particularly the affordable care act or obamacare, for a range of domestic ills including flat wages, high student debt, small businesses unable to survive and people forced into part-time work. much of this has been debunked, but that's been the gop narrative for years and it is unshakeable.
in the end, however, the effort was for naught. leaders couldn't come up with language that would draw enough votes from the two holdout gop factions to overcome the unified opposition of democrats.
matthew edward, 23, came to cpac from illinois. trump was his third choice for president, after ben carson and ted cruz. but on thursday, he roamed the halls in a maga hat, perfectly content with how the administration was operating.
sen. joe donnelly is perhaps the most vulnerable democrat in the senate this election season. donnelly is running for re-election in a state mr. trump won by nearly 20 percentage points. the democrat has been nervously hewing to the center in recent months, denouncing recent progressive battle cries like implementing medicare for all and abolishing u.s. immigration and customs enforcement.
moreover, the progress in growing the exchanges and in covering the uninsured may be stalling. total enrollment on the exchanges barely grew compared to last year, and those who remain uninsured are considered the most difficult to locate and persuade. that's especially true for households that earn too much to qualify for health insurance subsidies.
-- south carolina gov. nikki haley was confirmed as u.s. ambassador to the united nations on tuesday, after a nearly-unanimous senate voted 96-4 in her favor. meanwhile, three cabinet nominees – ben carson for hud, elaine chao for transportation, and wilbur ross for commerce – advanced out of committee. (anne gearan)
the governor said it was incumbent upon state and local officials to work hand in hand to solve not just affordable housing but also homelessness; the state is home to some 130,000 homeless, about a quarter of the nation's homeless population.
proposals like a job guarantee, medicare for all and tuition-free college have moved from the policy fringe on the left toward the mainstream in the democratic party, embraced by some of those interested in challenging trump as the party tries to give voters a clear, memorable outline of what democrats stand for.

the group might be aiming for an unrealistic goal in enacting its plan, despite the gop majorities in congress and a republican president.
elizabeth macdonough was appointed to be the senate parliamentarian in 2012, by then-majority leader harry reid, a democrat. but parliamentarians are shared senate staff and thus expected to be nonpartisan so macdonough was retained when the chamber switched to republican control in 2015.
the question will arise ... which shall rule: wealth or man? which shall lead, money or intellect? who shall fill public stations, educated and patriotic freemen or the feudal serfs of corporate capital?
thank you for serving as an enduring reminder that although my legal principles are prevalent, they have not yet prevailed, walker said. and although we are winning, we have not won, and although we celebrate today, we cannot take for granted tomorrow, or we will lose our courts and our country to critics who call us terrifying and describe us as deplorable.
there are so many of you!
to hear the current mayor of london, and possibly future prime minister of britain tell it, president barack obama harbors a dislike of the u.k. because of an anti-colonial mindset developed by having a kenyan father.
such decreases may happen whenever the government cracks down on immigrants, a new study shows.
just not their view of obamacare, which cut the jenkins' insurance costs. they want to elect a democratic congress to stop the president's attacks on it.
cornish: the honor system. i'm sure there are people worried about fraud, right?
conway agreed and said the administration is making important strides.
eliminating obamacare could leave roughly 20 million more people without health insurance, according to a recent report from the urban institute, an economic and social policy think tank. the president said this week that he will not push for a replacement plan until after the 2020 election.
mccaskill's republican opponent, state attorney general josh hawley, has been criticized by some in his own party for being too distant, and not campaigning with sufficient vigor. mccaskill has also outraised hawley, raking in over $4 million in donations during the second quarter, compared to hawley's $1 million. early polling has generally shown mccaskill ahead, although a poll from the republican firm remington research in july showed hawley edging out mccaskill by two percentage points. mccaskill has also recently been knocked by hawley for using a private plane during a campaign tour.
older americans who buy long-term care insurance and pay for it from their retirement savings would get a generous tax break, too.
block: wirch says democrats made a fatal mistake assuming they had wisconsin in the bag. hillary clinton didn't visit wisconsin once after the primary here, which she lost to bernie sanders by double digits.
and in november 2015, usa today reported that the va had given out $142 million in bonuses to employees in 2014, as incentives or tied to performance reviews. that claim is true.
and, she said, policymakers should reconsider allowing the government to offer health insurance in markets where there's little competition.
they'll use a process called budget reconciliation, not to be confused with talk of unity and political reconciliation. it has been used often for high-profile legislation, including massive tax cuts in 2001, 2003 and 2017 and 2010's affordable care act, also known as obamacare.
millions of american have lost health insurance during the pandemic. biden's coronavirus plan proposes to have the federal government cover 100% of the costs of cobra coverage for the duration of the crisis. so when people lose their employer-based health insurance, they can stay on that insurance, given the moment we are in and the pandemic, says stef feldman, biden's national policy director.
even after trump, an additional 20 million or so americans have health insurance today largely because of obamacare. others have better benefits — like maternity care and addiction treatment — or face lower costs.
in a memo to senior white house staff detailing several recent public polls, mike donilon, one of biden's closest advisers, said of the opposition: rather than being cost free, this approach has been quite damaging to them.
on sunday, president trump said he'd support remote voting. top house democrats have privately floated it, our colleague amber phillips writes. in the senate, there's a new bipartisan proposal to vote remotely for up to 30 days. senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.) has endorsed the idea for an emergency.
however it plays out, what's clear now is that trump's december 2015 announcement calling for a total and complete shutdown of muslims entering the united states until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on is a long way off – and even more measured versions have significant challenges ahead.
republicans have rejected all of those options, arguing that they would entail too much taxation, spending or regulation ― and ultimately do more harm than good. their preferred strategy is to roll back the law's existing regulations and, in many cases, reduce financial assistance. monday's action is consistent with that approach.
while some gop convention speakers stirred fear over crime and rioting, others, such as sen. tom cotton of arkansas and trump himself, framed a win for biden as tantamount to selling the country out to china.
i think he's getting advice from the people in -- his inner circle is smaller than any president in our lifetime.

james tried to deflect the anger by insisting that, notwithstanding his support of repeal, he was committed to preserving protections for people with preexisting conditions. he lost anyway.
sasse said he hopes washington and americans more broadly can recover what he called the importance of civics, which would lower the temperature on disputes like that over barrett's nomination.
yeah, in the debates. and to me, the problem there is, oh, so now you're going to go one-on-one with trump? maybe you're not the guy. this is a problem. this all a game-day decision for me, right? so it's — election's tuesday. so, you know, can trump destroy bloomberg? can he destroy biden? yes and yes, perhaps. who has kind of the better heart, and i think i have that answer, because joe is the guy. i love joe. who has the money to be able to do this? bloomberg does. but biden's victory in south carolina, game changer for me.
we need to start with the basics, which is, first of all, identifying who are enemy is, understanding that this war cannot be won, this enemy and threat cannot be defeated unless we understand what's driving them, what is their ideology. and the fact is when you look at what is happening today, we have over 40 different islamic extremist terrorist groups going by different names. you look at the vast majority of terrorist attacks that are being committed around the world, there's one common element here and it is this radical islamist ideology. and in order to defeat it, we have to do so militarily but simultaneously, it has to be an ideological defeat as well as a political solution that's offered.
jonathan turley, a george washington university law professor who represented the house of representatives in the lawsuit, called the opinion a historic ruling reaffirming congress's power of the purse.
to win, democrats need to do more than just point fingers at republicans and claim they're destroying the aca. candidates need to take it one step further: make medicare for all a central part of their platform.
without the stepped-up immigration enforcement of secure communities, alsan and yang estimate that aca enrollment among latino immigrants would be 22 percent higher.
spicer: it is, but i think as i noted, john, it's very early in this process. we are at the beginning stages of this decision-making process and his team's gonna continue to consult with stakeholders as we get there.
no! sanders replied. i'm just waking up.
medicare now reimburses doctors $86 to discuss end-of-life care in an office visit that covers topics such as hospice, living wills and do-not-resuscitate orders. known as advance care planning, the conversations can also be held in a hospital.
cooper: we're going to take a break. you have been watching infomercials.
what about as your democratic nominee? i mean, what do you —
biden's latest digital ad gives us a peek at what he will try to convey during an unprecedented time in a unique campaign environment:
ouch: democrats are warning a government watchdog to maintain vigorous oversight if the trump administration approves tennessee's waiver request to convert medicaid into a block grant.
a broader question is not how the plan would affect rich households as opposed to the poor, but what it would mean for the u.s. economy overall.
shapiro: this surge of support for biden has really just come in the last few days, and the sanders campaign has been well-resourced and energized for a while. some key states voting today, including california, appear strong for sanders. so what are biden's expectations tonight?
sagal: on wednesday, foxconn, the producer of most of blank's products announced plans to open a factory in wisconsin.
this was an icon in the united states senate. he was lyndon johnson's close adviser. they did the great society together. so, people would criticize richard russell for maybe being on the wrong side of the integration movement, but my goodness he turned around and got the school lunch program done. he did that himself, perdue said at the time. russell was a segregationist who was opposed to the civil rights act.
sen. ted cruz (r-tx), presidential candidate: we are, with this stop, completing the very last stop of the full grassley. we have now been to all 99 counties in the great state of iowa.
we want peace, wherever peace can be found. america is friends today with former enemies. some of our closest allies, decades ago, fought on the opposite side of these world wars. this history should give us all faith in the possibilities for a better world.
soon after, roberts began trying to persuade kennedy to find that the unconstitutional insurance requirement could be severed from the rest of the law. but kennedy -- often a swing vote on high-profile cases -- was firm in his position. he was puzzled, and then put off, by roberts' view that the aca provisions could be severed.
last year, premiums for the benchmark silver plans in these areas increased 2% following the state reviews.
but congress and the administration failed to come to a deal after intense lobbying by hospital and physician groups, and the private equity companies that own medical practices that make tons of money from surprise bills.
but we must do more. it is unacceptable that americans pay vastly more than people in other countries for the exact same drugs, often made in the exact same place. this is wrong, unfair, and together we can stop it.
the administration's plan includes health officials working toward reducing hiv transmissions by 2030 by concentrating efforts in communities with the most hiv infections, dan writes. he also reports trump's remarks have not been finalized and the plan for tuesday evening's address could change.
the biden campaign says the goal is to ensure that all americans have access to regular, reliable and free testing. it would work to double the number of drive-through testing sites and invest in next-generation testing including home tests and instant tests.
trump claimed in michigan that real median household income had increased by $10,000 during his presidency.
but again, i think that when you look net-net, we're going (ph) to do our best every time we can. i'm going to come out here and tell you the facts as i know them. and if we make a mistake, we'll do our best to correct it. but i don't -- i think that as i mentioned the other day, it is a two-way street. there are many mistakes that the media makes all the time. they misreport something, they don't report something, they get a fact wrong. i don't think that's always -- you know, to turn around and say, okay, you were intentionally lying. i think we all try to do our best job, and do it with a degree of integrity in our respective industries.
palin was and remains a beloved figure to many parents with special needs children. but her claim about the health care legislation was as off-base as mccaughey's.
celebrities had a lot to say about wednesday's presidential debate, especially when it came to hillary clinton's white pantsuit and donald trump's nasty woman and bad hombres comments.
perhaps most significant, the biden administration plans to promote the sign-up period heavily, through advertisements, email and other outreach, according to my colleague margot sanger-katz, who's been covering obamacare for most of its existence. biden's people think the trump people bungled the regular enrollment period, margot told me.
let me tell you exactly what my message is: the republican party will soon be known as the party of health care, trump told reporters in a senate corridor during a visit to consult republican lawmakers. you watch.
in a three-page letter to house minority leader nancy pelosi, d-calif., attorney general jeff sessions acknowledged the executive branch has a longstanding tradition of defending the constitutionality of duly enacted statutes if reasonable arguments can be made in their defense. but sessions said this was a rare case and not unprecedented.
collyer blocked her own decision from taking effect while awaiting a likely appeal from the administration.

as for the new york law, the entire premise underlying the anti-abortion fury that erupted following its passage is that women routinely carry pregnancies for nine months and then during delivery order the doctor to abort the baby, for, well, no reason. what woman would do this? it's theoretically possible, but is it really plausible that this is a regular occurrence?

the gop votes in 2015, especially in the senate, were relatively safe ones because it allowed a lot of anti-obama, anti-iran and pro-israel posturing without actually owning the consequences of the deal collapsing, including a very real prospect of another major war in the middle east, said colin kahl, former vice president joe biden's national security adviser.
in addition to the cuts in enrollment assistance and advertising for the sign-up periods, trump has cut two important funding streams to health insurance companies, the second of which his administration halted just days ago. the previous decision to cut off billions in payments owed to insurers resulted in significant premium increases for this year, and the latest one could do the same.
question: elijah cummings, maryland congressman -- democratic maryland congressman, confirmed that president donald trump talked to him at the luncheon about the high price of prescription drugs.
if you'll recall i fought tooth and nail against cromnibus in december because i said in december this gives up our leverage and it puts us into effectively a boxed canyon. so i would say it's now up to leadership to lay out their strategy. i told them this was not a winning strategy and they went down this road anyway fighting tooth and nail.
today, women are the most potent political force in this country. the women's march sparked a movement, and an unstoppable one at that. we're changing everything: our policies, our culture and our media – and come november, we're going to change our representatives in office.
el senador de texas, por su parte, ha criticado a trump en una gama de temas, desde cuando trump apoyó el derecho al aborto en 1999 hasta el uso que trump ha hecho de las leyes de dominio eminente para obtener beneficios personales. él también ha sugerido que trump, quien se ha comprometido a revocar el obamacare, apoya esa ley distintiva del cuidado de la salud, pues apunta a la entrevista de trump del mes de septiembre con «60 minutes», en la cual trump dijo: «todos tienen que ser cubiertos», cuando se le preguntó si apoyaba la atención de salud universal.
he quoted former independent counsel ken starr as saying this was unfortunately a very dark stain against john mccain.
it was equal parts an inside- and outside-the-beltway effort by the white house, aided by congressional democrats involved early, and often, on both the substance and politics of the proposal. supporters were boosted by a continuous run of positive public polling -- which white house officials and congressional leaders made a point of regularly putting in front of their members -- all as they sought to capitalize on state and district-level officials and advocacy groups they knew would hold sway on capitol hill.
all undergraduate students are required to take a minimum of 10 hours in ecce curriculum, according to the university's website.
yet some conservative thinkers have argued while reducing rates could be beneficial, they are already very low by historical standards, and other changes to the tax system might be more important for growth. the document published wednesday does not discuss these new ideas, such as helping taxpayers and firms recover the costs of new investments.
his habitual threats to american businesses have added new uncertainty to investment and trade decisions. he practices mussolini's doctrine of corporatism: the government as puppet master pulling the strings of puppet companies. that economic policy inhibits enterprise and innovation at a time when they are desperately needed.
yeah, like any industry town would be, right? so if you're going to say, the car manufacturers stink, i think detroit would take umbrage to that.
the campaign that never ends: sanders on friday told cnn's jake tapper that superdelegates should be eliminated entirely. in a statement on the dnc's moves saturday, hillary clinton praised other reforms but didn't mention superdelegates at all.
i learned based on the polling data that they want everything that's in the plan, biden said. not a joke. everything that's in the plan.
republicans say that the health law remains potent for them in part because some of its flaws, like rising premium costs, have only begun to be revealed, even as many of its more popular provisions were quickly clear.
as trump navigates his first year in office, his challenge will be keeping these types of voters in the fold as he confronts the tough realities of actual governance. a border wall won't be built quickly, and the repeal of obamacare may never occur. the question is whether workman, edward and many others can forgive a lack of progress as quickly as they forgive trump's idiosyncratic politics.
and third, the bill lowers the value of cost-sharing subsidies for plans, so most people purchasing it would have higher out-of-pocket spending on health care than under current law, the budget office estimated.
large insurers aren't the only ones running into trouble. more than half of the co-op insurers, created and funded by the health reform law, have failed. this means consumers in a growing number of areas have only one or two insurers to pick from.
bernie sanders: but i was not pleased that vice president biden distorted what medicare for all is and, in fact, simply parroted the line coming from the health care industry.
so, rubio's claim at the debate that he never supported cap-and-trade is false. he might not support the idea now, but he helped pave the way for florida to create a cap-and-trade system when he was a state lawmaker.
while the trump administration has made the opioid epidemic a priority, people in communities across the country continue to die in record numbers from fentanyl, and health officials are struggling to provide treatment for tens of thousands more, like the men and women warehoused inside this jail.
and that, according to biden, comes down to a race between him and sanders.
still, anxiety remains, even in sanctuary cities. earlier this year, reuters reported the trump administration was considering making it harder for immigrants to get a green card if they or their u.s.-born children used public assistance programs such as food stamps. advocates say that sent many immigrants into a panic.

5. harley davidson:  harley-davidson should stay 100% in america, with the people that got you your success. i've done so much for you, and then this. other companies are coming back where they belong! we won't forget, and neither will your customers or your now very happy competitors! (6/27/18)
washington — in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the trump administration late thursday urged the supreme court to overturn the affordable care act.
in the senate, minority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) has finally drawn the line, describing greene's views as loony. but it is too little, too late. the party has been encouraging loony views for years. today we rightly laud sen. mitt romney (r-utah) for his political courage — but it's worth recalling that when he was running for president in 2012, he craved donald trump's endorsement. when romney got it, he gushed, there are some things that you just can't imagine happening in your life. later that year, he tacitly endorsed trump's most noxious lie — birtherism — joking that no one's ever asked to see my birth certificate.
but it's also not fair for trump and republicans to characterize democrats as trying to eliminate medicare, when what they want to do is make the popular program accessible to everyone.
andy slavitt, a member of usa today's board of contributors, is a former health care industry executive who ran the affordable care act and the centers for medicare and medicaid services from 2015 to 2017. follow him on twitter: @aslavitt
behind a belief in the necessity of bipartisanship was a faith that it was possible ― a notion that didn't seem as preposterous then as it does now.
it excites a group that democrats desperately need to get to the polls — younger voters, who strongly support it.. and it shows that a candidate is willing to take on special interests on behalf of their constituents.
mr. trump said the public option means socialized medicine.
the closest thing to what palin was describing was a proposed commission on medicare spending. but it was hardly a death panel. its job was to make broad changes in how the program paid for medical services, not sit in judgment of individual patients or their merits.
the idea that nordic nations are little socialist utopias is a gigantic myth. denmark, norway and sweden are absolutely not socialist nations. some parts of their economies have been socialized, like health care and higher education, but they are still market-based economies, and in many respects, their citizens are freer than americans.
the trump administration declared that it no longer will defend the affordable care act from a challenge filed by 20 states because it agrees that the law's individual mandate is unconstitutional and that key parts of the act — including the provisions protecting those with pre-existing conditions — are invalid.
spicer: i'm sure we seated -- i don't -- i can't say -- i'm not really sure why this matters. i mean, 10 people didn't yell that loud.
the answer is, laugh in their faces. the g.o.p. recently rammed through a tax cut, disproportionately benefiting the wealthy, that will probably cost $2 trillion over the next decade — with no offsetting savings. enhanced health care could easily be paid for by rescinding just part of this big giveaway. if republicans won't do that, it's not democrats' problem.
in a statement sent to breitbart news, ashley mcguire, senior fellow with the catholic association, noted the little sisters are currently fighting two battles:
regarding medicaid, all four liberals voted to uphold the program, and roberts joined them. at the same time, he expressed some tentativeness.
pence didn't answer the question, though, at another point in the evening, he said the trump administration has plans to improve health care and protect pre-existing conditions for every american.
kessler's verdict: harris gets two pinocchios for her comment — not an outright lie but misleading. biden administration officials may be proud of what they have accomplished, but they shouldn't suggest that nothing was in place when they walked in the door, he writes.
she cited mistakes politifact claimed to uncover in house speaker paul ryan's remarks, then implied ocasio-cortez could face discrimination because of her latino heritage.
even if they want to spend it exactly as i think they should, it wouldn't be enough, he said.
outgoing senate minority leader harry reid told congressional republicans that people will die if they repeal obamacare, the hill reported.
it remains to be seen whether eight justices will hear the case or nine justices will decide the matter.
but since the tax cut's passage, the trend has been in the other direction. when sen. bernie sanders of vermont...introduced his universal medicare bill last year, he did not immediately say how it would be paid for, dave and jeff note. he had offered a list of potential tax hikes to pay for it but didn't include them in the bill. and in a new ad for her reelection campaign, sen. dianne feinstein (d-calif.), who is facing a challenge this year from her own party, tells california's primary voters that she favors a health care 'public option' and the expansion of medicare to people 55 and older, with no suggestion of how it would be paid for.
people can still sign up for coverage through saturday.
i think people are viewing us as doing a very good job, trump told a questioner. this started in china. how it started, is a question. ... it's gonna all work out. everyone has to be calm.
with dramatic drops in insurance company participation on the exchanges for some states, decreased competition and other factors are leading to often jarring rate hikes. some of the states that are facing what are likely among the biggest increases this year — tennessee, arizona and north carolina — were among those the urban institute reported in may had the biggest increases last year.

wintry weather may hit iowa by monday evening just as iowans head out to caucus. that could be a problem for donald trump and bernie sanders — outsider candidates who need high voter turnout.
trump claimed in michigan and at the iowa rally to have eliminated the estate tax, saying at the rally of his 2017 tax law: because of that, there is no death tax or inheritance tax.
the facts: it's true that, under trump's leadership, the food and drug administration has approved more generic drugs than in the past. that's one important mechanism for bringing down drug prices, but many of those approved generics have not actually made it to market, robertson said.
what should we do about long-term care, the elephant that doesn't even fit in this room, she said. we need to make it easier for people to get long-term care insurance, we need to make it easier for them to pay for their premiums.
on monday, they used it to talk about what they called the real subject of the proceedings this week: the desire by president trump and republicans to sink the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, via a ruling from the high court.
the trump administration announced its new rule the following october that would protect the nuns and other religious non-profits from being coerced by the federal government to provide services in their healthcare plans that violate their faith beliefs.
there's a, you know, a tremendous excitement i think in the diplomatic corps and at the world leader level of people who are excited that president trump and this administration want to engage. there is a lot of times when he's talking to these folks and they're saying, i have not heard from anyone in years. and i think that there is a genuine excitement to reengage the united states, especially in the area of trade and other economic interests, but also in the area of national security.
democrats outnumber republicans by more than 4-1 in the majority-black district, which includes a significant portion of baltimore, as well as parts of baltimore and howard counties.
mary watched racing cars and 1) didn't experience any ptsd and 2) looked like her whole body had been botoxed.
the failure to pass the bill represents a devastating defeat for trump and ryan ― and throws into doubt a crusade that has defined republican politics for over seven years.
biden's platform also embraces state medicaid home- and community-based care for low-income adults. its $450 billion initiative targets getting 800,000 people off waiting lists for community care.
rosen called trump's nevada trip heller's reward for backing trump's agenda.
one way to take the temperature of the republican party's ongoing tumult this election cycle is to consult the national review, the conservative magazine founded in 1955 by william f. buckley. the magazine has been so opposed to donald trump that it pitched its entire january issue against his candidacy. a number of right-leaning luminaries contributed, warning primary voters that the reality tv mogul's continued rise could doom the conservative project writ large.
five thousand police, backed by 1,400 national guardsman, greeted the 35,000 protesters descending on washington that day, according to the american civil liberties union
he gave a similar answer when asked by a voter how he would bring us together. the voter noted that a relative had banished trump supporters from the family.
sen. amy klobuchar of minnesota came in a strong third with almost 20 percent, while sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts trailed at a distant fourth with just over 9 percent. former vice president joe biden was in fifth place with just over 8 percent. no other candidate managed to reach even 4 percent of the vote.
that's something democrats are homing in on. look: no one likes this bill, said senate minority leader chuck schumer. hospitals, doctors, governors. conservatives, liberals, nonpartisan groups. and most of all, the people who would no longer have affordable health care.
members also are eager to avoid any kind of embarrassing or dramatic leadership showdown like the one that transpired in 2015.
on one hand, obamacare definitely did reduce the number of americans without health insurance. on the other, it also massively increased insurance premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums for millions of americans. thanks to insurers narrowing their networks and many fleeing obamacare's exchanges, many of us who liked our doctors, or our insurance plans, didn't get to keep either.
i'm not going to vote for him because he and barack are friends, said phyllis pelzer, 53, of orangeburg. a lot of black people see biden as a good guy because he was obama's guy, but i don't care nothing about that. all of em' got some black friends somewhere. you can't win because you have a black friend.
the kaiser family foundation estimates there are 5.7 million people who are not eligible for financial subsidies under obamacare, and who would have to pay for the entirety of their private insurance plan. cobra too is cost-prohibitive for many families. the average monthly cost for individual coverage in an employer-sponsored plan is $490, amounting to nearly $6,000 a year — a steep cost for someone without an income.
the high cost of insurance, even with the affordable care act in place, has been a major source of discontent with the law, especially among people in relatively good health who were able to purchase insurance previously ― and who had to pay more after the law took effect, because insurers for the first time were covering bills from people with severe medical needs.
reality check: fiorina on the department of veterans affairs
that caused sen. mitt romney, r-utah, to say he can't understand why trump would go after mccain, whom he called heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and god.
if we are guided by the well-being of american citizens then i believe republicans and democrats can work together to achieve an outcome that has eluded our country for decades.
the phrase death panels became part of america's political vocabulary in 2009, when republicans were trying to stop the legislation that eventually became the affordable care act.
and a member of the senate intelligence committee tells cnn there's no reason to believe isis is, in his words, moving beyond what until now have been aspirations to attack the u.s. homeland.

kelly: i'm almost out of time. i've got to get this in quickly. to those who say many presidents have issued executive orders on immigration, none near this sweeping, what say you?
during an interview wednesday, ryan said he had thoughts on who should succeed him, but he wouldn't weigh in yet.
you can't expect a newbie to perform like an incumbent, but both mitt romney and donald trump carried the district by 11 percentage points. there are 68 gop-held u.s. house districts with a more democratic lean than ohio's 12th. democrats only need to pick up 23 of them to grab the majority and subpoena power over the trump administration.
the claim: think of it, a lottery. you pick people. now, let me ask you. so these countries that are sending people in — do you think they are sending us their finest?
jake harper, byline: thanks for having me.
but it is also the sternest measure by far of his 16-month-old tenure as speaker, and of his leadership style, salesmanship, deal-making skills and capacity to corral a gop caucus united against obamacare but divided over what should take its place.
another group - and this a follow-up on cbn's question a moment ago, when we have the march for life here in washington, you've said that this is a pro-life president, what concrete promises is he making? we haven't heard a lot about what that policy is going to look like.
at a senate confirmation hearing on tuesday, none of the committee's 22 senators asked becerra about his reported support for providing taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits to the roughly 11 to 22 million illegal aliens in the united states ,even as at least 30 million americans are uninsured.
some analysts have suggested that the house amendment sought by conservatives to allow states to waive some of the health law's regulations might run afoul of the senate's byrd rule, which limits what can be included in a budget reconciliation measure.
the us has not just now become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012, according to the us government's energy information administration -- under the very obama administration trump is accusing of perpetrating a war on the industry.
closing lines:`we can't return to the same old approach,' and other closing lines from the democratic debate
detrow: sanders and his wife, jane, spoke with weigel after the event. and sanders supporters have since set up an online fundraising effort to help him with those bills. after carson city, it was on to reno in las vegas. nevada is the third state up in the presidential contest. that's due largely to the influence of one man, former senate majority leader harry reid. reid's retired now and battling cancer. but he's still paying close attention, and he's still in touch with the 2020 candidates. so i drove to his house in the las vegas suburbs.
it's important to study health policy in a more quantitative manner, and i think we're seeing an increasing number of research studies on these kinds of topics, he said. this research just sort of fits in with a growing trend of research in this area.
borger: right. well, they believe that.
levin: i want to ask you this, i don't want the public to know this. you haven't complained about this to me at all. i'm the one who keeps bringing it up.
there are plenty of fair critiques of medicare-for-all, as envisioned by sens. bernie sanders (i-vt.), elizabeth warren (d-mass.), rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.) and other liberal democrats. it would massively inflate federal spending and could prompt provider shortages if the payment rates were set too low.
in the meanwhile, people are dying, and that's haunted me, said madras, a harvard medical school professor who served in the drug czar's office during the george w. bush administration.
as to your comments [in thursday's halftime report], who knows? but like most americans i want to do the patriotic thing to help staunch the contagion. thus, i have ordered t shirts from zazzle inscribed, 'don't shed on me.' – paul thomson, edmond, okla.
but of course, you're not supposed to imagine that, much less conduct hard research into any aspect of the absolutely forbidden notion that government makes problems worse by subsidizing them.
then, on a day in which sanders flew from utah to minnesota to vermont, everything changed. buttigieg, who had dropped out the night before, endorsed biden. minnesota sen. amy klobuchar did the same. so did former texas rep. beto o'rourke, who had ended his campaign months earlier.

perhaps most interestingly about this story of sethi surrounding himself—by choice and with his campaign staff hiring decisions—with never trumpers is the fact that sethi refuses in any respect to address it at all.
but kaine and bennet did add in some new elements aimed at lowering coverage costs. medicare-x would:
the measure – included by democrats in the sweeping coronavirus legislation they're trying to soon pass – is a key way president biden and democrats are hoping to further expand health coverage, after the 2010 affordable care act made progress toward that end but still fell short of closing the uninsured gap. about 33 million americans lacked coverage in 2019, and more have probably joined their ranks since then amid pandemic-related job losses.
winning house passage thursday would be a huge but provisional victory. the bill would still face daunting odds in the senate.
but it was all based on nothing. mccaughey's influence enrages actual policy experts who read legislation and accurately dissect the implications of new programs. as the typically measured ezra klein put it in the washington post in 2009: betsy mccaughey is really just a horrible, evil, awful, lying person who wants to make the world worse for people because that's her ticket to increased tv time. there's no other way to put it.
i was in vegas the other day and someone said 'don't put your chips on a number on the wheel that isn't even on the wheel.' that's the problem, klobuchar said, noting that majorities of house and senate democrats and numerous democratic governors don't support the approach.
in the last eight years, the past administration has put on more new debt than nearly all other presidents combined.

i mean, you're talking about integrity and you're talking about telling the truth and facts. i don't know that it wasn't malicious at all, and i'm not saying. but there is a point at which we have a right to go out there and correct the record. and i think that over and over again, there is this attempt to go after this president and say, well, that can't be true and that's not right and the numbers weren't there.
jeff, what is the sanders campaign telling you about how they will determine if iowa turns out to be a success?
under such a scheme, people have very little power over their own lives. even their homes are owned collectively. in the case of democratic socialism, this means that people are forced to live according to the desires of the majority. in many situations, a small group of people is given power by the majority, and that group typically ends up becoming tyrannical, as we've seen in china, north korea and venezuela.

coming up, the latest polls in iowa show bernie sanders just barely behind hillary clinton. her lead within the poll's margin of error. that's why tonight is so fascinating, so important. the question is can sanders pull out a victory in the heartland? i'll speak with someone who wrote the book on him, next.
after iran tested a long-range missile ― something not covered by the agreement ― then-national security adviser michael flynn went before the white house press corps to deliver a bellicose response. but just hours later, top national security council staff in a briefing with those same reporters acknowledged that iran was still complying with the agreement and said that the united states would continue to comply as well.
the house speaker reacted to trump's threat to withhold federal money to fight wildfires in california:
drug traffickers kill so many thousands of our citizens every year, trump said. and that's why my department of justice will be seeking so many much tougher penalties than we've ever had, and we will be focusing on the penalty that i talked about previously for the big pushers, the ones that are really killing so many people. and that penalty is going to be the death penalty.
anyone and everyone who looked at all freaky ... was scooped up off the street, one protester said, according to an aclu article. a federal court later agreed, saying, the innocent as well as the guilty were in large numbers swept from the streets and placed in detention facilities.

in the days that followed house speaker john boehner's retirement announcement, mccarthy, the then-majority leader, stepped up to run for speaker, but was rebuffed by conservatives who put forth a competing candidate. in a stunning move, mccarthy withdrew his name during a conference-wide election and the leadership election was postponed.
kodjak: well, that was a pretty different picture. almost half of those people said that they didn't like the health care system in their state. they like their own doctor, but they didn't like the way the whole system worked. it's a little like people's attitudes toward congress. you know, they like their own congressman. they keep re-electing him. but they say they hate the institution of congress. so we were trying to figure out what's going on there. and so we talked to georges benjamin. he's the head of the american public health association. and here's what he said.
question: but -- but in terms of the crowd size issue, why bring that up at the cia? and why did you come out saturday afternoon to talk about that? did he tell you, sean, i'm upset about this, i want you to come out and --
on friday, he signaled both options remained on the table. and more pointedly, doubled down on his argument in favor of some kind of ban.
unlike flake, ward is unequivocal in her support for a wall along america's southern border, rightly claiming that national security begins with border security. she has proposed a border security bill that includes funding and starting of trump's border wall, which would include 24/7 high tech monitoring accessible by the public online.
shapiro: and what are you hearing from voters that you're talking to?
no, i think that is right. when you create this hierarchy of human value, and you feel that there are only so many rungs on that ladder, and if someone gets on your rung, that means you have nowhere to go but down — that can apply to immigrants, different kinds of immigrants over different time, that can apply to women coming into the workforce, et cetera. but i will say that for me, it was important to note that the zero-sum racial hierarchy is a story that has been relentlessly packaged and marketed and sold by people who benefit the most from the economic status quo. it is not something that is a predominant white working class idea on its own. everything we believe comes from a story we've been told.

the purpose of the meeting is to get the president's agenda moving through congress. the american people are frustrated with the lack of progress here in washington and the president wants no delay in addressing our most pressing issues. he's taking every step -- opportunity to forge strong bonds with congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle. one of the other subjects that's sure to come up is the status of his nominees during this meeting.

hospitalization for chest pain can result in a bill from the same hospital, for the same services, ranging anywhere from $3,000 to $25,000 or more. a simple blood test for cholesterol can range from $10 to $400 or more at the same lab.

harmel says most of his covered california clients earn too much to qualify for the federal subsidies that reduce monthly premiums. he said most are paying more now than they did before the law and didn't need the new rules to be able to buy insurance. a forced coverage system is not the answer, he said.
rep. john lewis (d-ga) told msnbc's chris matthews on hardball on monday that president donald trump feels at home with recent acts of racist violence, citing trump's comments on the charlottesville riots in 2017 as proof.

lewis, who was infamously beaten during a civil rights march across the edmund pettus bridge in selma, alabama, in 1965, has been known to put the heroism of his distinguished past to partisan use.

sanders repeated an old, misleading claim that 83% of the benefits from the republican tax law go to the top 1% of income earners. that won't be true until 2027, when most of the individual income tax changes expire unless congress extends them.
a highly respected career lawyer at the justice department has decided to resign just days after the trump administration backed a controversial lawsuit that would wreck part of the affordable care act.

soon, state after state postponed their primaries, and sanders didn't have any chances to gain ground on biden, whose delegate lead had grown to more than 300.
democrats can celebrate, but they cannot be complacent. they will have to expose and fight any efforts by the trump administration to sabotage the affordable care act through regulation. they should propose a package of improvements to make the aca work better and dare trump — and the dozen or so non-right-wing republicans who helped block the trump-ryan bill — to join them.
he sees a chance for democrats to flip the state if they make it a priority, just as he is.

anchor bret baier noted that trump, when campaigning, had promised to erase the national debt within eight years -- but nevertheless had approved $4.6 trillion in new debt already.
supporters like gerald griggs, a vice president of the state n.a.a.c.p. chapter, reject such descriptions as inaccurate — and also hear in them a coded effort to scare off white voters.
we have to return the u.s. to the paris agreement and lead the world in reducing the pollution that causes climate change, obama said. but science tells us we have to go much further – that it's time for us to accelerate progress on bold new green initiatives that make our economy a clean energy innovator, save us money and secure our children's future.
the house energy and commerce health subcommittee holds a hearing on the gop-led lawsuit to overturn the aca and the impact on people with pre-existing conditions on wednesday.
many insurers found enrollees have higher health care needs than expected, forcing them to hike rates. a recent kaiser study found the benchmark silver plan premiums are projected to rise 10% for 2017, on average, for a 40-year-old consumer in 14 major cities. that's double the 5% increase for 2016 policies, but it could change since state regulators often reduce insurers' rate requests.
sagal: on wednesday, president trump announced plans to nominate kansas governor blank as ambassador of religious freedom.
biden has talked about making sure americans don't spend more than 30% of their income on housing. biden says he will seek a tax credit for renters who make too much to receive section 8 vouchers but still need help covering their rent, and fully fund the section 8 program for those who qualify.
without a quick resolution to this matter, this action will significantly increase 2019 premiums for millions of individuals and small-business owners and could result in far fewer health plan choices, scott serota, president and ceo of the blue cross blue shield association, said in a statement. it will undermine americans' access to affordable coverage, particularly for those who need medical care the most.
sanders delivered the speech at a tenuous moment in his second presidential bid. his standing has dropped in many national- and state-level polls, putting warren and harris within striking distance of his second-place standing, as all three scramble to overcome the substantial lead biden continues to enjoy.
that's not the case in trump vs. amazon.

jacki olsen: i would just like to see something change. i felt like the democrats just couldn't get anything done.
to me, one of the trickiest things about this is that we are likely to end up with a vaccine — the j&j — that is showing somewhat less effectiveness than these amazing first two that came out of the gate and is also most appropriate for rural settings, low-resource settings, settings without really great freezers, alison buttenheim, an associate professor of nursing and health policy at the university of pennsylvania, told stat news.
what we're looking for? on the republican side, remember, it's complicated because we have so many candidates. we're expecting, of course, marco rubio to be in play tonight if you believe the polls. one of the big question is how does donald trump do? and obviously, ted cruz, they're in alphabetic order right now, the senator here.
the parties typically able to negotiate a deal whereby employees have their entire tuition bill covered. under more traditional tuition reimbursement plans, the company money functioned as sort of voucher that offset the cost partly, but not completely. but this new setup also means that to receive the benefit, employees have to attend specific schools and in some cases earn specific credentials.
brat suggested, we have to get back to our basic issues. they will lose on the basic issues. obamacare is still the law of the land. the promise was that you can keep your doctor [and that] prices will stay down. none of that was true. we need to get back to our pillars.
the term gaslighting gets overused these days, but there's no better way to describe what trump is perpetrating. his claims about these executive orders are entirely detached from reality and his claims about his own record on health care range between completely made-up to highly exaggerated.
jayapal continued that she had worked closely with mcgovern, who is a medicare for all advocate himself, and said she was grateful for his leadership.
gosar: there are some pretenses there. this is a way, especially when you have the speaker now acknowledging that there's, we've got some problems that we're running into headwinds. and you know those headwinds, if you talk to people on the street, is that 'trust is a series of promises kept. please tell us how you kept your promises. you said you were going to repeal and replace obamacare, you didn't. you said that you were going to build a wall, you haven't and you failed to even put money there for the president to do it. and then you've consistently beat down the american public by putting omnibus bills that go into deficit spending like $1.3 trillion and then give really the concerted effort and gavel of the spending to nancy pelosi, chuck schumer, to california to new york, who are never going to vote for you.' so from that standpoint, here's something that's a goodwill gesture to get the american people believing that congress actually does represent the people and it starts in the peoples' house.
between may and august 2018, an additional 10,520 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, the most recent time period for which cdc data is available. colton gutknecht, 20, a fashion design student from peoria, ariz., was one of them.
circumstances could always change. but for now, it looks like those reservations have left the proposal without the support it needs to get through congress ― as part of this new spending bill and, perhaps, as part of any other legislation this year.

and on top of everything else, republicans were fighting an increasingly skeptical public. multiple polls have suggested the gop measure is deeply unpopular, while the law it aimed to replace, long the subject of controversy and the object of scorn among conservatives, is now becoming more popular.
but i also think we are here on the first working day. we're announcing theresa may coming this friday. we're excited to have the prime minister here. as i said, we already talking about setting up a meeting with canada and mexico. he's talked to prime minister netanyahu about having him come over. and then as i mentioned, president el-sisi.
the law also expanded medicaid benefits to a wider range of needy individuals. the money for about 90% of that expansion would come from the federal government. but it would come with a strict condition: if states did not broaden their programs as dictated they would lose all medicaid funds.

fifteen were charged with disrupting congress and 166 were charged with crowding, disrupting or incommoding, with 23 of those facing an additional charge of resisting arrest, according to capitol police
demonstrators said mr. trump has attacked everything they stand for, from his crackdown on immigration to his party's response to climate change and the environment. meanwhile, supporters of the president have followed his lead, turning on the media and saying they're glad to see mr. trump fighting back.
legitimate pricing also means networks would be obsolete, along with the administrative burdens, tremendous costs and limitations on patient choice they impose.

we don't know what prompted devos to craft this gross misstatement and to implement this wholesale abandonment of protections for students and taxpayers against waste, fraud, and abuse by predatory for-profit colleges. we can only remind you that robert eitel, senior counselor to devos, was, when he joined the department, an executive at bridgepoint education, a predatory for-profit college company repeatedly caught engaging in fraudulent behavior, and before that was at career education corp., a predatory for-profit college company repeatedly caught engaging in fraudulent behavior; eitel reportedly committed when he arrived to recuse himself from matters related to those schools and from the department's review of the gainful employment rule, but apparently not to issues related to for-profit colleges generally. we also can tell you that devos herself invested money in for-profit education, that republicans in congress have long done the bidding of the for-profit college industry, which has donated big money to the gop, and that devos's boss donald trump owned his own for-profit real estate university, whose predatory practices were similar to practices of for-profit colleges that stand to benefit from devos's trashing of the obama rules.

levin: all common sense, but they reject it. they don't reject it because it's irrational or bad policy or bad for the country. they reject it because it's bad for their own political fortunes and yet they have a propaganda machine at cnn and msnbc and in the new york times day-in day- out, you were talking about your kids. they have academia in their back pocket with tenured professors who are mostly hardcore left-wing and much like you in sports.
when roberts cast the decisive vote to uphold the landmark health care law in 2012, he linked its penalty for people who refused to obtain insurance to congress' taxing power. roberts' final decision, which came after multiple changes in his reasoning, saved obamacare but generated intense friction inside and outside the court.
white house allies professed confusion over the president's tactics, they report. for republicans who have tried to stick with the mercurial president, the shifting goal posts have been frustrating. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) has said he will not allow a vote on any bill to reopen the government unless he receives assurances from the white house that trump supports it. 'it's always difficult,' said sen. john cornyn (r-tex.), when the person you're negotiating with is someone who changes their mind.'
a 16-day shutdown in 2013 stemmed from a fight over funding for the affordable care act, also known as obamacare. unable to repeal president barack obama's signature health care law, republicans in congress approved a temporary measure that would fund the government but would cut funding to implement obamacare. the senate, controlled by democrats, rejected the plan. the standoff ended when republicans conceded defeat and a deal was worked out to reopen the government.
poor women in sub-saharan africa stand to be the biggest losers from trump's order, our kevin sieff reports from nairobi: in practice, experts say, that policy will freeze millions of dollars in funding that has gone to critical health treatment, including hiv testing and neonatal care. the united states does not fund any abortion services overseas, but many health groups receive american assistance to provide other women's services, while using different funding sources to provide abortion counseling and procedures. now, those organizations will have to stop providing abortion services if they want to continue to receive u.s. aid for their other programs. the policy is known as the 'global gag rule' because it even restricts references to abortion in counseling sessions….

obamacare is a disaster. you know it. we all know it. it's going up at numbers that nobody's seen worldwide. nobody's ever seen numbers like this for health care. only gets worse. their method of fixing it is to go back and ask congress for more and more money. we have almost $20 trillion in debt. obamacare will never work. it's very bad. very bad health insurance. far too expensive. and not only expensive for the person that has it, unbelievably expensive for our country. one of the biggest line items very shortly.
if she's president of the united states, nothing is ever going to happen...she's all talk. it doesn't get done.
lower-income enrollees could have their premiums eliminated completely for the same period, and those collecting unemployment benefits could sign up for coverage with no premiums in 2021.
and for that reason, we need to be particularly vigilant here at home, working with state and local law enforcement, working with the public through campaigns such as if you see something, say something.
this is actually an argument that alexander and collins have sometimes made to their colleagues ― that it's in the gop's self-interest to find bipartisan agreement on policies to reduce health insurance premiums. it looks like that argument is not carrying the day.
in her remarks to supporters, collins acknowledged the political polarization of the moment, presenting herself as a someone who can work to build consensus.
the president noted that he hadn't spoken to former president obama since the 2018 funeral for president george h.w. bush, in part because of lingering animosity about that administration.
what the gop bill would have done
meanwhile, aguilar, the program manager for community health initiative of kern county, said roughly six people are referred to his organization each month by a local cancer center. they have been diagnosed with cancer or another serious illness but don't have insurance, he said.
roots in politics: kavanaugh was a member of lawyers for bush-cheney during the 2000 campaign and was a regional coordinator for the campaign. he also participated in the florida recount and served as a white house counsel to george w. bush and then staff secretary until 2006, when bush appointed him to his current position on the federal bench. (he was originally appointed in 2003, but democrats argued he was too partisan and his nomination was held up for three years.) no one else on the president's current list can rival kavanaugh for washington credentials, scotusblog notes.
in 2008, the department of homeland security started a partnership, the secure communities program, that cross-checked the fingerprints of people arrested at the local level with the agency's database of deportable individuals. the program ran until 2014, and was reinstated last year. it resulted in the deportation of more than 363,000 immigrants charged with crimes.
when ryan was pushing president trump to support an unpopular and unsuccessful healthcare plan at the beginning of his first term—an obamacare replacement that critics derisively called ryancare—the deal fell apart, a ryan failure that hurt trump in his first few months as president. meadows, working with republican members like now former rep. tom macarthur (r-nj), revived, reformed, strengthened, and secured house passage of the gop healthcare plan.
4. what is that case about?
obama's willingness to wade into the national conversation – and offer not-so-oblique criticisms of trump – is something of a break from presidential tradition. typically, ex-presidents largely avoid any sort of engagement on the policies of their successor. george w. bush, for example, virtually disappeared during obama's term. (worth noting: bush's vice president, dick cheney, was an early and active critic of obama.)
this isn't an uncommon pattern in presidential politics: in an effort to secure support from primary voters, who tend to be more politically extreme, candidates espouse positions that are further from center. the challenge, though, is that candidates might become committed to positions that become liabilities with the necessarily more-moderate electorate that votes in the general.
we eliminated the very unpopular obamacare individual mandate penalty — and to give critically ill patients access to life-saving cures, we passed right to try.
the health care law expanded medicaid to tens of thousands of previously uninsured patients, providing new revenue streams for rural hospitals, which often serve a poorer, sicker patient population. the law also created a program that allowed some of these facilities to buy prescription drugs at a discount, though highlands qualified for that program independently of obamacare.
opioid funding is just one bullet point in a list of health-care priorities included in the potential deal. a few of the other biggies:
political scientist josh pacewicz argued that trump's popularity in the rust belt was the result of undirected populist resentment at a technocratic, corporate-friendly elite. the corporate-friendly elite might as well be the name of the trump administration's softball team, if they had ever heard of softball.
moreover, trump had delivered a televised statement from the white house the day before. racism is evil — and those who cause violence in its name are criminals and thugs, including kkk, neo-nazis, white supremacists, and other hate groups are repugnant to everything we hold dear as americans, he said, as cnn noted.
a 1998 investigation by the u.s. department of health and human services found that 30 percent of children under 6 years old in the community had elevated lead levels, which can damage the developing brain. but people continued to live in the apartment complex until it was deemed uninhabitable in 2016.
the consensus among experts — including infectious disease expert anthony s. fauci and other senior officials on trump's coronavirus task force — is that restaurants, bars, schools, offices and other gathering places should remain closed for many more weeks to mitigate the outbreak, the worst effects of which are yet to be felt in the united states, our colleagues write. but trump has been chafing against that notion and impatient to get american life back to normal.
i ask, 'does it pass the jimmy kimmel test?'  cassidy, a medical doctor, said in may of republican health care proposals. will a child born with congenital heart disease be able to get everything she or he would need in the first year of life? i want it to pass the 'jimmy kimmel test.' 
a group of 20 democratic states appealed. defenders of the affordable care act argued that the issues raised by the case are too important to let the litigation drag on for months or years in lower courts.
washington, dc - may 08: u.s. president donald trump announces his decision to withdraw the united states from the 2015 iran nuclear deal in the diplomatic room at the white house may 8, 2018 in washington, dc. after two and a half years of negotiations, iran agreed in 2015 to end its nuclear program in exchange for western countries, including the united states, lifting decades of economic sanctions. since then international inspectors have not found any violations of the terms by iran.

-- trump's top economic adviser gary cohn is leaving his post at goldman sachs with a payout of more than $100 million, according to a late filing from the investment bank. goldman says it paid cohn $65 million in cash for long-term bonuses he was owed, cnn money reports. it also sped up stock awards worth $35 million and lifted restrictions on $23 million in locked-up goldman shares so cohn could sell them.
kaufman's overarching point is that this question from 1873 is not asked once and answered. it is a question posed repeatedly in every generation, and every generation must provide its own answer.
and with demonstrators flooding town hall meetings to rail against republicans' health care plan, or a convincing lack thereof, full repeal seems a long ways off.
trump has spent the entire first two years of his presidency playing to his hardcore base – and, seen through that lens, the decision to re-litigate the aca fight makes some sense. but trump won't win a second term solely on the strength of his base. and by picking the obamacare scab, trump is energizing and inflaming democrats and many independents. and that is a major political mistake.
senate minority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., criticized the move, saying it will run over the consciences of american taxpayers and put them back on the hook for funding abortions overseas.

during the senate's consideration of walker for the us trial court spot in 2019, he was guarded about his aca views.
trump said at the iowa rally that democratic presidential candidate joe biden drew a speech crowd so small that the campaign turned it into a roundtable discussion, roping in unwitting attendees to answer questions like, what do you think of socialism?
it seems yet another glitch is forcing a delay in a piece of the health law. this time it's how much more insurers can charge smokers. coupled with last week's announcements of other delays, could there be trouble ahead for the law?
bernie sanders is on a roll. after a strong showing in iowa and new hampshire, and berning through nevada, the socialist senator from vermont is without a doubt the democrat front-runner.
at any rate, i am going to go ahead and hedge my overall portfolio a little bit here. i'm going to buy a first tranche of puts with expirations dated out into november and december. the puts are:
democracy can buckle when we give in to fear, he said at one point. so just as we, as citizens, must remain vigilant against external aggression, we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are.
then, in 2019, barrett joined a dissent from the denial of rehearing of a challenge to an indiana law that would have required doctors to notify the parents of a minor seeking an abortion. a three-judge panel found the law was unconstitutional.
warren: look; what families have to deal with is cost - total cost.
i mean, look, dana, if there's one thing that i think you would acknowledge i've been willing to do is take on my own party when my own party is not standing for the principles we're supposed to stand for. it is time to see some senate democrats willing to take on their own president but right now they're putting partisan politics ahead of principle and that's why they're filibustering the funding for homeland security. it's the wrong thing to be doing.
the data points again to six companies that distributed the majority of the pain pills -- mckesson corp., cardinal health, walgreens, amerisourcebergen, cvs and walmart made up 76 percent of the oxycodone and hydrocodone pills shipped during those years. the volume of pills distributed skyrocketed as the epidemic claimed more lives. from 2006 through 2014, more than 130,000 americans died from prescription opioids, steven, scott and sari write. the number of pills shipped went from 8.4 billion in 2006 to 12.8 billion in 2011. pill distribution started to decline slightly in 2012, and the additional data shows that, by 2014, the number of pills distributed was 11.8 billion.
just last year, in 2019, zach wamp sent out a number of other tweets attacking trump and siding with both the late sen. john mccain (r-az) and mccain's daughter meghan mccain:
he campaigned on a pledge to expand the program by offering a government-provided alternative to private insurance that's known as a public option, a proposal he's called bidencare. it would be available to all americans, including those who get their insurance through work. low-income americans would be automatically enrolled and, if eligible, their premiums would be free. biden's plan also envisions expanding obamacare tax credits to try making premiums more affordable for middle-income households. his plan set him apart from the progressive wing of the democratic party, which has pushed the idea of achieving universal coverage by scrapping private insurance and replacing it with medicare for all.
a couple of weeks ago i had a problem, he said. they came over the gate and put their tent inside, right in front of the front door. it's like . . . the audacity. and if you complain, what are you? oh, one of the establishment elite? no, i'm a bloke that's worked hard for his money and i expect to be able to use my own front door.
as kimmel drove home his points, the audience groaned. those groans revealed something else — the audience, not unexpectedly, was not familiar with the details of the cassidy plan, which is co-sponsored by sen. lindsey graham, r-s.c.
read details of biden's plans below.
biden has repeatedly said americans earning less than $400,000 a year won't pay a cent more in taxes. but those earning above that threshold could lose their tax cuts and pay a bit more.

but thursday, at the filing deadline for the case, the justice department submitted a brief that sided with the states.
the senate office building that schumer is proposing to re-name is currently named for richard b. russell, a former democratic senator from georgia who served from 1933 to 1971.
the next place to look is the insurance exchanges set up under the affordable care act. losing health insurance that you got through your job is considered a qualifying event to enroll in a plan on all the health insurance exchanges. that means you can go to healthcare.gov or your state-run exchange and shop for a new plan. the kaiser family foundation has a handy subsidy calculator so you can see what you might pay in premiums for these plans — remember that your unemployment benefits count as income on the exchanges. again, you only have 60 days to choose this option after losing coverage (unless you live in a state that's created a special enrollment period), so be sure and enroll in that time window.

schumer said that he is planning to re-introduce legislation to re-name the russell senate office building after mccain, describing him as an american hero.
we are concerned that since most osha inspections were done remotely during the pandemic, hazards may go unidentified and unabated longer, with employees being more vulnerable to hazardous risk exposure while working, the inspector general wrote.
losing workplace coverage is a qualifying life event that will allow you to sign up for a plan on the obamacare exchange even outside open enrollment. that means you could be eligible for subsidies to help you afford coverage. be sure to look into that option, because it may be cheaper than cobra coverage.
she pointed out that the administration had launched an opioid prevention ad campaign. dogs are being trained to detect fentanyl at ports of entry. congress directed the u.s. postal service to start electronically tracking packages from foreign countries. the cdc has begun improving overdose collection data to provide a clearer picture of what is happening on the ground. the administration has formed an opioid cabinet with representatives from key government agencies, and conway said they secured an additional $6 billion from congress to combat the crisis.
tuesday's oral arguments will offer the first hints of how she and the rest of the justices view this case, although an actual ruling will likely wait several months, maybe even until the spring.
levin: not hegel, who would come a little later, but was somewhat of a contemporary and rousseau, who was followed by the french and then they had 10 years of terrorism and the french revolution. the reason why there had to be a civil rights movement is because there was resistance, that word, particularly in the south among the old democrats and the democratic party.
before we get to that, i want to ask about what you just heard the report about kayla mueller. you heard her say that she knew the risks of going into a place like syria. the state department advises u.s. citizens not to do that.

trump was referring to house impeachment votes he lost -- but where 196 or more republicans voted in his favor, with none against. he lost an october vote to set the rules of the impeachment inquiry 232-196 , then the december votes on the two articles of impeachment, 230-197 and 229-198
in pennsylvania, 625,000 people enrolled in the expanded medicaid program. close to 300,000 came from rural areas, said andy carter, president of the hospital and health system association of pennsylvania.

the coronavirus pandemic poses both a public health and an economic crisis. squarely in the middle of those concerns are fears about medical bills and loss of employer-provided health insurance.
trump's nominee to lead the office of management and budget, rep. mick mulvaney (r-s.c.), defended his support for cuts to popular entitlement programs that trump vowed to keep intact during the campaign. from ylan q. mui: in appearances before the senate budget and homeland security committees … mulvaney presented himself as a 'straight shooter' and said he would continue to warn about the growing costs of social security and medicare.... 'my job … is to be completely and brutally honest with him,' he said. … mulvaney said he remains in favor of raising the retirement age for social security to 70 but emphasized that he would not reduce benefits for current recipients. he also reiterated his support for means-testing to qualify for medicare.

borger: eventually. it takes long time.
as we've documented extensively in the health 202 (check out our recent history of preexisting condition protections), trump's administration has taken repeated steps to undermine the aca's ban on insurers from refusing coverage to patients with preexisting conditions or charging them more.
barrett has said she would follow the constitution and not legislate from the bench. she has criticized chief justice john roberts' decision upholding the affordable care act and the court's earlier decision in roe v. wade.
democrats are debating amongst themselves how far to go, how hard to push and force this battle, reveals kapur. there are three things they want: obamacare stabilization, they want to extend the children's health insurance program and they want a daca fix. republicans need their votes to keep the government funded … we'll see what happens.

the coronavirus pandemic is a public health crisis, also an economic crisis. nearly 10 million people have filed for unemployment benefits in just the last two weeks, and no job often means no health insurance. so what are the coverage options for those newly jobless or for those who never had insurance to begin with? - questions for npr health policy reporter selena simmons-duffin.
in addition to the short timeline, the recent covid-19 diagnoses from three republican senators, two of whom serve on the judiciary committee, has further roiled the confirmation process. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell canceled legislative activity until october 19 after senators mike lee, thom tillis and ron johnson tested positive for the coronavirus, but this week's hearings are proceeding as planned, with members having the opportunity to participate remotely.

in response to questions about there not being a true medicare for all advocate on the panel, the rules committee pointed to baker and sent a nowthis video of nahvi endorsing single-payer health care. (nahvi also wrote an op-ed in the guardian that speaks positively about single-payer.)
some americans will certainly assume that if trump is leveraging the heft of an oval office address, it is in service of something that deserves that attention, this undeniable crisis in pence's formulation (that became urgent only after trump changed his mind about agreeing to a funding deal when he saw conservative media expressing frustration about his not picking a fight over the border wall). it's worth remembering, though, that trump has a long track record of making false claims to try to get what he wants.
msnbc anchor chris matthews on friday night after the 2020 democratic presidential candidates debated in manchester, nh attacked sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) for identifying as a socialist.

in a lecture at jacksonville university in 2016 just days before the election, barrett warned that if hillary clinton were elected, the court would experience a sea change in ideology. but as nan aron, president of the liberal alliance for justice puts it, it is barrett's ideology that now presents a potential sea change.
-- many lawmakers who represent districts along the border, including some republicans, are either opposed to a wall or to using emergency powers to build it. matt viser reports: rep. mac thornberry (r-tex.), the top republican on the house armed services committee, this week said he opposes an emergency declaration to build the wall. rep. will hurd (r-tex), whose district includes 820 miles along the border, has repeatedly spoken out and voted against it. dennis nixon, a bank executive from laredo who was a top trump donor, has published a lengthy rebuttal to trump's desire for a wall.
and democrats have been using those initial numbers to score rhetorical points, even if they lack the votes in either the house or the senate to stop the bill or change it.

what it says is, if you like your employer-sponsored insurance, you like the network that you're in, you like the doctors that you can see, you're happy with that, you can keep it, o'rourke said thursday in portsmouth, new hampshire. in response to an audience question. if you do not like your employer-based insurance and want to enroll in medicare, you can. if you have no insurance whatsoever or if you are under-insured today, you can enroll in medicare as well.
the administration also proposed easing environmental rules in order to speed up construction of major infrastructure projects. the proposed rule, revising an arrangement in place for a half-century, would exclude reviews of infrastructure projects built without major government involvement, set a two-year deadline for drafting and delivering most environmental impact statements, and limit the degree to which such assessments include the effects of climate change.
most americans would not feel the effects of a partial government shutdown. however, hundreds of thousands of federal workers would face furloughs.
mike lee ( utah ) lee opposed the second version of the bill because he supported full repeal instead. it's not clear if there will be a vote on full repeal tuesday. he said in a july 17 statement of the second version of senate republicans' bill: after conferring with trusted experts regarding the latest version of the consumer freedom amendment, i have decided i cannot support the current version of the better care reconciliation act. in addition to not repealing all of the obamacare taxes, it doesn't go far enough in lowering premiums for middle class families; nor does it create enough free space from the most costly obamacare regulations. read more »
many in the republican party argue that simply reducing rates is enough to encourage work and investment, since reduced rates imply that taxpayers can keep more of their income. trump is proposing plenty of reduced rates, bringing them down to 35 percent for rich individual taxpayers and 15 percent for corporations and businesses.
in a call to arms designed to further affirm his populist credentials and distinguish himself in a crowded primary field, sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) committed on wednesday to reject contributions of $200 or more from executives at the country's pharmaceutical and health insurance companies, as well as the political action committees and lobbyists who represent them.

for o'rourke, the proposal's appeal is that he thinks it moves the country to guaranteed health care more quickly than the alternatives, including the signature medicare for all proposal from vermont sen. bernie sanders, an independent who is also vying for the democratic nomination. that's in part because it would maintain the private insurance industry, which is a deal breaker among progressives.
certainly, good people slip through the cracks temporarily. no question. but there are all kinds of avenues to help those who are sincere about getting back on their feet. the homeless epidemic is actually an epidemic of mental illness, addiction, and tolerance.
viewed only through a judicial lens, his moves were not consistent, and his legal arguments were not entirely coherent. but he brought people and their different interests together. his moves may have been good for the country at a time of division and a real crisis in health care, even as they engendered, in the years since, anger, confusion and distrust.

lawmakers in tennessee, alaska and oklahoma have already expressed an interest in pursuing block grants. supporters of block grants say the change would free states from federal requirements and give them more flexibility to try new ways to increase coverage and cut costs.
collins has also said she would favor cutting back the size of the corporate tax cut so that the rate would fall from 35 percent to 22 percent, instead of the 20 percent in the current house and senate bill. she would then use the additional revenue to pay for keeping in place the deductions for state and local taxes.

trump has delivered on a number of them, including tax cuts, conservative judges, de-regulation, the climate accord and the israeli embassy to name a few. some have been partly accomplished, such as trade deals, the border wall and defeating isis. other pledges have yet to be realized, such as bringing back coal and steel and replacing the affordable care act. and some have gone in the wrong direction, such as reducing the national debt and bringing back manufacturing.
texas gov. greg abbott's order to lift the state's mask requirement and increase the permitted capacity of all businesses to 100 percent prompted sharp criticism tuesday from health experts and government officials who deemed it irresponsible and premature, the post's erin cunningham, derek hawkins and paulina villegas report.
spicer: i am not. i am saying that it was the total largest audience witnessed in person and around the globe.
brave new world by aldus huxley (1931) - huxley's vision of a 26th century world free from want and dedicated to the pursuit of personal happiness fueled by prescription drugs must have seemed utterly bizarre to his contemporaries. but with each passing decade, his vision of a rigidly enforced social code and the dangers of a mob mentality have come to seem more and more prescient.
president trump, speaking at a fox news town hall in joe biden's hometown of scranton, pa., on thursday evening, openly suggested that the new democratic front-runner's repeated gaffes could be a sign of a competency issue -- honing a line of attack that republicans are expected to repeatedly deploy if biden becomes his party's nominee.
the iowa poll, from the des moines register, is a near sacred institution in politics. it's conducted by ann selzer, the best pollster in politics, and has regularly predicted contests in the state with uncanny accuracy.
the senate approved a three-week spending bill to fund the government for three weeks after senate democrats caved on the schumer shutdown.
let's chat now with one of president-elect donald trump's most high-profile advisers. it's former house speaker newt gingrich who, like trump, led a political upheaval. that was 1994. gingrich helped republicans take control of both houses of congress for the first time in decades on a set of promises called the contract with america. gingrich spoke with our morning edition colleague rachel martin. rachel began by asking what he thinks trump needs to do in the first hundred days to satisfy those who voted him into office.
the occupational safety and health administration's failure to issue new rules about coronavirus safety that companies would have been required to follow left workers unsafe, the labor department's office of inspector general said in a new report. osha also performed significantly fewer workplace safety inspections during the pandemic despite receiving more complaints compared with the same period in 2019, the post's eli rosenberg reports.
over the weekend, he blasted mccain for giving to the fbi an uncorroborated dossier alleging that moscow held compromising information on trump.
jobs in the healthcare field are growing fast, according to the bureau of labor statistics.
he knows where you shop, what you do, who you're likely to vote for, whether you go to church every sunday or just twice a month. he is so data-driven. and that will in the end i believe help him if he is close to trump. (crosstalk)
biden promises to preserve private insurance and create a public option as a means of stoking competition in the insurance market. that may seem like a safer political bet for democrats who need the votes of suburban moderates to retake the white house.
under the affordable care act, americans have seen insurance premiums rise and choices dwindle. president trump is bringing more affordable insurance options back to the market, including through allowing the renewal of short-term plans. these plans aren't for everyone, but they can provide a much more affordable option for millions of the forgotten men and women left out by the current system.
aetna's decision will cause problems in some places. for example, pinal county in arizona might have no insurer selling marketplace policies for 2017 unless another company steps in to replace aetna. but competition is more robust elsewhere. a kaiser family foundation report published in july said that in 16 states and the district of columbia, there would be an average of 5.8 insurers selling policies for 2017. that number was down from 6.5 in 2016 but about the same as in 2014.
and now a word from charles…
rogers: i even think smaller amounts cause trouble. and remember, this is those hard decisions but that -- is that one person at risk really if you do this do you put -- how many other people do you put at risk? how many other americans do you make targets on their head who (ph) were operating in that region? that's the problem. and so it is horrific because you get to know this person but think of the people who are exposed if you make these ransom payments.
california exchange chief rips unitedhealth for obamacare excuses
kettl aptly describes why federalism was unavoidable when the constitution was written in 1787. many states did not agree with the draft mission statement for the united states that thomas jefferson had laid out in the preamble to the declaration of independence. liberty and self-government might have passed muster if properly defined, but the assertion that all men are created equal, with inherent rights, would be mocked by generations of southern slaveholders. representatives from south carolina and georgia refused to support the declaration until a passage condemning the slave trade as cruel war against human nature itself was removed.
this was supposed to be the republican party's year. many voters are disillusioned with president obama, a democrat, saying he promised hope and change but fell short. the likely democratic nominee, clinton, has vulnerabilities, due in part to the intense dislike she engenders among some republicans and, as bernie sanders' momentum has evidenced, disillusionment among some democrats.
there's also a strong evangelical streak here, which would seem to break in favor of a ted cruz, perhaps a donald trump with a falwell endorsement. but other candidates not leaving it to chance. darrell issa, who's a surrogate for marco rubio, he's come all the way down here to the southwestern corner of the state to speak here tonight to try to peel away some of those cruz and trump supporters to go the way of marco rubio.
trump had just finished discussing health care with seven republican lawmakers over dinner monday when sens. mike lee, r-utah, and jerry moran, r-kansas — who were not at the meeting — announced they would be voting against the measure to repeal and replace obamacare. with two other republican senators already on record in opposition, the monday-night development effectively killed the senate bill.
the president also mocked calls for an apology for using the term.
there was such a sense of urgency to literally stop the bleeding and try to stem the losses that people were feeling, that we worked as hard as we could work, as assiduously and as quickly as we could to get our arms around, 'why now, why this?'  conway said.
yes ma'am? i think we're going to have further -- a lot further updates on that. yes ma'am?
spicer: i don't know. i'll -- i'll have to get back to you on that one right now. or -- i think the best thing to do, would probably contact the department of state.
then why wouldn't you vote for him in the primary? asked his brother, jack, a 53-year-old long island electrical contractor. the two had come to see kasich tape a town-hall-style interview with msnbc's chris matthews on thursday. he might not be there in the general, jack morrell told his brother.

in june, we mark 75 years since the start of what general dwight d. eisenhower called the great crusade — the allied liberation of europe in world war ii. on d-day, june 6, 1944, 15,000 young american men jumped from the sky, and 60,000 more stormed in from the sea, to save our civilization from tyranny. here with us tonight are three of those heroes: private first class joseph reilly, staff sergeant irving locker, and sergeant herman zeitchik. gentlemen, we salute you.
in hindsight, i seemed convinced that abortion supporters didn't appreciate the gravity of later-term abortion. but the opposite is true. nobody understands this issue better than women who have actually had a late-term abortion. by listening to their stories, i've come to see that the tragedy of this procedure, sought in desperation, is well understood by the women receiving it.
look no further than the house judiciary committee, which would hold impeachment hearings if they take place. chairman jerrold nadler, d-n.y., has issued 81 horribly overreaching document requests.

the virus is little more than a packet of genetic material surrounded by a spiky protein shell one-thousandth the width of an eyelash, and leads such a zombielike existence that it's barely considered a living organism, our post colleagues sarah kaplan, william wan and joel achenbach report.  … as researchers race to develop drugs and vaccines for the disease that has already sickened 350,000 and killed more than 15,000 people, and counting, this is a scientific portrait of what they are up against.
nobody seriously disputes barrett's sparkling intellect and qualifications to serve on the supreme court. rather, it is her work on the 7th circuit court of appeals and her scholarly writing and commentary that have drawn such fervent opposition from the left and support from the right.
we are now making it clear to china that after years of targeting our industries, and stealing our intellectual property, the theft of american jobs and wealth has come to an end.
the only problem is that bill is currently sitting in a committee that mcgee is not a part of, meaning she has not had an opportunity to take any action on it. the fact check team gave the claim zero out of four stars, false.
sanders speeches in south carolina and iowa reflected this diversified focus. he called the criminal justice system broken and racist, and mused about how hypocritical republicans are who preach small government, except when it comes to women's abortion rights.
medicaid paid for his stay at sojourner recovery services. ohio was one of the states that expanded medicaid under the aca — also known as obamacare — which covers drug treatment for thousands like proffit.
after being asked about his concerns about embracing socialism, hickenlooper misrepresented the green new deal, objecting to a provision in the legislation that doesn't exist.
former vice president joe biden, the democratic nominee for president, and other critics have warned that barrett could vote on the high court to overturn the affordable care act, which is nicknamed obamacare, and the decision called roe v. wade that established a right to abortion.
huckabee went on to say he visited newton, iowa, where workers lost their jobs in 2007 after maytag's washer-dryer facility went out of business. all those jobs went to mexico, he said.
in 2017 the congressional budget office estimated the obamacare repeal reconciliation act of 2017, a bill that would fit that description, would increase the number of uninsured by 32 million people over 10 years. but not all of them would be thrown off their insurance. cbo said: in the nongroup market, some people would choose not to have insurance partly because they choose to be covered by insurance under current law to avoid paying the penalty.
the report released thursday projected 2016 enrollment of 12 million, one million less than the agency's projection of 13 million just two months ago, and significantly less than a 21 million estimate a year ago.
the white house drug czar's office was still leaderless when christie's commission issued its report in november 2017. a few weeks later, trump named conway, a former republican party pollster, to be his point person on the opioid epidemic. a highly skilled political operative with no drug policy experience, conway was now in charge of coordinating the government's response to the epidemic.
turley: oh, this would be unprecedented and i think it would be an unprecedented threat to the balance of powers within our system.
wolf, if you had told me back in may that bernie sanders, who was at 3 percent in the polls, within seven months would essentially be tied with the presumed front-runner in iowa and be closing fast in national polls, have raised $20 million just in january, which means he will be competitive in all the super tuesday states on march 1st, you would have said, you know, what are you smoking? you wouldn't have believed it.
i mean, what is your reaction when you hear this kind of breach? because the public is also -- is obviously saying, how does this kind of thing...
via cbs news campaign reporter tim perry heading into the debate, kamala harris has seen a sharp decline in her poll numbers and has had to make major layoffs and changes with her staff. when asked how she plans to prepare for such a crucial debate, harris jokingly said prayer, but added, i'm going to just be present.
so, he's gonna -- i mean, that's gonna happen.
a major factor relates to one of obamacare's greatest strengths. now that people with preexisting conditions qualify for coverage, insurers may have underestimated the amount of health care services these people need. in addition, special subsidies given to insurers in the beginning of obamacare have come to an end. that's on top of rising health care costs in general, especially prescription drug costs.
the complexities of repealing obamacare are laid bare in the 23rd congressional district that mccarthy represents, highlighting what other republican politicians from less affluent areas may face.
schilling: right, no but they've been making it clear to us as conservatives that we're deplorable. you're just stupid rednecks and we know better than you so just shut up and let us do what we do.
while i was working as an aide to small-government supply-sider rep. jack kemp (r-n.y.) in the 1970s, it took years for me to get the wall street journal's tax reporter to write about kemp's tax legislation, even after the paper's conservative editorial page had endorsed it. (later, i would come to question tax-cut orthodoxy.) my colleagues and i bemoaned liberal bias among journalists, but we never believed the media owed us anything or that our free speech was being squelched. we were conservatives: we believed that competition would sort out which ideas would see the light of day. the media referee wasn't government; it was the news consumer.
but when two groups are competing on a playing field and they're playing by separate rules, it's not a fair game and that's exactly what's happened. the republican party -- the freedom caucus has more my speed now -- jim jordan and the guys --

kimmel pressed cassidy to follow through on his word in a tweet in june and outlined his definition of the kimmel test, which he reiterated tuesday night.
spicer: not that i'm aware of. and when i say that, what i'm saying is during the transition, i asked general flynn that -- whether or not there were any other conversations beyond the ambassador and he said no.
the narrative -- and the default narrative is always negative and it's demoralizing. and i think that when you sit here and you realize the sacrifice the guy made, leaving a very, very successful business because he really cares about this country and he wants -- despite your partisan differences, he cares about making this country better for everybody. he wants to make it safer for everybody. and so when you wake up everyday and that's what you're seeing over and over again and you're not seeing stories about the cabinet folks that he's appointing or the success that he's having trying to keep american jobs here. yes, it is a little disappointing.
under guidance from the department of health and human services that takes effect immediately but likely won't affect insurance markets for another year, state governments will have new leeway to request waivers from some of the federal health care law's core requirements.
sanders said during the debate, 83% of your tax benefits go to the 1%.
so trump is incorrect when he says congress passed choice under his watch — that credit goes to obama.
6. jeff sessions, attorney general. last week's ranking: 7
although mcelvain has not publicly offered a reason for his resignation, the post article said that his departure highlights internal frustration with the trump administration's decision to support a lawsuit from officials in 20 conservative states. that lawsuit, now before a federal district judge in texas, could wipe out key protections for people with pre-existing conditions.
by highlighting both mr. trump's request to ukraine and the barbs from foreign adversaries—whom he calls thugs—biden underscores his foreign policy experience, which he sees as a key selling point to voters. having spent much of the last 50 years as a powerful lawmaker steeped in foreign policy discussions, he says he knows intimately what makes leaders like kim and putin tick. will he proactively start contrasting this record with the other democrats?
i know how to work across the aisle when we need to, she said.
this is a moral issue. the lawless state of our southern border is a threat to the safety, security, and financial well‑being of all americans. we have a moral duty to create an immigration system that protects the lives and jobs of our citizens. this includes our obligation to the millions of immigrants living here today, who followed the rules and respected our laws. legal immigrants enrich our nation and strengthen our society in countless ways. i want people to come into our country, but they have to come in legally.
gosar also told breitbart news that republican voters ahead of the midterms have reason to be unsatisfied with their members of congress, but says his anti-illegal immigration legislation can bring public support to pro-america first candidates as immigration remains gop voters' biggest issue.
the trump administration is preparing a sweeping executive order that would clear the way for the central intelligence agency to reopen overseas 'black site' prisons, like those where it detained and tortured terrorism suspects before former president obama shut them down, the new york times's charlie savage reports. president trump's three-page draft order, titled 'detention and interrogation of enemy combatants' … would also undo many of the other restrictions on handling detainees that mr. obama put in place in response to policies of the bush administration. if mr. trump signs the draft order, he would also revoke mr. obama's directive to give the international committee of the red cross access to all wartime detainees in american custody — another step toward reopening secret prisons outside of the normal wartime rules established by the geneva conventions….
the military mandates that service members receive a variety of vaccinations at enlistment, but commanders are restricted in requiring the use of the moderna and pfizer-biontech coronavirus vaccines, which have received emergency use authorization from the food and drug administration but have not received the standard fda approval.
it's the senate's turn house passage of the american health care act is just a first step. as this measure moves to the senate, it will face a new set of political and policy challenges. among them: medicaid: the house-passed measure makes the most sweeping changes to the program since its inception in 1965. some of these changes, such as capping federal funding, would provoke intraparty divisions.
i'm going to hope that if i have a health issue, i can go back during the year, not during open enrollment and go onto the marketplace and buy insurance, he said.
so i remember covering this. i covered the affordable care act closely. and there are two things about this that always stick in my mind. one is that the medicaid expansion, even with the supreme court decision allowing states to opt out — it was built to be such an extraordinarily good deal for the states. the federal government paid 100 percent of the cost for the first three years, and then it was 90-10 after that. medicaid is usually a much closer match between the federal government and state governments. the federal government was backing up dump trucks of health care money into these red states, and these red states are saying no. but then the consequences are deadly. so a 2019 study by the center for budget and policy priorities found that medicaid expansion saved 19,000 lives from 2014 to 2017, and state decisions not to expand cost 15,600 premature deaths over the same period. and to state the unbelievably obvious, a lot of those are white people. this isn't just not being able to swim in a pool. this is your mother may die, your friend may die — it's shocking.
the administration is also grappling with a surge of unaccompanied migrant children at the us-mexico border that are being held in us border patrol facilities. richmond said during an interview on msnbc tuesday that he is hopeful republicans will work with democrats on addressing immigration, but the administration will not let obstruction get in the way of values and progress and this is something we're going to have to work on.

newsom said he was now convening a team to look into the creation of a new law requiring technology giants to kick back some of their billions in earnings in the form of a data dividend for californians.
and in an ironic twist, los angeles mayor eric garcetti (among others) pointed to a 2012 supreme court case to explain why they're so confident. the ruling in nfib vs. sebelius, which allowed states to reject medicaid expansion without the threat of losing pre-existing funds, set a precedent trump's opponents say will prevent him from using federal money as a tool to coerce local governments.

in november, unitedhealth surprised analysts and health-policy experts with its steep losses and said it might leave the exchanges altogether, just after expanding into new states. the sudden reversal prompted questions about the sustainability of the government-run marketplaces, the linchpin of president obama's signature law.

where did obama win? obama won big in the east. just a little bit of clinton over here, dubuque, cedar rapids, iowa city, davenport. this area is critical. can hillary clinton hold her own in the east, even just splitting this with bernie sanders?
it's really pretty simple. the senate bill would, over the course of the next decade, cut obamacare's health insurance subsidies by $408 billion and medicaid by $772 billion all to pay for $700 billion of tax cuts, nearly half of which the nonpartisan tax policy center says would go to the top 1 percent of households. not only that, but the fact that it would only peg the value of its remaining subsidies to higher-deductible plans means that a lot of people would be pushed into them. they couldn't afford anything else. on an apples-to-apples basis, the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation estimates that the senate bill would increase the cost of a silver plan that covers 70 percent of expected medical costs by an average of 74 percent over the next three years — and more for the type of older, poorer people who overwhelmingly went for trump.
but cruz, after building a national brand stoking tensions with mcconnell and his top deputies, is, in his own words, trying to get to yes. the former presidential hopeful has spoken positively about the negotiations, which he helped kick-start. his investment in the talks has generated cautious optimism among many republicans that he won't walk away from a delicate effort from which mcconnell, with a 52-seat majority and vice president pence as a potential tiebreaking vote, can afford only two defections.

not all people file tax returns, so the denominator for the 3.3 percent is too small, he said. not every person on a tax return on which somebody paid the mandate penalty paid the penalty themselves. he added that he suspected the typical tax unit in which somebody paid a mandate penalty is smaller than average, in which case the 3.3 percent of tax returns would correspond to a smaller fraction of the total population.

the majority party assigns a chairman for each of the senate's 20 permanent committees, holds a majority of seats on each committee and controls most committee staff and resources. but when the senate was evenly divided at the start of 2001, its republican and democratic leaders -- trent lott of mississippi and tom daschle of south dakota -- negotiated a power-sharing agreement that provided for equal membership on committees, equal budgets for committee republicans and democrats, and the ability of both leaders to advance legislation out of committees that are deadlocked. a similar power-sharing arrangement might be reached after jan. 20.

governors clamor for more federal controls - fox news: despite pleas from governors, members of congress and presidential candidates, president trump so far has resisted using his powers under the defense production act as officials look to ramp up the american medical system's capacity in anticipation of a spike in demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. on wednesday, trump invoked the defense production act… but as of friday morning, he has not actually taken action under the law, tweeting wednesday that he only signed the act 'should we need to invoke it in a worst case scenario in the future. hopefully there will be no need....' that has concerned officials across the political spectrum who see an immediate need for things like personal protective equipment (ppe) for medical professionals who will be treating patients sick with the novel coronavirus. a potential shortage has concerned medical professionals and even led multiple tv medical dramas to donate the masks they use in their wardrobe to hospitals.

but to accomplish our goals at home and abroad, we must restart the engine of the american economy — making it easier for companies to do business in the united states, and much harder for companies to leave.
rovner: well, you know, it doesn't apply to that many people. it only applies to companies with 50 or more full-time workers. more than 96 percent of those firms already provide health insurance. but still, it has set off a huge cry of outrage, particularly from the law's opponents.
this report has been updated to reflect that the extra $70 billion for stabilization funding will be in part used for helping insurers defray the costs of high-risk individuals.
during his endorsement remarks, obama referred to the coronavirus pandemic and highlighted biden's work during the h1n1 and ebola outbreaks.
fair also included in its estimate the $259 million cost of providing medicaid to the u.s.-born children of undocumented immigrants, who, again, are citizens.
hhs secretary alex azar said in a statement on wednesday:
holler and his compatriots are reasoning that the political pressure from democrats will eventually build to the point that gop house and senate members in tough races will decide they must rally around a health-care plan — even though multiple versions of repeal-and-replace failed to gain enough traction in the senate last year, and the stakes are even higher as republicans try to hold onto their house majority (i explained more fully in this health 202 why it's even harder to repeal obamacare now compared to last year.)
the number of clients served by the program dropped by about 840,000 – or 21% – after the trump administration changed the rules for receiving title x grants, according to the kaiser family foundation.
in a normal year, in other words, embracing medicare-for-all might seem like a risky proposition for a democratic primary candidate. but 2020 will not be a normal year.
almost immediately after obamacare went into effect, rates of uninsured dropped and medicaid coverage jumped to over half of all patients.
trump wasn't clear what he meant by do it, but prominent democrats did not want to cut social security, much less take it away, when trump was running in 2016. clinton proposed to increase social security benefits.
claiming that the united states military has been dramatically downgraded during the obama administration, cruz said that when the first gulf war began in 1991, the united states had 529 ships. today, we have 272.
we're not going to sacrifice our values for the sake of compromise. you think people from red states are going to be for tax reform with 98 percent of tax breaks going to the top 1 percent?
we will vote today to reopen the government, to continue negotiating a global agreement, with the commitment that, if an agreement isn't reached by february the 8th, the senate will immediately proceed to consideration of legislation dealing with daca. the process will be neutral and fair to all sides. we expect that a bipartisan bill on daca will receive fair consideration and an up or down vote on the floor.
some employees certainly do benefit from the programs. but the limits on where the perk can be used, what workers can study and how challenging it can be for employees to make it through school while working at the same time mean that the companies have probably run the numbers and know that offering the benefit is not going to be super costly, cappelli said.
if president joe biden cannot gather enough bipartisan support for his $1.9 trillion covid-19 relief plan, democrats will look to another way to get at least some of it through on a simple senate majority with 51 votes.

-- potus is beginning his term at the helm of a stable but sluggish economy – but an increasingly ominous explosion in debt and deficit is looming in the very near future. a new report from the congressional budget office says the spending growth rate is set to outpace the rate of revenue growth after 2019, causing the deficit to explode to $1.4 trillion by the end of the decade. and, if current policies go unchanged, the cbo estimates public debt will soar to the highest rates since the period following world war ii.
schilling: i mean that -- but that was -- she was the linchpin of the trump administration's nomination of judge kavanaugh and it turned out she had nothing and it turned out that all the people involved including michael avenatti and the lady in newark, they were lying about this man.
analysts and advocates who follow obamacare sign-ups say interest in the program has only grown stronger as the coronavirus pandemic holds its grip on the nation, the associated press reports.
reality check: cruz on naval power
the gloomy mixture of covid-19 fears and political uncertainty are on investors' minds early on tuesday.
just 24 hours removed from arguably his best day as president, donald trump picked a political fight he cannot win.
photo: tristan smith/cnn justis harrison met donald trump as a candidate and then volunteered for his campaign.
an urban institute report issued last week, however, found that some of unitedhealth's troubles may have been self-inflicted. the company's premiums were substantially higher than its competitors' in many of the largest u.s. markets. the insurer also offered broader provider networks that tend to attract sicker customers who incur big medical bills.
apps and computers can be hacked and break down. that can't happen with good old-fashioned paper ballots.
the setting was more casual and conversational than trump's boisterous rallies, and afforded the commander-in-chief an opportunity to connect directly with voters on camera.
what's even more curious about this case is that sethi's campaign had been practically begging breitbart news for months to feature sethi in an interview and to highlight his campaign by claiming he was the real outsider in the race. they repeatedly claimed that breitbart news coverage of the trump-endorsed hagerty, with whom the president just conducted a virtual town hall and with whom sen. tom cotton (r-ar) is campaigning in tennessee later this week, was somehow a betrayal of the base and selling out in some respect. but when breitbart news accepted the offer to interview sethi and told the campaign that these never trump staffers would be a topic of the interview since sethi had been portraying himself as an outsider but surrounded himself with political consultants like the above exposed individuals, sethi's consultants abruptly pulled back and canceled sethi's plans to sit for the interview thereby hiding the candidate and protecting themselves from public scrutiny over their actions.
they need to tell voters how they're going to make things better, how they're going to defend health care as a basic right, and how they're going to create a new system that better serves the needs of patients, workers, small and mid-sized businesses, and the economy. they need to really differentiate themselves from the republicans and show that they speak for people first, not the insurance and pharmaceutical industries.
another approach would be what trump has described a reciprocal tax, which would aim to match taxes imposed on certain goods in different countries around the world with some corresponding tax in the united states.
cindy bagge, president of oak street manufacturing in monticello: 'we're hopeful as far as the tax reform… we have grave concerns about other facets of his administration'
bill clinton had charisma. barack obama has charisma. trump has charisma.
trump's supporters skeptical of general election polling
in 2018, the administration announced it wouldn't defend the aca in a legal challenge from gop-led states. at the time, the justice department filed a brief saying the law's preexisting condition protections can't exist without the law's penalty for lacking coverage (which congress had repealed).
improve social security's long-term solvency (its trust fund is expected to be depleted by 2035 or perhaps sooner due to the pandemic) by having americans with high wages pay the same social security payroll taxes that middle-class families pay. the platform didn't offer specifics, but biden has said he'd require people to pay social security taxes on income over roughly $400,000. today, employment earnings of up to $137,700 are subject to social security payroll taxes.
-- customs and border protection officers sued the trump administration over unpaid wages. deanna paul reports: the national treasury employees union became the second federal employees' union to file a lawsuit against the trump administration over the shutdown. tuesday's collective action alleges more than 400,000 federal employees — including tens of thousands of nteu members — are being forced to work without pay during the partial government closure.
you have a few options to maintain coverage when you leave one job and don't immediately get covered at another. you could keep your current coverage under cobra but will have to begin paying full premiums if your employer was subsidizing coverage. or you could sign up for a plan on the individual market.
mcgovern also noted in his statement that he worked with jayapal and staff from the office of sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) to help plan the hearing. i am a cosponsor of this bill and i'm proud to convene the first-ever hearing on medicare for all as congress works toward universal coverage, mcgovern said.
so, in terms of providing more arms and assistance to the kurds, that's something that we should do. we should be building up the capacity, especially of the kurds and the iraqi security force, and also sunni tribal leaders in iraq because we've been able to kind of slow the advances of isil in iraq but we have to push back and then move on to the tougher aspect of how to take the fight to isil in syria.
trump's tax records are not supposed to become public as part of prosecutor's criminal investigation, but the high court's action is a blow to trump because he has for so long fought on so many fronts to keep his tax records shielded from view. the ongoing investigation the records are part of could also become an issue for trump in his life after the presidency. trump has called it a fishing expedition and a continuation of the witch hunt — the greatest witch hunt in history.
what we needed today with regard to ukraine was presidential leadership that stood up and said, we're going to honor our treaty commitments. we're going to provide defensive weaponry for the ukrainians who are fighting to defend their own nation, to stand up to russian aggression. that's a message that would be heard by our allies.
i have no stake in this race, he said. medicare for all has been the slogan of a lot of people over the years, but it really is just a slogan. it doesn't really tell you much about how the program would work.''

simon: and what have we learned about the trump agenda over the last couple of days?
obamacare premiums nationwide have increased by double and triple digits. as an example, arizona went up 116 percent last year alone. governor matt bevin of kentucky just said obamacare is failing in his state — it is unsustainable and collapsing.
the news was so major that it was touted in an official white house tweet.
the charlotte (north carolina) observer, editorial: that means the country will go back to a health care system similar to what we had, with no individual exchanges, with medicaid expansion threatened, and with millions of americans losing health coverage. congress might be able to save some pieces of the affordable care act, such as coverage of pre-existing conditions, but that too would be a long shot.
question: ...and then on nafta, can you just clarify? i know he's going to meet with the leaders of mexico and canada. has he started to have discussions with them currently about renegotiating nafta...
a sea change for the supreme court
the proof is in the rhetoric of republicans, who claim to support these goals as much as democrats do, while promising supposedly better alternatives they've never been able to pass as legislation.
the reason this law keeps getting delayed is because it doesn't work like the president promised it would work, he said in a statement.
regardless, mr. hutchinson said monday he was optimistic about winning approval to shrink the expansion population after meeting recently with alex azar, the new health and human services secretary.
all we want is fairness, he said. we're gonna be the smart country again, not the stupid country.
federal judges the trump administration and congressional republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. trump is currently supporting a republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of obamacare void.
getting democrats out of the freedom-vs.-government nonsensical argument would be a great contribution to buttigieg's party and to reasoned debate. it would force republicans to defend their policies on turf they are unfamiliar with: are they helping people or hurting them, advancing a shared common good or reducing us to the law of the jungle?
…and to the current holder of the title potus, you're not good enough to utter john mccain's name. not good enough. and definitely not american enough. — ron perlman (@perlmutations) august 26, 2018
so why — politically — is this happening now? one explanation is that democrats are trying to rebuild after a devastating election in 2016, which many emerged from thinking the party didn't have a clear message for what it stood for.
green added, i am sure that ryan — and other speakers have done this — is talking to some members and saying, 'if this goes down, i lose and we all lose. so help a guy out here.' 
—extending the children's health insurance program for an additional four years (on top of the six years congress authorized in its short-term spending deal last month, making for a total of 10 years before the issue must be dealt with again.)
the senate health, education, labor and pensions committee holds an hearing on the opioid crisis.
third, the democrats' best argument in 2018 was health care. now that we are in a health-care epidemic not seen for 100 years, democrats have an obvious upper hand. unbelievably, republicans will not drop their lawsuit seeking to invalidate all of obamacare. in addition, on tuesday, politico reported, the trump administration has decided against reopening obamacare enrollment to uninsured americans during the coronavirus pandemic, defying calls from health insurers and democrats to create a special sign-up window amid the health crisis. this is horrifyingly cruel and politically shortsighted. republicans however seem determined to be on the side of taking away or denying health-care coverage to millions of americans. this is a gift to the biden team.
schilling: yes. probably the greatest power pitcher.
in late january, sen. patrick leahy (d-vt.) fell ill and was briefly hospitalized. a day later, sen. mark warner (d-va.) went into quarantine for a few days after coming in close contact with someone who tested positive for the coronavirus.
in a recent move, walker issued an opinion related to drive-in church services and the louisville mayor's social-distancing order, without hearing first from the mayor. on holy thursday, an american mayor criminalized the communal celebration of easter, walker declared as he opened his opinion.
the new figures hhs published thursday show the uninsured rate improved across racial and ethnic groups.
and i think that you're gonna to see a lot more of that, a listening president who's engaged in trying to figure out what policies and actions that he can take, that this government can take, that he can work with congress to make people's lives better, to make their -- their security better, to make their economic security better.
bernie sanders is the first politician in my lifetime whom i've heard speak about compassion in convincing, dead-serious terms. that kind of unqualified compassion at the foundation of the movement is why, even after bernie's crushing defeat in michigan, campaign volunteers stuck around in the following days to organize mutual aid with local groups to help those affected by covid-19 shutdowns.
the mandate is among the affordable care act's most controversial features, but experts say it's essential for making the rest of the program work. it's basically a tax on people who decline to get health insurance, even if available coverage meets the law's definition of affordable.

i'm especially proud of our troopers and our staff, because these drugs, as we know, are contributing to the opioid crisis in our country, which is killing americans every single day, bolduc said thursday at a news conference. this work is saving lives. we can't even extrapolate out the number of lives that this particular bust has impacted.
schilling: yes, i think they would. first of all, you can't be a sovereign nation without borders. i mean that's just a simple fact. but i've got to tell you, on the foreign policy side, i think, i was struck by a couple of things.
even better, the cost of buying groceries to prepare meals at home actually fell for the first time in six years and only the second time since 1976.
during the presidential transition, brooks-lasure served as a lead for biden's hhs review team, helping assess the trump administration's operations, dan and amy write. she has most recently served as a managing director at manatt health, a consulting firm that works with the health-care industry — a role that raised some concerns inside the biden administration given the president's stringent ethics pledge and the potential for brooks-lasure to shape policies that might affect her former clients, said one person familiar with those concerns.
at a reno, nevada, rally, the gop presidential frontrunner completely stopped his speech after a woman in the crowd fainted.
i am going to bring back millions of jobs. protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. the current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.
with little warning and no explanation, the centers for disease control and prevention canceled a major climate change conference that had been scheduled for next month in atlanta. the climate and health summit, which had been in the works for months, was intended as a chance for public health officials around the country to learn more about the mounting evidence of the risks to human health posed by the changing climate, brady notes.
dionne: well, right, but they - the - i think what they are doing - what they have to do is say, we're not for open borders, and this is an attempt to push us away from issues related to economics, to health care and to the issues that a lot of voters are voting on to the point where republicans have had to essentially mislead - that's a terrible word - about where they stand on health care. and i think they are doing that quite effectively in a lot of local races, governors' races and i think in a great many house races, too.
what could doom democrats is fellow democrats. seattle was a laudable pioneer in raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. but now its city council is never far from a bad idea. a recent proposal would make it the first city in the nation to appear to incentivize misdemeanor crime. assaults, trespass, stalking — all could be excused if their offense is linked to poverty or a behavioral health disorder.
however, employment records haven't been kept for the entire history of the country — that began in the 1950s. unemployment likely was lower during world war ii, with so many people working as part of the military.

6. declining to commit that consumers will be better off under obamacare replacement:
spicer: i think he reaches out to them in a way that he started on the night that he won the election, on the way that he did on inauguration day by sending a message that talks about fighting for them. but more importantly, i think the president's going to show through action and through success that he's fighting for them and fighting for every american. one of the things that we've seen so often in this town is a lot of soaring rhetoric about how much people care.
in late november, ginsburg was hospitalized at johns hopkins hospital for two nights with the chills and a fever.
ducey did tweet out his dissatisfaction with the repeal attempt as it stood the day mccain gave his thumbs-down. but both the governor and mccain say that ducey told the arizona senator to vote for the repeal, a suggestion mccain simply did not follow.
the obama economy has led to the lowest labor force participation since 1978. ninety-two million americans aren't working. obamacare is a train wreck. we're seeing our constitutional rights under assault. and abroad the obama-clinton-kerry foreign policy is an unmitigated disaster. leading from behind doesn't work.

first, we should ensure that americans with preexisting conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for americans currently enrolled in the health-care exchanges.

the merits of medicare for all have been touted by medical professionals, business leaders and health care economists for a variety of reasons: it would help drive down costs, eliminate administrative waste, increase transparency, bring down rising drug costs, and ease the costly burden of health insurance from businesses and individuals.

but consumers who use navigators frequently end up enrolling in medicaid, the children's health insurance program or other special programs ― or simply enrolling on their own, at home, after long consultation with navigators. as a result, they don't show up as enrolling in the private marketplace plans, which is the metric cms is using to judge navigator performance.
preexisting conditions have to continue to be solved, perdue said. we have to figure out a way that people don't lose their insurance when they lose their job, and then we have to get after the real causes of health care costs.
so how does the increase in lobbying spending square with president donald trump's promise to drain the swamp?
we're dealing with obamacare version 1.0 here, says frietchen. i never expected it would be perfect right out of the gate, and i hope that our next president focuses on refinement, revision and review, rather than repeal.

● health care. the administration proposed letting states limit the amounts they spend on medicaid for poor adults. it invited states to transform that part of medicaid funding into a block grant and offered them new flexibility to cut coverage and benefits. block grants are a favored republican technique to limit entitlement spending, and the administration's proposal was a way to achieve, in a more limited way, what it was unable to get through even a republican congress, which balked at its effort to block-grant medicaid three years ago.
i don't think this president has been helpful. i think he feels at home with what is going on. when he reacted to what was happening in charlottesville, you know, good people on both sides, i cried. it's not the america that i dream for, the one i was trying to help set right. it's not the america we had during the days of president [john f.] kennedy and lyndon johnson. it's — it's different.

she wasn't able to find lots of people in her community who had memory of it. and this is a black woman. we've just erased so much of the knowledge. and so we're left to puzzle out — why is it we can't — i open the book saying, why is it we can't seem to have nice things? why are we not addressing climate change? why are we not having universal health care? why is it so hard for working families to make ends meet? why does it feel like we keep falling behind and falling apart? and so when you give people the truth — sometimes people talk about putting a racial equity lens on an issue. i think it's taking blinders off — just allow people to know the full story of our community's history, the beauty and the struggle. then you get people on the same page, and then you can turn it. i do think it needs to be the federal government to adopt this as a national effort, but it needs to be implemented at the local level. i tried for almost 20 years to give rational, economic, self-interest arguments to decision makers and to white people who are listening to me talk on meet the press and whatever, to say, what let's do something about the struggling middle class, which is a diverse middle class now. and it wasn't working. we still have this racialized politics. we still have the majority of white people voting for donald trump.

it's not hard to see why republicans would try to cast themselves as guardians against rising crime in some cities ― to say nothing of the rioting that has spilled out from peaceful demonstrations against police misconduct, particularly in cities like minneapolis, minnesota, and kenosha, wisconsin. that's because it allows the gop to shift from the politically inconvenient terrain of dismissing protests against police misconduct and racism, which a majority of americans support, and turn to the stronger ground of condemning arson and property destruction, which already appear to be turning swing voters against democrats in the general election battleground state of wisconsin.
he was hardly abandoning his conservative credentials. but early in his tenure, as data mounted about the dramatic increases in teenage nicotine addiction from vaping, gottlieb saw the makings of what he described as an epidemic, and he became something of an accidental activist regulator. he issued more than 1,300 warning letters and fines for those who sold e-cigarettes to minors and even took the rare and admirable step of publicly adjusting his prior views when faced with new information.

scott raised $22 million in his first quarter as a candidate for senate, with $8 million of those funds coming from individual contributions, while nelson raised $4.4 million in the second quarter. scott is also extremely wealthy, and could potentially pour millions of his own funds into his campaign in the final stretch of the race.
one thing that sanders clearly does not see as an obstacle is his age. though that issue would likely surface, its importance could be diminished if the 75-year-old biden enters the race. and by election day in 2020, trump will be 74.
5. we will repeal so-called 'right to work' laws. it is not clear how democrats will actually do this, since these laws are made at the state level. but right to work laws — freeing employees from being forced to join unions — have been a huge economic boost to states that have adopted them. working-class americans — especially minorities — have voted with their feet, moving from the highly unionized rust belt to the right to work south, where there are more jobs.
what remains intact are deductions for mortgage interest and charitable donations, the two most popular among american taxpayers. touching these deductions would most likely hurt the housing market and home values, and non-profit organizations relying on donations to survive.
undoing restrictions on u.s. clinics that provide abortion counseling or services will take more time, as would changing when employers can decline to include birth control in workers' health care plans.
other fraud-susceptible programs such as medicare, the va, and the food stamp program are duly cited by the report as sources of opioids.
stone: yes, people - the 200,000 people in the marketplace, many of whom can now afford insurance with the tax credits. and then 400,000 plus people in arizona benefited from medicaid expansion. and that was the big concern here when - as the republicans moved to repeal and replace the affordable care act.
the trump administration will help americans have more affordable health insurance options compared to the skyrocketing premiums and diminishing options on the individual insurance market.
the divisions between the candidates will likely be on display on tuesday and wednesday in detroit for the second presidential debate. sanders and his fellow progressive sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) take the stage the first night, while harris and biden will get a chance to square off against each other on the second night.
with all due respect to gary abernathy, he is just plain wrong in his claim regarding donald trump's presidency. true, mr. trump won the electoral college vote, but he did not get the majority of votes. indeed, as mr. abernathy noted, democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton got almost 66 million votes; mr. trump, ­63 million.
at one point, after jabbing at wacky jacky and pocahontas, trump claimed that rosen and warren don't know how to say nevada. the two say nev-ah-da, a pet peeve for the state's residents, rather than the correct nev-ad-a, trump claimed.
whether obama could have pushed conservative democrats harder, or picked different places to give ground, remains a source of disagreement between him and some of his liberal allies even today. what's not in dispute is that obama always realized the law would need more work. that's why he talked about it as a starter home, with the expectation that it would be possible to bolster and expand the program over time, through a series of legislative and administrative fixes.
moments later another of the protesters - a young woman - asked what biden would do to close a coal fired plan in new hampshire.
obama had strongly defended the internet and phone data collections, saying in 2013 the programs have saved lives and thwarted at least 50 terror threats. however, in testimony to the senate judiciary committee, former nsa deputy director john inglis admitted that the number of cases where the program was used was actually 13. the program was terminated last year.
the trip shows the extent to which trump and heller have repaired their relationship.
and if bernie has got it, he wins tonight. but just one other quick point. as complicated as the democratic caucuses are, it's even more complicated than we learned, because they're weighted. so based on the turnout the last time, if you have 200 people at once caucus, you don't get as many delegates as you do if you have 200 people at a different caucus.
this is not acceptable in our society.
and i've run organizations for decades now. and what i say to people, is this. there are three ways you can treat human beings who work in your organization. no 1, you do nothing, then they leave you within a year. no. 2, you tell them how great they are. that lasts for about a year, and then they leave you before the second year. the third thing you can do is you invest in them. you compensate them. you give them raises, and you genuinely value them and then they'll stay with you forever. right now in the united states of america, we're doing some combination of one and two with our kids. we're saying, hey, things are great. you can vote. they don't really believe it. if you could look at every parent who could then look at their children and say, when you turn 18, you're going to get $1,000 a month from your country because your country loves you, your country values you, and we are investing in you, that is a game changer for americans of every political party. and there are many people in red states who are already embracing this vision. i know, because i see them every day.
the department of health and human services expects about 10 million people to be enrolled in federal and state exchanges at the end of 2016. that's far below previous government forecasts.
president trump says he may pick a nominee for fbi director before he goes overseas on friday, while the investigation into russian election interference gets hotter and the fight to repeal and replace the affordable care act continues and the effort to revamp the tax code grinds on. let's check in now with some people who voted for donald trump. how's he doing? and how would they like to see these battles play out? kevin eisbrenner joins us now from livonia, mich.
reynolds' rationale on the meatpacking plants and the wisconsin court's thinking on the stay-at-home order, like the logic behind the broader push from some conservatives to ease social distancing rules, is that the costs of lockdown are too severe. sacrificing the well-being of some more vulnerable populations is necessary, this argument goes, in order to alleviate the hardships on the rest of the population.
kodjak: as in killing the insurance market. an even faster way for a president trump to deal a blow to obamacare would be to drop an obama administration appeal of a court ruling against the law.
this new, have-it-every-which-way approach pushes the extremely challenging implementation of the medicare for all part of this plan ten years into the future, meaning it would not occur on the watch of even a two-term administration, biden deputy campaign manager kate bedingfield said in a statement. the result? a bernie sanders-lite medicare for all and a refusal to be straight with the american middle class, who would have a large tax increase forced on them with this plan.
and wouldn't you know it? it's the same crowd that was screaming about the specter of death panels a decade ago.
this is a rush transcript from life, liberty & levin, january 20, 2019. this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated.
the case has been rescheduled for consideration more than a dozen times.
pelosi and other supporters of the aca were quick to condemn the move.
i don't want to over promise and under deliver, clinton said in council bluffs. i'd rather under promise and over deliver.
garcia-navarro: that's reporter will stone. he's part of a reporting partnership between npr, kaiser health news and member station kjzz.
some conservatives don't like him: there is some grousing in some conservative circles over kavanaugh. these conservatives, including texas sen. ted cruz, believe he is not sufficiently conservative. they disagree with portions of opinions he has written relating to abortion and the affordable care act, for example.
levin: and you played with him?
10:07 p.m. et trump said that clinton talks tough about russia and the u.s. nuclear program has fallen way behind.
trump on cordray: he was groomed by 'pocahontas'
not so long ago, i got to interview an expert on the matter: president obama himself.
the bills would have weakened rules that require insurance to cover a standard set of health benefits, for example, and would have established policies that would have raised prices for people with a history of health problems.
i would not use american ground forces in syria, clinton said. i think that would be a very serious mistake. i don't think that american troops should be holding territory, which is what they would have to do as an occupying force. i don't think that would be a smart strategy.
sarah dash: health care hasn't always been designed with the needs and the efficiency of the patient in mind. it's designed for the various doctors in the health care system.
3. establish a u.s. public health jobs corps
question: fifteen to 20 percent? sorry (ph).
or, as the republicans would call it, freedom! and if you lived in a red state, you would probably get more of it. that's because the senate bill would let them opt out of essential health benefits like mental health, maternity care and prescription drugs — and in the process, the brookings institution's matthew fiedler points out, bring back annual and lifetime limits on benefits. the result would be a system where healthy people would mostly buy cheaper plans that didn't cover much, and mostly sick people would buy ones that did, you know, cover things — which would only make those more comprehensive plans so expensive that hardly anybody would be able to buy them at all. people would be forced to buy skimpy insurance that might not even insure you if you use too much of it.
an analysis of metropolitan police department data shows local police arrested five times as many people during the floyd protests as they did during last week's insurrection.
boris johnson, in a column written for the sun newspaper, regales the tale of the removal of the bust of winston churchill when obama took office.
sanders later said, the scientists tell us we are 12 years before there is irreparable damage to this planet.
california must act where washington has failed, newsom said, adding that he aims to increase subsidies and reimbursement rates, as well as extend health care coverage for anyone up to 26 years old regardless of their immigration status.
voters are hurting -- and they're looking for leadership that comes forward with plans and solutions, donilon wrote in the february 16 memo obtained by cnn. this is not a moment in the country when obstructionism will be rewarded.
duke regularly surveys hundreds of top cfos about the assumptions, analyses and expectations they use when the running the numbers on all new corporate investments. it turns out the typical cfo doesn't want to ok a project unless it offers a return on investment of at least 14% — even though their company can borrow for half that.
as sanders was walking out of the facility in shirtsleeves, a student called out to him. bernie, are you tired yet?
in the case of the trump impeachment question, pelosi has it all gamed out in advance and this most recent misleading statement is just part one.
i just wanted to reiterate that one of the hardest things about this disease is he's in the hospital — he's been there a few days — and i can't even be by his side, klobuchar said on a previously scheduled conference call. i think many families in america are now experiencing this and things that are much, much worse.
so, would all those pages really stack up as tall as a three-story building?
many of these people remember, angrily, the promise from president barack obama that they could keep their old plans if they liked them. and in states like iowa, which have some of the highest rates for unsubsidized customers, gop state officials have been among the most aggressive in seeking ways to weaken or eliminate the affordable care act's rules.
levin: what do you of this battle over the budget and the wall and the state of the union? what do you make of all that?
cruz was right: he voted for the measure in march 2015, though it ultimately failed to garner enough support for passage.
indeed, members of the freedom caucus — which is supported by outside conservative groups — have often claimed the mantle of pure conservatism, but their tactics have been seen by many in their party as uniformly counterproductive.
according to the competitive enterprise institute, a libertarian-leaning think tank, there were in fact 81,611 pages of new government rules, proposed rules, regulatory notices and executive orders in 2015. the group, which says it opposes onerous government regulation, notes that 2015 set a record for pages of new federal regulations.

1. sanders announces his 1st presidential bid
spicer: ok. let's take them one at a time.
and see:here's where trump and biden stand on health care
but monday's rule change almost certainly means that, overall, people with serious medical problems are likely to have a harder time finding coverage ― and, ultimately, paying their medical bills.
in his closing statement, sanders said he suspects people all over the country who are watching this debate are saying these are good people, they have great ideas, but how come nothing really changes?
here's how medicare for america would work:
* how democrats should proceed now: e.j. dionne charts the path forward for democrats, now that it looks like the aca is here to stay for the foreseeable future:
 'it clearly represents the anxiety around attending college particularly for lower-income individuals that many of these companies seem to be targeting for employment.'  — — kevin kinser, a professor at penn state university and head of the school's department of education policy studies
high-income earners: the bill eliminates two taxes on individuals earning more than $200,000 or couples earning more than $250,000: a 0.9 percent increase on the medicare payroll tax, and a 3.8 percent tax on investment income. it also allows people to save more money in tax-excluded health savings accounts, a change most useful to people with enough money to have savings.
against this backdrop, last week's surprise announcement that gottlieb had tendered his resignation is a setback for consumers and potentially a bad sign for the future. gottlieb was unusual in this administration for his repeated willingness to stand up for the american public against powerful pharmaceutical, tobacco and vaping companies and has been unafraid to stake out new regulation as an important part of that effort.
the american tragedy: a lousy economy and lots of covid-19 infections
aetna's announcement comes a month after the department of justice blocked its merger plans with humana, as well as anthem's (antx) purchase of cigna (ci). anthem has linked its merger with its obamacare participation.
there are political realities that exist in america that can be changed sometimes, and often are, but that are not often subject to sea changes.
cruz: in my view, american boots on the ground should always be the last step, and we need to exercise other steps before that. we have the availability of overwhelming airpower, and we have

that pushback has also created doubts in the minds of some gop senators. rob portman, r-ohio; bill cassidy, r-la.; and shelley moore capito, r-w.va., are among those who have expressed concerns about the house bill, as has dean heller, r-nev., it's not clear whether any of the house changes have satisfied those senators.
although barrett is expected to garner support from most, if not all, 53 republican senators, most democrats will likely oppose her confirmation. barrett has only been on the federal bench for three years, but she has conservative bona fides and credits the late justice antonin scalia with shaping her judicial philosophy.
his trade tariffs and deals certainly challenged the lousy deals of the past, but the result to date contributed to what the federal reserve calls a technical recession in the manufacturing sector and increasing economic strain on small farmers. no wonder bankruptcies and suicides are rising among small farmers. and while the white house trumpeted aid to farmers, the environmental working group reports that the top 10 percent of farms — the largest and most profitable, industrial scale farms in the country — received 50 percent of the money. the bottom 80 percent received an average of $5,136.
conway said trump views his handling of the crisis as a legacy issue and continually asks her for updates about what is taking place in the states.
the outcome of the referendum friday was a decisive win for the campaign to repeal the eighth amendment to the irish constitution, william and isaac write. the 1983 amendment enshrined an 'equal right to life' for mothers and 'the unborn' and outlawed almost all abortions — even in cases of rape, incest, fatal fetal abnormality or non-life-threatening risk to maternal health.
cooper: i want to get a first quick take from our panel, wolf, on just what to look for in this next hour as the doors open at caucuses one hour from now.
later in april, roberts tried another path. he began exploring whether, as the obama administration had argued, the individual mandate could be upheld as a tax. (cbs's jan crawford reported earlier on roberts' reversal on the mandate, but the full story of roberts' switch, including on medicaid expansion, and the changed votes of two liberal justices is detailed now for the first time.)
a ruling against the law would unleash chaos
1. kyrsten sinema claims she stopped a pay raise for congress — is she right?
between may and august 2017, an additional 9,487 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. matthew sutton, 39, a barber from pasadena, md., was one of them.

but the republican majority in the senate isn't interested in pursuing additional emergency relief for those who suddenly find themselves uninsured.
cruz talked to the media, standing in front of a backdrop with his logo on it — the kind people are photographed in front of at award shows. inside, an iowa family music group sings a song they wrote about cruz.
how will members of congress respond to the green new deal?
presidents going beyond their constitutional authority is nothing new, and it's imperative that congress fix this to restore our system of government. this week, the house judiciary committee will vote to launch a task force to examine the historic increase in presidential power and executive overreach, which is distorting the system of checks and balances enshrined in the constitution.
columbia, s.c. — on the eve of martin luther king jr. day, joe biden went to church in barack obama country.
speaking at the university of michigan, romney defended the individual mandate in the massachusetts plan, saying it was necessary to address the free rider problem of state residents declining to buy health care and then showing up at hospitals for care, leaving taxpayers to foot the bill.
so, this campaign is just started. we feel very, very good about the number of volunteers that are out there, the energy, the enthusiasm that's going to spread all across the country. and this will go all the way to the convention.
so what does merely incidental mean?
and so, you know, i just think it's sad that he's going to stoop to this level.
when you think about where we thought the a.c.a. was headed four years ago, and contrast that to where we are right now, on the cusp of a massive expansion of affordability, it's pretty exciting, said christen linke young, deputy director of the white house domestic policy council for health and veterans affairs.
story highlights the senate majority leader has had tense relationship with donald trump after the senate failed to pass health care, trump criticized mitch mcconnell
john king is here to brief us for what to watch for -- john.
in other words, the glass is half-empty. that's not all that far from ted cruz's declaration in thursday's debate that people are struggling through seven years of barack obama.
olsen continued, what we are doing is we are living in a world where people are accepting of some degree of government involvement. they don't want total government control, but they want the government to help average people live dignified lives, and sometimes that means subsidy or regulation.
this isn't officially included on this list. it isn't the fairest comparison, given that half a century has passed and the country looks markedly different than it did in 1971. but the may day protests against the vietnam war have been described as the largest mass arrest and largest mass acquittal of demonstrators in us history.
spicer: no, i'm not going to get into conversations that i have with the president. but i will tell you that it's not -- it's not just about a crowd size. it's about this constant -- you know, he's not going to run. then if he runs, he's going to drop out. then if he runs, he can't win, there's no way he can win pennsylvania, there's no way he can win michigan.
let's check in with our brianna keilar, who is there.
on march 19, 2018, trump and sessions traveled to manchester, n.h., to highlight the fight against opioids. the president told the crowd gathered at manchester community college that congress was working on legislation that would set aside billions to fight the epidemic. he said he planned to increase funding to develop nonaddictive painkillers. he also said he was working to shut down illegal online marketplaces to block fentanyl coming in from china.
university of texas law professor stephen vladeck says he expects that with barrett's confirmation, the court would be transformed into the most conservative court since the 1930s, a court that is much more aggressive in its conservative agenda.
if your salary is changing at your new job, you should adjust your budget accordingly.
obama spokeswoman katie hill, in a statement, called the ad despicable.
many of next year's premium rate increases on the affordable care act exchanges threaten to surpass the high and wildly fluctuating rates that characterized the individual insurance market before the health law took effect, interviews with insurance regulators and records show.
(yes, the food stamp program. among other things, it is well-known to investigators that some snap card holders engage in trafficking of their benefits, and often purchase drugs with the money they receive. this has been specifically cited as a contributing factor to the opioid crisis. also, shop owners have been prosecuted for allowing customers to use snap benefits to pay directly for forbidden items. one such case documented in the senate report involved a small grocery store with a back-room stash of medicaid-funded oxycontin pills.)
washington republicans, meanwhile, predict a replay. they argue the legislation's popularity will drop as voters are exposed to less popular aspects of the law, and suggest it won't serve as the economic rocket ship democrats are expecting.
several senators are already expressing concerns about the proposal.
spicer: i'm not going to - no decision has been made at this time on that.
trump touted the inclusion of repeal of the obamacare individual mandate. obamacare is just about over, he said, indicating that the department of health and human services is working on a new plan to be released in a very short period of time.
garcia-navarro: all right, kevin eisbrenner and rena tolson, thanks so much for coming in.
many veterans of white house work see the anxiety over flynn's decision to cooperate with investigators as perhaps tipping the scales a little for those who are torn between departing at year's end, or staying on.
i hear the rickets family, who own the chicago cubs, are secretly spending $'s against me. they better be careful, they have a lot to hide! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) february 22, 2016
4) a big year one priority slips to year two
eisbrenner: you know, that's one - that's why, you know - they say how do you grade him on 1 to 10? and i say maybe 7.5. that's one of the little things there that - you know, that and his twitter, i wish he would stop a little bit of that, you know, the reactionary part and, you know, talk to his advisers because sometimes just shooting from the hip, you end up shooting yourself in the foot.
the same could not be said for insuring vehicles. forget all those funny tv ads about cut-rate plans: auto insurance jumped 5.7% last year.
trump had not set a record for total judges appointed as of this point in a first presidential term; jimmy carter had appointed 197 judges by late january of his fourth year in office, according to data from russell wheeler , a visiting fellow at the brookings institution who tracks judicial appointments. wheeler said trump has appointed 187 judges by traditional counting methods -- two supreme court justices, 50 appeals court judges and 135 district court judges -- but that it's possible to get to a total of 191 judges by adding trump's three appointments to the court of federal claims and his designation of a sitting judge on that court as chief judge.
-- a russian cybersecurity firm banned from u.s. government networks helped the nsa identify a suspect in the agency's massive 2016 data breach. ellen nakashima reports: federal prosecutors in august 2016 arrested a former nsa contractor, harold t. martin iii, accusing him of taking home without permission at least 50 terabytes of data — the rough equivalent of 500 million pages of material — that included highly sensitive hacking tools. but the nsa's enhanced vigilance was not what led to martin's arrest at his home in glen burnie, md. rather, earlier that month, moscow-based kaspersky lab notified the nsa that it had received strange twitter messages from martin seeking to speak with kaspersky's founder, along with a cryptic comment, 'shelf life, three weeks,' according to two people familiar with the matter.
kaine: congress needed to weigh in.
klacik, a baltimore county republican central committee member, generated buzz with appearances on fox news. her social media posts last year showing trash and blight in baltimore prompted a call for her to appear on the network's program fox & friends. president donald trump went on to describe the 7th congressional district in tweets last year as a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess where no human being would want to live, at a time when cummings was the powerful house oversight committee chairman, leading multiple investigations of the president at the time.
the republican party will soon be known as the party of health care – you watch, trump told reporters after the justice department asked an appeals court to uphold a texas judge's decision to invalidate the entire law known as obamacare.
three republican senators tuesday effectively scuttled senate majority leader mitch mcconnell's plan to repeal the affordable care act without replacing it. this was hours after the senate's bill to repeal and replace obamacare was blocked when two more gop senators came out in opposition to it.
problem no. 1 is you're not just going to get people who have been unable to find work in the private sector for whatever reason, said douglas holtz-eakin, a former director of the congressional budget office and president of the right-leaning american action forum. you're going to get a lot of people. and a lot of people means a lot of money, so the federal budget is going to explode.
the agreement is the clearest evidence yet that the split between gordon, a central figure in the state's response to covid-19, and whitmer was not amicable, and it shows the democratic administration used taxpayer funds to ease his departure, the detroit news's craig mauger reports.
trump has not let up. he's issued 13 tweets critical of amazon since the middle of 2017, including a barrage in the past five days targeting the company's shipping deal with the u.s. post office. he's claimed the post office loses money even though independent analysis shows the usps makes a profit on the deal.
that's not the case today. today, insurers can cover abortion services in states that allow such benefits, just as long as the insurers don't use federal dollars of any kind. in other words, insurers can't use money they've received in the form of premium tax credits. back when csr money was coming in, they couldn't use that money either.
enrollees would pay no more than 8.5% of their income towards coverage, down from nearly 10% now. also, those earning more than the current cap of 400% of the federal poverty level -- about $51,000 for an individual and $104,800 for a family of four in 2021 -- would become eligible for help. the provision, which is retroactive to january, would last for two years.
the problem is obamacare has just collapsed, said brat, who stood at a podium in the blackstone herb cottage, a restaurant and event space. the crowd shouted in response, no, it has not!
here's a closer look at what trump said wednesday, with analysis from arizona republic reporters.
lisa murkowski: republicans have to admit that some of the things in the aca we actually liked. and the democrats have to admit that some of the things that they voted for in the aca are broken and need to be fixed.
to ensure this corrupt dictatorship never acquires nuclear weapons, i withdrew the united states from the disastrous iran nuclear deal. and last fall, we put in place the toughest sanctions ever imposed on a country.
so i am calling on all democrats and republicans in the congress to work with us to save americans from this imploding obamacare disaster.
bernie sanders: we must and will defeat trump.
minnesota gov. mark dayton said he has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. the news comes just hours after he fainted during his state of the state address, setting off alarm bells and prompting questions about his health, though he recovered shortly after. in a news conference, dayton said he had planned to disclose the cancer next week after further tests and visits with his doctor. i don't expect it to impede my performance or responsibilities, he said, but i'll know more next week.

for all these reasons, it is vitally important that the people vote for the biden-harris ticket. trump has gravely weakened the nation's economy, while biden has shown over his life that he cares about people's chances for prosperity and rewarding lives—for achieving the american dream.
10:25 p.m. et candidates are asked what they would prioritize as the most important aspect of picking a supreme court justice.
courrielche explained, in a nutshell, we recorded a white house conference call where the obama administration tried to use a federal arts agency — the nea — to create propaganda, all to sell the american people on obamacare. … the nea story [was when] we caught the obama administration trying to turn the national endowment of the arts into a propaganda machine. … they encouraged us to create art on health care, on energy and the environment, and they wanted us to bring whatever art network [or] talent that we had to those issues. at the time, some experts claimed that the effort might have violated a law prohibiting federal funds for being used for political activities.
— a few of the latest headlines and developments to catch up on this morning:
she said, when my youngest daughter, alexandra, was going into senior year, i [said], 'alexandra, mommy has a chance to run for congress. but you have one more year at home, so i'm hesitant to do that. if you don't think i should go, i won't, and i'm happy with that decision.' and she said, 'mother, get a life!' what teenage girl wouldn't want her mother out of the house three nights a week!
so far, at least one democrat on the committee, senator chris coons of delaware, has committed to asking barrett about obamacare.
you have to engage the people and listen to their concerns, and if you don't do that then what you do is empower people like kamala harris or like elizabeth warren who are going to say, 'their answer is no answer, and mine's the only one on the table. you gotta pick me,' olsen added.
monday's announcement represents the latest in a series of gop efforts to accomplish through regulation what republicans could not accomplish through legislation when they tried, and just barely failed, to pass legislation that would have repealed the affordable care act outright.
a policy like a job guarantee could help win over the left wing of the party. but it's also the kind of idea that may never be much more than a campaign promise.
barrett's busy schedule and her many roles leave people in south bend, ind., scratching their heads and asking this question: how does she do it?

multiple gop officials noted the difference in circumstances: while health care is a highly polarizing issue, poll after poll has made clear that relief for a country struggling through dual economic and public health crises simply isn't.

bruni: as a member of the (very populous) camp of americans who believe that president trump is a great danger to us and that we desperately need him to be checked by at least one chamber of congress in democratic control, i have to admit that i'm spooked by some of what i've seen recently. a washington post/abc news poll over the weekend showed that 58 percent of americans rate the economy good or excellent — that's a 17-year high. another recent poll showed that the generic-democratic versus generic-republican difference had collapsed from over 10 points to just six. tell me why i shouldn't — or should — be hugely worried.

trump successfully ran for president by demeaning his enemies and rallying his base to deride his opponents. those habits have followed him to the white house, and mcconnell has regularly been that punching bag.
trump's 2020 budget, however, reduces medicare spending by $845 billion over 10 years compared to current law. that includes shifting roughly $269 billion in funding for training medical residents and payments to hospitals for caring for the uninsured to the department of health and human services' budget.

sen. ted cruz (r-tex.), ahead or tied for the lead in most recent iowa polls, is making a six-day primary-season pilgrimage across iowa this week, looping around the state on a journey that began monday in the center of the state, in the town of boone. here's the view from the press bus on day one.
so that's where all the lying comes from. fortunately, the truth is easy to find. if the gop survives what's shaping up to be a brutal election year and retains control of congress, rest assured they will again come for health care. they always try.
in july 2017, the justice department shut down the largest dark-web distributor of illicit drugs. called alphabay, the site allowed users to sell and buy drugs, including fentanyl. at the time of the takedown, there were 250,000 listings for illegal drugs and toxic chemicals on the site, according to the justice department.

rather than try to walk it back, however, sean spicer defended trump's take the oil line during his briefing on monday. he wants to be sure america is getting something out of it for the commitment and sacrifice it is making, the press secretary said.
clinton and congressional republicans disagreed over federal spending, and republicans refused to sign a bill in an effort to get democrats to cut funding for medicare and medicaid.

the house-passed measure makes the most sweeping changes to the program since its inception in 1965. some of these changes, such as capping federal funding, would provoke intraparty divisions. uninsured rates: the congressional budget office initially estimated that the house bill would mean the loss of coverage for 24 million people. many analysts say this number is now likely higher.

and, if we go into government shutdown, for example, that means furloughing employees, furloughing homeland security officials. as craig fugate, the administrator of fema, pointed out the other day, if we go into government shutdown, he's got to furlough something like 80 percent of his fema work force.
biden's appeal to moderates includes his pledge to build on the affordable care act, or obamacare, named after the president he served under for eight years. long popular with african-american voters, the former vice president has also proposed creating national standards for home appraisals, as part of an effort to stamp out racial discrimination in the real-estate industry.

sure, because her husband stayed out of the way of a booming economy ushered in by the reagan/bush years and a tech boom, the 90s were prosperous… but the clinton years were more than just an economy. they represented a decade of scandal and perjury and extra-marital affairs and ethical short cuts and the renting of the lincoln bedroom.

left unsaid in this defense, of course, is that trump also helped remake the republican party in ways party leaders couldn't imagine, in ways that seemed fantastic at first. he was the first republican in 30 years to win wisconsin in the 2016 elections. he flipped michigan and the all-important pennsylvania. he helped boost turnout in 2020 down the ballot that stopped a blue wave in its tracks.

-- jeff weaver, who ran sen. bernie sanders's 2016 presidential campaign, will take on a diminished role if the vermont senator runs again. david weigel reports: sources said the decision was made months earlier, long before a group of former campaign staffers asked for a meeting to create a new sexual harassment policy ahead of any 2020 decisions, asking in a letter for sanders to '[hire] diverse leadership to preempt the possibility of replicating the predatory culture for the first campaign.' weaver, 53, has worked closely with [sanders] for much of the senator's career. he first helped sanders as the driver for his unsuccessful 1986 bid for governor; in 2016, he helped build a long-shot campaign into a powerhouse that broke small-dollar fundraising records and won 23 primaries or caucuses.
bash: senator, thank you so much for joining us.
in a february, kaiser family foundation poll on the aca, 50% approved of it while 37% disapproved. in fact, since president barack obama left office in january 2017, his signature legislative accomplishment – and the one that bears his name – has grown steadily more popular. since may 2017, according to kaiser data, more people have approved of obamacare than disapprove – a sea change from most of the previous five years, when the law was consistently underwater in terms of approval. many of the provisions of the law that have long been the most popular – allowing kids to stay on their parents' insurance through age 26, no discrimination by insurance companies because of a patient's preexisting conditions – remain in effect. the least popular provision – the individual mandate that forced everyone in the country to have some sort of health care – was effectively eliminated by congressional republicans (and trump) in their 2017 tax law.
the last consideration — casting trump not as their protector but as a menace — will be key. telling voters he's an awful person may be totally ineffective; they know that already. telling them that he's going after their medicare and obamacare, hurting farmers with a tariff war, making the gap between rich and poor worse, and endangering the planet for them and their children by willful ignorance over climate change is quite another. the more concrete and immediate the threat (e.g., extreme weather, loss of health-care coverage), the more impact the message may have.
he had to be thinking he did the right thing, stevens said in a 2016 interview in his chambers, because he certainly made himself very unpopular with the conservatives.

simmons-duffin: so testing is covered if you can get a test. it's still not very widespread. congress passed that into law that it must be covered. treatment is still an open question. if you do end up in the hospital, even with insurance, you might end up paying thousands in deductibles or co-pays. a few insurance companies are waiving those patient costs, and others might follow suit. there is one more worry here i wanted to mention. hospitals and doctors can also bill patients directly. those are surprise bills or balance bills. that has not been addressed by congress, so that's another worry for folks in addition to all the other worries.
what donald trump says about muslims is used to recruit fighters, she said.
republican congressional leaders have essentially given up on repealing obamacare ― at least in this congress. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) made clear earlier this year that he has no intention of leading his conference into another fight over the law, despite trump's vow to turn the gop into the party of health care. the kentucky republican is instead focusing on retaining his majority next year by hammering democrats over medicare for all, a government-run health care proposal he says will put the country on a dangerous path to socialism.
many staffers admitted changing their minds about a policy topic after speaking with a lobbying group that had given money to their boss's campaign. 45% of staffers agreed they had developed a new perspective about a policy after speaking with a group that provided campaign contributions to their member, the authors write. this result suggests that a potentially large share of senior congressional staffers have had their thinking about policy shaped by interest groups that provided their member campaign contributions.
during the debate, clinton defended president obama's signature healthcare law and said, 20 million people have health insurance.

some of the most visible trump health officials, like jerome adams, the former surgeon general, and alex azar, the former hhs secretary, have yet to announce new ventures. a person familiar with azar's thinking says he's intentionally taking his time.
in fact, as margot sanger-katz of the new york times pointed out on tuesday, eliminating coverage requirements for the pre-existing conditions could have all sorts of far-reaching effects, making it difficult, or perhaps even impossible, for the federal government to distribute tax credits that today help millions afford coverage.
if we don't kill obamacare soon, we will get shaken down for billions of dollars to prop up the insurance companies… and that will become another epic middle-class tax increase, on top of the one we've already been hit with, to sustain a scheme very few taxpayers approve of.
that scenario could lead to a constitutional crisis, rudalevige said, especially if we still have an eight-member supreme court, assuming that the late justice antonin scalia's seat remained unfilled.
trump's own aides, many of whom are tasked with working with congress to turn trump's campaign promises into legislation, have privately lamented that the president's attacks against members of his own party – most importantly mcconnell – have made it more difficult to win over skeptical lawmakers.
mcgann also criticized daily beast writer matt lewis, who called ocasio-cortez the telegenic it girl of the left.
sanders is hoping for a better fate four years later. now is the time to take on the greed and corruption of the health care industry, of the drug companies, and finally provide health care to all through a medicare-for-all single-payer program, sanders said at last night's debate.

as a result, the uninsured rate rose last year for the first time since the bill was enacted in 2010 — 12.2% of americans are now uninsured. while the aca has managed to slow the rate of premium increases, they are still rising faster than wages and the inflation rate.

but even if hatch and grassley were truly interested in bipartisanship, they did not speak for their party or for leadership, which from the beginning urged members to oppose obama's agenda fully ― as mitch mcconnell, who was (and is again) the senate minority leader, later admitted. all of this happened at a time when the gop was also becoming more ideologically extreme, with conservatives displacing the remaining moderates.

the spinoff bills — a tax bill, a spending bill (or a combined deficit-increasing or deficit-reducing bill that includes both tax and spending changes) and debt-ceiling bill — are immune to the filibuster in the senate, meaning they can be passed with 50 votes and the vice president's vote as the tiebreaker. but if parts of the bills stray from budget-related issues, they can get stripped out individually and require a supermajority, usually 60 votes, to retain.

fun fact: obamacare, better known as the law, already does that. — rose benson (@notoriousrbf) august 8, 2020
levin: how do you qualify to go on there?
if you don't qualify for medicaid, next look to the state insurance exchanges that were set up under the aca. the trump administration has decided not to open a special enrollment period for healthcare.gov, the federal insurance exchange. but some states run their own insurance marketplaces and have created a special enrollment period during the coronavirus crisis. in these states — including hard-hit places like california and new york — that means you don't need to have a qualifying event like job-based coverage loss or the birth of a child to newly enroll right now in an obamacare plan.
cooper: but to bill's point earlier, the fact that if you have all these younger voters, if they're voting by their college, that's not a good thing. or if they're caucusing by their college, that's not a great thing for bernie sanders. he has got to get them to go to their home districts.
as we work to defend our people's safety, we must also ensure our economic resurgence continues at a rapid pace.
roberts posited in a draft opinion that congress had in effect held a gun to the head of the states by conditioning all medicaid money on the expanded coverage. yet he was not prepared to find that the expansion had to be scrapped altogether, only that states could not be forced to join through the leverage of losing all medicaid funding.
for all the polls showing trump would lose to clinton, his supporters — whether blue-collar workers or new york city donors — say the surveys may prove wrong. (indeed, trusting general election polls this early is dangerous: michael dukakis polled ahead of george h.w. bush in the spring and summer of 1988, but bush won the presidency handily that fall.)
the aca, signed by obama in 2010, followed decades of failed attempts in washington to control spiraling medical costs and provide americans with higher-quality health care. it created a marketplace where the uninsured could buy coverage and protected people from being unable to get health insurance because of pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, cancer and other chronic illnesses. to support the system and draw in the healthy as well as the sick, the law required that most uninsured people obtain coverage (the individual mandate) or pay a penalty, to be collected as part of an individual's annual taxes -- a provision critical to the final ruling.
i want to go back to what the gentleman said about the mandate -- the (inaudible). he said something about the obamacare (inaudible) in the mandate.
folks: this is simple. there are a great many longtime democrats living in toss-up states who didn't like the direction that president obama took the country. those voters, many of them union members, decided to take a flyer on neophyte candidate donald trump. why? because he talked about things that mattered to them – like jobs and manufacturing and trade deals. he also appealed to their patriotism and common sense, like putting america first.
meyers did ask him about his 2020 prospects, and what he would say about the attacks on him from the right calling him the hollywood candidate. we do have more kardashians than anywhere else, but most of us are not kardashians … so i can relate to that conversation on a local level with the mayor in dayton, a mayor in columbia, south carolina, mayor in south bend, indiana, like mayor pete (buttigieg) … and we speak the language i think of america. it's washington that's that swamp and it's only getting swampier.
senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.):
on monday, the trump administration said the entire affordable care act should be struck down, in a dramatic reversal. the justice department said in a filing with a federal appeals court that it agreed with the ruling of a federal judge in texas that invalidated the obama-era health care law.
well, i said to my wife, well, i got to go with joe. we're like best friends, you know? and she's like, you don't talk to the guy.
in the jama article, obama made several other recommendations for improving obamacare. he called on the 19 states who have not expanded medicaid to do so and on congress to increase financial assistance to make obamacare coverage more affordable. and he said congress should help reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring drug makers to disclose their production and development costs, increasing the rebates manufacturers must give for drugs prescribed to certain medicare and medicaid beneficiaries, and allowing the federal government to negotiate prices for certain high-cost medications.
the paper argues that the labor department doesn't do a good job in measuring underemployment. its current measure of part time for economic reasons does not ask how many hours the underemployed want to work.

in fact, as gallup reported wednesday, the number of uninsured americans has increased during trump's time in office, from a low at the end of barack obama's second term in office — a function of the implementation of the affordable care act (known more generally as obamacare). the attitude of trump's administration toward obamacare has varied from indifferent to overtly hostile.
it's almost impossible to wrap your brain around how this would actually work, sabrina corlette, a research professor at georgetown university, told huffpost. it's almost like you'd need a special master to go through these changes, line by line, to figure out what's constitutional and what's not.

bertolini spoke at length about the need to transform the health-care system and care for people before they are acutely sick. smarter interventions could lead to better outcomes and lower costs, he argued. and he said high drug prices aren't always a problem. he pointed to the new generation of hepatitis c therapies, which can cure the disease but are expensive — and argued that curing hepatitis c is better than waiting to pay for a liver transplant.
there are still a few states where republican governors and lawmakers refuse to expand medicaid. but residents may force their hands at the polls in november.
having last week joined trump and tom price in offering the old gop deception that a bill cutting health care benefits is not actually a cut; and saying that people cut off from obamacare could simply get jobs to fix the problem, even though many jobs don't come with health benefits, kellyanne conway offered up a new swipe at americans who may lose some health coverage if the latest gop health care bill is enacted. addressing the impact on opioid addicts of gop cuts to medicaid, after trump early this year pledged to expand treatment for those who have become so badly addicted, conway said such patients can overcome such funding shortfalls with a four-letter word called 'will.' senator ed markey (d-ma), whose state saw nearly 2,000 opioid overdose deaths last year, responded that conway owes an apology to the entire addiction and treatment community for her outrageous and disrespectful remarks.
he also wants to raise the value of pell grants, doubling the top amount students can receive.

but over the course of spring 2016, clinton steadily grew her delegate lead over sanders, winning key blowout victories in southern states with lots of african-american voters. sanders refused to drop out, and campaigned through june. even after clinton clinched the delegates needed to win the nomination on the first ballot, sanders still didn't concede until shortly before the democratic national convention.

sen. dean heller is widely considered the most vulnerable senator in the majority and is the only republican senator seeking re-election in a state that hillary clinton won in 2016. although he avoided a potentially tricky primary with mr. trump's help, his close ties with the president and his agenda could be fatal to his campaign. in 2017, heller co-sponsored a bill to repeal and replace the affordable care act, which would have reportedly cost nevada $250 million in federal health care funding. heller said in august that republicans made a big mistake by tackling obamacare as their first major legislative move with trump in office.
and though many in the party establishment don't like cruz, some top republicans argued that the texas senator would have been a better general election nominee than trump. not only is he a disciplined candidate with views more in line with traditional republicans, but there would be a silver lining, they believed, if he lost: it would be hard for cruz to revive his political career.
turley: well, it's a very sad moment. but it's becoming a particularly dangerous moment if the president is going to go forward particularly after this election to defy the will of congress yet again. i can understand the frustration. these are obviously two parties that are not getting along. but as you said we do have a democratic process. we have a congress that is coming in with the full voice of the american people behind them. that's what an election is. now, you may disagree with the outcome, but you have to respect the outcome.
lesley stahl: when you replace it, are you going to make sure that people with pre-conditions are still covered?
and i think that's why ted cruz has made such an aggressive play to go to those 99 counties, to pick up and win the places that huckabee and rick santorum have won before. he has been very up front saying that i want to be the candidate that conservatives coalesce behind.
but republican leaders and mr. trump appear to be laying the groundwork for blaming the law they are annulling for the fallout likely to come in the repeal's wake.

i just want to lay it on the line, that the country deserves better, the mccain family deserves better, i don't care if he's president of united states, owns all the real estate in new york, or is building the greatest immigration system in the world. nothing is more important than the integrity of the country and those who fought and risked their lives for all of us, he said.
we were elected on a pledge to try and repeal obamacare, said representative david jolly, republican of florida. if we are unsuccessful in a veto override, i think we should turn our attention to other matters like national security. but if we get a republican in the white house, then we need to turn to solutions. the focus can't be just on repealing obamacare. it has to be, 'what is our health care plan?'
other stars just wanted to talk about clinton's white pantsuit.
so finding coverage for specialists and out-of-network services isn't as tough a problem for judges as it can be in the often narrow networks aca enrollees rely on. and federal employees have the option of keeping their coverage into retirement, unlike many private employer plans.
we now know that all of those promises have been broken.
the american health care act, which narrowly won passage in the house on thursday, could transform the nation's health insurance system and create a new slate of winners and losers.

whether a litigant who is directly protected by an administrative rule and has been allowed to intervene to defend it lacks standing to appeal a decision invalidating the rule if the litigant is also protected by an injunction from a different court; and whether the federal government lawfully exempted religious objectors from the regulatory requirement to provide health plans that include contraceptive coverage.
other moderate democrats agreed. the argument was that the white house could move the package in two steps. but in conversations with biden's team, including chief of staff ron klain, the reality of the situation began to come into focus. separating out the bills could take time and potentially take the pressure off republicans to back the larger package altogether.
● environment. the administration revoked one of the most significant obama-era environmental rules, over waters of the united states. the earlier regulation had expanded federal protection and regulation of such waters to include streams, ponds and even drainage ditches that feed into larger waterways. environmental groups argue that the change will result in massive loss of wetlands critical for combating climate change and threaten the drinking water supply.
instead, many in the crowded 2016 republican field spent much of the early primary season telling voters they were more conservative than the next guy – narrowing their pitch to the hard-right and alienating those very constituencies party leaders had identified as crucial for victory. and the candidate who has done the most to offend those groups – trump – rose like a rocket.

they are our allies. in the budapest memorandum, we committed ourselves to standing with ukraine to defend themselves -- to defend their territorial integrity.
khalid: that's the background noise you probably hear (laughter). i was in dallas last night, where biden got the endorsement of pete buttigieg, amy klobuchar and beto o'rourke. and, you know, when you listen to the former vice president, he kind of seems to speak with a renewed vigor. here's a snippet.
some democrats in the house and senate support some version of medicare-for-all. progressives in congress may take the opportunity to try to pass a more comprehensive health care bill, although with republicans still controlling the senate, such a measure could die in the house.
finally, the time has come to give americans the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines — creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will bring cost way down and provide far better care.

entrepreneur andrew yang and sen. michael bennet of colorado dropped out of the race for the democratic presidential nomination, but nine candidates remain in a field that once had over two dozen presidential hopefuls.
the confirmation hearing for trump's supreme court nominee, judge amy coney barrett, is scheduled to start oct. 12. barrett would replace justice ruth bader ginsburg, a member of the court's liberal wing, who died at age 87 last month.

the caucus's influence also has limits, especially because democrats control the house. the group and its allies are outnumbered in congress, whose cooperation the president needs to implement his agenda. for example, when the white house recently joined a legal challenge against the affordable care act — a decision traced to mulvaney — members of both congressional parties openly complained. trump promised a new health-care law to replace the aca, or obamacare, but retreated when senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) told him the senate wouldn't pass one.
i've gotten to know many wonderful angel moms, dads, and families – no one should ever have to suffer the horrible heartache they have endured.
but it shows that nearly six years after its enactment, the health law remains one of the most divisive political issues of the obama presidency. for many americans, the health law is seen as costly, cumbersome and a government infringement on freedoms, even as it has spread health coverage to millions and ensured popular benefits like ending lifetime coverage limits and the denial of insurance for pre-existing medical conditions. this week's house vote was the 62nd to fully or partly repeal the health law but only the first that sent legislation to the president's desk.
the status quo is something that nobody in the democratic circles really likes, and doesn't want to embrace. the status quo represents the banks that we have to break up, the health care system that isn't working for people, and trade agreements that aren't working for people.
q&a: what does the department of education say about transgender bathrooms?
still, austan goolsbee, the former chair of president obama's economic council, said the sanders campaign is being a little sneaky about the final tab for taxpayers, including working seniors.
trump is no more honest than the next politician — some are, and some are not, just as in any other segment of american life, rice wrote. he is also just as political as any person in washington. you don't have to hold public office to be political.
with obamacare, we've made this gigantic step ... and then suddenly to just take it away without any rational plan in place seems totally irresponsible, says bill phelps, chief of program services at clinica sierra vista, a network of health care clinics serving 200,000 patients. they're playing chess with the american population.
in his address yesterday, he criticized the president's response. trump keeps saying that he's a wartime president. well, start to act like one. … donald trump is not to blame for the coronavirus, but he does bear responsibility for our response, he said. i, along with every american, hope he steps up and starts to get this right.
that said, there's a lot of education still to be done because health care is very complicated. and so that's where when someone like elizabeth warren, who's just a real master communicator on policy, where she comes in and she explains the for-profit health care system by saying, basically, they profit when they say no to you. that's really helpful. it helps put the whole idea of a government single-payer plan in context. and so i do think the debates are important for giving opportunities for what's not just a democratic primary audience but a general election audience who's also watching the basic facts about what is health care, who pays for it, what it costs.
this is health care in the united states now, she said. and so what we need to do now is make sure we're working to make this system and these changes work the best they can.
fellow billionaire tom steyer has urged bloomberg to support a wealth tax, but bloomberg said other countries have failed to show it can be successful.
if you did something like eliminated coverage for everyone, that would not certainly be positive, unless it's replaced with something that provided equal or more coverage, said giroir, senior opioid adviser to the secretary of the department of health and human services.
harper: well, it's pence and his entire health team seem to have gone with him to d.c. so seema verma, who is now the head of centers for medicare and medicaid services, is often referred to as the architect of indiana's medicaid program. health and human services secretary alex azar used to be the head of eli lilly, which is based in indianapolis. and u.s. surgeon general jerome adams, who just joined the white house coronavirus task force, was the state health commissioner here for years.
on health care, bloomberg called medicare for all — which is supported in some form by most of the democratic candidates — a solution to the problem. he said it's better to tweak obamacare and restore some of the cuts that were taken away. former vice president joe biden has a similar stance.
and with that could come another problem, holtz-eakin said: an expensive program could mean tax hikes. and he fears those tax hikes could exacerbate the problems that a jobs guarantee is designed to help.
protect our care, which has been described as a project of the sixteen thirty fund, has also been running an ad against sen. steve daines, r-mont., reportedly tying his opposition to obamacare to the coronavirus. on thursday, protect our care announced a coronavirus war room staffed with former aides to hillary clinton's and elizabeth warren's campaigns.
what i would like to do is legalize inexpensive insurance and you should be able to get insurance for $1 a day — i mean, you really should, paul said. the insurance companies make all the money. all of this is predicated upon still, you know, propping up the insurance companies. the insurance companies hate the idea of the buying pools where you can join an association and drive prices down. they absolutely hate it because they think it might eat into their profit. they love sort of privatizing their $15 billion-a-year profit but then socializing their losses in the individual market. i have absolutely no sympathy for the insurance companies to be bailed out by the taxpayer. that $15 billion in profit, that's where the risk should come from. that's where the — when we have to absorb risk when people get sick, it should come out of their profit, it shouldn't come out of the taxpayer's pocket.
montana health co-op, which has about 35,000 members in idaho and montana, is focused on holding down administrative costs. it has about 20 full-time employees and hasn't replaced some that left. some people we had during our startup mode we figured we can now work without them, said spokeswoman karen early.
the authors of the study, john graham and campbell harvey, finance professors at duke's fuqua school of business, also considered and rejected a number of hypotheses to explain the gap between the cost of capital and the return cfos want. for example, it isn't that small companies involve higher risks; large companies actually set a higher hurdle rate than smaller ones.
the first is his claim that the entire republican party would always, and very strongly, protect patients with preexisting conditions. this simply isn't true. the gop has dedicated dozens of congressional votes over the years to repealing obamacare, including its protections blocking insurance companies from denying coverage to people with preexisting health conditions. trump's justice department supports a lawsuit aiming to strike down the entire law that is soon to go before the supreme court. various republicans have tried to introduce legislation that could replace obamacare's protections, but health care experts have consistently said those bills would fall short of the protections the affordable care act offers.
certainly democrats should talk about how trump has undermined national unity, civility and stature in the world, but democrats should also pay attention to what voters are saying. they hate the chaos, the tweets, the constant turmoil. perhaps let america be sane may be the most effective thing a democrat has to offer. hence, they better pick someone calm, authoritative, reliable and drama-free.
tate, who then had a private market plan to cover lucas, credited two provisions of the affordable care act for giving his family security and peace of mind after lucas' initial treatment was over. one was a requirement to cover people with pre-existing conditions. if the aca hadn't been there and i needed another private plan, they would have denied him coverage, tate said.
courtesy barack obama presidential library. joe biden, seen here with then-president barack obama celebrating house passage of the affordable care act in 2010, now has a chance to reinforce and build on the health care law in a way that obama never did.
there are five planks in romney's proposal. the first is to give more power to states through medicaid block grants, more flexibility in dealing with the ill and uninsured and limits on federal standards.
while trump ran on a very clear and precise agenda about lowering taxes, cutting regulations, protecting gun and religious rights, getting a handle on illegal immigration, and making america great again, hillary promised a return to the 1990s, to the clinton years, as though that would be a good thing.
but also casting a shadow over barrett's confirmation hearing are possible legal showdowns stemming from the november election, as mr. trump has predicted the outcome of the presidential race could be decided by the supreme court.
el intercambio fue un momento de gran tensión, en un escenario ubicado muy cerca de la iglesia en charleston donde un autoproclamado supremacista blanco mató a nueve afroamericanos en un tiroteo el año pasado.
it isn't just on health care that democrats have gone off the reservation. consider the candidates – bernie among them – vowing to ban fracking, and promising the end of fossil fuels. are they not aware that in critical swing states like pennsylvania and ohio thousands of workers are making lots of money working in the oilfields? that those states have hauled in hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenues courtesy of oil and petrochemical development?
at the epa , communications staff received a memo instructing them that no social media will be going out and a digital strategist will be coming on board to oversee it. it added, incoming media requests will carefully screened.
public health experts have long known that the presence or absence of health insurance can influence death rates, said dr. georges benjamin, executive director of the american public health association, who was not involved in the new research.
steve ricchetti, biden's campaign chairman, has lobbied for major pharmaceutical companies. biden's campaign has also received contributions from 15 pharmaceutical and health insurance company executives.
the peak lobbying spending in 2009 and 2010 was driven in large part by efforts to influence obamacare and the dodd-frank financial reform law, as well as cap-and-trade legislation and the employee free choice act, the revolving door project's hauser said.
no. the president was not in washington and not in politics when the affordable care act was written, debated and passed in 2009 and 2010. the health law established consumer protections for americans who buy their insurance, including a rule that health insurers must offer coverage to anyone who wishes to buy it, with prices varying only by region and the age of the customer.

hhs has been busy tracking down hundreds of thousands of americans who bought subsidized coverage through the aca's insurance exchanges.
while the hospitals, the doctors and the insurers, which benefit when more people have coverage, had previously united to fight the attempts to repeal obamacare by the republicans in 2017, the new coalition also includes the chamber, which had not been a proponent of the law.
in practice, although it may have made health care more accessible to some, it did so at the cost of making it less affordable and worse quality for many others.
just last week, a report from the congressional budget office predicted that removing the individual mandate but keeping other obamacare provisions, such as the pre-existing condition guarantee, would lead to premiums jumping by 20 to 25 percent within a year, above and beyond current projections.
in the case before the supreme court, texas and other conservative-led states argue that the aca was essentially rendered unconstitutional after congress passed tax legislation in 2017 that eliminated the law's unpopular fines for not having health insurance, but left in place its requirement that virtually all americans have coverage.

so candidates are proposing this just because they think it's the right thing to do?
so far, the campaign is playing out a lot like it did in 2018, with republicans insisting, again, that they would never take away protections for people with preexisting conditions. several are running ads featuring family members who fought medical problems, just to prove how serious they are.
the price of premiums on the health care exchanges created by the affordable care act, which sell private insurance and allow consumers to qualify for federal subsidies to help pay for it, have stabilized in recent years. but trump has not supported those exchanges, commonly known as obamacare. under trump, funding for marketing and outreach to educate consumers about obamacare plans has been slashed, and the enrollment period has shortened.
10:19 p.m. et anderson cooper asked clinton how she can unite the country after her deplorables remark.
a close look at the democratic platform draft as well as biden's website and interviews with analysts suggests that biden wants to tackle several major challenges confronting those in the second half of life. it lays out the kind of policy framework president obama had, but several initiatives take it a step farther — perhaps an additional two to three steps.
the senate homeland security committee released a report in mid-january that received surprisingly little media attention despite its provocative assertion that obamacare, and particularly its enormous expansion of medicaid, is a driving force behind the opioid epidemic.
for about 20 minutes, protesters had been given verbal warnings to clear the street. some did, while others kept blocking traffic. police initially arrested three people, according to koin, and at least five others were arrested about 10 minutes later.
let me ask you a question or two. what do you think of your doctor? and what do you think of america's health care system? npr has been posing those questions in a survey that was conducted with the robert wood johnson foundation and the harvard t.h. chan school of public health. we have the results this morning. they'll be presented by npr health policy correspondent alison kodjak, who's in studios. good morning.
this is the chance. this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, said the speaker, roving the stage with a wireless mic, gesturing at both the audience in front of him and the powerpoint presentation behind him.
in most cases, keeping the money where it is seems simplest – but if your previous employer's plan is shutting down or if your balance is too small, that isn't always an option. even if you could keep your account where it is, you should still consider whether that's the best approach. you may be able to get more investment choices or lower fees by rolling the funds over to an ira or new 401(k), so be sure to compare the terms of each plan.

though the 78-year-old did not emerge as the democratic nominee in either of his two presidential bids, his campaigns have reshaped the party's politics and policy in significant ways. here's a look back at several key moments from the past five years:
mr. obama was also a topic of discussion at the debate in july when candidates argued over whether or not obamacare went far enough as well as that administration's immigration policies. on friday, mr. obama indirectly responded to those comments in his interview with abrams.
i ask because it is generally agreed that ousting president trump will require winning back those blue-collar workers in swing states who crossed party lines to vote republican in 2016. sanders is most definitely not the most likely candidate to do that.
a quick look on amazon shows the kindle version of bush's 2013 book, immigration wars: forging an american solution, goes for $11.99. the hardcover is priced at $18.78 and the paperback is $13.17. however, you can get a used copy for as little as 50 cents.
the energy on the left was on display tuesday, as activists turned out around the country ― more than 500 events were planned ― for a national day of action to support women's reproductive rights.
but really, bernie is not alone. no candidate seems to be tailoring his or her message to those traditional democrats who rejected hillary clinton.
trump questioned why obama didn't endorse biden early on in the campaign.
if you were invested in a workplace 401(k), you have a few options. you could keep it where it is, you could roll it over to an ira, or you could roll it over into your new employer's 401(k).
kennedy, however, joined by fellow conservative justices antonin scalia, thomas and samuel alito, believed the individual mandate was interconnected to other provisions of the new law and would entirely sink it. law clerks at the time portrayed walker as vigorously arguing the mandate central to provisions such as those guaranteeing coverage for pre-existing conditions and expanding medicaid coverage to needy people.

die-hard opponents of the 2010 health reform law, the affordable care act, have often used its real and imagined problems to argue that it is fatally flawed. now they are seizing on an announcement by aetna that it will reduce its participation in the health insurance marketplaces set up by the law. donald trump's campaign called aetna's move the latest blow to this broken law that is slowly imploding under its regulatory red tape.
neither sanders nor biden campaigned in person in the week leading up to primaries in arizona, florida and illinois, and biden won all three states.

while president trump promised to unite the nation, the truth is that he has only made america's divisions worse with his attacks on politicians, individuals and entire groups of people.

democrats (and the media) bound them together: here's senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.), who gave a speech urging his colleagues to confirm biden's win just an hour or so before rioters broke into the capitol: we just spent four years condemning democrats' shameful attempts on the validity of president trump's own election. … the media that is outraged today spent four years aiding and abetting democrats' attacks on our institutions after they lost.

capitol police arrest demonstrators protesting us supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh.
if twitter were required to allow trump to remain on its platform, even if it concludes that he has serially violated its terms of service — if private companies were required to host parler, even after determining that anti-democratic rhetoric proliferated on its platform — that wouldn't be a win for the first amendment or the marketplace of ideas. it would be a top-down mandate that private concerns are required to tolerate, and indirectly participate in, the dissemination of misinformation and of lawlessness, imposed by an arbitrary standard of fairness.

as aides held up red-arrowed charts at alex azar's confirmation hearing, sen. ron wyden, d-ore., said the price of drugs used to treat diabetes, osteoporosis, heart disease and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder more than doubled when azar was president of lilly's u.s.-based subsidiary.
it does seem that the court may be holding back on agreeing to decide some major issues, said stephen wermiel, a professor at american university's washington college of law, adding that it could be a deliberate effort or the byproduct of having three new justices seated over the past four years.
but instead of clinton finding a way to express that her plans are more tangible than sanders's, and her chances in the general election are stronger than his, she and her campaign have made some incredulous inferences about sanders's honor.
mr. trump, who typically forgoes wearing a mask himself, said there are a lot of people who think that masks are not good. a voter had asked why he doesn't wear a mask more often himself and why he hasn't imposed a national mask mandate.
schilling: i don't care who you sleep with. i don't care about any of the other things that i have might -- i have a son on the spectrum and he is one of the greatest human beings you're ever going to meet and he formed the lgbtq club in high school.
on the campaign trail, he repeatedly promised he would repeal obamacare and replace it with a plan that would both offer everyone better coverage and cost far less ― an absurd claim on its face. only after he was in office did he acknowledge that the task perhaps wasn't that simple. nobody knew that health care could be so complicated, he said in february 2017.
it's important to note that at this point in 2009, president obama had seven of his nominee's confirmed on day one and five more in the first week. as it stands today, we have two. democrats even held up the confirmation of cia director mike pompeo, needlessly leaving one of our most important national security agencies without its top leader on day one. it's time for senate democrats to stop playing political games with the core functions of government and to allow president trump's unquestionably qualified and talented group of cabinet nominees to get to work on behalf of the american people.
i agree that everybody, once they, in fact — anyway, my time is up. i'm sorry.
while warren was bolstering her state-level ties, she was warring with fellow democrats on capitol hill.
trump's proposal has many in congress wondering if this plan is doable, since many of their constituency could actually end up paying more taxes. however, according to the tax policy center, almost half of the benefits of trump's plan would gravitate to the top 1 percent or those earning more than $700,000 annually. but the bigger question is, given trump's political and possibly legal problems, will such a plan actually occur?

preventing welfare-dependent legal immigrants from permanently resettling in the united states and eventually becoming u.s. citizens would help out the american taxpayer, an expert tells siriusxm's breitbart news daily.
though a super-majority of 60 senators is generally needed to pass major legislation in the senate, the chamber moves routine measures without a formal vote, and a simple majority is enough to advance certain annual budget and tax-related measures via a process known as reconciliation. only matters that are reasonably related to taxing and spending are supposed to make it into such bills. among biden's agenda items, those could arguably include raising some tax rates, lowering the eligibility for medicare and expanding obamacare. reconciliation could also empower democrats --provided they stay completely united -- to enact additional stimulus relief opposed by republicans as well as portions of biden's climate and immigration priorities. the congressional review act also will enable democrats to pass measures canceling regulations issued recently by the trump administration with simple majorities. democrats could also move the president's executive and judicial nominations with only democratic support as a result of rules changes that require a simple majority to cut off debate and obtain a vote on confirmation.
to everybody, actually. and then along comes bloomberg. and there's a guy who really does understand social media, and he has the money to understand social media. and that's really kind of cool. and on an electoral level, he really can go toe-to-toe with trump on that and put his money behind the whole thing to win this thing.

it's very challenging to plan for your future in an environment like this, said beth feldpush, senior vice president of policy and advocacy at america's essential hospitals, a group that represents safety-net hospitals nationally.
on monday, insurance giant aetna inc. said it lost up to $140 million, or a negative margin of 3 percent to 4 percent, on individual coverage last year. it has 1 million members with individual policies, about 75 percent of them on public exchanges. the company said it expects to break even this year, however.
our approach is based on principled realism — not discredited theories that have failed for decades to yield progress. for this reason, my administration recognized the true capital of israel — and proudly opened the american embassy in jerusalem.
gingrich: well, look, i'm not advocating it. i'm pointing out that it is within the constitution and that we should be aware of it. but i think there needs to be a re-evaluation of both sides. he has to understand and his family has to understand that there is a public interest which transcends them. at the same time, we have to understand that this is a new situation we've never seen before. and the rules were written for people who were dramatically less successful, who literally do not work.
the actual history of the va choice program goes like this: congress passed the program under obama as a way of addressing the 2014 scandal in which veterans affairs facilities were found to be obscuring long wait times for medical appointments. the program allowed one-third of veterans to get government-paid health care in private settings.

roberts had left behind a storm in washington over his opinion upholding president barack obama's health-care overhaul -- the affordable care act -- a stunning validation of obama's signature domestic achievement that transformed public perceptions of the chief justice.
blackstone mayor billy coleburn acted as an emcee, reading written questions collected from the crowd. asked do you deny climate change? brat said no, the climate changes all the time. his apparent attempt at levity angered the crowd, prompting some to yell answer the question!
sen. ted cruz (r), texas: well, what she said at this conference is that she did not believe there was any prospect for ukraine to be successful in defending itself against russian aggression. i think that's mistaken. but, at the same time, i think chancellor merkel's position is not surprising, given where president obama's position is.
the answers from hillary clinton and donald trump provided a near-perfect distillation of very different ways they think about the world ― and how, most likely, they would govern as president.
retaining private insurance plans, however, is unlikely to win the plan many fans in the health care industry. it's still a stepping stone to a single payer system, which eliminates consumer choice and does little to address costs, said lauren crawford shaver, executive director of the partnership for america's health care future, a coalition of insurance, pharmaceutical, hospital and doctor groups, which opposes all medicare for all-type plans.
alison kodjak, byline: democrats who supported the affordable care act could use their filibuster power to block trump and congressional republicans from directly repealing the law. but there is a workaround. for bills related to the budget or taxes, the filibuster doesn't apply. and republicans in congress gave it a test drawn earlier this year.
«nadie está destruyendo esto, vamos a seguir adelante», dijo sanders, quejándose de que 29 millones de estadounidenses todavía carecen de atención sanitaria.
the coverage expansions wouldn't last, either. unless congress extended the timeline, the subsidies would return to current levels after two years. by 2023, the uninsured rate would return to current levels, the cbo said.
spicer: i think, the president has been very clearly. he's gonna work with any country that shares our interest in defeating isis. not just on the national security front, but on the economic front. if we can work with someone to create greater market access and spur economic growth and allow u.s. small businesses and companies to...
the republican party's assault on the affordable care act continued monday as the trump administration found yet another way to undermine the law's insurance rules.
perhaps roberts' move was born of a concern for the business of health care. perhaps he had worries about his own legitimacy and legacy, intertwined with concerns about the legitimacy and legacy of the court. perhaps his change of heart really arose from a sudden new understanding of congressional taxing power. however the chief would explain it -- and he has not explained it beyond his written opinion -- the case added a new dimension to a man who insisted that he always decided cases based on the law.
every state is required to provide medicaid coverage to certain groups: poor children and pregnant women, people with disabilities, and poor older people requiring long-term care. but the obamacare expansion provides coverage for many poor parents and childless adults who were less often covered in the program. the health law provides federal funding for states to include all residents who earn below or just above the federal poverty line — the limit is about $16,000 for a single person.

americans who would qualify for the relief package's heftier federal premium subsidies for affordable care act policies would need to wait until the new regulations are programmed into the obamacare exchanges, which might take a few weeks.

in a report this week, becerra's colleagues said he is potentially interested in pursuing policies as hhs secretary that would expand taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits to illegal aliens.
last year, trump triumphantly signed a huge tax cut bill. the gop line when this legislation was going through congress was that it would pay for itself. it did not. it predictably blew a giant hole in the budget and increased the deficit.
a new conservative court could follow the party line when it comes to abortion. on the other hand, they will be aware of the public backlash that would follow. facing a potentially similar backlash in 2012, supreme court chief justice john roberts, who many have said might turn into the new swing justice in kennedy's absence, went against his conservative tendencies when deciding the fate of the affordable care act (obamacare). in arguably the biggest case before the court this decade, roberts chose to uphold it.
montanaro: she's going to have to figure out a political strategy because real change - for example, when president obama was in office, when lbj was in office to enact the great society measures or obamacare - came from having numbers and assembling coalitions. and that's something she's going to have to learn how to do.
sen. mcconnell's plan b to repeal affordable care act fails
sen. john mccain, r-arizona, called it a good proposal overall, but that there's a lot to absorb.
a source close to mccarthy told cnn at the time that the decision to drop out came down to numbers, pure and simple, adding that mccarthy had the votes to win the conference vote, but there just wasn't a path to 218 – the number of votes needed to lock down the speakership on the house floor.
we're nailing down the final details … and then boning up support between now and then as much as possible, heritage action's dan holler told me last week.
so that, for me, was a big win. the idea that this man who — in many ways, joe biden is an avatar of the white moderate who's had a huge journey himself on these issues, who's always wanted to have his heart in the right place. god, he even was a lifeguard in a black pool. it doesn't get any more apt than this. he followed the white moralizing logic into the crime bill of the 1990s. he was opposed to busing for school integration. and yet, then he became barack obama's best friend, and also, i think, did what good politicians do, which is read the moment and recognize that his constant moral compass now demanded something much bolder in terms of confronting the persistence of racial inequality and systemic racism. and yet, because he's still got his finger on the pulse of the scranton white american politics, he needed to call out the scapegoating. he needed to say, hey, i'm nostalgic for that time too, when a white guy could go into a factory and come out with being set for life. but it wasn't the black folks and the immigrants who took that factory job away. and in fact, this divided politics is propping up a party and an economic worldview that is stripping opportunity from your family and your neighborhoods and your communities.
according to the liberal progressive policy institute, sanders' proposals would increase federal spending by a whopping $51.5 trillion over a decade. that's seven to eight times what relative moderates like joe biden and pete buttigieg are pushing. it is also more than 50 times the size of obamacare, which the congressional budget office estimated in 2010 would cost less than $1 trillion over 10 years.
in new york, democratic sen. chuck schumer said he would like to see stimulus money used to wipe out the state's budget deficit and avoid raising taxes on the wealthy, who already pay the highest tax rate in the country, the new york post reported.
john sides: is this decision related to hobby lobby's protection of religious freedom at all?
make america great again, that's what's happening, said trump. we're bringing back our pride, we're bringing back our jobs, we're bringing back our wealth, and for the citizens of this great land we're bringing back our beautiful american dreams.
biden has no idea what he believes in, he just wants to win.
schilling: yes, as a member of the association, so -- and you don't have to be a baseball writer.
they just want to jam this nomination through as fast as they can, harris said. it's called raw power. but president trump and his party are about to learn something. they may think that it is they who have the power in this country, but they don't. the american people are the ones who have the power. you have the power.
if the tone struck you as vaguely familiar, that suggests you've been paying attention. president obama has often promised that he understood people's concerns about a particular issue, only to reveal later it was all about getting his way.
nutter: i love that. great spin. (crosstalk)
a defeat in the house, however, would damage ryan's speakership and undermine his far-reaching conservative agenda, which for political, parliamentary and budget reasons hinges on early repeal of obamacare.
ivanka trump shared this photo of her family at the blair house:
today, a great many people support biden on these grounds and others. trump stands in the way of the nation regaining a sense of flourishing, equity, and social harmony.
i don't want to give you a timeline, baum replied. but i can tell you this. i've studied the issue very closely.
the chairman of the house freedom caucus rep. mark meadows (r.-nc) said ryan does not have the votes to pass ryancare if house republican leadership insists on bringing the bill to the floor thursday. there are not enough votes to pass it tomorrow.
in all, trump has so far proposed minor changes to his plan from the campaign. the tax policy center forecast that 51 percent of the benefits from that plan would eventually accrue to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers.
while many americans like the idea of expanding medicare, their support drops when they hear private insurance would be eliminated, according to polling by the kaiser family foundation. medicare for america would address those concerns, said jen tolbert, the foundation's director of state health reform.

as part of its july decision, the high court returned the vance case and a similar case involving records sought by congress to lower courts. and the court prevented the records from being turned over while the cases proceeded.
trump is part of a lawsuit the supreme court is scheduled to take up in november (after election day, of course) that could eliminate the whole law. this, in fact, is trump's vision for health care reform, not whatever bogus claims he makes to get him out of a political jam he put himself in by joining a legal case originated by a bunch of republican state officeholders.
spicer: no, i think that he's been very clear throughout the campaign that he is committed to making sure that the american people, the american tax payer, see some benefit, and ensure that our interests overseas are not just (inaudible) sending blank checks. that we're doing something that either protects america or is in our economic interest.
trump was the first republican presidential nominee to propose federal child-care benefits, but his plan was criticized because it would disproportionately help wealthy parents. a senior administration official told the washington post tuesday that trump's staff is trying to find a way to address those criticisms. wednesday's document states that child care will be part of trump's plan but offers no further details.

-- 52 is the new 47: labor secretary nominee andrew puzder said in a 2011 speech that the electoral balance in the u.s. was tilted against republicans because a large segment of the population would always vote benefits to themselves. the quote, unearthed by cnn's andrew kaczynski and chris massie: last year, 52% of the people in the country got more from government than they gave to government, puzder said. we do have a segment of the population that's going to continue to vote benefits to themselves. you have to make a decision for yourself which party actually supports that and would therefore want to continue to have those people vote for them by taking from the rich and giving to the poor, as they like to say, which tilts the electoral balance in favor of those who get the benefits. if they are more than 50% of the population, we've got a problem. he continued, in california, i think the last election showed that. i think we have higher than 52% of the people … i think 49% of the people in california don't even pay taxes.
the uncertainty has seeped into the municipal bond market, where nonprofit hospitals access capital. the sector sold 36 percent less debt for new projects so far in 2017, compared to the same period last year, while the rest of the municipal market increased the amount of new money issued by 23 percent, thomson reuters data shows. while municipal analysts say it's too early to draw conclusions, the uncertainty surrounding obamacare is a likely cause for the decline.
kelly: ok. what about another group of people - people who maybe didn't have coverage to begin with before this pandemic? that's a number - that's, like, 27 million people who didn't have insurance.
martin: does that sit well with you, the idea that president trump could pardon a member of his family or his administration if that person was acting in the best interest of his corporation but not the government?
so here's the deal. let's get back up. we're decent. we're brave. we're resilient people. we can believe again. we're better than this moment. we're better than this president. so get up, take back our country. this the united states of america. there's nothing beyond our capacity if we do it together. god bless you all, and may god protect our troops. thank you, thank you, thank you.
they succeeded. the affordable care act, for all of its inadequacies and flaws, helped tens of millions of those americans get care. a big reason republican efforts to repeal the law failed was that it would have rolled back this progress.

for example, walmart recently added purdue global, an all online arm of purdue university that was created when the school acquired kaplan university, a for-profit college, to its list of schools where employees could earn their degrees.
obama, making his own case into what turned out to be a vacuum, said the u.s. economy is the envy of the world and offered democrats the talking points they should be using: there seems to be an alternative reality out there from some of the political folks that america is down in the dumps. it's not. america is pretty darn great right now, and making strides right now.
states have always had some flexibility to request these sorts of waivers, of course. but when the obama administration was in charge, it set clear limits on state action. to get waiver approval, states had to demonstrate that residents wouldn't end up with worse coverage as a result.

but some big national insurers like unitedhealth, humana and now aetna say they are losing too much money on marketplace policies. the reason is that the customers they signed up used more medical services than the insurers had anticipated. on monday, aetna said it would reduce the number of counties where it sells such policies to 242, from 778, citing a $200 million pretax loss on those policies in the second quarter. the company had sold marketplace policies to about 911,000 customers as of april.
[ed. note: if i had my way, dr. miller, conventions would increase rather than decrease in importance. i'd do away with primaries and caucuses and have delegates chosen in conventions on the county, district and state level who would then be free to choose a nominee. but i also recognize that this year of pandemic presents some special challenges. republicans don't need a convention, having opted to rig the process to protect president trump. but democrats aren't yet finished with their work and may need a convention to fill in gaps left by what has become a very uncertain primary process. i can certainly see democrats opting to hold a virtual convention in which the 4,753 delegates would participate remotely. but i'm certainly with you on getting mlb back on its feet. april without the cardinals is going to feel like thanksgiving without the turkey.]

i want to talk about what i'm hearing you say, because i think this is a larger question happening in virginia on super tuesday and part of the reason why we're here, which is that it seems like aside from defeating trump, which is your number one priority, a big priority for you is not having bernie sanders be the nominee. is that fair to say?
spicer: well, i think what we have is a -- is a mandate to make health care more accessible and lower costs. that's what the american people were promised under obamacare.
i think there has been a lot of flexibility in terms of some of my contacts and conservatives in terms of not making it totally offset. and that's a move that we're trying to do to provide real relief and economic growth. when we start to grow the economy at 4, 4.1 percent, it actually not only increases wages, but it puts more money in americans' pockets each and every day.

trump's address was also peppered with lies, misstatements and distortions about both his record and biden's positions, many of which were repeated at other points during the convention. going over every last lie would require a herculean effort, but two of them were critical, and trump is likely to repeat them again and again over the final weeks of the race.

joining melania in the gallery this evening is a very brave 10-year-old girl, grace eline. every birthday since she was 4, grace asked her friends to donate to st. jude children's research hospital. she did not know that one day she might be a patient herself. last year, grace was diagnosed with brain cancer. immediately, she began radiation treatment. at the same time, she rallied her community and raised more than $40,000 for the fight against cancer. when grace completed treatment last fall, her doctors and nurses cheered with tears in their eyes as she hung up a poster that read: last day of chemo. grace — you are an inspiration to us all.
there was no sign on march 30, 2012, that any of the nine would defy the usual ideological and partisan alignment. that political division bothered roberts, but he felt just as strongly about boundaries on the commerce power as the other four in the majority did.
levitt called the regulatory change a major end run around the health law.
as npr's alison kodjak reports, there are several ways to get rid of the rest of the health care law but not without creating major disruptions in the insurance market.
the federal reserve is making a huge error in believing that labor markets are so tight that interest rates must move higher, a leading academic said monday.
spicer: hold on -- because i -- i think it's important. he's gone out there and defied the odds over and over and over again. and he keeps getting told what he can't do by this narrative that's out there. and he exceeds it every single time. and i think there's an overall frustration when you -- when you turn on the television over and over again and get told that there's this narrative that you didn't win. you weren't going to run. you can't pick up this state.
and over and over again, the mlk bust. i think over and over again there's this constant attempt to undermine his credibility and the movement that he represents. and it's frustrating for not just him, but i think so many of us that are trying to work to get this message out. and so i mentioned this to john, part of this is a two- way street. we want to have a healthy dialogue, not just with you but the american people because he's fighting for jobs, he's fighting to make this country safer.

… becerra has repeatedly advocated for undocumented immigrants to have more access to health care and other government benefits, whether through medicaid or obamacare, politico reported.
at times, people of color have tried to argue for greater rights in ways that made that connection between whiteness and real americanness more explicit, even technical. in the first decades of the 20th century, two different supreme court cases, brought just a few years apart by asian-americans — one with roots in india, the other with roots in japan — rested on the plaintiffs' argument that they should be considered caucasoid in accordance with the anthropological understanding at the time, and thus deserving of all the rights and civic protections of americanness enjoyed by white america. (the high court ruled against them both.)
ahip also said a quick resolution is needed to avoid greater harm to the individual and small group markets.
democrats were able to retake the house in large part because they campaigned on health care issues, warning that republicans would try to strip away some of the more popular provisions of the aca, such as protection for pre-existing conditions. around 130 million people in the united states have pre-existing conditions, and without the aca, insurers would no longer be required to cover those conditions.

larry levitt, a senior vice president with the kaiser family foundation:
for millions of people, the affordable care act has meant access to regular medical care for the first time. and for tens of millions more, the aca protects us against being denied insurance because of a pre-existing medical condition or because we reached a lifetime cap.
— republican fears that sen. john mccain's (r-ariz.) battle with cancer could make it harder to keep their senate majority have receded, with a crucial election deadline just days away, our colleagues sean sullivan and michael scherer report. republicans in arizona and washington are increasingly hopeful mccain will be in office through may 30, the unofficial date for averting a special election for his seat this year. the gop, which holds a 51-to-49 senate majority, is defending the arizona seat held by retiring sen. jeff flake (r). another race in the state would give democrats a new opening to win control of the senate.
democrats are also fuming that the confirmation process is happening so close to election day, four years after republicans blocked the confirmation of judge merrick garland to the supreme court because it was an election year. democrats are expected to question barrett about her judicial record, but they also may use their time to excoriate their republican colleagues for choosing to hold the hearings now.
3. an assault on climate science:
according to teresa cavendish, the director of tucson migrant shelter casa alitas, dhs has continued to release an average of 20 people a day in tucson alone. the families still being released are mexican asylum seekers, outside the hemisphere, families with children under one year of age, pregnant women six months or more, and significant illnesses or injuries, she said.
his willingness to embrace mr. trump may be enough to save manchin, who is facing republican state attorney general patrick morrisey in the general election. recent polling has shown manchin to be several points ahead of morrisey. however, if republicans - with the help of trump - are successfully able to portray manchin as just another democrat, that lead could narrow very quickly.
to put an extra head spin on the whole incident, trump's department of justice argued before the supreme court in june to shut down the aca with its guaranteed coverage for preexisting conditions. it even specifically singled out coverage for preexisting conditions as something that's got to go.
williams added, but he's with the president on a number of issues — if he had been in the senate, he would have voted to repeal obamacare, supported the tax cuts.
we shouldn't have the warfighters have their arms tied behind their back as president obama wanted to do, but they had a chance to show support and it wasn't popular at the time, bush said.
this is pretty terrible, jodi ray, who is the project director for florida covering kids and families, told huffpost. we will be put in the awful position of pitting populations that need assistance against each other, in order to prioritize how we can use the resources.
just days ago, the press and the pundits had declared this candidacy dead. now, thanks to all of you, the heart of the democratic party, we just won and we've won big because of you.
the news capped a week of chaotic activity at both ends of pennsylvania avenue, as trump, ryan and their lieutenants tried desperately to round up votes for the measure they introduced less than three weeks ago ― which they were attempting to move through the legislative process at breakneck speed.
this is credibility, karl replied. the white house said nearly 4,000 terrorists come into our country. that's not true.
asked what they would like to see the house majority that swept into power in the 2018 midterms do, most democrats picked bolstering obamacare over passing medicare-for-all.
thomas edison showed an automatic telegraph and an electric pen.
sanders: hold it, john. stop it. you're not going to kill yourself. all right. stop it...
then the second thing is obamacare insurance exchanges. losing job-based coverage is a qualifying event, so you can shop for a plan there. the third option is medicaid, so the rules about who qualifies varies from state to state, but it's based on monthly income. you have to make less than $1,400 a month for yourself or $3,000 a month for a family of four in most states to qualify.
with this model in place, minorities don't really have any rights. if the majority thinks people should live or work in a certain way, everyone is required to obey, even if it violates their deeply held beliefs. for example, in a socialist country, vegetarians would be required to be part owners in a slaughterhouse.
the democrats on these committees hate president trump more than they love our country and are abusing their powerful positions in congress to try and damage the president's 2020 re-election chances.
i wanted to be a tv writer when i was growing up, because i wanted to be the black norman lear. i felt that television had this amazing power to tell americans who other americans were, and therefore cohere a national story of our relative goodness or merit. and so norman lear — i mean, he did sanford and son, he did good times, the jeffersons, all in the family, maude — all of these real, working, middle-class, totemic reflections of who we were and who we were becoming that really grappled with the issues of the day. i don't know. i don't that we've done much better than that in terms of tv shows that people are actually really watching.
those aren't necessarily the only members of congress who believe in job guarantees, but they do happen to all be oft-mentioned as 2020 democratic presidential hopefuls.
to launch our national rebuilding, i will be asking the congress to approve legislation that produces a $1 trillion investment in the infrastructure of the united states — financed through both public and private capital — creating millions of new jobs.
a source close to scalise pointed to those public comments, suggesting that ryan's wednesday decision was something people were still digesting before making any new moves.

another obamacare challenge:supreme court appears unlikely to topple affordable care act
i'm just trying to fight to keep the funding increasing every year, portman said. i got some pushback from some of my colleagues on the republican side of the issue, saying, 'where's the money coming from?' i said, 'this is a crisis. this is a national emergency.' 
the mandate is meant to encourage healthy people to buy insurance. it makes it possible for insurers to sell to anybody, regardless of pre-existing conditions, and not worry that people will wait until getting sick to enroll. the mandate also makes sure that people without coverage assume some financial responsibility for the charity care they would receive if they needed it.
the next major priority for me, and for all of us, should be to lower the cost of healthcare and prescription drugs — and to protect patients with pre-existing conditions.

most democrats identify as liberals for first time, underscoring leftward tilt of party
when hillary did bother to go out and earn votes, it generally would be before small, hand-picked crowds where she would rant about how indecent trump is. to this day i cannot tell you what she was running on or what her vision for the country was. she felt we had to vote for her because trump was such a terrible person.
more than half of people who purchase insurance in the health exchanges get the additional help, which reduces out-of-pocket health spending on deductibles and coinsurance. while that help for consumers is required under the law, the funding was not specifically included. (tax credits for people with incomes up to four times the poverty level to help defray the cost of premiums are a separate program and were permanently funded in the aca.)
remember, whenever you get money from the government - whether it's a student loan or a tax refund or whatever - you're legally promising you're telling the truth when you sign that form.
these numbers have fed the perception that trump is a sui generis type of political figure ― one whose avid base will stick by him regardless of foible or misstep. it's a perception that trump himself has pushed, famously declaring that he could stand in the middle of fifth avenue and shoot somebody and not lose any votes.
the estimated 40 million-plus unpaid family caregivers would also get a financial boost. among the ideas biden backs is an annual tax credit of up to $5,000 for informal caregivers to reimburse expenses. unpaid family caregivers would also be able to accrue social security benefits for the time they spend caregiving. and they'd be allowed to make catch-up contributions to retirement accounts, even if they're not earning an income.
how dare you. you are the absolute worst kind of hypocrite. https://t.co/inyqp63gfr — moby xⓥx (@thelittleidiot) august 26, 2018
the u.s. supreme court is expected to rule in the middle of this year on whether the affordable care act is constitutional.
the legislation, however, isn't as generous as the medicare for all proposals, which essentially provides all care at no cost. enrollees would have to pay up to 9.7% of their monthly income as premiums, though the poor would pay nothing and subsidies would be available for the middle class. there would also be deductibles and co-pays, with an annual limit of $3,500, or $5,000 for families.
mccain and trump were no fans of each other stemming from the early days of the 2016 presidential elections, trading barbs and insults.
trump's choice for health secretary repeatedly refused during his own testy confirmation hearing to promise that no americans will be worse off under trump's executive order to ease provisions of the affordable care act. democrats targeted most of their questioning on the direction that tom price, if confirmed, would try to take the health-care system. price demurred repeatedly. for instance, he sidestepped a series of questions about the effects of the sweeping order trump issued just hours after his swearing-in that directed agencies to lift or soften federal rules implementing aspects of the aca. price declined to commit that no one would be harmed, that no one would lose insurance coverage or that the regulations would be rewritten only after a plan exists to replace the 2010 health-care law. (read the full write-up by amy goldstein and juliet eilperin.)
6. democrats will recognize unions with majority sign-up—via so-called 'card check' processes. the card check violates the right to a secret ballot, and allows organizers to intimidate workers into voting to certify unions. the idea is so radical that even george mcgovern, the left-wing democratic presidential nominee in 1972 who lost to president richard nixon in a landslide, came out against it the last time democrats tried to mandate it, in 2009.
also today, the president signed (ph) designations for acting heads of executive departments and agencies to maintain continuity in those critical positions.
can i deduct medical expenses when i file taxes?
if someone with an individual insurance policy got sick, the insurer could scour the person's application looking for errors. even minor mistakes could cause the company to revoke the policy, a practice called rescission. under the aca, rescissions are allowed only if there's fraud or a material misrepresentation of facts.
though this new legislation would benefit those they represent, democrats are digging in their heels in the name of partisanship and preserving obama's failed legacy.
schilling: that's half the challenge. we ask questions we already know the answers to. we are talking about -- we know for a fact the president didn't collude in any fashion with russia, but hillary clinton gave somebody -- that is tied to a russian, you know, companies access the 20% of our uranium?

lower fuel costs also led to a 3% decline in the price of airfare.

— meanwhile, northam faces calls for his resignation over a racist photo in his 1984 medical school yearbook. the tip to the reporter who exposed the photo on northam's yearbook page appears to have come from a medical school classmate or classmates of the governor's who were concerned following the abortion controversy in the state last week, our post colleague paul farhi reports.
10. reneging on promises of transparency
today, federalism, the bargain that made the united states possible, is threatening to tear it apart. donald trump is president despite losing the popular vote and remains in office because of the unequivocal support of a group of senators representing a minority of the federation's population. the same senate majority denied the last president a supreme court pick, ensuring a lasting conservative lock on the highest court in a country where conservatives are not a majority. demographic trends will make this counter-majoritarian balance of power worse with each passing year, creating a crisis of democratic legitimacy in a country that once saw itself as the world's model democracy.
mcconnell has declined to publicly respond directly to the president, instead telling reporters that he isn't a fan of the daily tweets.
health-care officials and drug treatment experts in clark county say they are starting to see drug treatment money from washington, but more is needed. ending the aca or cutting medicaid, they said, would be disastrous.
shortfalls in anticipated levels of federal funding contributed, too. at the end of 2014, for example, insurers got blindsided when money they had counted on to offset losses was cut sharply from the obamacare's risk corridor program. that program transfers funds from participating insurers with high profits to those with high losses. the move disproportionately hurt small insurers, according to the nonpartisan commonwealth fund.

dr. ezekiel emanuel, an architect of obamacare and special adviser to the director-general of the world health organization, told msnbc's the last word that the united states cannot return to normal until a chinese coronavirus vaccine is available, which he speculated could take between 12-18 months.
this is really a defeat of paul ryan, sen. rand paul, r-ky., said, predicting the bill would go down. he's going to have to give conservatives a seat at the table.
trump celebrated independence day by visiting a golf course, a trump course, of course, for his 35th time since inauguration day, after saying as a candidate that he would not be playing golf because he would be working all the time.
in socialism, individual rights are mere illusions. even free-speech rights are limited if they are deemed harmful to the rest of society – which means these rights don't really exist at all. this is why human rights abuses are so common in countries that try to enact socialism.

9:14 p.m. et clinton responded and said with prior gop presidential nominees, she has disagreed with them on policies, but she said, i have never questioned their fitness to serve. donald trump is different.
it's a door that's so closed to so many people that i think they have to be looking at alternate pathways, fall said. as employers are willing to pick up the tab, that's certainly going to draw more higher education players into the market.
but make no mistake about it. part one of pelosi's plan has been a success because everyone is talking about her claim to not want to impeach the president.
these alternatives could mean moving cases to the term starting in october of this year or even resolving cases without oral arguments and just based on written briefs submitted to the court. there is no constitutional mandate that the supreme court hold in-person arguments on cases it decides.
the expectation among many democratic aides and members is that the $15 minimum wage, which is currently the biggest obstacle to getting the bill across the finish line, won't be allowed under the guardrails of reconciliation, a budget process that requires each provision to adhere to a strict set of rules but that could ultimately allow democrats to pass the legislation on a party-line vote.
domenico montanaro, byline: hey there, steve.
clinton said trump needs to give mr. obama an apology as well as the rest of the country.
jane schacter: twenty-one states currently have their own version of rfra, and more continue to be introduced. the most expansive of these laws will surely face constitutional challenges. mississippi's law is probably the most extreme in permitting, among other things, businesses to deny service to lgbt customers and has been challenged as violating lgbt individuals' constitutional rights. the supreme court recently decided not to hear a challenge to that law, but it was a procedural question only. expect further litigation.
there are thousands of people who would like to receive care in their homes, who are covered by medicaid, explains murthy, but are on a waiting list that is as long as five years. vice president biden would work with states to close that gap and make sure that we have medicaid-funded, home-based care providers to care for our older loved ones, murthy says.

blitzer: what else are they trying to do, jeff, to get people mobilized and get out there and caucus?
and so, you know, if he goes ahead and does it, i mean, obviously the next president could undo it. that might cause all sorts of logistical problems. but, what, i mean, right now senator jeff sessions, who is going to take over as the budget committee chief, says, i'm going to try to deny the funding. i'm going to try to sort of take away his ability to issue temporary worker cards to anybody. but there's been some questions about whether that could work. there's a lawsuit already pending against him. there's a question whether that is feckless. some people have talked about impeaching the president. the republicans seem to feel that's too politically dangerous. so as a practical matter, is he just probably going to get away with it?
this is where to the degree labor union fight will play out here in polk county. barack obama won it big eight years ago, hillary clinton was actually third, just behind john edwards. hillary clinton needs to turn the des moines area, the dark blue, and she needs to compete with bernie sanders out here in the east.
2. how many americans are covered because of obamacare?
executive amnesty is wrong, it's illegal and it's unconstitutional. and you say it would necessarily get support in the senate. well, you know, it's interesting. we don't know that seven democrats had publicly criticized it on the campaign trail. they told their constituents they didn't support the president ignoring federal law, ignoring the constitution and unilaterally and illegally granting amnesty to four to 5 million people here illegally.

a recent breitbart news report also revealed that more than half of the foreign refugee households resettled permanently in the u.s. between 2011 and 2015 were on food stamps. the trump administration has sought to reduce the burden of mass immigration to benefit the wages and quality of life of america's working and middle class.
georges benjamin: when you're talking about health care, we have this amazing kind of schizophrenia about our system. you know, we deliver the best medicine and nursing on the planet. no question about that. but it requires a lot of things.
trump effectively blocked clinics from receiving federal family planning grants through title x if they offered abortion services with other funds. trump changed the rules on counseling, including barring referrals for abortion services. since those changes, about one-quarter of clinics and other providers that had received federal grants to help the uninsured or low-income patients no longer participate, according to the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation.
as house democrats prepare to push through the legislation next week, with senate democrats set to follow suit in short order, it's a moment that underscores a confluence of factors on politics, policy and quiet, but wide-ranging, behind-the-scenes work that has nearly all gone biden's way.
[we] remain hopeful that we can work with policymakers from both parties on a sustainable public exchange model that meets the needs of the uninsured, he said. the company may expand our footprint in the future should there be meaningful exchange-related policy improvements.
1. high-stakes maneuvering on health care:
during the pandemic, biden says many families are struggling to find affordable care for their children, aging relatives or loved ones with disabilities. at the same time, professional caregivers have either lost their jobs or continue to work while putting their lives at risk without sufficient pay, his campaign plan notes.
he's thrown the rulebook out the window, and that could be a very good thing, hagin said. he certainly understands how to communicate with a certain segment of the population, and the question is, can he expand that to a majority of the population?
spicer: we pulled out of tpp.
he's talking about government spending as a share of gdp (gross domestic product) rising dramatically to the levels they are in france, sweden, denmark, the big social democracies in europe, which we've never had, said goolsbee.
no one has benefitted more from our thriving economy than women, who have filled 58 percent of the new jobs created in the last year. all americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before — and exactly one century after the congress passed the constitutional amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in the congress than ever before.
this year, america will recognize two important anniversaries that show us the majesty of america's mission, and the power of american pride.
but with the trump administration now pledging to take on the high cost of prescription medicines...grogan, as omb's associate director of health programs, will be in a pivotal position shaping drug policy — including aspects of medicare and medicaid...some critics see a conflict, david writes. grogan is hardly the only former lobbyist or industry official in the top ranks of the administration, but he is an exception among senior federal health policymakers for not completing federal ethics forms that laid out potential conflicts with his past work and what, if any, activities he would recuse himself from. hhs secretary alex azar and centers for medicare & medicaid services administrator seema verma completed such forms.
companies are starting to have a better understanding of this trend and the skills required from their workers to meet their business needs — and they're willing to pay for workers to meet those needs, said jaime fall, the director of upskill america at the aspen institute, an employer initiative promoting training and advancement opportunities for workers.
kelly: right. this isn't about how you feel about what should be done about the 11 million illegal immigrants living in this country. you can very much want a path to legalization for them. you could be behind the president's, you know, original plan submitted to congress that was passed by the senate. what this is about is what a president gets to do when an elected branch says, no to his agenda. and the framers decided that a long time ago.
but while kettl's solutions may not be convincing, his diagnosis of some of the pathologies undermining the republic is, and the historical background he provides on the evolution of madison's nation-founding invention will be useful to anyone seeking to flesh out additional remedies.

gop sens. susan collins and mitt romney lead a group of 10 fellow republican senators out of the west wing after meeting with president joe biden and vice president kamala harris at the white house earlier this month.
biden pushed back, though, and stressed he split from the democratic presidential candidates who supported medicare for all, including his running mate senator kamala harris, who was his rival in the democratic primaries.
rubio then reiterated the accusation at a cnn moderated town hall last week. i said he's been lying because if you say something that isn't true and you say it over and over again and you know that it's not true, there's no other word for it.
gary cantrell, a deputy inspector general at the department of health and human services, told the panel about a half-million medicare part d recipients received high amounts of opioids in 2016. almost 20 percent of that group are at serious risk of opioid misuse or overdose, he warned, placing the high risk in two categories — those receiving extreme amounts of opioids and some who appeared to be 'doctor shopping.'
by the end of trump's presidency, the uninsured rate probably rose close to 10 percent, from 8.6 percent in the obama administration's final year. through executive action, biden may be able to reduce it to about 8 percent over the next four years, according to my reporting.
that means judges who opt into the system pay premiums, just like the rest of us. they may even pay a bit more than the average private-sector employee. in addition, depending on what type of plan judges pick, like private-sector employees they may have high deductibles or high co-insurance for certain services. as in the marketplaces, it's all about what plan they choose.
she added, four-hundred pieces of legislation have my name on it.
to be a good judge and a good umpire, he said, it's important to have the proper demeanor, really important, i think, to walk in the other's shoes, whether it be the other litigants, the litigants in the case, the other judges, to understand them, to keep our emotions in check, to be calm amidst the storm.
we have seen this strategy prove successful not just for ocasio-cortez, but also for ben jealous, who won a competitive primary for maryland governor, and candidates like kara eastman, who won her primary against a former congressman in nebraska.

at 3:30 p.m. on friday, mr. ryan called republicans into a closed-door meeting to deliver the news that the bill would be withdrawn, with no plans to try again. the meeting lasted five minutes. one of the architects of the house bill, representative greg walden, republican of oregon and the chairman of the energy and commerce committee, put it bluntly: this bill's done.
a public option would mean a government run health insurance plan.
trump apuntó contra las tácticas de campaña del senador cruz, entre ellas los anuncios que cruz y sus aliados han levantado contra trump.
trump decried obamacare as a disaster, giving a hyperbolic account of its flaws with zero acknowledgement of its virtues. then the republican nominee promised he'd give americans the finest health care plan there is, even though he's never sketched out a detailed alternative.

his letter comes as polls show the legislation is extremely popular. a morning consult/politico poll found 69% of u.s. voters said the package is the right amount or doesn't go far enough, including 54% of republicans.
congress suspended the tax for 2016 and 2o17, although the tax's repeal was not included in the republican tax cuts and jobs act, and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky) failed to pass an obamacare repeal bill through congress' upper chamber on multiple occasions. most obamacare bills, including the better care reconciliation act, sen. rand paul's (r-ky) clean obamacare repeal bill, and the graham-cassidy obamacare repeal bill would have repealed obamacare's medical device tax.
what's not clear is whether the steady-as-she-goes approach will make conservatives restless for the kind of sweeping change they have sought on abortion and other issues for years. carrie severino, president of the conservative judicial crisis network and a former clerk to justice clarence thomas, said she hoped the court isn't sidestepping.
meanwhile, the affordable care act is actually functioning without a mandate penalty. that's one more reason to preserve the law, as a separate friend-of-the-court brief from several dozen policy experts argues.

meanwhile, the new class of freshman democratic lawmakers includes many offering their own liberal proposals.
washington — president obama vetoed legislation friday that would have repealed the affordable care act and stripped all federal funds from planned parenthood, writing in his veto message that the measure would reverse the significant progress we have made in improving health care in america.
many countries are calling, saying 'let's negotiate', said trump. they weren't doing that before.
and, again, it's going to come down to turnout. i think that rallied ted cruz voters to go out and grab a friend and bring them to the poll. i'm not sure that was helpful in that round of attacks. but beyond that, donald trump did something pretty interesting. about a few weeks ago, started having smaller group meetings where he was walking people through exactly, his campaign team, taking those new voters and walking them through exactly what to expect, how you go into a caucus, how you vote and how it works, because that can be very intimidating if you have never participated in politics to any degree.
workers tend to stick around when their company pays for their education
and yet, medicare-for-all remains popular with voters. exit polls from super tuesday found that half of all voters supported replacing private health insurance with a government-run system. around 70 percent of voters in maine and vermont supported this plan.
kodjak: coger's a carpenter by trade, but now he's on disability and medicaid. our new poll shows that lower-income people like coger are more likely to be dissatisfied with their health care. he sees doctors at a local clinic but says they don't take his back trouble seriously. they recommend exercise and offer ibuprofen but refuse to offer an mri. he thinks surgery could help him. but they won't talk about it.
on the other side of the capitol, eight house republicans broke ranks and voted with every democrat to advance a bill that would reopen the treasury department and ensure that the internal revenue service remains funded through tax season.
it is the positions that she has taken over the years, from the anti-abortion, anti-gay-marriage letter from catholic women that she signed in 2015, to her judicial decisions since then.
welcome to the 2020 democratic presidential primary. in a warm-up for an anticipated second run by sanders, he's been promoting the party's prospects in the nov. 6 elections during a nine-state campaign swing that began in bloomington, indiana, on oct. 19 and wraps up in oakland, california, this saturday. he'll be joined on that last stop by rep. barbara lee of california, a fellow progressive stalwart running for chair of the house democratic caucus.
joe biden has tried and failed to run for president twice before — once in '88, when he was forced to quit in disgrace over his serial plagiarism, and once in 2008, where his candidacy went nowhere.
the reason? congressional offices pay a lot of attention to what big business groups are saying — especially when those groups give them money.
the administration's last-minute filing, which was due on thursday for a case to be argued next fall, came the same day the government reported that close to half a million people who lost their health insurance amid the economic shutdown to slow the spread of covid-19 have gotten coverage through healthcare.gov.
as trump was calling for the death penalty, one of the cities that had a high fentanyl overdose death rate was running out of money to purchase naloxone, an overdose reversal drug. in baltimore, fentanyl deaths had risen by nearly 5,000 percent between 2013 and 2017, and the death toll was continuing to climb.
and this is what they say, wolf. they say, we thought things were good going into that night too. and then, of course, she was given a stinging third-place defeat. so there is really, i think, this sense for them of anxiety a little bit, that even though they're feeling good, they don't quite trust it. they want to see what the results are before they're really going to feel confident. blitzer: yes, barack obama came in first. senator, former senator
i just also want to point out that, in your own contingency plan in 2013 if there were a shutdown then, nearly 90 percent of border patrol agents would still have to work, 85 percent of ice agents, and 93 percent of tsa officials. they would have to come to work without pay, but they would have to come to work.
left unsaid by johnson, of course, is that states as diverse as texas and massachusetts share that authority, not always happily. and the u.s. has ceded authority to international institutions, notably the world trade organization, on key economic issues.
early voting in arizona's primary started aug. 1 and the az fact check team is looking back at five times politicians have stretched the truth in an attempt to take down their primary opponent or to set themselves up for the upcoming general election.
how do you stop the descending spiral? says wisconsin democratic strategist joe zepecki. every two years this just gets worse and worse...what you're seeing is more behavior in state legislatures and at the state level that is similar to what we're seeing in congress.
that's led some political pundits to surmise that bloomberg would be better off if he failed to qualify for wednesday's debate – thus avoiding direct contact with his rivals.
he overdosed four times but kept using.
but in a world where you have to sell that beyond the democratic party, is that a bad strategy?
that promise would be difficult, if not impossible, to keep if the trump administration weakens or eliminates the mandate on its own, before a new health care system is in place.
a cost estimate of the bill from the nonpartisan congressional budget office (cbo) is expected to be released by early next week. white house staff met with senate republican staffers wednesday night on capitol hill to review the bill.
i think the market will stabilize, and perhaps aetna and united will come back, said jost. but the market really needs support for another few years until it does, and since the majority in congress is rooting for [the affordable care act] to fail, it seems unlikely that the support will be forthcoming.
a little backstory: more than a decade ago, i came to faith while attending an evangelical church in new york city with my then-boyfriend. after this, i followed a winding path of spiritual searching during which time i steeped myself in evangelical theology. in the end, i returned to the catholic church, the faith of my beloved grandparents. throughout this period, i was surrounded by people who believe that one could not be a real christian if they weren't pro-life.
cruz said, you would carpet bomb where isis is, not a city, but the location of the troops. you use air power directed and you have embedded special forces to direct the air power. but the object isn't to level a city. the object is to kill the isis terrorists.
biden also favors bipartisan legislation offering greater protections for older workers against being workforce discrimination due to their age.
in most cases, hhs wants applicants to prove their citizenship, employer and income. those who are found ineligible could end up paying for their premiums without subsidy support, and those who already benefited from subsidies may be forced to repay some or all of the money.
compared with what sanders wants, those were very modest tweaks to social spending. and even they proved to be very difficult sledding.
the platform's focus and what's missing
he shared the statement via a facebook live feed.
trump's new national security adviser, john bolton, has been best known in recent years for broadcasting his pro-interventionist views on iran and other countries in his fox news appearances. and newly confirmed secretary of state mike pompeo, as a kansas congressman in december 2015, told a westminster institute audience that the only real solution in iran was the abolition of the current regime.
spicer: well i think the president, it's no secret, has made himself-made it very clear that he's a pro-life president. he wants to stand up for all americans including the unborn and i think the reinstatement of this policy is not just something that echoes that value but respects tax payer funding as well. and ensure that we're standing up, not just for life, for life of the unborn but also for tax payer funds that are being spent overseas to perform an action that is contrary to the values of this president . and i think continue to further illustrate, not just to the folks here in this country, but around the world what a value we place on life. jennifer rodriguez (ph).

i was never really a repeal-and-replace guy. i wanted to fix things, sen. david perdue (r-ga.), who voted to repeal obamacare in 2017, told huffpost. like other republicans, perdue views obamacare as fundamentally broken, calling it a disaster. but he, too, talked up the need to maintain some of its core elements.
—funding community health centers for two years (we have written extensively on this issue, most recently here.)
bash: i want to turn to 2016 politics before we go.
what i do know for sure is that i care about all lives, and that includes the lives of women contemplating abortion. the anti-abortion movement pays lip service to caring for women, but what the recent spate of laws shows us is that in the end there is only one thing they care about: the embryo or fetus. the lives of young rape or incest victims are accepted as collateral damage, and women who want to protect their health are as cast sinister actors incapable of searching their own consciences for a way forward when a wanted pregnancy goes awry.
democrats were unceasingly critical of the president — and so, on the whole, was coverage from mainstream media outlets, which covered his near-daily controversies and how he smashed through democratic norms.
mcghee: ...and talk to them enough at home. it was a terrible moment for him.
biden's health care plan centers around reinforcing and expanding the affordable care act — obamacare — via a public option while also improving access to care.
back then, many people who had health issues — or whose family members did — avoided changing jobs, starting businesses or retiring early because of the risk they couldn't find affordable health insurance.
the remaining vote was split between candidates in the back of the pack.
in an article published monday in the journal of the american medical association, the president called for congress to revisit the public option for obamacare in areas where few insurers offer coverage.
i mean, what we're seeing is, when america doesn't lead, europe can't be expected to step into the breach. what is missing from this is the president of the united states. and i have got to tell you, dana, i'm part of a large bipartisan congressional delegation here. and it is striking that, across bipartisan lines, the delegation is united on the need for us to get serious and provide defensive arms to ukraine.
election day is 40 days away, and trump knows he's on the wrong side of public opinion on health care. he's going to keep repeating falsehoods and misrepresentations about his health care record and agenda. but the totality of his actions as president makes very clear that his promises of better, cheaper health care are extremely hard to believe.
but there is no way to be sure, especially because her answer left some observers thinking she might agree with the plaintiffs on the rest of the argument.
they probably would have looked at it and thought: what's best for the country? he said. i don't know anybody who would have ripped up the deal.
and last year, the justices turned aside a series of gun rights cases that groups such as the national rifle association hoped would test state and local firearms laws – leaving this year's docket free from any second amendment debate.
rep. paul gosar (r-az) says the republican leadership in congress should be prioritizing american citizens by supporting his legislation to clarify that criminal foreigners are eligible for deportation out of the united states.

president donald trump's relationship with russian president vladimir putin is remarkable on a number of levels but none more so than this one: for a man who is ready, willing and able to attack anyone, trump never has a bad word to say about putin. and for a man who appears to have the attention span and message discipline of a toddler, trump is somehow able to stick to his say-nothing-bad-about-putin strategy.
so from my view here, the aca was a good thing to get people with pre-existing conditions health insurance, he said.
at supreme court, solicitor general donald verrilli won big and lost big
bash: and what is the administration saying to you, a fellow democrat who's been very outspoken about why they dragged their feet so long?
the attack by trump is not entirely without precedent, though. in one instance his predecessor, barack obama, called out a company that earned his displeasure.
some details of the proposal are still being hashed out. but those involved say the plan will probably be released mid-june, and white house staffers have been briefed on it.
his appeal has yet to be tested in a field with several strong candidates ― a field that may well include harris along with sens. cory booker (n.j.), elizabeth warren (mass.), kirsten gillibrand (n.y.) and former vice president joe biden.

kethledge , 50, is less well-known, but said to have support among senators. he is a university of michigan graduate who went on to clerk for justice anthony kennedy.
other measures in the package, however, are new or involve larger changes to existing programs — including temporary enhancements to the child tax credit and federal premium subsidies for affordable care act plans, as well as for cobra policies for laid-off workers who want to keep their employer health insurance coverage.
obama defended the law, and its implementation, during a press conference last friday. he blasted republicans for their sustained campaign against the law, saying there's not even a pretense now that they're going to replace it with something better.
new hampshire used paper ballots. the primary went off without a hitch and results came in early – quite a contrast to the failure of new technology used to tabulate votes in the iowa caucuses.
undocumented young adults should not have to worry about losing their health coverage when they turn 19, the governor's office added, saying that the budget proposals, to be presented later this week, would defend obamacare from recent federal attacks and bring the state closer toward the goal of health care for all.
spicer: (inaudible) i know it's still developing and i would refer you back to the department of defense. i know that they're -- they're currently monitoring this and i would refer you back to them on that. and i think...

an associated press analysis finds that 58.5 percent of the job gains from may of 2017 until this may were in counties that backed 2016 popular vote-winner hillary clinton. these are mostly the areas of the country that were doing pretty well under president barack obama.
he says americans can maintain private insurance, but a public option will also be available, particularly benefiting americans who couldn't access medicaid because they live in the dozen states that didn't allow them to do so under the aca.
they did not know if they would survive the hour. they did not know if they would grow old. but they knew that america had to prevail. their cause was this nation, and generations yet unborn.
the trump administration already redirected nearly $6 billion in funds from the defense department to cbp to build approximately 300 miles of new border barriers. it has also signaled intentions to divert $3.8 billion from the pentagon. this week, dhs issued waivers to expedite construction along 177 miles along the entire southwest u.s. border.
then again, increased medicare spending and reduced revenues will deplete the system's trust fund faster. the current insolvency date, with aca in place, is 2028; after that point, medicare's revenues won't be enough to cover all of its promised benefits.
levin: but you're not a republican because of that.
the draft order does not direct any immediate reopening of c.i.a. prisons or revival of torture tactics, which are now barred by statute, charlie notes. but it sets up high-level policy reviews to make further recommendations in both areas to mr. trump, who vowed during the campaign to bring back waterboarding and a 'hell of a lot worse' — not only because 'torture works,' but because even 'if it doesn't work, they deserve it anyway.'
did he pass the affordable care act?
eisbrenner: you know, the investigation really starts out with flynn because he could have been compromised as national security adviser, yes. look - they've got to definitely look into that. now, feel free to look into the collusion part, too, but i doubt very much they're going to find anything that affected the election. so - but, hey, if they want to - if the fbi wants to investigate it, go right ahead, you know. i have no problem with that.
believes presidents should be protected from lawsuits and criminal investigations: the starr report to congress outlined information that potentially constituted grounds for the impeachment of president clinton, as the almanac of the federal judiciary notes. and yet, kavanaugh wrote this in 2009 in the minnesota law review about presidential investigations, which is sure to please president trump:
at the time trump spoke, march apprehensions of immigrants illegally attempting to cross the u.s.-mexico border were surging to 92,840, more than triple the level of march 2015, prior to the aid program to which biden referred. far from being abated, the crisis of which biden spoke had come back with a vengeance.
health care is a right, not a privilege — and i will do everything in my power to ensure that all americans have access to the quality, affordable health care they deserve, mr. biden said in a statement. that is especially critical in the midst of a deadly pandemic that has already taken the lives of more than 470,000 of our fellow americans and infected more than one out of every 12 additional americans, often with devastating consequences to their health.

in september, a man in carson city, nev., told sanders he was considering suicide because of six-figure medical debt. campaign staffers credited these intense moments — always livestreamed and repackaged on social media by the campaign — as validating and amplifying sanders' push to overhaul the american health care system.

wolf-sized otters prowled prehistoric china. the new species was described for the first time this week in the journal of systematic paleontology, based on remains uncovered at a fossil-rich mine in northern china. the cleveland museum of natural history produced a video on the find:

courielche noted, one analysis showed that it drove not only conservative media in 2016, but also the broader mainstream news coverage, and another recent study revealed that breitbart news is crushing the mainstream media on facebook, racking up more interactions than the new york times, the washington post, the wall street journal, and usa today combined, and is even outpacing both cable news networks msnbc and cnn on mark zuckerberg's social media platform.
while he faces an uphill fundraising battle with his delayed entry into the already jam-packed field, bennet is optimistic about his political future.
insurers, including aetna, have been pressuring the federal government to make changes to the risk programs meant to help insurers that cover high-cost patients. the program requires insurers with healthier-than-average customers to fund payments to peers with sicker-than-average enrollees. aetna had to pay into the risk adjustment program in 2014 and 2015.
the fact checker awarded trump one pinocchio for his claim that good jobs numbers were fueled by factories returning to the united states from overseas:
as he ticked off the names of the counties he has visited in the district, a few in the crowd yelled arizona, a jab at his plans to attend a town hall meeting with rep. paul a. gosar (r-ariz.) in gold canyon, ariz., on thursday. brat had accepted that invitation before agreeing to hold a town hall in virginia, a move that enraged some of his critics.
at the moment, a federal judge in texas is considering a lawsuit against the affordable care act that gop officials in 20 states launched. the trump administration, rather than defending the federal law as administrations normally do in such circumstances, filed a brief in support of the plaintiff's claim about the law's constitutionality.

the white house office charged with leading our nation's efforts to combat the drug crisis has been missing in action as deaths continue to mount, cummings said. the white house had no national drug control strategy. none. none. all while tens of thousands of people were dying and the crisis was escalating every day.
cuando los dos hombres se encontraron en noviembre de 2016 para una forzada reunión posterior a la elección, el presidente electo fue cortés, por lo que obama aprovechó la oportunidad para aconsejarle no desmantelar obamacare. mira, puedes quitarle mi nombre; no me importa, le dijo, según los asesores.

detrow: lately, sanders has been turning rallies into town halls where, instead of asking him questions, people vent about their health insurance problems. in carson city, a man named john weigel told sanders how his bills keep piling up to over $100,000. and this exchange may be disturbing for some listeners.
-- state election officials released a statement tuesday saying they do not know of any evidence backing up trump's voter fraud claims, but said they were willing to hear from the new administration if they had any concerns. (mark berman)
and i think what he is trying to do is that he is taking a new approach to what is usually a traditional process, which is trying to build up a whole lot of buzz, trying to get a whole lot of free media, and then build a new coalition, some evangelicals, some independent voters, new voters that he expects to come and support him, because he is a very untraditional candidate, someone who can challenge the status quo.
rocca: probably to hold your cell phone.
the iowa caucuses and the new hampshire primary are important because they are the first two nominating contests. but the two states have small populations with few african-american and hispanic voters. the next two nominating contests – in nevada feb. 22 and south carolina feb. 29 – are in states with much more diverse populations, where biden, in particular, has enjoyed strong support.
there are tremendous threats to our country, he said during a joint press conference with japanese prime minister shinzo abe, eschewing specifics but suggesting that he, as president, was privy to information that would shake the broader public.
while the progressive change campaign committee cast the demonstrations as nonviolent civil disobedience, aimed at starting conversations on key democracy issues, numerous media outlets reported more than 900 arrests during the protests. salon pegged the final tally at 1,240 over a week of protests.
now, with the foot soldiers of his republican majority under siege in their home districts, the blustering outsider who chalked up his predecessors' failures to their lack of will or guile, is seeing his own challenged daily.
two key areas of trump's tax plan are the repeals of the alternative minimum tax (amt) and the estate tax. the amt requires individuals with a high number of deductions to calculate the amount owed in taxes under the normal rate and the alternative and ultimately pay the higher amount. while the amt was intended to rid huge deductions by wealthy taxpayers, according to the tax policy center, approximately 5 million people are now affected. the elimination of the estate tax would allow inheritances of $5.5 million for individuals and couples with estates over $11 million to transfer tax free.
so what tax breaks have the most potential for self-employed filers? here are five biggies:
hospitals typically lay out multi-year operating plans that prioritize investments, such as new clinics, medical wings, technology or other projects that help draw in more patients and increase revenue. in addition to enhancing patient care, these projects are vital to the local economy as a driver of jobs ranging from construction and maintenance to restaurants and transportation.
while some candidates at the back of the pack have virtually no chance of winning their party's nomination, i wouldn't count out warren and biden. i agree with their decision to stay in the race.
i'm hopeful. sen. murphy, i'm working closely with him. he's working real hard over (in the senate), thompson said.
voters will inevitably come to see him for the demagogue that he is, and president trump will beat him in november.
huffpost asked a number of the leading presidential campaigns whether they were prepared to reject contributions over $200 from executives in the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries. the campaign of sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.), a fellow proponent of medicare for all, said it would do so.
are the words yes and no in your vocabulary? subryan yelled. then she added, you're full of s---!
white house budget director mick mulvaney said sunday the white house would be okay with dropping the repeal from the senate plan. the house bill passed last week did not include the repeal of the mandate.
why would they do that? it turns out that many cfos are simply overestimating their company's cost of capital. for example in one survey the average cfo told duke that his company had to pay 10% for its money, even though his own calculations, and public data from the stock and bond markets, meant that the number was only around 6%.

even during his impeachment, clinton's white house was viewed as much more trustworthy than trump's ever was. bush's white house held a lot of trust and confidence from americans that evaporated following then-secretary of state colin powell's presentation to the united nations about the risk posed by iraq — an incorrect argument, as it turned out — and the war in that country that followed.
the current government shutdown is on track to outlast all previous government shutdowns if it extends into saturday. and with both sides still seemingly unwilling to budge on their stances regarding funding for a border wall – the chances of it rolling into saturday and its 22nd day seem likely.
as huffpost has noted, though, it's a whole lot harder for trump to paint himself as the solution to crime and civil unrest-fueled-rioting when those problems have exploded on his watch. he ran in 2016 on a similar platform; now he is asking for a chance to deliver on a promise he couldn't keep.
more:2018: what could possibly go right? five possibilities.
it's possible a coronavirus infection would become a pre-existing condition without the aca, according to levitt. he also noted that trump's executive order on pre-existing conditions carries no force of law, and he has never released a plan to replace the aca or protect people with pre-existing conditions.
affluent young people might end up saving some money as a result of these changes. but the effect on those who are older and less affluent would be devastating. aarp has done the math: a 55-year-old making $25,000 a year would end up paying $3,600 a year more for coverage; that rises to $8,400 for a 64-year-old making $15,000 a year. and that's before the death spiral.
the incumbent in michigan isn't a republican, however. it's democrat gary peters, a well-liked but not especially well-known former investment adviser who has spent nearly 30 years in politics ― as a city councilor, state senator, lottery commissioner and then a u.s. house member before succeeding democratic sen. carl levin in 2015.

the first test came when president donald trump and congress pledged to repeal obamacare and defund planned parenthood. house speaker paul ryan promised it would happen by early february, just days after trump would take office. any other year, with republicans controlling both chambers and the executive branch, that might have happened. but women and young people led the revolt, knowing that trumpcare would take aim at maternity benefits, family planning and affordable health care.
california's lack of affordable housing also promises to be a big focus for the state's 40th governor.

a year ago, when more than 20 co-ops were up and running, about 1 million americans were insured through these plans. by contrast, the alliance says the seven co-ops that will remain in 2017 have about 350,000 members. their supporters continue to tout them for cost-effective coverage, pointing to sources such as a recent report by the government accountability office that found co-ops' average monthly premiums in 2015 were below the averages for other plans in most areas.
well, look. let's be clear. the establishment is freaking out. the establishment is worried. wall street is worried. the drug companies are worried. insurance companies are worried.
one expert said a republican proposal to split the ninth circuit of federal courts — a long-sought goal of conservatives who see the circuit as dominated by liberal judges — was dropped after the senate parliamentarian indicated that even though the change would have fiscal impact and include the autopilot direct spending reconciliation is used for, the budget impact would be seen as incidental to the policy change involved.
stone: it really depends on who you talk to. the number that was held up repeatedly was an average increase of about 116 percent for the benchmark plan here. the caveat is that most people don't feel that price hike because they're insulated by the tax credits under the affordable care act. the republican replacement for that would have lowered the tax credits relatively significantly for a place like arizona. and the question would have been - how would people have afforded premiums?
you're right that in many ways, i left the think tank world in order to set out on the three-year journey it took for me to write the sum of us, because i felt like the way the progressive economic orthodoxy was understanding economic self-interest and what was driving people and how to make change — the idea that we could study the problem, put the numbers in front of decision makers, and of course, everybody would benefit — that all seemed very flawed to me, particularly after the election of donald trump. what i understand now is that much more than a material self-interest is a status self-interest — is a self-interest particularly in a society as hierarchical as ours, as brutally hierarchical as ours. being in the middle or on the top of that hierarchy is more important than $7 more an hour for you, is more important than $10,000 off of your student loan bill, is more important than things like taking action to address climate change. all of these obvious self-interest issues have been filtered through a racialized zero-sum story — the idea that progress for people of color has to come at the expense of white people. that is, more than anything i discovered, the major stumbling block to progress in america.
rep. mark walker, the chairman of the gop study committee, also warned against making predictions in a speaker's race that appears to be months away.

i'm a glass-half-full person so i prefer to emphasize the hopes and the dreams. i look at where we are today and where citizens of america are today and i hope that we can move forward positively so that it's tomorrow and the day after are always a better day. and that would be job-wise, opportunity-wise, because there are opportunities. hopefully everybody can have those.
braithwaite says he wants to stay with the plan, which covers just his wife as he's on medicare, because it's a lot of aggravation to change plans and possibly doctors and they have been with highmark for nearly 10 years.
during trump's first months in office, the administration shunted aside its white house office of national drug control policy. the office, whose director is known as the drug czar, is responsible for coordinating anti-drug efforts across 16 federal agencies and producing the national drug control strategy, an annual drug policy plan mandated by congress.

an effect that the numbers don't reveal
all these rural hospitals are operating on thin margins. the removal of any income source or coverage, or expansion of bad debt, is going to create significant financial hardship, said alan morgan, ceo of the national rural health association.
it's not surprising that trump followed through on promises to issue executive orders to revive the dakota access and keystone xl oil pipelines, but the administration is making a much harder play below the radar to eviscerate obama's environmental legacy.
the law will likely be upheld, based on a november hearing in which two members of the court's conservative majority, including chief justice john roberts, said the law could survive even if its mandate to purchase insurance must be struck down.
this validates one of the core concerns about politicizing medicine, or any other scientific field, by putting big government in charge of it. rational discussion becomes impossible. every analysis quickly devolves into a partisan brawl.
a month after longtime wisconsin gov. scott walker lost his re-election bid to democrat tony evers, republican lawmakers moved forward with legislation to curb his successor's power over a key economic development agency and over state litigation, including a lawsuit over obamacare. the measure, which will be voted on tuesday, would also limit early voting to two weeks. another proposal to move the date of the 2020 presidential primary, so as not to coincide with the re-election of a conservative state supreme court justice, did not advance out of committee.
those close to the effort say its ambitions — and its limits — reflect the preferences of those leading the way. mr. biden, who was involved in the passage and rollout of obamacare as vice president, ran on the idea of expansion, not upheaval. and leaders in congress who wrote obamacare have been watching it in the wild for a decade, slowly developing legislation to address what they see as its gaps and shortcomings. many see their work as a continuing, gradual process, in which lawmakers should make adjustments, assess their effects, and adjust again.
even prominent democrats who advocate the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, do not support completely unrestricted migration, as trump regularly suggests.
he said that aetna's heaviest utilizers of health care — the top 1 percent to 5 percent — are driving half of the costs in the exchanges.

via cbs news political unit associate producer ben mitchell while andrew yang's poll numbers continue to hover somewhere between 2% and 4% in the early states, the campaign insists they're exactly where they want to be right now. yang is still bringing in plenty of donations, his campaign is hiring new people every week and voters are still getting to know him, campaign staffer argue, which leaves room for growth. they also point to other campaigns that are hemorrhaging support and money.
more recently, the administration also sought to loosen rules on short-term health insurance plans that are less expensive but don't carry the same consumer protections as obamacare plans. experts believe that could entice healthier people to exit the marketplace in favor of less-expensive, short-term plans, leaving the marketplace with a sicker population that could drive insurance costs higher.
more than 80 percent of the 298 separate medicaid-opioids cases identified were filed in medicaid expansion states, led by new york, michigan, louisiana, new jersey, and ohio, the report states. the number of criminal cases increased 55 percent in the first four years after the medicaid expansion, from 2014 to 2017, compared to the four-year period before expansion.

texas sen. ted cruz promised his party tuesday that he is not suspending our fight for liberty.
meanwhile, intelligence committee chairman adam schiff, d-calif., has hired a former federal prosecutor to aid his desperate scattershot probe of the president.
cruz appeared more willing than ever to needle trump from the stage, saying that trump had not been in the fray during the seven big conservative fights of the past three years. and cruz repeated belittled trump as a fragile soul.

but there's a reason that you put out several of these statistics, its so that economists can view them and decide, look at different landscapes on -- what -- on -- on how to -- how to make economic policy.
that, verrilli said, tends to be the most time you get before somebody jumps into a question.
we have no higher priority than the safety, security, health and wellbeing of the american people, pence said during a news conference at the white house.
one of my people came up to me and said, 'mr. president, they tried to beat you on russia, russia, russia, that didn't work out too well. they couldn't do it. they tried the impeachment hoax,' that was on a perfect conversation, 'they tried anything, they tried it over and over and they've been doing it since you got in. it's all turning, they lost, it's all turning -- think of it, think of it, and this is their new hoax.'
geoffrey stone, a member of the review committee appointed by the white house to examine the program, said in an interview with nbc news that the committee found that the bulk data collection program by itself could not be credited with stopping any really big attacks.
i'd like us to put in place a better program than the one we have, the obamacare program, but getting that in place for the country to take advantage of in the next few weeks is just not very likely, sen. mitt romney (r-utah) said.
we have a great economic growth right now. industries are booming everywhere. in this area, no, but i feel like there are small businesses that are starting to pick up. they feel comfortable with bidding and doing work because the economy is good. the stock market's solid. unemployment is down. these are huge things for if i were to go into business i would want to do it in a situation like this.
chief justice john roberts arrived at the valletta campus of the university of malta on july 3, 2012, to teach a class on supreme court history. as he emerged from the back seat of a black sedan, he held his brown leather briefcase in front of him, almost as a shield. he wore a blue blazer, striped button-down shirt, and tan khakis. his clothes looked crisp, though his face was haggard. he was as exhausted and distressed as he had been in years.
say what you want about trump, he is what he is, he does what he says, and he stands his ground. his vision and ideas are clear, and you do not have to agree with him to see that.
barrett's critics, for instance, point to her judicial writing in a major gun case. in 2008, the supreme court ruled for the first time that the constitution guarantees the right to own a gun. but justice scalia, writing for the court, listed some exceptions, among them laws barring felons from owning guns. when one of those felon laws came before judge barrett, she dissented, maintaining that the supreme court didn't really mean to exclude gun ownership for felons who aren't dangerous.
trump said at the iowa rally that the most china ever spent on us agricultural products in a year is $16 billion, claiming that secretary of agriculture sonny perdue told him this.
another reason this matters: sessions could wind up being the point man on the investigation into voter fraud that trump promised on twitter this morning. as matt zapotosky and sari horwitz note, sessions has in the past asserted that voter fraud exists, though he has declined to endorse trump's assertion that millions of fraudulent votes were cast in the 2016 election. 'i don't know what the president-elect meant or was thinking when he made that comment or what facts he may have had to justify his statement,' sessions said at his confirmation hearing earlier this month, asked point blank by sen. al franken (d-minn.) whether he agreed with trump. 'i would just say that every election needs to be managed closely and we need to ensure that there is integrity in it. and i do believe we regularly have fraudulent activities occur during election cycles.' …
yet the cost is more per person than the government spends to insure people through its major insurance programs, medicare and medicaid — and illustrates just how expensive it is to rely on the nation's for-profit insurance industry to get americans covered.
— and here are a few more good reads:
in the gop 2016 field, though, republicans chose the least-conventional candidate of my lifetime, and it paid off with a white house win. regardless of how people feel about trump personally, the right track/wrong track numbers show a stable sense of satisfaction with the way things are going for the first time some 15 years.
another important part of the first 100 days is to create a network of people you can talk to — get to know people, be friendly with everyone around you, whether they're above or below you on the ranks, and build relationships, larssen said. these friendships help employees feel connected to their jobs — about two-thirds of 716 full-time workers with six or more workplace friends said they loved their company, and 55% said work relationships were very to extremely important to their quality of life, according to a 2014 workforce mood tracker report conducted by employee recognition firm globoforce.
the court's order is a win for manhattan district attorney cyrus vance jr., who has been seeking trump's tax records since 2019 as part of an investigation. vance, a democrat, had subpoenaed the records from the mazars accounting firm that has long done work for trump and his businesses. mazars has said it would comply with the subpoena, but trump, a republican, sued to block the records' release.
but denecke said those rules are easy to get around. he knows from experience.
and in march, a federal judge said trump's plan making it easier for small employers to band together to buy insurance was clearly an end-run around the aca. but some states that supported the change may not enforce the judge's ruling on plans sold in their jurisdictions, kaiser health news has reported.
three years after obamacare's exchanges opened for business, the program is facing challenges.
and then there's the question of whether debates matter that much anyway. it could be that the cacophony of multiple, fierce attacks from a presidential field piling on will only underscore bloomberg's argument to centrist voters that he's different.

palm beach, florida - u.s. sen. rick scott has a message for states and cities poised to receive a collective $360 billion from the american rescue act stimulus package: send it back.
rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) expressed frustration with critics seeking negative information about her:
in a letter to biden, 11 senate republicans and 64 house republicans — led by sen. tom cotton (r-ar) and rep. dan bishop (r-nc) — are asking biden to rescind becerra's nomination to lead hhs due to his embrace of radical policies on immigration, among other issues.
the rally was the product of a longstanding invitation from the state's our revolution chapter, according to his staff, which did not comment on the absence of the various candidates.
grogan didn't obtain a waiver from complying with a directive the president established during his first week in office that would block lobbyists from regulating on a specific issue area in the administration for two years, david pittman reports. (the health 202 wrote about grogan back in november.) the administration insists grogan didn't need a waiver because his current role doesn't overlap with his former work with gilead sciences.

insurers are requesting premium increases of 9%, on average, for the benchmark silver plan -- upon which federal subsidies are based -- in major cities in 16 states plus the district of columbia, according to the latest review by the kaiser family foundation. but this masks substantial variation, with requests ranging from a drop of 13% to an increase of 25%. states still have to review the requests and could change them.
sagal: this week, president trump awarded medals of valor to the officers who responded to the shooting at a congressional blank game.
more than one in four adults under the age of 65 have existing medical conditions, according to kaiser family foundation.
he rejected a deal that his own aides and gop leaders had negotiated after conservative media personalities got to him — and ann coulter threatened not to vote for him again in 2020. he's bending over backward to show his base that he's going to the mat for a wall. that's why trump is sitting down with fox news host sean hannity later today when he goes to the border in mcallen, tex.
it took watergate for the parties to stand up to nixon and attempt to constrain the presidency. the question really is, what unilateral action against isis would be so extreme that congress would pass a funding ban?
newsom also took issue with a number of other white house positions, including an effort to kill the affordable care act, commonly referred to as obamacare.
after the chief, conservative justices antonin scalia, anthony kennedy and clarence thomas offered their views. like roberts, they thought congress' commerce authority did not cover an individual's decision to forgo -- rather than obtain -- health insurance. there were thus four immediate votes cast to invalidate the mandate. no one at the table was surprised, based on the questions during oral arguments and word from law clerks inside the building circulating intelligence among the justices' chambers.
last night in federal court, the justice department of the trump administration, you'd think they'd have more to do, decided not only to try to destroy protections for pre-existing conditions, but to tear down every last benefit and protection the aca affords, pelosi said.
two months later, roberts had shifted on both.
but this week secretary of defense mattis joined the trump administration's attack on civil rights, and particularly lgbtq rights, delaying for six months a pentagon plan approved in the obama administration to permit transgender recruits to enlist in the military. mattis said the plan would give the defense department more time to study the issue, and insisted that the delay in no way presupposes the outcome of review, but lgbtq advocates noted that the obama order was issued a full year ago, giving the military branches sufficient time to address concerns, and conservative groups cheered the decision and expressed hope the obama decision would be cancelled. the order already prohibited the armed forces from kicking out existing service members for coming out as transgender, and there's been no showing of national security danger from allowing transgender americans to serve openly. blocking basic anti-discrimination protections for people who want to serve their country, just as the pentagon previously did with gays and lesbians, is plain wrong.
and that's just one example in which the courts would have to sort out modifications to the affordable care act that congress has passed since its inception.
the claim: i say it, and i say it all the time, we are so respected again. i can't even tell you — really, the degree to which people respect our country again. it's amazing. it's amazing.
and the consequences of a decision going in the other direction, wiping out the affordable care act, would be enormous.
the biggest savings would have come from medicaid spending. cbo and jct estimated that medicaid spending would have declined in 2026 by 26 percent in comparison with current law — a reduction of $772 billion over the 10-year period. as a result, about 15 million fewer people would have been enrolled in medicaid by 2026, compared with what enrollment would have been under current law, the analysis said.
by 2004, george w. bush could state that when congress wouldn't act, he had no choice but to issue an executive order expanding access to federal grants for faith-based charities. obama similarly said in 2014 that when congress doesn't move on things they should move on,... i've got a pen and i've got a phone, and i can use that pen to sign executive orders and take executive actions and administrative actions that move the ball forward.
levin: so you think they're bitter because they see athletes making all this money and they make chump change -- many of them.
for instance, families may not see the boost in the child tax credit until the summer.
the president also commended president el-sisi for his courageous steps to address egypt's economic challenges and offered to discuss ways the united states could support egypt's economic reform program. finally, the two leaders discussed a visit to the united states in the future.
the whole fracas reads like a fun house mirror version of john ridley's notorious 2006 esquire essay, the manifesto of ascendancy of the modern american nigger — or even bill cosby's infamous pound cake speech. these were angry, very public screeds by prominent black folks against poorer black folks for their supposed moral shortcomings, manifestos that essentially drew a line in the sand indicating who gets to claim membership in real blackness, and who doesn't.
those people are the ones the affordable care act affected most directly. today, they can get comprehensive coverage, regardless of pre-existing conditions, and a majority of them are eligible for federal tax credits that generally keep coverage affordable.
counties and states with the highest opioid use were often areas carried by the republican candidate, the researchers found. in many areas with high rates of drug overdose, voter turnout in 2016 exceeded that in 2012, with donald trump overwhelmingly favored.
conservatives were also critical of the bill advanced last fall by sens. bill cassidy (r-la.) and lindsey graham (r-s.c.). they liked how it transferred obamacare's subsidies and medicaid expansion dollars to states, but feared states might still use the funds to expand government programs. the plan they're working on will probably include more rules for how states could use block grant funds, such as restricting states from maintaining an expanded medicaid program for able-bodied, childless adults.
no one knows how seriously to take trump's threat to seize iraq's oil: the recycled campaign comment is raising concerns about trump's understanding of the delicate middle east politics involved in the u.s.-led effort against extremist groups, the ap reports in a story that just moved over the wire. the statement ignores the precedent of hundreds of years of american history.… taking the oil would also require a permanent u.s. occupation, or at least until iraq's 140 billion barrels of crude run out, and a large presence of american soldiers to guard sometimes isolated oil fields and infrastructure. such a mission would be highly unpopular with iraqis, whose hearts and minds the u.s. is still trying to win to defeat groups such as [the islamic state and al-qaeda].
paul, who has warned against big government and overspending, did tout the measure as a way to shrink the military.
that's the tally from the post's stellar fact-checking team, which in the administration's first 100 days started a database for analyzing, categorizing and tracking every suspect statement trump utters. at the request of readers, they kept it going.
miami, fl - february 05: aymara marchante (l) and wiktor garcia sit with maria elena santa coloma, an insurance advisor with univista insurance company, as they sign up for the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, before the february 15th deadline on february 5, 2015 in miami, florida. numbers released by the government show that the miami-fort lauderdale-west palm beach metropolitan area has signed up 637,514 consumers so far since open enrollment began on nov. 15, which is more than twice as many as the next large metropolitan area, atlanta, georgia
reading through the draft democratic platform, the cumulative effect is that the federal government would take on a bigger role in everything from retirement security to health care to sustainability. a core idea: animating the greater government activism with policies to improve the general welfare and social connectedness.
in addition, trump's state of the union address felt more like a campaign speech for someone running for reelection than a speech to democrats as well as republicans in congress. it lacked the formality, decorum and graciousness that a state of the union normally has.
crumbling midwest numbers for trump, gop
the medical exam room, used to treat minor ailments, is tucked into a broom closet beneath a concrete stairwell. with few drug treatment options, prisoners strung out on fentanyl go through days of withdrawal with little help, shivering and curled up on the beds and floors of the jail.
the situation in syria is catastrophic, clinton said, adding that she advocates a no-fly zone in syria to provide humanitarian aid to people suffering and to work with allies.
people change their minds about what they thought. so it isn't at all something extraordinary, and that's how it should work. we're in the process of trying to persuade each other and then the public, she told me in a 2012 interview in her chambers.
in several tweets throughout 2015 and 2016, for instance, gehrke repeatedly tweeted that trump was a plant by the democrats in the gop primary—even calling him a manchurian candidate in one and accusing the now-president of deliberate subterfuge in the gop primary that would benefit clinton in another:
experts say it's too early to tell whether this is a trend, however, and people in other high-income countries tend to live longer than people in the u.s.
yet it's not clear there will be other tests, as these phases would depend on newfound bipartisanship and the questionable use of executive authority. rep. raul labrador, r-idaho, isn't convinced, calling it a fiction for anyone to believe that.
between may and august 2018, an additional 10,520 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids, the most recent time period for which cdc data is available. colton gutknecht, 20, a fashion design student from peoria, ariz., was one of them.
now, i want to be absolutely clear at the start — and i've said this over and over again, this also becomes routine, there is a ritual about this whole thing that i have to do — i believe in the second amendment. it's there written on the paper. it guarantees a right to bear arms. no matter how many times people try to twist my words around — i taught constitutional law, i know a little about this — i get it. but i also believe that we can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the second amendment.
companies get a great return on investment in terms of publicity
more than 36 million people have filed for unemployment benefits due to the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, meaning millions will be left without health insurance. in mid may, left-leaning think tank economic policy institute estimated 16.2 million people have lost health insurance once provided by their employer — how roughly half of americans get their health insurance. that number could be as high as 26.8 million if those who lost their jobs don't sign up for other coverage, the kaiser family foundation found.
in wisconsin, republicans have had full control of the state for the past eight years. and in michigan, republicans have had full control since 2011. democrats in those states, both of which are also critical to the 2020 presidential contest, argue that republicans are dismissing the will of voters during lame duck sessions.
republicans have no compelling answer to charges that they're to blame for premium increases in the marketplaces, holler said.
some of trump's changes are also being challenged in court.
many tea party leaders, especially those who oppose common core educational standards and have strong evangelical backgrounds, back cruz.
secretary clinton is practical, pragmatic, knows how to get stuff done. and people will make a decision about those kinds of things. but i want to go back to one of the points that david made very, very early on, about 1,680-plus caucus locations. this is iowa. great state, great people. and it's kicking off this incredible big night.
-- trump's handling of the shutdown has demonstrated how white house communications director bill shine is not directing the messaging coming out of the west wing. the new york times's katie rogers and maggie haberman report: an alumnus of fox news, where he was known as a protector of the network's chairman, roger e. ailes, mr. shine has confined his white house role mainly to stagecraft, people who have worked with him say, and mr. trump, who chafes against being managed, has openly expressed skepticism about what he has done. once he was back in washington, mr. shine was among the aides pushing mr. trump to deliver tuesday's prime-time oval office speech and make a visit to the border on thursday. and it was mr. shine who was among the unnamed targets of the president when mr. trump criticized those plans at a lunch with broadcasters before his speech. … to his friends and allies, mr. trump wistfully brings up hope hicks, his most successful communications director, who departed nearly a year ago.
cnn's brianna keilar explains why many republicans are hesitant to take the coronavirus vaccine.
polls show trump's approval ratings are recovering from the impeachment inquiry. trump's republican support is solid even as other americans are repulsed by his crimes and outrages — from using public office for personal gain, to locking up kids in cages on the border, to cynically exacerbating america's racial tensions, to the denial of the greatest threat to our security: catastrophic climate change.
what republicans have to do is turn it into midnight basketball, he said, referring to a program republicans attacked as frivolous in 1990s crime legislation. you have to say you support the bits of this that go to covid relief, but detail the pork that's in there. (in 2010, republicans attacked a stimulus-funded study that tested how monkeys reacted to cocaine.)
the facts: the unemployment rate, 3.5% in december, is indeed at its lowest in decades. the average unemployment rate during trump's first 35 months was 3.9%, compared with an average monthly rate of 7.4% under barack obama, 5.3% under george w. bush and 5.2% under bill clinton.
the american health care act would have cut medicaid's budget by $834 billion, causing 14 million people to lose coverage. the cassidy-graham bill also sought to slash medicaid. those bills didn't become law, but not for want of republicans trying. the senate measure failed by a single vote (given that vice president mike pence would've cast a tie-breaking vote in the event of a 50-50 tally).
the new sign-ups for health coverage come from the centers for medicare and medicaid services. the figures are partial because they don't include sign-ups from states that run their own health insurance marketplaces. major states like california and new york are not counted in the federal statistics.
biden will have to answer for these scandals and so far his answers stink.
healthcare for all or medicare for all has become a more popular idea among young americans, due to the creeping normality perpetrated by obamacare, despite the fact that obamacare is proving itself costly and daunting.
political opportunism helps to explain the apparent shift. in 2009, republicans and conservatives were trying to block legislation from then-president barack obama. now they are trying to promote and defend president donald trump, who has been agitating to end social distancing to open businesses and revive the economy.
cheap gas helped fuel a car-buying binge in 2015 as americans bought new vehicles at a record rate. low interest rates and dealer incentives added a helping hand: prices of new autos were basically flat last year.
advocates are eager for action, particularly after women played a crucial role in biden's victory. if only men had voted, trump would have won.
then, yesterday, house republicans passed a bill that would prevent the district of columbia from using local tax dollars to subsidize abortion services for low-income women. jenna portnoy and aaron c. davis report: although the senate has never passed the bill, the vote was an ominous sign that the district could become an afterthought as congress considers targeting laws regulating guns, assisted suicide and marijuana in the nation's capital. the stakes are particularly high for the district this year, as it can no longer rely on a democratic presidential veto.
during his speech, newsom confirmed the news that he was ordering national guard troops off border patrol detail and redeploying most of the 360 personnel to wildfire and drug-gang duty.
richard morrell, 57, who owns a plumbing business on long island, plans to vote tuesday for cruz, because he supports his conservative principles.
raju: they believe if they have a third-place finish and are much higher than the other establishment type favorites in this race, the governor specifically, if they are 10 points, 15 points higher than them, they will have a very strong message to tell out of iowa and they can go into new hampshire trying to be that unity candidate. we will see if they're able to do that just in a few hours -- wolf. .
but the dispute before the justices this term raises different issues than the 2012 legal challenge to obamacare, making it more difficult to discern how barrett may rule.
mcconnell and other republicans argued they had more than a month to agree to an immigration package before daca is set to expire and called on democrats to back the short-term bill in order to give them more time to negotiate.
additionally, the task force will review the tools at the disposal of congress to restore the proper balance of powers and hold the executive branch accountable. it will also make recommendations where there are deficiencies, including legislative solutions.

spicer: ok, i'm asking where was that apology? and so, i'm just saying that when you -- when things like that happen, when john lewis says that he's never missed an inauguration and we find out actually he did, under -- he skipped george w. bush's, that there are points in which we have a right to make sure that we correct the record.
campaigning in a virtual mode forces a team to translate the modern elements of a campaign into new forms. the biden team is going to have to learn as it goes, substituting virtual news conferences, virtual fundraisers, virtual roundtables and virtual volunteer events for physical, in-person affairs.
now there's a new debate, about the effect of covid-19 on public health and the economy ― and how to respond.
melissa block, byline: kenosha county is the kind of place democrats didn't used to have to worry about. the last time it went for a republican for president was 1972, richard nixon. and now, in 2016, donald trump - he won kenosha county by 255 votes.
private insurers don't have the power to dictate what they'll pay providers. consequently, the public option will have a much lower cost structure – and will thus be able to set premiums that are far lower than those for private insurers.
spicer: i -- i -- that's a great question. i believe there's an action that has to be taken under the -- the provision of nafta where you set -- you send notice to the other countries, the other two countries.

for instance, biden's plan says it would direct the cdc to provide specific guidance — based on the degree of viral spread in a community — for when to open or close businesses and schools, when to impose restrictions on gathering sizes or when stay-home orders may be called for.
the goal of the advertising is to remind liberal-leaning young people that one of the two old men vying for the presidency agrees with them on the issues a lot more than the other does. one of nextgen's first ads is design to rebut the idea that there is little difference between biden and trump, comparing and contrasting biden's pledge to expand health care coverage with trump's support for repealing obamacare; and biden's support for clean energy with trump's backing of unchecked pollution, among other issues.

biden and bernie:wide-eyed joe biden dodges bernie sanders' hand in viral debate moment
-- jerry brown seized on conway's alternative facts formulation during his state of the state address in california yesterday: the recent election and inauguration of a new president have shown deep divisions across america. we have seen the bald assertion of 'alternative facts.' we have heard the blatant attacks on science. familiar signposts of our democracy — truth, civility, working together — have been obscured or swept aside, the democratic governor said. let me be clear: we will defend everybody — every man, woman and child — who has come here and contributed to the well-being of our state. california is not turning back. not now. not ever.

the affordable care act was all built on that penalty, weber said. the case will now likely go to the supreme court, where the five justices who previously voted to uphold the aca are still sitting. however, weber noted that the court now has a conservative majority, with the confirmation of supreme court justices neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh under mr. trump.

carroll, who had been appointed acting drug czar in february 2018, disputed that characterization and said the administration has taken numerous steps to combat the opioid crisis. he noted that the drug czar's office is only one of several agencies that are trying to battle the epidemic and that he is in close contact with them. despite the repeated attempts by the office of management and budget to slash his budget, carroll said he has the full support of the white house. he also said he has proposed spending an additional $1.3 billion on anti-drug efforts.
the point, proponents say, isn't just to keep unemployment from skyrocketing during recessions; it's to correct labor market problems that persist even when unemployment is low. and even people opposed to the idea of job guarantees agree that those problems need fixing.

sen. john cornyn (r-texas), who has repeatedly voted to repeal the aca, encouraged americans to sign up for obamacare if they lose their health insurance.
these are programs that are designed to be revenue generators, whether we call it profit or excess revenue it's basically the same thing, said kinser, the penn state professor.
the bill would have ended obamacare's expansion of medicaid eligibility and cut funding for the rest of the medicaid program going forward. it would have scaled back regulations on what insurance covers. it also would have redistributed financial assistance, so that people with lower incomes and higher insurance costs would get less than they do today ― even as more affluent people would qualify for substantial new subsidies.
republicans thought they had put a scab on their self-inflicted health care wounds from 2018, but donald trump just ripped off the band-aid again by going to court to try and overturn it, said democratic strategist jesse ferguson.

senator mitch mcconnell: now, i agree it's a terrible law. i understand why people harmed by it would want it changed. in fact, i think we ought to repeal it altogether and opt instead for real reforms that would actually lower costs. but the fact is, for now at least, it is the law. and it's the president's constitutional duty to enforce the law.
but while that's some solace for people including breast cancer survivor christine frietchen of new york city, she just got a letter from empire blue cross blue shield saying she faces a 22% rate increase for 2017. that will bring her premium to more than $630 a month for a silver-level plan that only covers in-network care and requires referrals for everything.
a big reason for that is the same one that checked liberal ambitions in 2009: the resistance of more conservative democrats. already two of them, west virginia's joe manchin and arizona's kyrsten sinema, have said they would oppose eliminating the filibuster. they've also expressed skepticism about ideas high on the progressive agenda, like raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.

-- a dhs test of a steel slat prototype of the wall showed it could be sawed through. nbc news's jacob soboroff and julia ainsley report: the trump administration directed the construction of eight steel and concrete prototype walls that were built in otay mesa, california, just across the border from tijuana, mexico. trump inspected the prototypes in march 2018. he has now settled on a steel slat, or steel bollard, design for the proposed border barrier additions. steel bollard fencing has been used under previous administrations. however, testing by dhs in late 2017 showed all eight prototypes, including the steel slats, were vulnerable to breaching, according to an internal february 2018 u.s. customs and border protection report.

no, it did not — although, contrary to what some republicans say now, it was not for democrats' lack of effort. in addition to believing in bipartisanship as a virtue, obama could count votes, especially in the senate, where a small-state bias gave conservative states disproportionate power ― and where the filibuster was becoming a de facto, 60-vote requirement for all legislation.
just hours after his inauguration on friday, trump signed an executive order instructing the hhs to waive, defer, grant exemptions from taxes and penalties associated with the affordable care act.

this could strand many of the 12 million people who have gotten coverage on the individual markets, according to larry levitt, a senior vice president at the kaiser family foundation. they could be left with no insurers in the marketplaces, no way to get tax credits, no way to get coverage at all, levitt tells me, adding that the insurer exodus could also prevent people who individually obtain coverage outside the exchanges from doing so: you're talking about small business owners, farmers, self-employed people, early retirees — who would have no way of getting health insurance.

chief justice john roberts, nominated by president george w. bush in 2005, has long sought to maneuver the court around similar partisan tensions. that above-politics approach sometimes drew the ire of trump, who castigated the high court as incompetent and weak for failing to buy into his baseless claims of election fraud.

but trump doesn't dislike all regulations. at the same time he is lifting regulations on fossil fuel and health care companies, he is imposing new regulations on individuals —particularly those with lower incomes. to qualify for medicaid, low-income workers in seven states face new regulations requiring them to fill out forms logging their hours worked. failure to comply results in the loss of medicaid coverage entirely. in arkansas alone, since these new regulations have been in place, more than 18,000 people have already lost their insurance for failing to comply with these new regulations. trump wants people who receive benefits from the supplemental nutrition assistance program, which provide food to hungry kids, to be similarly regulated.

republicans' ideas are unpopular. their president is historically unpopular. their failed effort to repeal the affordable care act and their deliberate mismanagement and weakening of the law's benefits are unpopular. they are under sustained assault from democrats highlighting (and mostly accurately describing) the gop health policy agenda, especially on the question of people with pre-existing conditions. and most americans are inclined to side with democrats on this issue.

i'm ezra klein, and this is the ezra klein show. i don't want to ruin too much of this show by summarizing it at the top. heather mcghee, who is my guest and the author of the wonderful and really important new book, the sum of us, explains all of it better than i can. so i'm going to let her do it. but i do want to share a connection this conversation made for me that i wish i'd made before i walked into it. and so maybe you'll get more out of it having this earlier than i did. a few years ago, i interviewed a psychologist named lisa feldman barrett, and she had written this really great book about how the mind generates emotions. and her argument is that emotions are metaphors that apply to sensory data. depending on which metaphors our society has given us, we will interpret the same sensory data in different ways. so if you believe yourself to be an anxious person or your society talks about anxiety a lot, you'll likely interpret a speedy heart rate, a bit of stomach churning as anxiety, a bad thing. i know i've done this quite a bit. but another person in another context might feel the same feelings as anticipation or excitement. she tells this funny story about being on a date and thinking it wasn't going well — that the conversation was lame, that the guy was lame.

i had very handily beaten a couple of really smart people in the high school democrat club [in a debate about the environment], recalled marlow, and then i was told that one of the teachers had called me an 'ignorant moron' to his class, and that, to me, was a jolt. that was a very exciting moment for me, to have triggered an adult teacher — an authority figure — by simply winning a debate. … it didn't scare me in the slightest, and that was a very seminal moment for me, because i realized that when i win a debate and then get attacked, there was something about that that made me hungry to learn more and fight harder.

'we were pushed by a man in a mask hiding his face,' manion [said] … 'our clothes were drawn on with permanent marker by other 'protesters.' and we were called the most vile names i have ever heard as we entered and exited the venue.' the alleged events friday night followed rioting and destruction earlier in the day by so-called protesters upset by trump's election.

overseas, as tehran's restraint saves the president from stumbling into a war with iran, he's dispatching 3,500 more troops to the middle east — on top of the thousands he already sent as the war in afghanistan continues. u.s. soldiers remain at risk in senseless deployments from syria to iraq, with the latter country's parliament voting to ask our troops to leave. even fox news loyalists such as tucker carlson are chafing at trump's betrayal of his promises.

trump has attempted to usher through prescription drug reforms via a series of executive orders signed in july and september, though the timeline for seeing these policies implemented remains uncertain. a notable order would lower drug prices for those on medicare parts b and d to comparable costs seen internationally.
those kinds of compromises are frequently deflating. that doesn't mean they should be, and the affordable care act is an example of why. it still achieved a lot ― more, in fact, than even many liberals seem to grasp. it's already transformed the political conversation on health care, so that the principles of universal coverage now have wide acceptance.
and they called on the administration to further promote the law during the pandemic, by opening up healthcare.gov for a special enrollment period.
trump's critics hear his sweeping promises as the words of a classic strongman, a ruler who seems prepared to push aside the cobwebs of bureaucracy and the checks and balances of american federalism to produce instant, decisive action. they've compared him to mussolini, hitler, vladi­mir putin, saddam hussein and argentina's juan peron. trump has praised putin and hussein for being tough on terrorism. in the past, trump has singled out china's crackdown against pro-democracy activists in tiananmen square in 1989 as a demonstration of the power of strength.
the nonpartisan congressional budget office estimates the new proposal would cause 14 million people to lose health insurance next year and 24 million by 2026. the bill has divided house and senate republicans and sparked fierce criticism from democrats and leading medical and hospital groups, including the american medical association and american hospital association.

the penalties already paid represent one of the biggest tax increases on the middle class in living memory, precisely as obamacare critics warned… and it's a tax people are paying for the privilege of getting nothing. they'd rather pay the irs than give the money to barack obama's cronies in the insurance industry for a low-quality product.
the president doesn't realize that his own base hears his attack against congress as an attack against republican leadership, he said.
as promised, i directed the department of defense to develop a plan to demolish and destroy isis — a network of lawless savages that have slaughtered muslims and christians, and men, women and children of all faiths and beliefs. we will work with our allies, including our friends and allies in the muslim world, to extinguish this vile enemy from our planet.

unfortunately for the president, not all of his friends in congress and the media were as disciplined. a number of them revealed the public option was a sneaky strategy for getting what the party really wanted: single-payer healthcare. some who abetted the president's lies at the time have since admitted that was the desired goal all along. the president tried to fool the american people, just as he had with the keep your plan promise. he almost got away with it.

we are not getting the job done, trump said after a reporter asked him about comments bannon made at the value voters summit in washington on saturday. and i am not going to blame myself, they are not getting the job done. we had health care approved, and then you had the surprise vote by john mccain. we have had other things happen and they are not getting the job done and i can understand where steve bannon is coming from.

i think it's been an interesting idea to generate conversation about how we best provide health care to people, sen. jeanne shaheen (d-n.h.) said on tuesday when asked if she could support a version of medicare for all. i'm interested in doing everything we can as quickly as possible to give as many people access to health care as we can, and i don't think that will do it ... i think there are other ways to cover people faster.

during the speech, president also returned to his familiar criticism of arizona sen. john mccain, saying a little early-morning surprise by one of our own – referring to mccain's dramatic thumbs-down vote on an obamacare repeal bill – tanked the effort to undo former president barack obama's signature legislation.

i didn't find him helpful at all on the issue, christie said. he only had one tune, which was enforcement. he didn't want to talk about the other parts of the issue. i wanted him to engage on treatment, on drug courts, and he had no interest in engaging in that. so, after a while, i just stopped calling because, what was the use?

as much as trump would have it otherwise, our system doesn't work without regulators willing to take on companies that put their profits ahead of the public. when those companies put the health and safety of kids and our access to life-saving medications at risk, we need regulators who will write the rules that will protect the public. when our government agencies can't or won't do that, it's another sign that we need a change in the oval office.
andrew gave this speech about how culture is upstream from politics, recalled marlow of breitbart's articulation of a now widely known axiom. growing up in hollywood, and seeing the power and influence of my peers' parents at harvard westlake and elsewhere, it was so obvious this guy was right on the money, and i loved movies and i loved music, and it was so clear what andrew was saying, and it never dawned on me, that of course, the politicians were taking cues from the cultural actors, not the other way around. i had never heard this before.
— meanwhile, the world health organization announced it would convene an emergency meeting to decide whether to declare the virus a global health emergency. the news came as china reported confirmed cases in beijing and in guangdong province, 14 cases in health care workers — a first — and a confirmed incident involving human-to-human spread of the new virus, known provisionally as 2019-ncov, stat's helen branswell writes.

much of that was driven by strong opposition from republicans. slightly more than half of independents viewed the idea positively — but that's much lower than the three-quarters who backed the other proposals included by kff. support among democrats for medicare-for-all wasn't particularly strong, generally matching support for the other proposals.
and here we are in working day one, and you've got the president reaching out to some of america's best business leaders and then some of the union workers and line workers, and bringing them in and saying, i want to listen to what's going on in your life. what can we be doing to help you?
rarely, but yes. the last time was in the first half of 2001, when the tie-breaking vice president was a republican, dick cheney. that 50-50 split ended after six months when a republican senator, jim jeffords of vermont, switched parties, giving democrats a 51-49 advantage. there also were 50-50 splits for a few months in 1954 and for most of the congress of 1881-1882, which caused what the senate historical office calls the great senate deadlock of 1881.
the brief was entirely consistent with president donald trump's long-standing hostility to the law, which president barack obama signed in 2010. trump and his republican allies in congress spent much of last year trying to repeal it.

cruz, unlike paul and lee, faces reelection in 2018 and is potentially vulnerable to attacks that he has spent his first term fighting with colleagues and running for president rather than delivering for his state. cruz has been a louder obamacare critic than most republicans, embracing a fight against the law that led to the 2013 government shutdown.

there are a whole lot of drugs, about 90 percent of drugs, that are not under patent. they're generic drugs. but the drug industry has figured out how to manipulate this industry to keep jerking the prices up and up and up, warren said. so my view is, let's give them a little competition... this is a way to make markets work.
solving these, and so many other pressing problems, will require us to work past the differences of party. it will require us to tap into the american spirit that has overcome every challenge throughout our long and storied history.
the pew charitable trusts marchers this month at a rally in washington, d.c., protesting the arrests of immigrants by immigration and customs enforcement. advocates say stepped-up immigration enforcement has contributed to a climate of fear in the immigrant community. many eligible immigrants, they say, are choosing to forgo food stamps, even though they are entitled to receive them.

why this photo of vp mike pence has a lot of people outraged
obama's focus on republican opposition and its effects may sound self-serving to some people ― whether it's conservatives who blame obama for polarizing the country, or progressives who think obama is trying to avoid blame for compromises he should never have made. reasonable people can certainly question individual decisions that obama, along with other democratic leaders, made at various points in the affordable care act's history.
the legal theory of the plaintiffs includes a series of arguments that scholars from across the political spectrum have criticized and, occasionally, mocked. how can there be a command to get insurance when the consequence for disobeying it is literally nothing? do the people bringing the lawsuit even have standing to sue?

but it turns out the computer system being developed for the exchanges won't be able to process that, at least not for the first year. so it turns out the smoking surcharges will pretty much have to be the same percentage for all smokers, regardless of age, at least for 2014.
the cms said a february federal court decision in new mexico, which ruled it was using a flawed formula to determine its collections and payments amounts, prevented it from continuing the program. the cms, which noted that a federal court in massachusetts found its formula fair, has asked the new mexico court to reconsider its decision and said it is seeking a quick resolution to the legal issue.
the conference's eyes are on two frontrunners at the moment: kevin mccarthy, the amicable majority leader who has forged a close bond with president donald trump but was unable to clinch the speakership in 2015, and majority whip steve scalise, the third in command of the house whose conservative credentials could help him win support from the right-flank of the party.
some state governments and local think tanks have prepared estimates of the costs and benefits of medicaid expansion in their region. but the avalere analysis is the first to apply a consistent methodology across all of the states that have declined to expand. some of the numbers are big. florida would get an estimated $26 billion over the next decade, according to avalere; north carolina $13 billion.
spicer: so there's been one call. i talked to general flynn about this again last night. one call, talked about four subjects. one was the loss of life that occurred in the plane crash that took their military choir, two was christmas and holiday greetings, three was to -- to talk about a conference in syria on isis and four was to set up a -- to talk about after the inauguration setting up a call between president putin and president trump.
in other words, democrats will proceed from the premise that, just as on health care, gop ideas on taxes will also be deeply unpopular, even among trump voters.
as the new york times reported in february when debunking an earlier version of trump's $500 million claim: under the one-year deal, this year south korea will pay 1.04 trillion won, or $925 million, an increase of $70 million from last year's $855 million.
roberts did not want the entire law to fall. a pro-business conservative, he understood the importance of the insurance industry to us businesses, and he was genuinely concerned about invalidating an entire law that had been approved through the democratic process to solve the intractable health care problem.
part of the motivation for launching walmart's education benefits program was to help employees continue to build their skills so they're prepared for a long career at the company, malashock said. the company chose to add 14 degree offerings focused on technology to the program last month in part because like many retailers, walmart is becoming more and more of a technology company, malashock said.

gabbard: well first of all, in the question of ground troops, i agree with the two people, senator kaine as well as senator cruz who just spoke earlier that, yes, there do need to be ground troops on the ground to work in conjunction with the airstrikes that we and jordan and some of the other coalition forces are conducting in order to be effective. but i think we also need to take it one step previous.

this is a winner. this is simple, this is a no-brainer, mansour said. and let's make it an issue. and if the democrats want to vote against [deporting criminal foreigners], let's please get them on the record before the midterms. i would love, i'm sure everybody that's running for congress this year or running to hold their seat, would love, love to make an advertisement, to make a campaign commercial noting if their democrat opponent does not want to vote 'yes' on [deporting criminal foreigners].
in the op-ed that sethi's campaign chairman praised, rice accuses trump of bombastic macho-ism and sleight of rhetorical hand that he argues has caused supporters to mistake rudeness for honesty and bad temperament for conviction.
but the public option is just single-payer in slow motion. it envisions paying doctors and hospitals rates similar to medicare's, which are about 40 percent less than those for private insurance.
when you do that, it sometimes puts you at odds with what is deemed pragmatic in washington, d.c., or 'the practical thing to do,' but i try to conduct at least a couple days of really listening every time i come back – especially if it's for a week or longer where i'm just listening to people. both the good and the bad. we're going to continue to try to get better, meadows said.

one conservative source told cnn that they viewed the seven-month window for the leadership race as a major advantage for conservatives in the house freedom caucus who might have time to organize and leverage themselves. the source told cnn that the right flank of the party might not put forth a candidate for speaker, but could do something like trade votes for speaker for assurances that one of their own would be placed in a leadership slot.
the sanders campaign said it would assess its path forward, and sanders instead focused all his efforts on the federal coronavirus response. he held virtual roundtables on the virus, arguing the global pandemic validated his call for a national government-run health care system, as well as massive federal spending to help the out-of-work and struggling.

schilling: oh sure they do. well, you heard them. i mean, hillary wanted hemispherical borders.
thanks to new media and trump's beautiful and bottomless audacity, hillary was not allowed to get away with posing as women's champion, not when her record of seeking to destroy her husband's victims is as well-documented as it is horrifying.
but what was true was the blitz biden's team was deploying outside of the beltway.
the reality, of course, is far more complicated. and it was readily apparent at this week's conservative political action conference. the gathering of students, activists and operatives featured a number of die-hard trump supporters, including those able to rationalize a principled support of the president, even after such a hypothetical shooting.
for that reason, we will soon begin the construction of a great wall along our southern border. it will be started ahead of schedule and, when finished, it will be a very effective weapon against drugs and crime.
i hope it will be dropped, she said.
spicer: most of them we have existing trade agreements with -- or a good chunk of them, we have existing trade agreements to -- to being with. this was an expansion of that, and some in areas, it allowed, whether it was the service industry, financial services, additional market access.
when it comes to the price of his book, at least used, we rate bush's statement as true.
the proposed platform marks biden's continued shift to the left, as the so-called moderate candidate — a label he has rejected — continues to be steered toward more radical positions to appeal to the party's base, offering revolutionary institutional changes.
rep. eric swalwell, trying to distinguish himself from the other candidates on gun issues, said he was the only person on stage who has voted and passed background checks.

inequality is at the root of america's existential crisis, kettl argues, and not only because it is higher here than in any of the world's other leading industrialized nations. income inequality among the states is growing, too, creating more polarization and more friction and rendering the united states a collection of states divided. with washington deadlocked, the states continue to go their own way in everything from infrastructure investments to obamacare implementation. their policy differences are increasingly driving the country apart.
he also devotes a chapter to the famous legislative district maps that allowed republicans to win a supermajority of the seats in the state assembly in 2012 despite receiving less than half the statewide vote for those offices. (a lawsuit challenging these maps made it to the u.s. supreme court this spring but was sent back down on a procedural issue.)
harris said it was hurtful to hear you talk about the reputations of two united states senators who built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country. biden responded by saying, i did not praise racists. harris didn't say he did. she said he talked about their reputations, and biden did say that he was able to work with them in a civil way to get things done in the senate, despite their political and personal differences.
and so i'm going to need a woman vice president who has the capacity, has strengths where i have weaknesses, biden said during remarks at the virtual fundraiser, according to the pool report.
it is the biggest job-killer in this country, cruz said. millions of americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work.

tuition reimbursement programs have been essentially ubiquitous at major employers for years. but those programs, which provide workers with money for tuition after they've already paid it, have relatively low participation rates and are typically geared towards white collar workers looking to improve their skill set, including through earning a graduate degree.
i will be back a lot because we're going to be fighting real hard for danny, and for adam, and for dean, trump said.
in his inaugural address, newsom promised sanctuary to all who seek it — a reference to california's status as a sanctuary state for illegal aliens that refuses to help enforce federal immigration law.
in the decade since the aca became law, many americans have become so accustomed to the protections and savings afforded by the landmark legislation that they may not realize how much could change if obamacare were struck down. its effects on health care are so pervasive that nearly every american could be affected, according to the kaiser family foundation, which tracks health care issues.

trump has also been checked by the courts on immigration as much as any other issue, including by gop-appointed judges, and his threat to claim emergency powers to build the wall would face certain legal challenges.

aetna said earlier this month that it was halting its exchange expansion plans for 2017 and reviewing its participation in president obama's signature health reform program. the company noted monday that it has lost $430 million in its individual policies unit since the exchanges opened in january 2014.
while the overall drug overdose death toll declined by 21 percent in the state between 2017 and 2018, deaths from fentanyl continue to rise. the senator has sponsored legislation to increase federal funding to help the hardest-hit areas of the country. since 2017, ohio has received $140 million from the federal government, but he said he knows it's not enough.

9:46 p.m. et clinton said that trump has repeatedly lied about not initially supporting the war in iraq even though that claim has been debunked.
she has such a complex and nuanced plan, clinton said after referencing her mother's record from when she was a new york senator. that's why paul krugman and others have said hers goes the farthest to regulate and rein in wall street and to increase the chance that we will never have 2008 ever again.

but when sanders walked onto the university of south carolina stage to the adulation of some 1,000 supporters waving medicare for y'all placards, it was clear that he had his share of supporters here. feeding on the crowd's energy, he dispensed with his detractors with a bit of gentle sarcasm.
and those same people are not resentful of white privilege. those same people are not resentful of the history, which frankly, many of them were taught not to know and worked very hard not to know of all of the litany of free stuff that was given by the government to create the white middle class. and so i do think it's related — the idea of resentment at some idea that somebody is getting something else and the way that we cling as americans to whatever our rung is on this brutal hierarchical ladder.

it's interesting that we have so many people in the conservative movement who write about legislation and political controversies every single day. as a matter of fact, here seems to be about 50 people writing on the same subject all day long, but very few people focus on pop culture, and pop culture is the dna of who we are, and we export that through the satellite dishes and in our dvds and your films and on the television screen and on film across the world, and if we don't alter that dna, if we don't try to inject in it our best qualities and not our worst qualities, our fate is in the hands of people who don't agree with us. … so we have to take them on using their skills. so that's the primary objective [of the site]. i'd say the secondary objective of the site is to create cover for those who exist in hollywood, right now, who actually are conservative or libertarian, or who consider themselves to be lieberman democrats or jfk liberals, people who don't necessarily relate to the current boutique leftism that seems to be intent on squelching any type of dissent, especially dissent that is right-of-center, and i believe the site will provide cover for those people.
the trump administration has been criticized for not doing as much as states like california to publicize these readily available backups. in response, administration officials say they have updated the healthcare.gov website to make it easier for consumers to find information on special sign-up periods.
the house judiciary committee's specialized task force will study the growing problem of executive overreach and will also look for solutions to prevent the executive branch from continuing to exceed its constitutional authority. it will be part of the task force's mission to study the impact the increase in presidential power has had on the ability of congress to conduct oversight of the executive branch, the lack of transparency that furthers unchecked executive power, and the constitutional requirement of the president to faithfully execute the law.

senate minority leader charles schumer reported the president said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years – a promise mr. trump confirmed at a press briefing later that day.
somersworth, n.h. -- former vice president joe biden cranked up the volume wednesday in his attacks against two of his top rivals for the democratic presidential nomination – sen. bernie sanders of vermont and former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg.
like aetna, a growing number of insurers on the obamacare exchanges are voicing concerns about the viability of the program as they run up big losses. many say that their premiums were too low and didn't cover the cost of care because their consumers are far sicker than anticipated.

there are only so many things you can do in that bill because of senate floor rules, reconciliation, ryan said. you can't put everything you want in that legislation, because if you did it would be filibustered, and you couldn't even bring it up for a vote in the senate.

ryan's challenges have included a politically explosive issue (health care), a tortuous multi-pronged legislative path (complicated by the senate's filibuster and budget rules), and the much heavier lift of forging a real-life replacement law rather than what ryan calls the fake opportunities to kill this law the party attempted when president obama was still in the white house.
we need to campaign among hispanic, black, asian, and gay americans and demonstrate we care about them, too, the report stated. america is changing demographically, and unless republicans are able to grow our appeal the way gop governors have done, the changes tilt the playing field even more in the democratic direction.

unlike in past recessions, most of those who lose their job-based coverage will be eligible for health coverage because of the affordable care act, though some may find coverage unaffordable even with subsidies, larry levitt, who runs health policy at kff, said in a statement. as unemployment benefits expire, however, about two million more people in states that did not expand their medicaid programs under the aca will move into the medicaid coverage gap and have no affordable option.

making it easier to see hospital prices and giving consumers more choices might or might not improve health care access at the margins, but it's not a substitute for the structure the affordable care act has put into place.
-- the district's virginia suburbs are different from other parts of the state, a fact that got its latest confirmation tuesday when the state senate debated knives. gregory s. schneider reports: sen. richard h. stuart sponsored a bill to make it legal to give dangerous knives to children. specifically, a switchblade, bowie knife or a dirk. several members said they had to look up that last one — it's a straight-bladed dagger wielded by scottish highlanders. virginia law already allows adults to give handguns to someone under age 18, as long as the child is a family member or it's for 'the purpose of engaging in a sporting event or activity.' it prohibits those types of knives, however, and stuart was proposing to change the language to mirror guns. sen. barbara a. favola (d-arlington) was aghast. 'this is just bad public policy,' she said, pointing out that the change would make it legal to give knives to toddlers. 'why would you want to put our children at risk?' 'i understand they may not do that in arlington county,' stuart said. but there's a whooooooole other part of rural virginia where they do do things like that.'
the medicaid expansion occurred only a few years prior; it was too early for studies to reliably determine the effect of medicaid expansion on clinical measures of health status and, certainly, too early to determine the impact on any long-term outcomes, mazurenko said.
senator bernie sanders opened eight new offices across the state this past weekend, according to the campaign. sanders now has 22 offices and over 133 staffers on the ground, both among the most of any campaign in iowa says bidar. the campaign also says it knocked on more than 11,000 doors in the last 48 hours, adding to the over 100,000 doors they have knocked since the launch of the campaign. this comes after congresswoman alexandria ocasio-cortez campaigned for sanders in iowa this month.
senate democrats have made the future of obamacare a focal point of their opposition to barrett's nomination, especially since the supreme court is set to hear a challenge to the obama-era healthcare law november 10, just seven day after the election.
while barrett's faith came up in her confirmation hearing for her federal judgeship, democrats steered clear of the topic on monday.
some health policy experts said the report, while not groundbreaking, did provide a blueprint for the trump administration to follow.
trump also turned a holiday concert that was supposed to salute service members and veterans into a tribute to himself, gloating that the fake media tried to stop us from going to the white house, but i'm president and they're not.
if republicans are searching for a conservatism that can work in the modern era, they should first stop lying to their own voters and look to examples such as britain's to bring their party into the world of facts and reality.
shapiro: yeah, i can hear that rumbling in the background.

via cbs news campaign reporter cara korte the big question in last month's debate for bernie sanders was how he would perform just a few weeks after his heart attack, a test he passed easily. since then, sanders has seen bumps in polling while warren has struggled.
the opioid epidemic had begun in the late 1990s when a generation of americans became addicted to prescription pain pills. after the government started to crack down on doctors, pain clinics, and drug manufacturers and distributors in the mid-2000s, addicts turned to heroin and then fentanyl.
the new coronavirus, sars-cov-2, stays in the upper respiratory tract. it can lodge itself deep within lungs.

obviously, obama said, that did not prove to be the case.
the largest single-day arrest count from the protests, however, came in september, when demonstrators -- many of whom, reuters reported, were in wheelchairs (most of them belonged to a disability rights group ) -- delayed a senate hearing. capitol police began rounding them up en masse.
then he decides to run for president the united states. the next thing you know, he's a reprobate. he's hitler. he's stalin. he's a thousand things that they say. isn't that what we all come up against? he came up against it. you came up against it. guys like me, we come up against it every single day. isn't it the effort to just destroy your reputation and your character if they can, rather than engage?
8. provide a public option toward universal health care. this idea was so radical ten years ago that democrats left it out of obamacare. but it is the beginning of medicare for all, which sanders wants to impose on everyone, and biden wants to offer as a choice (for now). there is no thought of achieving universal health care outside government, building on the recent reforms under the trump administration, such as tele-medicine — just more federal bureaucracy.
congressional republicans spent a good chunk of last year trying to repeal all or most of the affordable care act, for instance, which already dealt with the problems of people with pre-existing conditions being shut out of health coverage or charged exorbitant rates. against all evidence, these lawmakers constantly denied what they were doing, so we've seen this before.
but none of that would compare to knocking out the protections for people with pre-existing conditions, as this new lawsuit could do.

-- the top three senate republicans refused yesterday to disavow trump's false claim that millions cast ballots illegally. from the associated press's erica werner and lisa lerer: the comments from senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and his top lieutenants suggested that some leading republicans would rather follow trump into the realm of 'alternative facts' than confront the new chief executive. 'it does occur,' mcconnell told reporters at the capitol tuesday on the issue of election fraud. 'there are always arguments on both sides about how much, how frequent and all the rest. ... the notion that election fraud is a fiction is not true.' the no. 2 senate republican, john cornyn of texas, also passed up a chance to dispute trump's claim tuesday, saying 'i'm not going to re-litigate that. it's time to move on.' and the no. 3 senate republican, john thune, said he didn't know whether 3 million to 5 million votes were cast fraudulently, which would be larger than the population of all but the biggest u.s. cities [and especially his tiny home state of south dakota!], and did not happen. 'there's always a certain amount of irregularity that goes on in elections, some places perhaps more so than others. how you quantify that i'm not sure, but he must have his methodology,' thune said.
his populist rhetoric has not translated into better pay for less advantaged workers or victims of discrimination. he has sought to erase any sense of economic justice. he cares nothing about the appallingly low wage rates for those at the bottom or about the terrible living standards that these wages afford. and he has done nothing to support the eradication of statistical discrimination—racial, gender, and lgbt+.
martin: but up until now, donald trump has just essentially said trust me.

under the proposal, states could stay with the affordable care act, or they could receive a similar amount of federal money, which consumers could use to pay for medical care and health insurance. we are moving the locus of repeal to state government, mr. cassidy said. states should have the right to choose.
in a recent interview with msnbc's lawrence o'donnell, democratic frontrunner joe biden suggested he might veto a medicare for all bill if one were to land on his desk. however unlikely that scenario, the disconnect it highlights between biden and a large chunk of the electorate is shocking, and would hurt him in november. he may not end up needing the youth vote bernie has a near-monopoly on to secure the nomination, but he is going to need it if he wants to beat donald trump. that means making some concessions, and showing a willingness to make some enemies in the private sector.
asked about environmental policy, rubio said he has never supported cap-and-trade, a policy designed to drive down pollution by creating a regulated market for carbon emissions.

whether that is a reason for the u.k. to stay is another matter. but the very last thing obama should be accused of is populism.
he cares about the place of the institution in our constitutional structure, verrilli said. he cares deeply about maintaining the integrity of the court and the integrity of the judiciary as a vital part of our democratic system.
one hint to how the supreme court might vote on this case comes from justice brett kavanaugh, who in recent rulings indicated he supports the traditional notion of severability. that might suggest he's inclined to leave the rest of the affordable care act in place, even if he buys the argument that the mandate has now become unconstitutional.
yes, let's bring back denial of insurance coverage for pre-existing conditions, let more people die uninsured or forced to file bankruptcy because of medical bills. let's also not let students stay on their parents' plan, make them go without health insurance, have everyone go back to jamming up emergency rooms because they couldn't afford to go to a doctor and now their problem is an emergency. yes, obamacare has been just terrible! if your current insurance isn't affordable, blame president barack obama, not the greedy insurance companies.

in addition, cbo said, the proportion of americans without health insurance would rise even more dramatically ― by 18 million, which is roughly the number of people who have gotten coverage through the law, according to the most reliable estimates.
donald trump made a key promise during his presidential campaign to revise the nation's tax code while lowering taxes. however, upon closer examination of his recently released tax proposal, certain groups will benefit, while others may suffer economic harm.
inhofe and feinstein, too - ny post: two more senators made hefty stock sales before the coronavirus pandemic tanked global markets, records revealed as two other lawmakers who dumped millions in shares faced mounting calls to resign. sens. dianne feinstein and jim inhofe sold as much as $6.4 million worth of stock in the weeks before panic about the coronavirus sparked a worldwide selloff, according to disclosure filings… feinstein, a california democrat, sold $500,001 to $1 million worth of stock in a company called allogene therapeutics on jan. 31, less than a month before panic about the virus caused markets to plunge, senate records show. her husband sold $1,000,001 to $5 million worth of allogene shares on feb. 18, according to financial disclosures. and inhofe, an oklahoma republican, dumped as much as $400,000 worth of stock on jan. 27, records show. he sold shares in five different companies including apple, paypal and brookfield asset management, according to a disclosure report.
less than 24 hours before, trump had issued an ultimatum to the house, demanding a vote on what both he and republican leaders had identified as a top legislative priority ― and threatening to move on to other legislative items if they refused.
as president donald trump continues to make clear that he wants to kill the affordable care act, new research suggests that a big part of the aca – the expansion of the medicaid program – was linked with fewer cardiovascular-related deaths in counties where expansion took place.
what someone promises to do doesn't mean a whole lot, huffmon said. now primary voters tend to be more educated on the issues, and more passionate, but a lot of voters do retrospective voting. in the past they judged obama as good, and that's who they trusted and biden is linked to him.

i know jonathan's (ph) a stickler for that.
before the affordable care act, it already was illegal for health insurance companies to reject customers with pre-existing conditions or charge them more based on their medical histories if they got coverage through a group plan, like from an employer. and insurers and employers are limited in how much they could refuse to pay for treatments related to a pre-existing condition for group policyholders. the affordable care act extended similar protections to people who buy their health insurance directly or via the exchanges the law created.
joe biden lapped the field with 48 percent of the vote, winning every single county in the state, crushing bernie sanders by more than a 2-1 margin, with everyone else trailing badly. biden's big win helped him close the delegate gap considerably with sanders. it's very close.

even casual students of history have heard of robert la follette, champion of the common man and longtime statewide hero. the original fighting bob served as governor, senator and presidential candidate in the early 20th century and remains a beacon to progressives today. some also know that milwaukee routinely elected socialist mayors for nearly half a century.

the report showed that only 4% of employers with at least 50 employees said they shifted some staffers to part-time hours so they wouldn't qualify for health care, and another 4% said they were reducing the number of full-time employees they planned to hire because of the cost of health benefits. kaiser found that 10% of employers reported that they were changing workers from part-time to full-time status to enable them to obtain coverage.
there was ostensibly democratic support for all of those provisions, but the vast majority of democrats oppose the stopgap because of the ongoing inability to reach a bipartisan immigration deal. democrats are also withholding support for a longer-term spending deal until an immigration deal is clinched.

block: now we drive past an empty swath of land the size of 80 football fields. our tour guide is democratic state senator bob wirch. back in the day, he worked at another factory here that's long gone, american brass.
the pressure trump exerted on the mexican government this past summer to stop central americans traveling through the country on the way to the u.s. to claim asylum was a key factor in the drop. mexico deployed its national guard and has vastly increased the number of central american migrants it apprehends and deports.
i mean, if you look at all of these programs that are trying to make up for either no work or inadequate paying work as companies outsource their labor costs on us, the taxpayers, booker said, those programs alone are worth billions and billions of dollars.

house speaker ryan said that he couldn't be happier that mitt romney will run for the u.s. senate seat.
-- while trump's claims of voter fraud are certainly newsworthy, they are also a distraction from an aggressive effort by this new white house to quickly transform the government and dramatically change the direction of public policy in ways that will directly impact tens of millions of americans.
i believe it's going to be terminated, whether it be through the texas case, which is going through the court system as a victory right now, because of, you know, the various elements of that case. you would think it would have to be terminated, trump said in a recent interview with the new york times.
i personally expect clinton to win and that she'll basically keep the bush/obama/republican-democrat regime status quo intact with all the corruption, corporatism and wall street-controlled government that comes with it. that doesn't necessarily mean smooth sailing for the stock market and the economy either. and then the republicans will claim they're worried about socialism, and the show will go on. if trump wins, i'd expect we'll see much of the same status quo mentioned above.
and then there would be effects that have nothing to do with health insurance. the law is the reason that restaurant chains must post calorie counts on their menus, for example. it modified the indian health service and changed the approval process for so-called biosimilar drugs.
you're going to actually undermine the private economy that's needed to pay those bills. so it doesn't really add up, he added.
spicer: ok. two questions. let me start with the latter first. as you know, we hit the ground running on day one. there was a lot to do and we had done a lot of work on the website to make sure that we were prepared to get as much information up as fast as possible. we are continuing to build out the website, both in the issue areas and then that area. but we've got the i.t. folks working overtime right to continue to get all of that up to speed. and trust me, it's just going to take a little bit more time, but we're working piece by piece to get that done.
the truth is that, like in so many other areas, trump doesn't want to do the work. after all, as trump once said, health care is complicated! who needs the headache when there are people of color to insult and golf to play?
we're all immigrants, you know. i just want these people here to be legal. unfortunately, there's a lot of american people who don't want to work, you know, who are abusing the welfare system and we can't get people from mexico who come up here and they want to work and they do the work. so i don't want us to shut off from other countries.
but kaufman is not satisfied with blaming the people's anger alone for what has happened in wisconsin. he explores other more deliberate and systemic factors that dragged down clinton and other democrats in recent election cycles.
not a very convincing performance. is there any other amendment to the constitution the president would downplay in this way? saying, it's there written on the paper would be an odd, dismissive comment from someone announcing plans to tighten up the 1st or 5th amendment.

the facts: in discussing moving the u.s. embassy from tel aviv to jerusalem, trump conflates the alleged estimated cost ($1 billion) of building a new u.s. embassy in jerusalem with the actual cost (less than $400,000) of renovating existing space for the interim embassy that opened in may. the interim embassy will be temporary; the state department still intends to build a permanent facility.

a central goal of the mainstream conservative establishment (of which the national review is a part) has been to stunt and roll back the size and influence of government, with the welfare state right in the crosshairs. but to the chagrin of the republican brass, trump's vocal support for some types of social safety nets that conservatives are supposed to disdain — claiming, for example, that he would replace obamacare with a single-payer health care system — hasn't repulsed the downscale rank and file.
for the first time in history, a congressional committee will be hearing from experts on why every american should have access to quality, affordable healthcare, sponsor of the medicare for all legislation rep. pramila jayapal (d-wash.) said in a statement. this hearing will continue the momentum for this deeply important issue ― an issue that people have literally been dying over while waiting for congress to resolve ― and will surely be a catalyst for more action to come.
spicer: well, i think - i think he's going to meet with his team and figure out what policies are best for the environment but i think that there's - one of the things that he talked about during the campaign is there's a balance and he's trying to make sure that we use our resources appropriately, that we maximize things to make sure that we don't do so at the detriment of economic growth and job creation.
the cbo is now expecting enrollment to max out at 19 million in 2019.
when it comes to medicaid, trump once again floats huge spending reductions as compared to current law, though it's hard to decipher the exact amount since some are interconnected. but the budget also serves as a menu of longtime republican visions for the program, including repealing medicaid expansion and obamacare subsidies and giving states a fixed sum of money, known as a block grant, instead.
san francisco – newly minted california gov. gavin newsom doubled down tuesday on his mission to resist white house policies that he says run counter to the interests of his state – and in his view, the nation.
as the race for the democratic nomination tightens in the early voting states of iowa and new hampshire, clinton and sanders are dueling over competing visions for expanding health-care coverage. clinton says sanders would undo a decade's worth of democratic work to expand benefits via obamacare by pushing a plan that is unworkable and would never pass congress.
kyung lah, cnn national correspondent: well, dana, everything that we have been told by people who are in touch with the family is that they still do not have confirmation. they do not know the status of their daughter.
during the pandemic, several governors asked the trump administration to reopen the federal obamacare marketplace for a special enrollment period.

white house press secretary jen psaki declined to estimate how many people might take advantage of the opportunity.
the facts: trump appeared to be referring to an outdated report by the federation for american immigration reform, a group that advocates against illegal immigration. the 2012 report estimated that unauthorized immigrants cost arizona $2.4 billion, estimating arizona's 2010 undocumented population at 390,000.
the cost of putting food on the table also eased after a big runup in the previous year. food prices rose just 0.8% in 2015 — the smallest gain since 2009 — with most of the increase coming early on. prices had jumped 3.4% in 2014.

i believe that right now this is not a matter of democrat or republican, james told host katie pavlich. it's a matter of policies that work and policies that don't. it's a matter of what is best for our children and what is not.
so i look at the racialized history of our unique-among-advanced-economies unwillingness to provide universal health care, and it's just overwhelming, the evidence. from the very beginning, truman tried to have a national health insurance plan. the segregationist dixiecrats in his party opposed it. and then, of course, to obamacare and medicaid expansion. i actually didn't realize until i began researching the book that white americans are pretty vehemently opposed to obamacare and have been. support for it has never reached over 50 percent. it's still an unpopular plan among white americans, even though if you break down the individual policies, white americans are supportive of it. but if you think about medicaid expansion, which is still a fraught battle — we still have a dozen states that have refused to expand medicaid. and as soon as, not incidentally, a states' rights theory was used to knock down the medicaid expansion that should have been universal across 50 states, you had a new mason-dixon line of states mostly in the old confederacy that refused to expand medicaid. and i looked at a bunch of the research that really showed the racialization of health care opinion, and i go to texas, which is the state with the highest uninsured in the population. it is the state with the highest number of rural hospital closings. and these are hospitals that are the lifeblood of these mostly rural, conservative, largely white towns, and they are closing.
mr. biden vowed during the 2020 presidential campaign to preserve and expand the affordable care act, which he helped shepherd through congress while serving as vice president. in addition to the special enrollment period, the centers for medicare and medicaid services announced friday it is launching an education campaign that begins today focusing on increasing awareness of the added time to sign up for coverage, as well as the assistance available to those who qualify to pay for premiums.
as the first alarms sounded in early january that an outbreak of a novel coronavirus in china might ignite a global pandemic, the trump administration squandered nearly two months that could have been used to bolster the federal stockpile of critically needed medical supplies and equipment. a review of federal purchasing contracts by the associated press shows federal agencies waited until mid-march to begin placing bulk orders of n95 respirator masks, mechanical ventilators and other equipment needed by front-line health care workers. … we basically wasted two months, kathleen sebelius, health and human services secretary during the obama administration, told ap.
the cruz-endorsed keep the promise i group, moved monday in two 30-second advertisements to paint trump as politically opportunistic. the new spot, extreme, uses the trump interview with meet the press host tim russert. a second keep the promise spot, which was already being shown to voters on digital platforms, uses trump praising cruz as a conservative fighter.

ouch: the national archives admitted it made numerous changes to a photo of the 2017 women's march showcased at the national archives exhibit celebrating the centennial of women's suffrage.
in some states, cuts would happen automatically because the executive actions or laws authorizing expansion call for restoring the pre-expansion eligibility standards if the extra federal funds stop flowing.
biden is doing the same: posing as above-it-all, refusing to engage his opponents, already fighting a general election campaign against trump, and watching matlock instead of hustling.
we did get input from ice. i actually met with a gentleman named chris crane, he's the president of the union for the ice agents. we met for about an hour, an hour and a half… his frustration, and the frustration of many ice agents, is that they're not being allowed to enforce the law… these are valid points that we've heard… we have taken their input, we continue to seek their input. and i have nothing but the highest respect for the men and women who are on the front lines of trying to enforce our laws even though sometimes the politicians get in the way.
news you can use if you live in d.c.:
in his dec. 27 op-ed, my new year's wish for trump: respect the haters, too, gary abernathy demonstrated the vacuity of the reasons for the continued support of president trump. he wrote, i want trump to continue to 'drain the swamp,' enforce immigration laws, undo obamacare, cut costly regulation, put america first and even criticize journalists when their zeal to be the first to break unfavorable news about him results in inaccurate or poorly vetted stories. mr. abernathy expounded empty slogans, not material policies, slogans that ignite the amygdala of the human brain rather than stimulate the reasoning functions of the frontal lobe.
another problem is the illicit use of drugs intended to treat drug addiction, notably suboxone. the attorney general of kentucky is quoted declaring that wrongful prescribing of suboxone is flooding our communities with yet another drug that is killing our children.
the standard deduction will double, affecting all taxpayers. as the law now stands, single individuals can deduct $6,350 from their taxable income while married couples deduct $12,700. trump proposes that individuals will deduct $12,700 while married couples can write off $25,400. the proposed benefits are that average taxpayers will pay less taxes if they do not have itemized deductions and simplify tax return preparation without the use of an accountant or preparer.
on wednesday night in atlanta at the fifth democratic presidential debate, candidates will likely be asked to respond to comments former president obama made on friday cautioning against radical change. during an interview with stacey abrams, mr. obama said, this is still a country that is less revolutionary than it is interested in improvement. they like seeing things improved, but the average american doesn't think we have to completely tear down the system and remake it.
some of his supporters lauded his signature approach.
-- some landowners along the border are gearing up to fight the government's planned construction of the wall. the ap's nomaan merchant reports: congress in march funded 33 miles (53 kilometers) of walls and fencing in texas. the government has laid out plans that would cut across private land in the rio grande valley. those in the way include landowners who have lived in the valley for generations, environmental groups and a 19th century chapel. many have hired lawyers who are preparing to fight the government if, as expected, it moves to seize their land through eminent domain.
what trump said: trump said his administration had reduced illegal border crossings for eight straight months in a row. he said illegal crossings are down 75% since last spring, and january saw the fewest illegal crossings in two years.
in 1994, she claimed that hillary clinton's health care reform plan would bar people from purchasing care outside the new clinton system, which would cruelly ration treatments to curb costs. it wasn't true. the magazine that published the article would later disavow it.

her announcement wednesday that she will try to stay new england's only republican u.s. senator comes hours before the house is poised to impeach the president on charges that he obstructed congress and abused power. that move would set up a january trial in the republican-controlled senate, a process that is expected to acquit trump.

the associated press accused the trump administration of having wasted months in the fight against coronavirus on sunday morning, claiming that federal contracts for needed medical supplies were only made in mid-march.
rubio claimed his bill transformed our immigration system from family-based to merit-based, schlafly writes, yet this too was not true: despite making the merit-based system one of his central selling points, the bill substantially increased chain migration, schlafly explained.
trump both restored and expanded that policy, which was started by the reagan administration and has been turned off and on again depending on whether a democrat or republican holds the white house. critics call it the global gag rule.
bash: should the u.s. be responsible for going and rescuing hostages who are going, even though the u.s. state department says it's just too dangerous?
that's insulting. i disagree with corker often, but i won't let his independence from trump make him a rino. after all, trump isn't a conservative. i asked for a senator more principled on the national debt and you sent me ranking by a libertarian think tank. — weston wamp (@westonwamp) september 18, 2018
turley: well, megyn, we're waiting for the details, but what i'm hearing certainly causes great concern that he will again violate separation of powers. supreme court has already ruled that this president has violated the separation of powers. they just took another case a week ago in the aca obamacare area about whether he had another violation in that area.

at least four democrats are expected to face off to win their party's nomination in order to face collins in november 2020. collins will enter the race with an $8.6 million reelection war chest, and she is running television ads statewide portraying herself as an independent, bipartisan senator.
a spokesman with the u.s. department of agriculture, which oversees snap, declined to comment.
the epidemic was a key issue in important swing states. the journal of the american medical association found a correlation between chronic use of prescription painkillers and regions that supported trump. medicare reimbursements for opioid prescriptions also documented the epidemic's disproportionate impact on areas where trump polled well.
biden does not support defunding the police. biden has actually proposed increased federal funding for police departments to hire additional officers, while trump has proposed cutting federal funds for local departments in each of the budgets of his presidency.
via cbs news campaign reporter jack turman south bend mayor pete buttigieg drew sharp contrasts with his progressive competitors, elizabeth warren and bernie sanders, on health care in the last debate. in contrast to warren and sanders' embrace of medicare for all, which would eliminate most private insurance plans, buttigieg's health care plan calls for a public option and does not eliminate private insurance plans.
he also spoke at length about the necessity of humility. part of being a good judge, he said, is don't be a jerk.
trump has said one of his top priorities as president is to repeal and replace obamacare, but senate democrats could make an outright repeal tough. trump says he'll consider keeping two popular provisions, a requirement that insurers cover people with existing conditions and another that lets children stay on their parents' policies until age 26.
trippi: a partisan from either party who is in a marginal district and lashes out at the other side is likely to hurt themselves with these voters. how is this candidate not going to add to the chaos and hostility in washington? how is this candidate going to get anything done for me?

jonathan capehart: i mean, one could argue that when president [barack] obama came into office, he was laser-focused on getting health care to as many people as possible. and obamacare passed, but those republicans, no republican voted for it in the house. i'm having a hard time seeing how you're going to break the fever that president obama thought he was going to do in 2012 simply by your election. how are you going to convince the americans who are literally willing to die or or stay in dire economic circumstances simply because policies that you'd want to put into place and others want to put into place would benefit someone else?
if they put everyone on medicare, we seniors will be next in the line for bullet in the head… because they can't afford medicare for everyone… it would not work, greenstreet said.
the new york times admitted wednesday that former vice president joe biden is not pivoting toward the center, as most candidates do when they have secured their party's nomination. rather, he is moving to the left — toward embracing what the times refers to as systemic disruption.

the vote would bring maine, which has been hit hard by the heroin epidemic, in line with 31 other states that have expanded their state programs. an estimated 80,000 maine residents will qualify.
they need to recast the dominant narrative as a tool of the plutocrats, as a tool that stops us from joining together across lines of race to do what we can only do together and what we can't do alone — things like adequately fund our infrastructure and our schools, things like tackle climate change, things like rewrite our trade laws to make sure that every american who wants one has a decent job. and it's really important to not ignore just how profoundly racialized the story of the american economy and government is and has been for all of our history. so if you try to bring colorblind tools to convince people about their economic self-interest while ignoring just how profoundly racialized the economic story is, you just won't succeed. [music playing]
but the approach taken by bernie and other progressives was so extreme – demanding the end of private insurance – that, rather than galvanizing support for democrats, it fractured the party. astonishingly, the candidates who jumped aboard single-payer health care never stopped to think about how their plan would impact union workers, who would be the group most opposed to ending private insurance.
the washington post reported on tuesday that pacronym is planning to spend $5 million on ads attacking trump's response to the pandemic. that pac is affiliated with the new venture fund and acronym, whose board includes former obama adviser david plouffe. the ads will target five swing states (michigan, wisconsin, pennsylvania, north carolina, and arizona) and run on major digital platforms like facebook.

in fact, some of his supposed accomplishments further give the lie to his claim that he supports protections for preexisting conditions. the trump administration has expanded access to several kinds of health insurance that aren't available to people with preexisting conditions, like short-term health plans.

this is all bad enough. but here's the real rub: there's no reason to believe such an outcome would actually force democrats to cooperate on health reform on the gop's terms.
a guilty plea and promise of cooperation from the president's former national security adviser makes it difficult to challenge mueller from a productivity standpoint.

more moderate members, many of them from democratic-leaning states and states that used affordable care act money to expand medicaid, worried that the bill would take away insurance coverage from too many people ― and that, if premiums really did come down, they would do so only by increasing out-of-pocket costs for people who held on to their coverage.

block: he smiles and wiggles his 10 fingers. new business has come to kenosha county. a gigantic amazon fulfillment center sprawls alongside the interstate. but those thousand-plus jobs are non-union. and senator wirch has seen wisconsin unions take a pounding. last year, republican governor scott walker signed a bill making wisconsin a right-to-work state. and earlier, he pushed through controversial legislation that ended collective bargaining for public sector workers. wirch says those measures and the decline of industry here have hurt democrats at the ballot box.
but conservative republicans have never recognized that distinction as meaningful. they say the affordable care act violates the hyde amendment, which prohibits federal funding of abortion. the alexander-collins proposal would essentially outlaw the existing arrangement, leaving potentially millions of women without a way to get insurance that covers abortion.

as a matter of simple math, mulvaney is wrong. far more people — twice as many — gained under the affordable care act than paid a penalty. we're not sure why mulvaney would have such a limited understanding of the impact of the law, but it may have started with his misimpression that tens of millions of people were paying a fine. that's totally off base, too.

and what about his candidacy so far, if anything, has given you any reservations, given you pause?
joe biden's running mate also criticized trump and the republican-led senate's decision to ignore the late liberal supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg's final wish to hold off the nomination to replace her until after the next president is chosen — and asked voters to make them pay on nov. 3.
instead of blaming president obama and the democrats or thinking that misplaced risks and inaccurate enrollment predictions are the problem, maybe some of those ceos earning $10-$15 million dollars per year should stop whining about not making enough profits and start finding ways to help fellow human beings survive and thrive... maybe even human beings who aren't white.
spicer: i think we've always had that special relationship with britain. and -- and he's gonna -- and that reflects in -- in his first visits -- the prime minister's first visit here. he's had a great conversation with her and he looks forward to having her here. but we can always be closer.
another piece of evidence suggesting that trump and his aides want to do more for working-class taxpayers is that the white house is looking for a new direction on child care.
private insurance, however, would continue to be an option. large employers could keep providing benefits, though they can also help their workers buy medicare for america coverage. employees can also choose medicare for america coverage over their work-based plan. and folks could opt to buy private policies through a medicare advantage-type plan or decide to keep their children on their work-based polices.
biden was already the most left-wing frontrunner in u.s. electoral history. now he has adopted the rhetoric of the far left as well, calling the coronavirus an opportunity to fundamentally transform the country.
it stands in sharp contrast to the multi-group, multi-million dollar efforts put together by democrats as they sought to sink former president donald trump's top legislative priority -- the repeal and replacement of obamacare in 2017.
«todos dicen que trump va a ganar mañana. solo suponemos que vamos a quedar empatados», le dijo trump a sus partidarios el lunes por la noche.
caucus members also care about delivering what they think their constituents want. they often justify their tactics as ways to keep their campaign promises, as meadows did when he encouraged a possible shutdown in contrast with politicians who forget what they promised the american people. and caucus members have long believed that public conflict — like shutting down the federal government — is a strong negotiation tactic and a valuable way to show voters their commitment to policy.
many were shocked by ryan's announcement wednesday morning. while the growing belief was that ryan would step down after the midterms, few expected the speaker – a fundraising powerhouse – to announce he was stepping down before the midterms were over.

some 20 million americans could lose their health coverage and protections for people with preexisting health conditions also would be put at risk if the court agrees with the administration in a case that won't be heard before the fall.
brian harrison, the former hhs chief of staff, this week unveiled his campaign for congress in texas' sixth congressional district. catherine bird, who worked closely with harrison in senior hhs roles, is pitching in on the campaign.
that policy continues to be a lightning rod for national criticism after the murder last month of corporal ronil singh, a legal immigrant and police officer who was allegedly shot and killed by an illegal alien during a traffic stop.
shutdowns are usually the product of divided government, but this likely shutdown would be the first time one occurred when the same party controlled both chambers of congress and the white house.
cooper: the thing that she has, the part of the obama coalition she has in other states, because there is not as big an african-american population, is african-americans in south carolina and elsewhere, as we have talked about. the question is young people.

in 2018, when the 7th circuit weighed whether the full court should rehear a case involving a challenge to an indiana abortion law that requires fetal remains to be cremated or buried after an abortion, barrett joined a dissent from the denial of rehearing en banc authored by judge frank easterbrook. in his dissent, easterbrook took issue with a panel decision striking down a different statute that prohibits abortion based on sex, race or disability.

according to data provided by the department of justice, the vast majority of individuals convicted for terrorism-related offenses since 9/11 came here from outside of our country. we have seen the attacks at home — from boston to san bernardino to the pentagon and yes, even the world trade center.
if they've been diligent about repaying their debt, after 20 years the balance of their loans will be forgiven.
he's a very confused guy, biden said. he thinks he's running against somebody else. he's running against joe biden. i beat all those other people because i disagree with them.
nudo: nudo likes trump's hard line on illegal immigration, calls obamacare bad news, thinks hillary clinton should be in jail.
and a significant degree of the closure is because of unpaid bills by people who should be eligible for medicaid. but the texas political class — the overwhelmingly white, overwhelmingly male political class in texas is absolutely opposed to expanding medicaid. and the idea that i heard from the advocates on the ground was that the idea of medicaid has become a dog whistle for black people. even the latino community in texas — there were many people who said, it's not something we want, because after 40 years of being told that public benefits are only for degraded poor people, you don't want any part of that. admitting that you need medicaid is admitting that you were on the bottom of this social hierarchy that you're going to work like hell to rise above.
people living in sparsely populated areas who shopped for coverage on the obamacare exchanges in 2017 frequently had just one or two insurers from which to pick and often faced significantly higher premiums than did people in more urban areas, according to a new study.

in 2010, lewis was at the center of another alleged racial hoax, when several democratic members of the congressional black caucus claimed that tea party protesters had shouted the n-word at him as he walked through their demonstration on the weekend that congress was voting on obamacare. the claim, widely repeated throughout the media and used to malign the tea party as racist, was never substantiated.

in political terms, barrett is the dream candidate for conservative republicans and the nightmare candidate for democrats.
for trump's true believers, it is precisely that bulldog nature that makes him such a draw. standing outside the hotel where the conference was held, nigel farage ― the former leader of the u.k. independence party, brexit champion and closest approximation to trump that england can offer ― scoffed at a query about what trump might do to possibly disappoint.

hours before the town hall, trump took his trademarked parting shots at warren and mike bloomberg, whom trump likened to an incompetent, undersized darth vader-style character from the 1987 parody spaceballs.
in february 2018, the senate's gop majority leader, mitch mcconnell, helped gop and democratic senators vote down trump's four pillars immigration reform plan. in the summer of 2018, house speaker ryan helped block a matching reform in the house which was drafted by rep. bob goodlatte, the chairman of the house judiciary committee.
earlier this year, a federal judge ruled that subsidies designed to cut the costs in some policies are illegal. that's because congress didn't appropriate money for the payments which go to health insurers. dropping the appeal would leave the court ruling in place.
this was one of trump's trademark little exaggerations of accomplishments that need no exaggeration. the decline in overdose deaths in 2018 was the first since 1990 , 28 years prior.
spicer: no, it's not, and sometimes we'll make mistakes. i promise you that. but it's not always got to be negative, jim. some days, we do do the right thing. some days we are successful. so it's not -- part of us is saying, when we're right, say we're right. when we're wrong, say we're wrong. but it's not always wrong and negative. there are things -- there's a lot of things that he's done already, a lot of amazing people that he's appointed, a lot of success that he's having.
the situation now is more decentralized, more diffuse, and frankly more complex, in that terrorist organizations such as isil or al qaeda in the arabian peninsula use the internet, use social media to communicate and to inspire acts of terrorism in individuals' home countries.
a short film of racially diverse residents of new york city's public housing system denounced the incompetence of democratic mayor bill de blasio. one speaker even denounced democrats for putting illegal immigrants before black americans.
over the past year or so, thousands of people have become eligible to attend college at low or no-cost — and that's not thanks to a new government policy or a sudden drop in tuition levels.

we've had to live through some of the worst things, but we fought a civil war to end slavery. nobody else did that. almost a million we're killed in a conflict to eliminate slavery. we have scars of the past, but those scars of the past, that's why we are where we are and there's -- i've been -- i've got to tell you, i've been wanting to get in front of you and ask you this question for the longest time.
while biden and sanders did release a platform to ensure universal health care, it is not sanders' medicare for all plan. the platform recommends an affordable and government-run public option health care plan to be made available through the obamacare exchanges.
they feel good. they're looking at the indicators. they're looking at the polls over time here in the last couple of weeks. and they feel like the numbers are on their side. they feel like they have done everything they can when it comes to organizing, when it comes to getting people out to caucus. but so many of them also remember back to 2008.
as daca illegal aliens can remain in the u.s. for the time being, escaping deportation once again, the pro-mass immigration billionaire gop megadonors the koch brothers have started a campaign to demand the republican-controlled congress and president trump sign off on an amnesty for millions of illegal aliens.
rachel martin, byline: donald trump has been favoring a lot of so-called disrupters in his cabinet appointments. a couple of them stand out. rick perry as the man to lead the department of energy - he's someone who's advocated shutting the agency down. scott pruitt has been tapped to lead the epa - pruitt at odds with the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change. he's repeatedly sued to weaken epa regulations. what is donald trump's message in these two particular appointments?
but it's also a message that would be heard by our enemies, nations like iran, who are looking at the weakness of this administration and viewing it as an invitation for them to move even faster towards acquiring nuclear weapons.
trump wants to get rid of that obamacare penalty almost immediately, because that is something that is really strangling a lot of americans, to have to pay a penalty for not buying government-run health care, she said on abc's this week.

geist said, [t]his obamacare story, about premiums going up 25% in certain plans, 22% in other plans, and choice shrinking, all things predicted by conservatives many years ago.
$15 minimum wage: probably not. mandates have a speckled history in reconciliation in general and even then the size of a minimum wage hike on the federal budget would likely make it too small to be more than merely incidental. a broader analysis of its economic impact could show a larger effect but that would be similar to republicans' failed effort to use dynamic scoring to show a smaller revenue loss from tax cuts in 2017.
trump may be making progress on lowering the cost of prescription drugs, but right now, that's hard to measure. there has been no substantial or sustained decrease in drug prices under the trump administration, robertson said, and high drug prices remain a persistent problem for americans and a top priority for candidates in the 2020 presidential race.

bagley said the brief reveals the depth of institutional decay at the department of justice, and he expressed profound concern about the precedent it sets. it suggests that future administrations can pick and choose which laws they're going to enforce, he said.
short-term health insurance plans were originally designed to be used for just several months — to tide people over between the end of schooling and the start of a new job, for instance. since then, the trump administration has promoted these plans, and their more affordable monthly premiums, as good long-term alternatives.
i've said from day one that i want to get to yes, cruz said. the consequences would be terrible to fail. yet cruz also promised not to pass a watered-down bill: even worse than not passing a bill is passing a bill that makes the problems worse.
sanders, por su parte, estuvo mucho más cómodo en el ataque a clinton que en sus anteriores encuentros, y la noche en charleston, carolina del sur, fue notable más por sus enfrentamientos personales que por los ataques contra los republicanos. él se defendió de clinton insistiendo en que obama era su amigo y le dio un golpe a la precandidata por sus relaciones con wall street desde que dejó el departamento de estado.
clinton added that trump has made brutal kinds of comments about not only women, but all kinds of americans.

that's what they call phase one of this operation, to contain isis within that city. phase two will be hard. it will be dislodging isis from that city. the kurdish fighters say they will be ready to take part. the time frame is not yet clear. some u.s. officials have suggested it could be as early as april. kurdish officials think it's going to be longer than that.
when i got into uc berkeley, i immediately saw the path for me, marlow remarked, which is that i had to go to uc berkeley because of their politics, because of their reputation as not just being extremely left, but being the home of the free speech movement. … a lot of people at harvard westlake were decrying big classes. they wanted you to have a … hands-on, small, touchy-feely environment. i didn't like that as much. i liked the idea of a big sprawling diverse campus — but diverse in terms of ideas — and i liked the history of the leftism. i thought that would be a challenge. i wanted to see it. i wanted to go inside the belly of the beast.
it is quite infuriating to read about how all the insurance companies are losing money, when we rarely, if ever, have utilized our many insurance plans over the years, says brodie, who has a form of chronic arthritis that she would like treated. those insurance companies have made nearly 100% profit on us, while we got either zero benefits or zero access to the system.

when insurance companies face uncertainty, they increase premiums, levitt tweeted thursday night.
those on the left, meanwhile, pointed to romney's past statements seemingly in support of a federal mandate, including a 1994 statement that he would back a federal bill that included a mandate. in 2007, romney said that once states try out their own plans, we'll end up with a nation that's taken a mandate approach.
between september and december 2017, an additional 9,940 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. samantha huntley, 20, a tanning salon employee from springfield, mo., was one of them.
republicans concede that if they win the white house, simply repealing the law will no longer be sufficient. republicans in congress have yet to offer a comprehensive replacement for the law. instead, much of their focus, beyond the health care law, has been on attacking planned parenthood.
psaki said the white house will work to explain the provisions to americans in the jargon-free way biden prefers.
in an interview with siriusxm's breitbart news tonight, gosar told breitbart news senior editor-at-large, rebecca mansour, that his latest legislation, the criminal alien removal clarification act, should be part of a strategy by the gop leadership, headed by house speaker paul ryan.
just before sitting down to lunch with mcconnell earlier monday, trump said he understands the frustration behind bannon's mission.
similarly, republicans who oppose trump or cruz say they would write off the party, but likely only until the next election.
sen. doug jones, d-ala., is behind the bill. he says expanding medicaid would help protect everyone in these uncertain times.
the public option would be offered with no premiums to americans who live in states that don't have access to medicaid benefits that they would qualify for in other states.
ninety percent of the heroin in america comes from our southern border, where, eventually, the democrats will agree with us, and we'll build the wall to keep the damn drugs out, he said.
president donald trump was famously not invited to the memorial service of sen. john mccain, which took place saturday at the national cathedral in washington. the president's daughter ivanka trump and son-in-law jared kushner were in attendance, however.
in the last congress, both parties came together to pass unprecedented legislation to confront the opioid crisis, a sweeping new farm bill, historic va reforms, and after four decades of rejection, we passed va accountability so we can finally terminate those who mistreat our wonderful veterans.

the agency, gradually, is getting through the pile. hhs tells foxnews.com that as of mid-july, they've processed 650,000 cases – and have about 550,000 left to go.
we strongly support nato, an alliance forged through the bonds of two world wars that dethroned fascism, and a cold war that defeated communism.
the speech jumped around from attack to attack ― hitting biden for being weak on china, then for becoming allied with progressive sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.), then back to being weak on china, then to his support for late-term abortion, then back to biden being a trojan horse for socialists ― without sticking to any one cohesive theme.
some states will keep working to expand coverage to the uninsured and keep it affordable and adequate, [and] in other states we'll see a race to deregulate, with the result that comprehensive coverage will be more expensive for those who need it most, sabrina corlette, a research professor at georgetown university, said.
if you haven't watched speaker ryan's remarks yet, i highly recommend it, barnwell-hagemeyer wrote. this is what conservatism is about, this is what the republican party stands for, and these are the ideas we must fight for.
trump's economic team feels that cutting taxes will help the american economy in order to reach their goal of 4 percent gdp growth. but the plan has some potential problems that outweigh the intended benefits.
but at the same time, she was flushed and her heart rate was sped up and she felt these butterflies in her stomach, and so she thought, i must be wrong. there must be some real primal connection here. but it just turned out she had food poisoning. her brain had a story, a metaphor. it knew how to apply to those sensory feelings. and so then it got what those feelings met wrong. our brains are prediction machines, and sometimes they predict incorrectly. something that i took from this conversation with heather is that the same thing happens on a societal level. if we grow up in a society cut up by racism, told again and again that our relationships, our policies are zero-sum, that if those people over there are going to progress, it's going to come at our expense, that metaphor will lodge in us. we'll become used to interpreting the data of this world in a zero-sum way. and so a society that needs to tell that zero-sum story again and again and again to justify racial hierarchy and oppression, to justify ill-gotten gains, will also become used to seeing the world through that lens. and so we will deprive ourselves — all of us — of so many opportunities to advance together, because we are so used to fearing that any other group's gain will mean our loss.
all national security and military personnel deemed essential would continue to report to work, but they wouldn't get paid. that includes active-duty u.s. troops, unless congress passes separate legislation to make sure their paychecks go out. lawmakers, however, face no such threat. members of congress continue to get paid in a government shutdown.

and just two days before trump wrapped the gop nomination in indiana, gehrke falsely predicted trump would lose in november and said anyone who supports trump is stained by him forever while urging people not to sell their soul by supporting trump:
the trump administration's decision to freeze billions in payments to health insurers with plans under obamacare that cover a higher number of sicker patients could cause health care premiums to rise in 2019.
trump's policies have been precisely tailored to pleasure the richest. under his tax law, businesses received nine times more in cuts than what they gave their workers and spent 37 times more on stock buybacks than on bonuses since the reforms became law, according to an april analysis by americans for tax fairness. now, trump's treasury secretary has suggested that the administration may serve up $100 billion more in tax cuts that will go just to the richest of the richest, who just happen to include much of trump's cabinet, family and big donors.

republicans insist that the measures are a way to balance government, and point to legislative moves in 2010 to extend union contracts during the lame duck before walker took office, though that measure did not limit the power of the governor. for all the talk about reigning in power, it really doesn't, walker told reporters monday, according to the milwaukee journal sentinel.

first lady on trump: we'll help in any way
the democrats on these committees hate president trump more than they love our country and are abusing their powerful positions in congress to try and damage the president's 2020 re-election chances.
but it's unlikely barrett will divulge her views on abortion or those cases, as nominees typically avoid weighing in on issues that may come before them as a jurist.
garcia-navarro: so just let me clarify this - your daughter was helped by a policy under the obamacare legislation?
though sanders campaigned with and for clinton into the fall, many clinton backers blamed sanders' perceived apathy toward clinton as a reason why she narrowly lost to donald trump in michigan, pennsylvania, and wisconsin.
but i think they feel like they are in a good spot heading into this night. as you know, though, better than anyone here, it all just depends on who shows up tonight. and there is no guarantee until they open those doors at the caucus sites, wolf.
even if sanders can get young voters to show up, their support might be too concentrated in counties like story. democratic candidates win in iowa by collecting delegates in every county instead of by running up the popular vote, our own heidi przybyla reports.

second, it emphasized how the colorado anti-discrimination commission disparaged religion in handling this issue. here the court focused on derisive comments made about [masterpiece owner jack] phillips's beliefs by state officials and the fact that the state gave other bakers leeway to refuse to bake cakes based on what might be seen as nonreligious claims of conscience. the majority said that doing so violated the principle that neutral laws — in this case, anti-discrimination laws — cannot be applied with animus toward religion.
then, in 2014, nancy pelosi sought to defend the collapsing law by claiming its success should be measured by the number of people who had access to affordable healthcare and its ability to lower skyrocketing costs.
it was vice president pence's motorcade driving by. he was back on capitol hill for the second time this week, meeting with fellow republicans to talk and pitch the health care bill.
despite that, it's often seen as a black box — what is allowed under it isn't always clear. that's because, according to experts, it actually isn't clear. the limitations are vague and subject to the whims of the senate parliamentarian, who doesn't provide written guidance.
republican-led legislatures in wisconsin and michigan in lame duck sessions are aiming to limit the powers of incoming democratic governors in their states, prompting sore loser allegations from opponents who say lawmakers are undermining voters. but the moves also raise broader questions about whether such efforts have become the new normal in a political environment in which state bodies are becoming more partisan--and more powerful.
this is why the president has been so adamant about producing alternative, affordable options for patients because for so many, the 28 million forgotten men and women in this country have been forced out of the individual market and are sitting there without insurance even though they were promised they would have accessible, affordable, competitive insurance that they could keep. 6.7 million americans paid 3.1 billion dollars in the obamacare taxes for the privilege of not buying insurance they couldn't afford and didn't want and 80 percent of them make 50,000 dollars or less. so we're trying to bring short-term plans as an option for people. we're trying to bring association health plans out of the labor department as options for people. the president is just- we want to keep looking for more options to get people out of some of the traps that the obamacare system has created of these high cost and uncompetitive plans for people.
not every 2020 democrat is in the same place on abortion. former vice president joe biden stands out for, for years, supporting the hyde amendment, which prohibits spending federal money (such as medicaid) on abortion services. and after the alabama law passed, he notably tweeted a statement that was noticeably less fiery and outraged than what the other candidates were putting out. but he too seems to be feeling the energy: in early may, he said he no longer supports hyde.
his subsidized monthly premium for his blue cross policy will be $65 next year, up slightly from the $63.30 he paid this year. ellis says he went without health insurance for many years before obamacare. with high blood pressure, arthritis in his knees and a potential need for another hip replacement, he says, it's been great for me.
chang: ok, let's start with probably the most divisive topic last night - health care. how much did last night's tussle between, say, sanders and warren on the medicare-for-all side and biden on the obamacare side - how much did last night move the health care conversation forward for you, heather?
trump resisted calls for a special enrollment period for people who became uninsured during the pandemic and repeatedly sought to repeal the affordable care act, the obama administration's signature health care reform law. the aca, or obamacare, provides health insurance to more than 23 million people.
under the program, customers' health status is based on diagnoses of chronic costly conditions, such as diabetes and hiv. but insurers argue that enrollees' use of prescription drugs, particularly expensive specialty drugs, should be included in the formula.
now that the obamacare exchange websites are largely up and running, federal health officials are finding themselves swamped as they fact-check a flood of paperwork from applicants seeking taxpayer subsidies.
but he has enjoyed the longtime backing of mcconnell, a louisville family friend who persuaded trump to nominate walker. mcconnell has been an unyielding partner to trump in stocking the federal bench with conservatives.
inskeep: ok. so what do we think of the health care we're receiving?
with the benefit of hindsight, it's now undeniable that trump blundered last january and february by turning down democratic offers that would have given him his wall in exchange for protecting the dreamers. trump caved to the hard-liners in his orbit, specifically sen. tom cotton (r-ark.) and nativist policy adviser stephen miller, and demanded massive reductions in the number of legal immigrants. it was a poison pill. but elections have consequences, and democrats now control the house. of course, they won't offer the terms they were willing to when they were in the minority. why would they?
but interpreted one way — the most obvious way — mccain seemed to have come to a conclusion about how trump is president: he helped lead the way.
laveist says longstanding policy decisions, and population characteristics in the south already put the region at risk in a health pandemic. he points to high poverty rates, large numbers of uninsured residents, lower minimum wages, and general health and well-being measures.
i thought it was going to be worse, he said.
the biden-harris bernie sanders-inspired, socialist health care agenda would bankrupt u.s. taxpayers and eliminate quality access to health care for millions of americans, said ken farnaso, deputy national press secretary. president trump has fought to safeguard patients with pre-existing conditions, lower prescription drug prices, lower premiums, and will always put the health of patients first. the choice couldn't be more clear in november.
he added that his wife nora, who suffers from alzheimer's, isn't able to cope with bums trying to steal the iron bars off the windows for the scrap metal and bricks coming through his windows.

in fact, president trump had been referring to non-violent protesters on both sides of the issue of the removal of a statue of confederate general robert e. lee. he specifically excluded neo-nazis and extremists, whom he said should be condemned totally.
a sign that he's serious about declaring an emergency: the pentagon is already preparing options to build barriers along the southern border if trump does declare a national emergency there. an emergency declaration would allow the army corps of engineers to design barriers and allow contracts to build them.
during right-wing skirmishes over who might succeed kennedy, walker vigorously defended kavanaugh's credentials, especially regarding his ambiguous aca opinion. in one article, walker referred to kavanaugh's thorough and principled takedown of the mandate and asserted that it had even guided dissenting justices in the supreme court's 2012 decision.
we understand that, instead of building senate bills through regular-order deliberation, the democratic majority instead intends to bypass their own committees and bring the house bills straight onto the senate calendar and the floor. this would make senate democrats' first legislative act of the 117th congress the outsourcing of their own committee gavels to the house, a group of republican senators wrote to majority leader chuck schumer and minority leader mitch mcconnell.
in utah, where past attempts to expand medicaid failed in the state's lower chamber, organizers had only three months to gather at least 113,000 signatures. they easily cleared that bar by going to community events, knocking on doors and turning to social media, said rylee curtis, campaign manager for utah decides healthcare. the group will start running television and radio ads next month in hopes of convincing voters to support the measure at the polls.
now, though, the fate of an estimated 20 million americans covered under the aca lies in the hands of these well-covered judges. judge o'connor's friday ruling that the aca is unconstitutional came in response to a lawsuit filed earlier this year by a group of republican governors and state attorneys general.
he has actually helped agriculture so far. now with nafta, that's another story. you know that does scare us pretty bad. but he is willing to listen to us. … i think he is on the side of farmers, though. truly i think he has a plan. he's completely different than what we've ever had before.
sure, you wouldn't ok a project unless it offered a healthy return over your cost of capital. you want to make a profit, and you want a margin of safety. but demanding a return that's twice your cost of capital is quite something.
balancing work and school often means students may struggle to make it through the program in a timely fashion. in addition, achieving success through online programs — what many of these partnerships offer — can be particularly challenging for students who have traditionally struggled in higher education.
trump's proposal would open up a major discrepancy between the rate for individual taxpayers (35 percent in the new document) and the rate for corporations and businesses (the document calls for 15 percent). that gives individual taxpayers a good reason to claim that they are, in fact, businesses to avoid taxes.
the budget seeks to reduce the size and scope of the military complex, including its global footprint to one that is more in line with a policy of containment, he wrote at the time.
the final part of my agenda is to protect america's national security.

human traffickers and sex traffickers take advantage of the wide open areas between our ports of entry to smuggle thousands of young girls and women into the united states and to sell them into prostitution and modern-day slavery.
those are the kinds of things the president, he's not focused on statistics as much as he is on whether or not the american people are doing better as a whole and whether or not a family.
all the nations of the world — friend or foe — will find that america is strong, america is proud, and america is free.
it's also possible that the federal government, by investing all this money into the labor market, would crowd out the private sector, competing with businesses for labor and stifling growth.
still, analysts like gleckman applaud biden for grasping the need for better long-term care support and services.
republic report, which focuses on how money corrupts democracy, has met its abusive dream mate with the kleptocratic administration of president donald j. trump. trump and his lieutenants personify how money and greed, mixed with serious bigotry, disrespect for constitutional freedoms, know-nothing ignorance, and an endless capacity for lying, can really, really corrupt democracy.
sanders' september 2017 single-payer health care legislation received the support of about one-third of the senate democratic caucus; even former president barack obama has praised the underlying policy. and as sanders is fond of noting on the stump, 70 percent of americans say they support medicare for all, according to a reuters poll in august.
mcconnell could vote no on the measure for procedural reasons so that he reserves the ability to bring up a substitute bill later. sen. john mccain, r-ariz., was not present for the vote.
the claim: so they go and they take this man, right? and he got here and he's got 22 people that came in — his mother, his father, his grandmother, his uncle, his brother, his sister. he got — 22 people come in for this one guy. that's called chain migration — 22 people.
martin: former speaker of the house newt gingrich.
detrow: biden says building on obamacare and creating an optional medicare-type national plan is the better approach. but for sanders, private companies and their profit motives are the root of the problem. he blasted the insurance industry in nevada, along with the big pharmaceutical companies he blames for spreading opioid addiction.
one reply from pence in particular could leave millions of americans with pre-existing health conditions wishing for more.
johnson: it is a more complex situation, very clearly.
for the rest — which all posted annual losses in 2015, according to the national alliance of state health co-ops — survival is job no. 1. some are diversifying to serve larger employers, no longer limiting themselves to their aca mandate to offer health plans to individuals and small businesses. a maryland co-op has sued the federal government to avoid paying millions of dollars to other insurers under the aca's complex formula to keep premiums stable by balancing risks among insurers and helping ailing ones. other co-ops are trying to renegotiate contracts with hospitals and other providers.
i think aca supporters should be concerned, bagley told nbc news. not panicked: the lawsuit is weak and the supreme court is unlikely to endorse it. but a small risk of a bad thing is worth worrying about.
-- robert becker, who oversaw sanders's iowa campaign in 2016, was accused of forcibly kissing a female subordinate during the democratic national convention. politico's alex thompson reports: becker, now 50 years old, told the 20-something woman that he had always wanted to have sex with her and made a reference to riding his 'pole,' according to the woman and three other people who witnessed what happened or were told about it shortly afterward by people who did. later in the night, becker approached the woman and abruptly grabbed her wrists. then he moved his hands to her head and forcibly kissed her, putting his tongue in her mouth as he held her, the woman and other sources said. the woman did not formally report the incident at the time because the campaign was over. sanders's principal campaign committee said in response to the allegations that robert becker would not be a part of any future campaigns.
some of trump's changes have already been blocked – at least temporarily – by legal challenges.
down-ballot democrats are very worried about bernie ending up at the top of the ballot, but there's speculation that the rest of the folks — the moderates and others — can't get it together, and they can't stop bernie.
michelle malashock, a walmart spokeswoman, said the company isn't yet comfortable sharing the amount of money it's spending on the program, but she described it as a significant investment.
the legislation, which the duo first introduced back in october 2017, now includes an expansion of marketplace tax subsidies to ensure people don't pay more than 8.5 percent of their income on monthly premiums. it would also eliminate a subsidy cap for people earning 400 percent of the federal poverty level or more.
the first month of pelosi's return to the speakership has thus far served as a pretty resounding affirmation of her leadership and political acumen. and wednesday epitomized it.
sanders held a rally saturday in warren's home state of massachusetts, and projected confidence as that state's voters prepared to go to polls tuesday. if we have the largest voter turnout in the history of the massachusetts primary, we can win here in massachusetts, we can win the democratic nomination, we can defeat donald trump and we can transform this country, sanders said in boston, according to the boston herald.
this proposal recognizes, if you're going to be serious about home-based and community services, it will take real dollars, says ruth katz, senior vice president for public policy/advocacy at leadingage, the association of nonprofit providers of aging services.
trump rattled off a litany of policies his administration has implemented or proposed, ranging from relaxing health insurance regulations to attempting to lower drug prices, few of which have amounted to anything.
losing this vote makes the speaker look weak, says matt green, a catholic university political scientist and expert on the office of house speaker. it empowers skeptical groups in his party, particularly the (hard line conservative) freedom caucus, and emboldens them to challenge ryan on future bills. it could arguably worsen the relationship between president and the speaker.
rep. annie kuster (nh02) - who endorsed buttigieg last month - pushed back.
this is really a defeat for paul ryan, he said. ryan is going to have to come to conservatives now and ask for the votes he doesn't have–if he has the votes, he doesn't have to–but he is going to have to give conservatives a seat at the table.
so it's been a week, and you're starting to get a little bit of ranch fever. okay, maybe a lot. you're following the good advice to keep some structure in your day, especially if there are younger ones around. you're attending to your intellectual, physical and spiritual needs, getting plenty of fresh air and going to bed before 11 o'clock. but you still feel the strains of isolation and loss of routine. so read a book! not just any book, but a world-class book that will hold your attention, expand your mind and transport you to someplace else entirely. there are lots of lists of great books out there for generalists. but what about political books? glad you asked... here is the halftime report's latest and greatest list of the best political books to read:
levin: do people tell you, writers tell you what's going on? they must talk to each other?
but bob kocher, an economic adviser in the obama administration who is now a partner at the venture capital firm venrock, said that beyond the current changes, mr. biden's mission on obamacare seemed more modest, more like don't break it.
for the candidate himself, i think that it's no coincident that his last formal event before coming here to this rally later is about evangelicals, speaking and rallying evangelical voters at a baptist church nearby. this is where he needs to perform well tonight. he has always been about appealing to evangelicals.
rovner: that's right. on these exchanges that we've talked about, this got announced last friday, the day after the fourth of july. no coincidence, i think the administration was trying to make this as invisible as possible. and what they said is that, once again, computer problems mean that when people sign up for insurance on the exchanges, if they're eligible for federal subsidies, they won't get their income checked automatically or verified automatically.
when problems have arisen, obama has often used his executive authority to try to solve them. and it's this very mechanism trump could use to undermine the law. as president, the republican can just reverse obama's actions in many cases, said nicholas bagley, a law professor at the university of michigan who writes about health policy. a president can't undo the basic architecture of the law, but you can throw sand into the gears, he said.
in fact, hernandez, a 21-year-old plumber, is supporting trump in part because he believes he has the best chance against clinton. we have to win this, he said.

sagal: ...the 65-year-old woman caught the cabber on midnight, asked to make a quick stop at a gas station. when the driver got out to buy something from inside, the woman leapt into the front seat and drove off. after that, officers say she continued to pick up fares for about an hour. though most people were fooled, one of the passengers said he really should have known that the woman wasn't a taxi driver because the car did not smell like a dead animal. bill, how did mo do on our quiz?
3. is ducey responsible for mccain's 'no' vote on 'obamacare' repeal?
it all started years ago, during the push for then-president bill clinton's impeachment, when lindsey graham, then a house member, was presenting the case to senators, including arizona's sen. john mccain.
i don' think this is the time to get into it, ryan said.
griffin then retweeted others' reactions bashing trump.
it is indeed true that biden voted to approve permanent normalized trade relations with china in 2000. experts estimate that from 1999 to 2011, the u.s. lost between 2 million and 2.4 million manufacturing jobs due to increased competition with china. as a candidate, sanders also slammed biden for his vote to open up u.s.-china trade.
the first republican president, abraham lincoln, warned that the abandonment of the protective policy by the american government [will] produce want and ruin among our people.

pamela brown to biden: why not carve out time to answer tough questions?
hillary clinton earned 232, not 223, electoral votes to trump's 306. this was not a one-time slip; trump habitually says 223.
spicer: there are no plans for that now. it's always possible. he's been having a tremendous number of calls. i think the number is well over 80 now of people that have talked to him, congratulated him prior to being elected. he's had a -- we read out the other day he's met with both canada and mexico. i think he's talked -- prime minister netanyahu yesterday, president el-sisi today. i think there's -- there's going to continue to be a robust number of world leaders.
is it any wonder that they oppose medicare for all?
in the dc circuit case, kavanaugh rejected a challenge to the aca on procedural, rather than substantive, grounds. yet kavanaugh commented on obamacare at length, calling it unprecedented and deeming the administration's justification for the individual insurance mandate jarring. he said it could extend to other mandatory purchases such as of college savings accounts and disaster insurance.
mississippi gov. tate reeves (r) made a similar announcement on twitter.
davis: you know, i talked to a lot of republicans. the word you hear a lot is they say they're disappointed. they did the best we could. but there's a lot of simmering tensions going on here beneath the surface, audie. there is frustration between the conservative and moderate wings blaming each other for why this went down. there's frustration from some republicans towards mitch mcconnell and how he put this bill together.
cooper: explain that, because that's very confusing.
northam called a senior staff meeting on sunday as he considered his options, including resignation, our post colleagues gregory s. schneider, laura vozzella and jenna portnoy report. a larger meeting is scheduled for this morning as national democratic leaders call on the governor to resign.
spicer: well, i think what the president seemed very clear about in foreign policy is too often the united states is going in with a lot of money, a lot of man power, and in many cases, losing both, loss of life -- and we want to make sure that our interests are protected. and so if we're going in to a country for a cause, i think that he wants to make sure that america's getting something out of it for the commitment and the sacrifice that we're making.
most states should start sending out the jobless benefits in less than three weeks, he said.
the affordable care act has its shortcomings and tradeoffs. nobody, not even its staunchest defenders, think it's the ideal response to the problems of america's health care system.
cooper: all right. good to know. pamela brown, thanks.
-- in an richly reported meditation on the history of walls, marc fisher notes that border walls have a checkered history of maintaining separation between people: no matter how high, how long, how strong the wall, people have an uncanny knack for finding their way over, under and around. … some historians contend that walls have repeatedly proved their worth: they protect communities from perceived threats, bringing the people inside the wall together in security and camaraderie. yet walls can also undermine community, creating and cementing 'us vs. them' antagonisms, letting wall builders avoid resolution of the problems they face.
obviously, there's an unknown factor, but i believe we have the systems in place to do a pretty good job of tracking these individuals through law enforcement, through -- through travel, through our efforts to monitor what they're doing.
he's standing on principle. he's standing on things that we've never -- we watched eight years. i mean, i suffered in eight years watching the obama administration do things that are going to take us decades to get out of, but president trump, i do find it -- i don't know what the word that the media treats -- they hate his guts, obviously. they can't stand him.
you cannot get a bead on what either of them intend to do, other than to cave to media and left-wing pressure at every turn.
for people like this, a full repeal of obamacare without a replacement would be devastating, aguilar said.
toward the end, spicer gave an impassioned defense of why trump dwells so much on things like his inauguration crowd size, arguing that trump is very frustrated by constant negative coverage and the media minimizing him. he basically said it amounted to a defense mechanism from the president. it was really rather interesting.
and uninsured patients who require hospitalization will incur tens of thousands of dollars in costs.
this story was produced by kaiser health news, which publishes california healthline, a service of the california health care foundation.
additionally, most seniors working past the age of 65 have additional health insurance from their employers that include premiums, deductibles and co-payments. every senior citizen in this country with less than $250,000 in income would save thousands of dollars a year, said gunnels. anyone who claims otherwise is simply not telling the truth, he said.
the remarks were first reported by the new york times.
calling the law a fixture of the american health-care system donald verrilli, a lawyer for the house, urged the justices in legal briefs to review a remarkable lower court decision that threatens profound destabilization of the health care system.
anti-abortion groups put the pressure on
clinton slammed senate republicans for not taking up president obama's nominee of merrick garland to fill the vacant seat on the supreme court, and vowed to immediately move to ensure that we fill that if elected president.
he called reversing the incentive for high list prices — even if that's not the price most people pay — the most important nut to crack.
warren announced last week at a democratic national committee gala that she'd sent a check for $5,000 to all 50 state parties – $250,000 total. i want a democratic party strong enough to compete for every vote, in every race, at every level, in every state, in every election – and i'm willing to do my part to help make that happen, she said.
after 9/11, the rush to expand the president's ability to respond quickly to attacks and to ferret out terrorists shifted the balance of power ever more decisively toward the white house. then-vice president dick cheney, a proponent of a stronger presidency going back to his days in congress three decades earlier, argued that the fragility of a world with nuclear weapons mandated an expansive presidency: the fact that the president is accompanied at all times by a military aide carrying the nuclear codes, he said, means that he doesn't have to check with anybody. he doesn't have to call the congress. he doesn't have to check with the courts. he has that authority because of the nature of the world we live in.

at the kenosha ice arena, we find jacki olsen (ph) watching her son at nighttime peewee hockey practice. she voted twice for obama - this time, for trump. it's not that she feels negative about clinton, she says.
perhaps most consequentially, the administration has partially sided with a group of republican state officials seeking to strike down the affordable care act on constitutional grounds.
before the aca, insurers routinely used preexisting health conditions as a reason to deny coverage or charge people more for their insurance premiums. preexisting conditions typically included serious ailments such as cancer or heart disease as well as more common conditions such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, asthma, diabetes and obesity, and even temporary conditions including pregnancy. insurers denied about 1 in 5 applications for individual policies because of preexisting conditions, and some employer-provided group policies required people to wait up to a year before their preexisting conditions were covered.
cooper: amanda, your former boss, ted cruz, in order to win, he doesn't just have to get his largely evangelical supporters to come out. he has to hope the donald trump's new people don't come out, right?
the congressional budget office initially estimated that the house bill would mean the loss of coverage for 24 million people. many analysts say this number is now likely higher. tax credits: some gop senators are already on record opposing the bill's age-based tax credits, charging that they will make coverage unaffordable for older constituents. others, however, describe these credits as obamacare lite.
there is simply no evidence this happened. biden's campaign says it didn't, and trump's campaign did not respond to a request to identify the event he was talking about.
in the first three years of the expansion, the federal government paid 100 percent of the tab. but now states need to chip in a small share to cover the expansion population's medical bills. that share, 5 percent this year, is set to rise to 10 percent in 2020.
health insurance companies are struggling to make money on the exchanges, leading major players like unitedhealth group to openly contemplate abandoning them. aetna and other firms, in contrast, say they're committed to making the marketplaces work even if they're not immediately profitable. and insurers losing money in the exchange market are eyeing premium increases for next year that could make coverage unaffordable for some portion of those already in the system.
in a departure from his fellow democratic contenders, bennet, who supports creating a public option for health care while making private insurances available on obamacare marketplaces, noted in his campaign rollout video that the answer to the nation's health care woes does cannot be found in far-left policies like medicare-for-all.
one of those quotes includes trump's hoax comment but does so by combining two separate statements and not providing the words trump said before he used the hoax label. the coronavirus, this is their new hoax, the ad says. according to the washington post, trump never made that exact statement but it was included in another ad released by former vice president joe biden's campaign. the post also determined that trump wasn't calling the virus itself a hoax.
walker in march remarked that it was still the worst thing he ever heard from kennedy. it was not the first time walker had referred to the 2012 deliberations in a highly public way. he spoke about the experience in 2018 when he was backing kavanaugh as a successor to retiring justice kennedy.
twelve months after this fight began, not only are planned parenthood's doors still open across the country, but millions in america have kept their coverage. it's no coincidence that two republican women, sens. susan collins and lisa murkowski, held strong with the entire democratic senate caucus (and were then joined by sen. john mccain) to stop the legislation that would have ended affordable health care for so many.
but the senator's colleagues need him as much as he needs them, so it's a role many are embracing — at least for the moment.
if your income has been wiped out with the lost job, you should also check to see whether you qualify for medicaid, the national health insurance program for low-income people that's jointly funded by federal and state governments. medicaid enrollment takes place year-round and is based on monthly income, not annual income, and it's essentially free for people who are eligible. you're more likely to qualify if you live in one of the 37 states and d.c. that expanded medicaid under the affordable care act.
if you earned vacation or sick days at work, you're probably entitled to a payout for the value of those days if you didn't use them. make sure you talk to your employer about the policies and process of collecting pay for these unused days, because you could otherwise miss out on hundreds or even thousands of dollars of income you're owed.
now my republican friends ― and some others ― seem to think the american people hate paying taxes, but they just love paying insurance premiums! sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.)
even though the unemployment rate is at historic lows in many countries this still does not suggest that these country's labor markets are anywhere close to full employment, the paper said.
— the pandemic could now define the battle for congress, in more dramatic ways than the impeachment storm, which now feels far in the rear view.
a jobs guarantee program can take different forms, but the basic idea behind any program is the same, according to darity.
the bit of good news is that the report also found that the vast majority of those who lost their insurance can remain covered by switching to a spouse's plan, or are eligible to get subsidized health insurance elsewhere — either via medicaid or via a plan on the obamacare insurance exchanges.
sen. thom tillis (r-n.c.), one of the most vulnerable gop incumbents facing reelection, introduced one such measure this year, allowing him to say he stands with trump on obamacare repeal while maintaining his support for the health care law's most popular provisions.
staff for susan collins referred huffpost to previous comments the maine senator made to bangor daily news that she was disappointed in president donald trump for not allowing a special enrollment period for the affordable care act, but did not comment on congress taking further action on health care specifically.
sen. bernie sanders of vermont tweeted that trump wanted to throw millions of americans off health insurance and put lives at risk, and pledged to fight back.
health care is a winning issue for democrats. as president trump and republicans seek to constantly undo obamacare and have no alternative plan, this is an issue that still is strongly resonating with voters.
with so many supporters, mr. courtney secured a vote on the house's fast-track calendar, which requires two-thirds of the house to vote for passage, but also allows the bill to bypass rules that would require the cost to be offset by spending cuts or tax increases elsewhere.
he also directed federal agencies to reexamine policies that undermine the affordable care act, make it difficult for americans to enroll in medicaid or ones that reduce affordability of coverage or protections for those with pre-existing conditions.
this report was first published on jan. 27, 2020.
olivier douliery/getty images democratic presidential nominee joe biden has a long record of moderate positions on crime, including his current opposition to police funding cuts, that trump wants americans to forget.
collins, who says she did not vote for trump in 2016, has yet to say whether she will support him in 2020.
unlike the democrats, republicans and trump are listening to the american people and promised to repeal and replace this disaster. they have worked together to introduce legislation in congress that ensures americans with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage, and that we have a stable transition for americans currently enrolled in the healthcare exchanges. republican-led reforms would help americans purchase their own coverage through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts, so that they can get a plan that works for them, not a one-size-fits-all plan forced on them by the government. our families would have the freedom to purchase health insurance across state lines, creating a truly competitive national marketplace that will drastically reduce costs and provide far better care.
expected to last four days, monday's hearing will feature opening statements from the panel's 22 members, as well as introductions of barrett by indiana senators todd young and mike braun, and patricia o'hara, the former dean of notre dame law school.
those of us who follow the facts, like i couldn't be happier with what he did in this past year. and he, to me, is a man of his word and that is the most important thing to me. i don't want another suave-suit politician. i'm sick of it. i want someone to keep their word. i want them to love this country like i love this country. i want them to put americans first for a change.
-- the ex-north korean diplomat who defected to seoul with his family last year spoke to the post for his first-ever foreign media interview. our anna fifield writes up their fascinating discussion: over the past month, [thae yong-ho] has predicted to south korean media the demise of north korea with the same fervor with which he once extolled its glories. his hard line statements happen to fit nicely with the hawkish stance taken by the south korean government over the past eight years, but thae said he was not being expedient and was speaking his real mind — and was intent on using his influence for good. 'i've known that there was no future for north korea for a long time,' thae [said] … [and] his arrival in south korea was the most high profile of what is said to be a string of elite defections … 'there is no sense of solidarity or loyalty between kim jong un and senior officials,' thae said. 'senior officials know that this system can't continue.'
despite the higher prices and promises by president-elect donald trump and gop leaders to repeal the health law in 2017, most are still signing up, she says.
we can have a president who wants 100% clean energy, student debt forgiveness and an assault weapons ban, or we can have a white supremacist who tells americans to drink bleach, said ben wessel, the group's executive director. this election is about young americans and our future, and the choice for us is clear: joe biden is the best candidate for president.
pushing for change against opposition from industry and some conservatives is a tough job. it's unclear whether gottlieb had enough administration support for some of his far-reaching reforms. if not, this will mark victories for the vaping and tobacco industries, and this might have influenced his decision to leave.
lahrs mehlum, the director of norway's centre for suicide prevention, said the media's portrayal of williams's death may have played a role. sadly, there were all too many examples of unfortunate presentations of the case of robin williams' suicide, mehlum said. many journalists failed to mention the huge health problems williams struggled with (both mentally and physically), but rather portrayed a glorified version of the event. this is not according to international guidelines for media reporting of suicide.
progressive lawmakers such as warren (d) and sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) have long been critical of the relationship between members of congress and the business interests who lobby them. last year, a study published in the american political science review painted a stark picture of how corporations have skewed congress's perception of what the american public wants.
house majority leader kevin mccarthy wants to repeal the affordable care act first and replace it sometime later. that doesn't sit well with victoria barton, who lives in mccarthy's rural california district.

nearly a quarter of the physicians in the national poll said that the electronic health records they're required to use don't have a place to include patients' end-of-life preferences. even when electronic health records signaled that a patient had an advance care directive, nearly a third of doctors reported they couldn't access its actual contents.

clinton leads among democrats who have attended the caucuses before; sanders leads among those who haven't but say they will this time. like trump on the republican side, sanders is depending on turning out new voters.
bertolini drew a portrait of the health insurance landscape caught in a deteriorating cycle. with too many sick people and not enough healthy ones buying insurance, he argued, the premiums have to keep going up. the more the premiums increase, the fewer healthy people want to sign up for care. they opt to pay the penalty instead of buying insurance with a massive deductible. that causes the balance of sick and healthy people buying insurance to worsen, prompting more rate increases and causing people — and insurers — to drop out.
in recent weeks, honesty has become a central issue of the 2016 race. rubio has repeatedly hit cruz as a liar. at the most recent republican debate, rubio said: this is a disturbing pattern now, because for a number of weeks now, ted cruz has just been telling lies.
those conservative democrats were the ones who were dead set against the public option. they were the ones who kept pushing to give state officials more power over the program. they were the ones most anxious over new spending. and those decisions had consequences later, when the law took effect. among other things, it meant less financial assistance for some middle-class americans buying insurance.
the case laid out by the report is straightforward, logical, and politically unspeakable. it's an argument generally made in hushed tones until now, and it's easy to see why. even the senate homeland security report was swiftly denounced as a partisan fantasy peddled by chairman ron johnson (r-wi) in what little mainstream media coverage it received. thou shalt not speak ill of medicaid.
you might be able to keep the same health plan under federal rules known as cobra — if you worked for an employer with 20 employees or more. levitt says one advantage of cobra is it provides the most continuity of coverage, because you stay in exactly the same plan you were in when you were employed — same network of doctors and hospitals, same deductible — everything is identical. but this continuation of your current health coverage can be quite expensive because, at least under normal circumstances, you would have to pay the full monthly premium, without your employer chipping in to make it more affordable. your insurer is required to notify you if you have the cobra option, and you have 60 days to elect to take it. (for those who lost coverage in march, the clock is ticking to elect this option).
so i think the right answer -- and there is a difference of opinion about this, but the right answer is only combat troops in limited circumstances, and then there's some other differences of opinion, too, that we're going to have to work through in hearings in the foreign relations committees.
the elimination of financial help in covered california — even if delayed — would not just cause people to drop coverage and insurers to leave the market, but would force skyrocketing rates for those left in a smaller and sicker insurance pool, said anthony wright of health access california, a statewide consumer advocacy coalition.
i would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and i'll build them very inexpensively, trump said during his june 2015 campaign kick-off. i will build a great great wall on our southern border and i'll have mexico pay for that wall.
with so many more patients covered, hospital margins grew and days of cash-on-hand climbed. such financial improvements enabled the hospital to invest in new projects, including the pena family health center in southwest denver. the hospital planned to construct three more clinics, to expand two existing clinics, and to build a new parking garage to drive new revenues and expand its coverage.
i found most of what he said a little incoherent, emanuel told msnbc's hardball on wednesday, noting that the president was surprised to learn how many people die from the flu each year.
it took a deadly mob invading their place of work and their safety and the democratic process for some of them to say so publicly. and a few acknowledge that it's too little, too late.
but a minority of consumers must pay full premiums, because their household incomes are more than four times the poverty line. (that's about $100,000 for a family of four.) and in some parts of the country, like iowa and tennessee, premiums have skyrocketed ― partly because of design flaws in the 2010 health care law, and partly because of republican efforts to undermine its implementation.
top trump administration officials indicated that while the president still backs repealing the obamacare individual mandate, the administration would accept a tax reform package that left the mandate in place.
mccain's been sending us this signal for awhile now. months before his death, he wrote in his last memoir that he regretted not picking joseph lieberman, an independent senator, for his vice president. palin called that revelation a gut punch.

some of those who favor the law, or rely on it, see a conflict between mccarthy's stated goals as a national leader and the needs of so many of his constituents.
warren's choice:she has the chance to unite the left by endorsing sanders. she should take it.
on tuesday's broadcast of msnbc's morning joe, co-host willie geist stated that obamacare's premium increases and shrinking choices are all things predicted by conservatives many years ago.
success as a country is the solution, trump said, suggesting that democrats would come to the bargaining table, if not the dinner table, if he won reelection.
question: do you dispute, though, his tweet about comparing the intelligence community to nazi germany?
this isn't some radical new change, hauman said. public charge doctrine has existed in the country since 1882, the immigration act of 1882, which gave the government the ability to restrict entry of any person who is unable to take care of themselves without becoming a public charge.
enter dan kaufman, who grew up in wisconsin and now writes for magazines in new york. in the fall of wisconsin: the conservative conquest of a progressive bastion and the future of american politics (norton), he tries to explain what happened in 2016 as part of a far larger story.
at bethlehem baptist church, and later at the oyster fry in orangeburg, biden's remarks only touched on one policy issue: criminal justice reform. notably, his platform is an attempt to backtrack his legacy on the issue. he said he would end mandatory minimum sentencing, and expunge criminal records stemming from marijuana convictions.
spicer: i'm -- i'm not gonna -- there -- we'll have further updates on trade issues later this week, jennifer (ph).
yeah, well, i don't know if i would retire. i would've gone home. yeah, i see my role as more of a mission than job tenure. and when the mission is accomplished, then i can have that satisfaction that when i was needed to get the job done, i was there to do it.
rubio said, often and repeatedly, (and does to this day in pitching his immigration plans) that illegals would have to 'pay taxes and undergo a background check,' schlafly pointed out. however, there is no such thing as 'back taxes,' for illegal immigrants as most have no net tax liability. similarly, with regards to the background checks, rubio's bill would have legalized criminal gang members and child sex offenders.
olsen went on, does it mean a mandate? maybe not. but in australia what they say is that they'll add a tax if you don't buy health insurance, and they'll subsidize you under a certain level of income if you do. that's not that different than obamacare. but it means that you've got nearly 50 percent of australians who have private-sector health insurance and that gives improved healthcare and keeps public sector costs down. is that a better alternative than medicare for all? i would say it is.
even the new york times is conceding that the huge number of americans willing to pay a special tax to escape from obamacare is newsworthy, although the paper tries to sugar-coat the bad news as much as possible:
vice president mike pence on friday delivered remarks at an event for rick saccone, the gop nominee running in the special election to fill the seat vacated by former rep. tim murphy, r-pennsylvania, which is being held on march 13. conor lamb is the democratic candidate running for the seat.
on thursday morning, the senate republican conference sat through a closed-door briefing for an hour and a half to learn about the bill's substance. many inside the meeting didn't actually see the text even though it was posted online.
photo: shefali luthra/khn with 64 beds, highlands hospital is a crucial economic engine and a key source of local health care.
any plans short of medicare for all leaves these costs in place. in other words, they leave hundreds of billions of dollars a year in savings on the table.
when ginsburg found out about roberts' new position, her first thought was, it ain't over till it's over. she understood that the process could continue to be fluid, especially in such a monumental case.
that prospect has been the backbone of the president's insistence on the senate confirming barrett before election day.
the administration has instituted regulations to undermine the law, for example expanding the sale of short term health insurance policies that do not have to cover pre-existing medical conditions or other health benefits deemed essential by the law, such as emergency services and prescription drugs. and the white house has cut funding to promote obamacare sign-ups and for navigators who are supposed to help consumers enroll.
don polite, 28, of columbia, said he was supporting warren after seeing her policy team emphasize black women. early in the campaign, several black activist communities praised warren's plans for addressing racial inequality head-on.
kasich is trying to claim the beat clinton argument for himself. now that the race has dwindled from 17 candidates to three, he's getting more attention, he says. the upcoming elections in new york tuesday and next week in connecticut, delaware, maryland, pennsylvania and rhode island — moderate east coast states where cruz may struggle — offer him a chance to boost his delegate total heading in to a possible contested convention, where he hopes to emerge as the party's choice.
yet if you think about the fact that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death, followed by cancer, it would not be surprising that the leading cause of death goes down when you give people health insurance, he said. we know very clearly that again, even in the medicaid program, that if you give people coverage, mortality goes down.
biden also wants to create a public health jobs corps to mobilize at least 100,000 people and help identify those at risk of contracting or spreading infectious diseases. think of a public health version of teach for america, with jobs as community health workers and elsewhere.
trump's short saturday swing through las vegas was aimed largely at bolstering heller, who is running for re-election in a state hillary clinton won in 2016. just before his speech to the state gop, he held a backstage fundraiser for heller.
the house passed the four-week stopgap on thursday, 230-197, with just six democrats voting with republicans. the measure included a six-year renewal of the popular children's health insurance program and further delays of certain taxes under the affordable care act, also known as obamacare.

phoenix — in his second day on the campaign trail, former new york city mayor michael bloomberg stood in strong contrast to many of his democratic rivals in the presidential race. he criticized not only their campaign strategies but their policies.
so, i introduced a resolution in september authorizing limited military action against isil but congress wouldn't vote on it before the mid-term. and then i pushed it after november and i was able to get a vote in the senate foreign relations committee defining this mission in a limited way. we voted out a bill in the senate foreign relations committee in december but the house hasn't even been willing to talk about this in a committee.
mazurenko was first author of a paper published last year in the journal health affairs that found expansion to be associated with increases in coverage, service use, quality of care and medicaid spending.
whatever your party, whatever you believe, whoever you support, we need to make sure that the people who are supposed to represent us, people who are meeting about this right now in washington, understand that very clearly, kimmel said.
and he is succeeding. it is no coincidence that trump recently overhauled our outdated tax code for the first time since the reagan years, rewarding job creators and employees alike with pro-growth tax cuts.
trump's comments followed a lunch meeting with mcconnell, and come after the president's former chief strategist, steve bannon, has pledged to wage a war on the republican establishment and cited the senate majority leader by name.
this idea is best reinforced when families engage in charitable activities together. parents must show their kids that motivated, compassionate conservatives care for those most in need and make the world a better place.
biden, who took a more expansive position on reproductive health issues during the campaign than he had in the past, frames his views in the context of one of his top priorities: creating a more equitable society for people of color and other marginalized groups.

if you talk to students, the thing that stands out to them is that she really makes an effort to get to know them, understand them, and help them, says g. marcus cole, dean of the law school.
a big question for cruz now is whether he'll run for reelection for a second senate term in 2018. while he would be heavily favored to win in texas, he'd have to intensify his focus on local issues over the next two years and build a war chest in case a threat to his seat emerges.
it's time for the navigator program to evolve, seema verma, the cms administrator, said in a press release that cited the success of commercial brokers in enrolling individuals and stressed the importance of spending federal funds more judiciously.
mfume supports stronger gun-control measures, such as reauthorizing a federal assault weapons ban that expired in 2005. he also is focusing on the root causes of crime, like the inability of young adults to find jobs. he has made health care a priority, particularly lower prescription drug costs.
sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) called it a pipe dream. both she and former vice president joe biden implied sanders wasn't being honest about how much it would cost.
this is word salad worthy of sarah palin. even the comprehensible parts don't make sense. allowing insurance sales across state lines, for example, won't enable people with pre-existing conditions to get insurance. if anything, it will have the opposite effect, since some states have historically forced insurers to sell to all comers ― and allowing cross-state purchasing would render those regulations moot. republican schemes to block grant medicaid typically involve reducing the program's funding, which would, according to impartial estimates, vastly reduce the number of people who could get insurance.
tolson: i think that there's a overanalysis (laughter) of all of that and that he...
healthcare was not the only major policy fight in which meadows helped president trump against leftist democrats and establishment republicans. on everything from ending endless wars to fighting against open borders amnesty pushes to battling for the trump tax cuts and more, meadows has been one of trump's go-to allies in the house since the president took office—and the two speak on the regular.

and former new york mayor rudy giuliani ― long hailed by conservative gothamites for his heavy-handed approach to reducing crime in the 1990s ― described de blasio as a taste of the kind of lawlessness-for-its-own-sake that democrats supposedly want to visit on america.
jeff weaver, a senior adviser to the sanders campaign, shot back on wednesday, suggesting it was unrealistic. without unicorns, magic wands ... health care is not free, he said on msnbc.
the coronavirus was on voters' minds as they headed to the polls on super tuesday. over half of voters in five states, including california and texas, said the illness caused by the virus was an important factor shaping their vote, according to exit polls.
harper: sure. so pence, as a republican, under obamacare, did expand medicaid. he did it with restrictions. so people who need insurance, many of them need to pay a premium in order to get coverage, and they face getting kicked off or getting bumped down to a lower level of coverage if they don't pay. but that program did bring health insurance to a lot of people who didn't have it before, and that helps with public health issues like addiction.
mark meadows is the right person at the right time to serve as president trump's chief of staff, rep. louie gohmert (r-tx) told breitbart news as well. after enduring establishment operatives undermining his efforts since his inauguration, the president will now have a fearless warrior on the inside to promote and safeguard his agenda.
republicans have also sought to call attention to what they see as hypocrisy from the democratic leadership, who loudly criticized republicans in 2013 when the government last shut down, over affordable care act disagreements.
the policy of the united states is an empty phrase. it's not a law. it's not even an actual policy. also, the current real policy of the united states on this issue is encoded in a law called the affordable care act that trump is trying to get rid of.
as washington was inundated with the impeachment trial of biden's predecessor, the white house took pains to make clear they both weren't involved and weren't paying attention. it wasn't entirely true -- biden was kept abreast of the trial and took to watching highlights each night, two sources said.
instead, trump's ascendance has been fueled less by concern over slashing and destroying entitlements, broadly speaking, than by a desire to protect those entitlements for the right people. mr. trump is a political harbinger here of a new strand of populist republicanism ... in which the 'conservative' position is to defend the existing entitlement programs from a perceived threat posed by a new-style obama coalition of handout seekers that includes the chronically unemployed, students, immigrants, minorities and women, wrote the wall street journal's holman jenkins.

(moriah balingit) a new study found bullying rates at virginia middle schools were higher in school districts where trump won in 2016. the researchers who conducted the study wrote of their findings, it is obviously difficult to demonstrate a causal link between statements by a public figure and schoolyard bullying. nevertheless, there are incidents in which youth made threats and jeering statements that closely matched language used by [trump]. (valerie strauss) two north carolina women were charged with sexually assaulting a transgender woman in a bar bathroom. the case comes nearly three years after north carolina passed a bill requiring transgender people to use facilities corresponding to the sex on their birth certificate.
trump has since relented on his threat. on june 18 — after widespread criticism — his administration said it would go ahead with $432 million in projects and grants that had been previously approved — out of the $615 million in aid that trump had ordered to be frozen.
now, there are three ways to think about the senate bill. the first is that it would take health-care from the poor and middle-class to pay for tax cuts for the rich at a time of already historic inequality. the second is that it would make insurance more expensive for everyone and less useful for anyone who is sick. and the third is that it would hurt president trump's working-class base the most. other than that, how were the tax cuts, mrs. lincoln?

the present case represents yet another effort by litigants who disagree with the policy judgments embodied in the aca to use the courts, rather than the democratic process, to undo the work of the people's elected representatives, the filing states.
but if you have family who couldn't pay for your higher education costs, and so you go to college and you get a good job, but you're paying off hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt, and you're also helping other members of your family who maybe don't have as much as you do, then you don't build wealth. it helps your income some, but it doesn't translate into your wealth, and so the gap just keeps widening. i really feel like the dynamics of wealth creation are understudied and under-emphasized in politics, where we tend to talk about income. but in many ways, they seem to me to be more important.
brat continued, he knows better than anyone that the performance coming out of free-markets and letting individuals alone and not encumbering them with unending regulations is going to serve us all better in short and the long run. he put together the tax bill way back when, and now, he's got a slot in the there. he's going to be a total breath of fresh air.

be optimistic, see the day coming, not the day that has gone. this was a favorite saying of george w. bush's. i worked for him for five-and-a-half years. love the guy. at graduations, he would say, 'for those of you who've won honors, awards and distinctions, well done. and for the c students, you too can be president of the united states.' president bush lives on the sunrise side of the mountain. that's the place to live. be the optimist, the happy warrior. do not get beaten down.
at least four of the photos were found to be altered, our post colleague joe heim reports. a placard that proclaims god hates trump has trump blotted out so that it reads god hates. a sign that reads trump & gop — hands off women has the word trump blurred out.

endorsing kavanaugh opinion as a 'roadmap'
a president who might act unilaterally was one of the chief fears expressed in the original debates about the constitution. writing in the federalist papers in 1787, the pseudonymous cato warned against the presidency becoming a caesar, caligula, nero, and domitian in america. the system of checks and balances — giving congress the authority to make laws and decide how money is spent, and giving the supreme court the last word on what laws comport with the constitution — was supposed to rein in the president.

even as some democratic operatives privately concede republican voters are likely to unite against the bill in the not-so-distant future, they have both messaging and policy reasons to be confident the bill will remain broadly popular.
and he calls for expanding the unemployment insurance system to cover independent contractors and gig workers, many of whom are over 50.
i think trump is redefining what the term 'swamp' means, hauser said. it was initially understood to be excessive influence of money on politics, but i think the term has morphed in how it is understood on the right. now it means entrenched people in washington, especially progressives.

a presidential historian tweeted a famous trump quote after he walked out of his meeting with democratic leadership:

one of the most striking things about the final night of the republican national convention was the degree to which speakers singled out new york city as an embodiment of the failures of urban democratic rule.
the house health care battle: what's at stake?
-- trump took to twitter last night to re-up the idea of dispatching federal law enforcement to chicago if local officials cannot curb the city's homicide rate on their own: if chicago doesn't fix the horrible 'carnage' going on, trump wrote, i will send in the feds! he then cited homicide figures that appear to be from a newly published chicago tribune article. it is unclear what exactly trump's suggestion would entail, or what kind of unilateral government intervention he could order to remedy the problem — but following the tweet, a spokesman for chicago mayor rahm emanuel said he welcomed the prospect of working with trump, adding that the two men had previously spoken about the issue. (john wagner and mark berman)

harris's home state of california is leading the charge to defend the law and they say 20 million people could lose health coverage if the aca falls.
scholten, a former minor league baseball pitcher and devout catholic, is a natural ideological fit for the brooklyn-born sanders. casting himself as heir to the forgotten tradition of farmer populists in iowa, scholten is running in support of medicare for all and taking on the monopoly seed and livestock conglomerates he believes are squeezing small farmers.
politico reports that boehner, speaking at a conference in boca raton, florida, said: if we don't have a nominee who can win on the first ballot, i'm for none of the above. they all had a chance to win. none of them won. so i'm for none of the above. i'm for paul ryan to be our nominee.
romney, who has been stung by charges of flip-flopping in the past, said his federal health care proposal had not changed from 2008, when he last ran for president -- even though his decision to sign the law has seemingly gone from a political asset to a liability.
vice president says health insurance sign-ups may be short of the 7 million goal during the open-enrollment period but adds he's optimistic regardless
health and human services secretary alex azar said there have been 15 cases of covid-19 in the united states in addition to three cases of people who came from the chinese city of wuhan, the epicenter of the virus and 42 who were brought in from the diamond princess cruise ship, which docked in japan.

rogers: the king who spent a lot of time of washington, d.c. over the last few years really talking about this growing extremist problem for the region in eastern syria. so he's been laying out plans literally for three years on how he thought that the united states should help the region. this could act as the catalyst for discussions that have already happened.

and he said categorically that while religious and philosophical objections are protected … such objections do not allow business owners to deny protected persons equal access to goods and service under a neutral and generally applicable public accommodations law. this sends a pretty strong signal that kennedy, at least, would resist broad religious-liberty claims that shielded merchants from anti-discrimination laws.
in their summary of the bill, senate republicans laid out the major provisions. here are some of those big changes that this new version of the bill would make to the original bcra, and what they would mean:
the veto was expected. but republicans claimed victory with the vote, arguing that they met two goals by finally passing a repeal bill: keeping a promise to voters in an election year, and showing that they are capable of repealing the law if a republican wins november's presidential election.
when president obama signed the affordable care act seven years ago, he saddled americans with a healthcare system that put the ultra-liberal agenda ahead of our best interests. we were promised that obamacare would bring down healthcare costs with increased competition between insurance providers. we were promised we could keep our healthcare plans. we were promised that obamacare would not raise middle class taxes. instead, the law brought the american people rising premiums, unaffordable deductibles, fewer insurance choices and higher taxes. we were let down.
the trump administration also implemented policies restricting access to asylum for latin american migrants. in january 2019, the department of homeland security rolled out its migrant protection protocols, also known as remain in mexico. more than 60,000 people have been sent back to await the outcome of their proceedings.
the short-term spending bill also funds the children's health insurance program (chip) for six years, while delaying several obamacare taxes, such as the cadillac tax, the medical device tax, as well as the health insurance tax (hit).
you and i grew up in a similar milieu in politics, in this policy analysts world in d.c. and you were at demos, and i was at the american prospect, which at a certain point merged together for a time. and something you talk about is a realization — as that work continued looking at table after table showing how a tax plan or a student debt plan or a health plan would benefit different groups, that there was this myth at the core of policy analysis that what people are trying to do in politics is pursue their economic self-interest. and when you look at examples like this one — but so much that we'll talk about here, so much in the trump era, so much in modern politics too, you just endlessly watch that disproven. you just endlessly watch that narrow distributional table way of measuring what is in somebody's self-interest fail. so when you look at these stories, how do you understand political self-interest?
for example, in the heritage foundation's 2019 index of economic freedom, denmark, norway and sweden all score higher than the united states in numerous categories, including property rights and business freedom.

they have anointed representative mark meadows of north carolina as their leader and principal spokesman. but they occasionally get help from three senators sympathetic to their cause: ted cruz of texas, rand paul of kentucky and mike lee of utah.
the former vice president touted his past efforts and added we can't do it all at one. we're working on it kid. we're working on it.
why, hillary clinton's supporters wondered aloud, is the democrat tied with donald trump in ohio, when she is so experienced and his rhetoric is so divisive? when, the trump supporters wondered, will the real-estate-mogul-turned-republican-nominee focus on the concrete plans and grassroots organization they think could deliver him the election in the quintessential swing-state?
still, biden's ability to cite the first black president as his close personal friend poses perhaps the biggest challenge to the other candidates in south carolina. to make inroads in the state, biden's competitors have to effectively pull the former vice president away from obama. on paper, it's not difficult to make that point by noting biden's long record in government — one that was far more conservative than obama's on issues like criminal justice reform, health care and national security.
mcdonough: then we are looking at a national holy mess in the insurance market like we've never seen before.
in the 20th century, america saved freedom, transformed science, and redefined the middle class standard of living for the entire world to see. now, we must step boldly and bravely into the next chapter of this great american adventure, and we must create a new standard of living for the 21st century. an amazing quality of life for all of our citizens is within our reach.
well, let me first say that our purpose in the meeting at the white house was to open up government, said pelosi. the impression you get from the president [is] that he would like to not only close government, build a wall, but also abolish congress so the only voice that mattered was his own.
officials in 11 states have cleared planned parenthood of wrongdoing, according to the organization. officials in another eight states declined to even investigate the accusations made by the center for medical progress.
a key change in individual taxes could occur with the revision of tax brackets. trump's proposal calls for reducing tax brackets for individuals from seven to three set at 10, 25, and 35 percent. according to the wall street journal, this reduces the amount of taxes on individual income for those earning over $699,000 by $214,000, while their ultimate share of all federal taxes reduces to 25 percent. this will benefit the wealthy since the top tax rate decreases from 39.6 percent to 35 percent.
joining us tonight in the gallery is a remarkable woman, denisha merriweather. as a young girl, denisha struggled in school and failed third grade twice. but then she was able to enroll in a private center for learning, with the help of a tax credit scholarship program. today, she is the first in her family to graduate, not just from high school, but from college. later this year she will get her masters degree in social work.
inskeep: isn't that the political challenge that obamacare has faced all along? it's designed to insure millions more people, which is very important. but there are many, many millions of others who don't necessarily experience a direct change?
over the course of his day-and-a-half in iowa, sanders participated in no fewer than four campaign events for j.d. scholten, who is waging a long-shot bid to unseat infamous white nationalist rep. steve king in iowa's heavily rural 4th congressional district.
schilling: right. she still doesn't, but that's fine. but i read it and it's a pretty cool document and then when you think about -- we were talking about foresight. the amount of foresight these men had to put this document together knowing full well that we are a horribly flawed species and that somebody somewhere was going to try and do many, many bad things to get it -- it's just mind-boggling to me that they were all that smart and we've gone through some changes as a country.
and i think part of this is ensuring that we sequence these, that gives the american people the proper -- issue the proper attention that they deserve because part of it is that when -- and if we put them all out in one day, they get lose -- they get lost in the ether, i think, and i think he made these promises and pledges to the american people because they're important to him. so...
the caucus soon became known for using hardball legislative tactics to achieve its goals. republican leaders who refused to make bills more conservative or to allow the caucus to offer floor amendments faced the likelihood that a coalition between the freedom caucus and house democrats would kill those bills or the procedural motions that brought them to the floor.
and it would be once -- nice once in a while for someone just to say -- report it straight up, he appointed this person, here's their background. not why they're not gonna get nominated, not why it's not gonna happen.
let me begin by saying that the president has been closely monitoring the severe weather in the southeast. he spoke by phone with governor deal of georgia yesterday and offered his condolences and support. today, president trump is focused on fulfilling his pledge to pursue trade policies that put america first.
question: narrowing down his nominees, i should say.
in this regard, kaufman's work belongs with well-known recent studies such as j.d. vance's hillbilly elegy and arlie russell hochschild's strangers in their own land — examinations of alienation among rural (or until recently rural) americans. kaufman finds much the same core values and deep resentments in the upper midwest that these authors have found elsewhere.
he argues that walker's voter id law suppressed turnout in milwaukee and that the influx of money from conservative political action committees taking advantage of citizens united inundated candidates at the local and statewide level. for example, he reports the democratic candidate against walker in the 2012 recall election spent $4 million to walker's $30 million.

to cover these sicker patients, many insurers are requesting big premium hikes for 2017, some in the high double digit percentages.
as for unemployment benefits, the senate and house bills differ on the provisions.
trump said at the iowa rally: usmca: the biggest trade deal ever signed in the history of the world. ok, it is.
levin: i mean, there's nobody better in the postseason -- nobody.
additionally, no family with children under 5 and income less than 1.5 times the state average would pay more than 7% of their earnings for child care. that amounts to $45 a week at most for the average household according to biden's campaign site.
amid growing questions over the future of obamacare exchanges, the head of california's marketplace said the nation's largest private health insurer should take responsibility for nearly $1 billion in losses and stop blaming the federal health law.
hickenlooper said, inaccurately, that the green new deal promises every american a government job. the nonbinding resolution guarantees a job, but not necessarily one in government.
i respect his children, clinton said, adding that it says a lot about trump. i don't agree with nearly anything else he does or says.
the aca, also known as obamacare, outlawed health insurance carriers from increasing prices or denying coverage for people due to their pre-existing conditions.

i think that health care is just a mess, and he's obviously trying to move something forward on that. and i think that everyone needs to be behind the president and working together to get this taken care of for the people. whether it's eradicating obamacare or making something new, the people are suffering, and we need to be united and be behind the president to help the people. and so i think he's really trying to move that forward. so i'd give him a lot of progress points on that.
democrats on the house energy and commerce committee quickly criticized the president's remarks, tweeting that trump openly admits the gop is looking to dismantle the law through the ongoing lawsuit.
ideally, tuition benefit programs are designed in a way that address a skills gap within an employer's workforce or other challenge a company may be facing, said vivek sharma, the chief executive officer of instride, a company launched out of arizona state university this year that helps employers design and manage these programs.
we fund in excess of $2 billion a year in grants to state and local law enforcement for homeland security, for surveillance equipment, for communications commitment. and, as long as we're on a c.r., i cannot fund those new initiatives, which should be of serious concern to sheriffs, police chiefs, mayors, and governors.
french luxury goods giant lvmh mc, +0.09% countersued tiffany & co tif on monday, claiming the u.s. jeweler has been so badly damaged during the pandemic that the planned $16 billion takeover agreement is invalidated.
kelly: yes. i said last night to charles krauthammer, how will they like it if they get a republican president in there who says, you know what, i don't like these laws that prevent protests outside of abortion clinics, so i'm just going to use my discretion not to pursue any prosecutions against those people. and protest against abortion clinics grow so loud and so big that nobody can go into these clinics and get an abortion, well, so be it because that's a matter of my discretion.
there could be no greater contrast to the beautiful image of a mother holding her infant child than the chilling displays our nation saw in recent days. lawmakers in new york cheered with delight upon the passage of legislation that would allow a baby to be ripped from the mother's womb moments before birth. these are living, feeling, beautiful babies who will never get the chance to share their love and dreams with the world. and then, we had the case of the governor of virginia where he basically stated he would execute a baby after birth.
democrats have made clear they will unanimously oppose the bill. trumpcare is just a breathtakingly irresponsible piece of legislation that would endanger the health of tens of millions of americans and break the bank for millions more, said senate minority leader chuck schumer, d-n.y.

my plan is to run for president, bennet told cbs this morning co-anchor john dickerson. i think this country faces two enormous challenges, one is a lack of economic mobility and opportunity for most americans and the other is the need to restore integrity to our government.
he argued that, instead, it was necessary to talk about the value of drugs and to reexamine the role of middlemen between the drug company and the patient — such as pharmacy benefit managers that negotiate on behalf of insurance companies, wholesalers and pharmacists — which each take a cut of the price.

while discussing the complex challenges involved in repealing and replacing obamacare, kelly said, we've been handed something that never should have passed to begin with. but we're not going to do it like our friends did. we're not going to pass it to find out what's in it. we're going to find out what's in it before we pass it.
since my election, ford, fiat-chrysler, general motors, sprint, softbank, lockheed, intel, walmart, and many others, have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the united states and will create tens of thousands of new american jobs.
signed by president barack obama, who later embraced the obamacare name, the affordable care act required all americans to obtain coverage and created a marketplace for purchasing insurance. it also expanded medicaid for poor people and protected diabetics, cancer patients and other individuals with pre-existing conditions from being denied coverage.
sunlen serfaty, cnn national correspondent: well, wolf, the cruz campaign is touting that they have blanketed this state; 12,000 volunteers were deployed today to really get out the vote.
it would be a fitting tribute to john mccain, flake wrote in his retweet. kudos to senator schumer for reintroducing it.
dorothy johnson, 57, a caterer who lives in a mobile home with her disabled husband, was disappointed that the lowest obamacare premium would still cost her $56 a month, even with a subsidy.
mitch mcconnell: well, we have a new supreme court justice. we have 14 repeals of regulations. and we're only six months into it. last time i looked, the congress goes on for two years. we'll be moving on to comprehensive tax reform and to infrastructure. there's much work left to be done for the american people, and we're ready to tackle it.
so basically what these leftists are telling us is that the people in the bureaucracy are smarter, more experienced, more noble than all the plebes out there.
mm-hmm. that's exactly right. everything we believe comes from a story we've been told, and the story that has been aggressively marketed to white americans has been that there is something so wrong with black and brown people that you don't want to be in collaboration with or in solidarity with them or else that reflects on you. there is a hierarchy of human value. you'd better fight like heck to maintain your position in that hierarchy. i think it's really important not to even inadvertently communicate that there's some sort of biological basis for these group-identity-related psychologies. i talk about it in terms of the slogan that's become very popular in some places on the left. trust black women. i'm a black woman. i want you to trust me. i want to trust stacey abrams. i want you to trust ayanna pressley. i agree to a certain degree, but i was always a little bit wary of it, because it suggests there's something biologically amazing and magical about us. and in fact, it's not that. it's that there is a social hierarchy, that group identity does shape your experience of the world and how the systems shape your life, and so people who are at the intersectional bottom of that social hierarchy are the ones who have the clearest view of all of it — all who is harmed by it, and what you need to do to fix it for everyone.
kurtis: too bad she missed weed. she got seven right. that's a lot.
this trend gives obama something to boast about when it comes to his signature domestic achievement, but the affordable care act still faces considerable challenges in the next few years that could jeopardize these gains in coverage. obama has floated policies to fix some, but not all, of the problems with the law.
the report studied hundreds of cases in which medicaid was abused and defrauded to obtain opioids that were often resold on the streets. the report quotes sam quinones' award-winning book dreamland: the true tale of america's opiate epidemic to explain why this outcome was entirely predictable: we can talk morality all day long, but if you're drawing five hundred dollars a month and you have a medicaid card that allows you to get a monthly supply of pills worth several thousand dollars, you're going to sell your pills.
still, democratic leadership has worked closely with members in an effort to try and build a coalition of support. schumer has been having one-on-one conversations with individual members, trying to do the work ahead of time on what they need to support the bill.
arizona has also been a focus of priorities usa, a democratic super pac seeking to mobilize latinos in arizona and florida.
i think that's what he's going to talk about is supporting all of life, the born, the unborn, throughout life making sure that we have healthcare that can support the american people and the american families. that's -- that's what he's gonna fight for and that's what he's gonna be clear on.
in his veto message to congress, obama disagreed. obama said the affordable care act includes fairer rules and stronger consumer protections that have made health care coverage more affordable, more attainable and more patient-centered. and it is working.
the supreme court said that it may reschedule some cases from the march and april oral argument sessions that were put off before the end of its current term, scheduled to end in june. it also said that it will consider a range of scheduling options and other alternatives if arguments cannot be held in the courtroom before the end of the term.
president trump said as a result of these measures, billions of dollars will come into our treasury.
medicare for america provides comprehensive benefits – including prescription drugs, dental, vision and long-term care – to those currently on medicare, medicaid and obamacare plans, as well as to the uninsured. newborns would automatically be enrolled.
the decision raises concerns that, at least for next year, the health care law will not save people as much money as president obama claimed. on the campaign trail, obama has touted caps on out-of-pocket costs as a selling point.
the only way to survive is to diversify, hickey said.
new york is suing amazon over allege failure to provide adequate protection to its warehouse workers, the post's jay greene reports. new york attorney general letitia james has accused the company of cutting corners on health and safety requirements and retaliating against employees who complain. amazon has disputed these accusations. (amazon founder jeff bezos owns the washington post.)
today, that competitive pressure is more urgent than ever.
clinton said she supports an investigation of the russians and syrians committing war crimes in syria.
it hasn't been for a lack of trying. trump over his first 21 days in office has issued a barrage of executive actions aimed at delivering on a range of policy pledges – including many of his most aggressive and controversial. but the january 27 travel ban has become a millstone on the neck of a young administration that has spent the last two weeks digging deeper into a legal battle that now seems destined for the supreme court.
health policy analysts on both sides of the aisle also still question where health care fits on trump's priority list.
trav robertson, chairman of the south carolina democratic party, criticized party colleagues who blasted sanders for his visit and said he welcomed the visit.

it could also explode into the most heated months of the 2020 presidential showdown if obamacare's fate – for the third time – ends up before its previous savior, chief justice john roberts and his supreme court.
schilling: as conservatives, we're up against a group of people who don't have any forethought, who don't think ahead. you can't, in any realistic scenario in the real world play out this socialist dream and come to a conclusion that benefits the people. it's never worked anywhere ever.
aetna's decision to alter its marketplace participation does not change the fundamental fact that the health insurance marketplace will continue to bring quality coverage to millions of americans next year and every year after that, said kevin counihan, the exchanges ceo. it's no surprise that companies are adapting at different rates to a market where they compete for business on cost and quality rather than by denying coverage to people with preexisting conditions.
but there is an interesting question. i don't want to stretch this analogy too far. but if you're running an air game, do you need boots on the ground to win?
medicare recipients would also feel the effects. the affordable care act bolstered it in several ways, most obviously by gradually eliminating a gap in prescription drug coverage that became known as the doughnut hole. without the affordable care act in place, that gap could open back up, leaving seniors to pay more money for their drugs.
trump will likely loom large in the race. he has called mccarthy my kevin and the two have developed a close relationship. if he weighs in with an endorsement that could effectively end the race. ryan also signaled that he will talk about who he thinks should fill the post in the post, saying wednesday, i'll share those thoughts later.
meadows was a back-bencher second-term congressman when he filed a motion to vacate the chair in the summer of 2015, a bold move that would have forced a vote on whether then-speaker john boehner would be allowed to remain in his position.
these attacks were especially galling to reform proponents because it was the opposite of what they were trying to do.
now first things first, 1993, you pitched in the world series with the phillies, they lost; 2001 arizona diamondbacks, 2004, 2007 boston red sox championships. you are an 11 and 2 post season record. i just want the nation to understand how phenomenal that is. that is the greatest postseason record of any pitcher who's pitched 10 or more games in the postseason and 8.846 winning percentage.
john sides: the aclu's david cole, who represented the plaintiffs, wrote here at the washington post that while his clients lost the battle, they won the war. would you agree?
climate change: while a concern for americans of all ages, a next avenue reader survey of our 50+ readers taken before the pandemic found climate change was the no. 1 election issue for them.
given how entrenched obamacare has become, he is also in the position of looking like a leader trying to eradicate benefits – not provide new ones.
polls have shown repeatedly that medicare for all's support drops if voters think it means displacing their private insurance altogether.
i share their frustration, and i imagine most of you do, too. just this week, a member of my family endured the kafkaesque experience of being told that she needed to show up for an appointment even if she were no longer sick or face a penalty, thanks to insurance rules.
via cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak over the past month, elizabeth warren has faced more criticism than at any point since the early days of her campaign. the drama began at the last debate when her opponents swung at her from all sides.
one of the most immediate steps vice president biden would be able to take is to reopen open enrollment as needed so people who have lost insurance can sign up for new coverage, feldman says, calling it a basic step that president trump has refused to do.
asked about cruz over the next four years, retiring indiana sen. dan coats – a leading cruz critic – said: all i know is i won't be here to enjoy the theater.
it's a change that's been repeated around the country after big health insurers such as aetna, humana and united healthcare pulled out of dozens of obamacare marketplaces that they judged unprofitable.
americans surveyed last year by the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation named lowering prescription drug costs, along with lowering overall out-of-pocket health care costs, as the top health care priorities they want trump and congress to address. it's also an issue that has rare bipartisan support among respondents.
each american generation passes the torch of truth, liberty and justice — in an unbroken chain all the way down to the present.
anthony fauci, biden's top medical adviser, told the world health organization last week that the united states would revoke the mexico city policy – which blocked funding to groups that include abortion services or information in their family planning programs – as part of a broader commitment to protect women's health and advance gender equality at home and around the world.
johnson: the fbi and the department of homeland security do a pretty good job of tracking the travel of individuals of suspicion, of investigating potential acts of terror or material support to terrorism.

trump has said more than once that politically speaking, the easiest choice for republicans would be to sit back and let the system operate on its own. doing so, trump predicted, would lead to a total collapse.
president donald trump signed an executive order last october which expanded short-term insurance plans as well as association health plans (ahps).
given that the house and senate majorities were built on a promise to repeal and replace mr. obama's signature health care law, many lawmakers fear electoral repercussions. it is painfully ironic that members from safe, conservative congressional districts who can't ever quite seem to get to 'yes' make it harder to enact good, conservative public policy like repealing obamacare, said michael steel, a republican strategist and former aide to mr. boehner.
when i was a kid, everybody had a job, everybody had health care. now, look at the statistics, said mcmullin, one of the rafters.
in cities that began cooperating with secure communities, food stamp enrollment among immigrants dropped by 19 percent within five years, the report found. but in sanctuary cities around the country, there was no drop-off in snap and aca enrollment. (the study included data from the pew research center, which, like stateline, is funded by the pew charitable trusts.)
before obamacare, some states protected people with pre-existing conditions in this way, but most did not. americans with prior illnesses like cancer, asthma, even acne, often had trouble buying insurance for themselves and their families. one state that did protect people with pre-existing conditions was new york, where the media executive and presidential candidate michael bloomberg currently resides and where mr. trump did at the time. (mr. bloomberg's recent television advertisements, which attack mr. trump's health care record, appear to have prompted the tweets.)
how can the president be — how can his word be trusted on this when he's said so many things that are just not true about this crisis? karl asked, pointing to several recent examples of trump and his team misleading the public. how can the american people trust the president when he says this is a crisis when he says things over and over again that aren't true?
johnny rotten complaining about one of the most sacred of sacred cows is as punk as it gets, and so is his support of trump and brexit.
perhaps no one can reconcile all this and establish a single narrative for the wisconsin story. and kaufman does not try to disentangle all the strands of populist versus intellectual progressivism. instead, his account returns repeatedly to the trials of the present moment.
plus, the hospital is connellsville's second-largest single employer (pdf), after the school district. it contributes an estimated $15 million to the local economy, andursky said. that's in a town where unemployment's already at 7.6 percent — up from last year and higher than the state and national averages.
the american civil liberties union first brought the case over president donald trump's 'zero tolerance' policy of criminally prosecuting all border crossers, which led to the separation of hundreds of families and sparked national outrage. sabraw had ordered the administration to find and reunite separated families, they write. trump officially halted the practice with an executive order on june 20, 2018. but the aclu claimed in court that since then, the government has continued the practice and separated more than 1,000 families in violation of sabraw's order.
kodjak: under either scenario, these experts say, the changes could lead to the end of the individual health insurance market. alison kodjak, npr news, washington.
mcghee: no problem. but basically, he went and ended up sort of blaming, you know, implicitly black families for not doing enough to educate their children at home...
the lowest-income americans would be automatically enrolled in the public option without health care premiums; they could opt out at any time.
so far, sens. bernie sanders of vermont, amy klobuchar of minnesota and elizabeth warren of massachusetts, former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg and former vice president joe biden have made the stage.
garcetti on late night: los angeles mayor eric garcetti was on late night with seth meyers on tuesday and spoke about his passion for local politics – and slammed national politicians in washington, which is something he's been repeatedly doing through his stops and visits around the country in early primary states. he specifically called out washington for not acting on the issues of homelessness and daca – both of which strongly impact his city.
i don't know, said hugh crowell, 58, an environmental scientist from columbus. the line that they're taking of just very gently pointing out that trump is a potential demagogue seems to be carrying a lot of weight. i think people are listening, gradually, and i think they'll come around to that.

i know that the congress is eager to pass an infrastructure bill — and i am eager to work with you on legislation to deliver new and important infrastructure investment, including investments in the cutting edge industries of the future. this is not an option. this is a necessity.
this is the lowest rate that we have seen since we started keeping these records, obama said. we're not going backwards. we're not going to go back to a time where people could be denied because of pre-existing conditions. that's not who we are. that's who we were.
warren gunnels, sanders chief policy adviser, said even working seniors subject to additional taxes stand to save. a senior working past the age of 65 making $50,000 per year would pay less than $840 for their health care, he said. a 2014 kaiser family foundation report found the average senior pays $4,734 out of pocket for health care costs, meaning they would save more than $3,800 under sanders' plan.
the president claimed he in fact up-played covid-19, after telling washington post journalist bob woodward he always wanted to play it down.
congress could always render the lawsuit moot by approving a one-sentence law eliminating the language of the mandate, for example. so far, nobody has seriously tried to pass such a measure.
i'll always talk about it, because to me it's very important, trump said. the good thing about the debt is we're paying almost no interest. he added that more cuts would be coming but that it was crucially important to fund the military in the meantime.
earlier in the day, the president spoke with egyptian president el-sisi. they discussed ways to deepen the bilateral relationship and support egypt's fight against terrorists and bolster egypt's home- grown historic economic reform program. president trump underscored the united states remains strongly committed to the bilateral relationship, which has helped both countries overcome challenges in the region for decades. the president committed to working -- continuing to (inaudible) military assistance to egypt and working with egypt to ensure that assistance most effectively supports the egyptian military's fight against terrorism.
and it was hopeful, and it laid out an agenda.

adding a public plan in such areas would strengthen the marketplace approach, giving consumers more affordable options while also creating savings for the federal government, the president wrote.
yes, insurance companies wouldn't be allowed to refuse to offer coverage to someone who, for example, has a history of cancer or is pregnant. but they could sell someone a policy that doesn't cover cancer treatments or the birth of a child.
early next month, the court will delve into a major voting rights case from arizona that could decide whether states may ban third-party groups from collecting mail ballots from voters and turning them in to election officials. the practice, which critics call ballot harvesting, became a major target for trump in the run-up to the election.
while abortion opponents paint the new york law as an abortion free-for-all, in fact the law allows for an abortion past 24 weeks only if a health care professional determines the life or health of the mother is at risk, or the fetus is not viable.
the race suddenly went from sanders narrowly having the largest base in a crowded field to essentially a two-candidate race. and biden, who had appeared on the brink of a humiliating defeat just a few days before, cleaned up.
ivanka trump, who spent the earlier part of her sunday at a monster truck rally in baltimore, made the quick change into a strapless black gown, posing for a photo with jared kushner outside their home in dc's kalorama neighborhood.
medicare-for-all would end up as one of the defining issues of the 2020 primary, surfacing in numerous debates. even opponents of the effort, like former south bend, ind., mayor pete buttigieg, framed their own health care proposals on sanders' terms.
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.):
allowing insurers to offer non-obamacare-qualified plans. this mirrors an idea that texas sen. ted cruz and utah sen. mike lee had proposed in recent weeks: the senate's bill would allow an insurer to offer skimpier plans. as long as an insurer does offer a plan on the individual insurance exchanges that meets the demands of obamacare's title i (for example, covering certain areas like preventive care and protecting people with pre-existing conditions), that insurer will be allowed to offer additional plans off of the individual insurance exchanges that don't meet those criteria.
■ two weeks later, mr. trump declared he would not run, citing his passion for business and a new contract with nbc for celebrity apprentice.
tonight, we are also joined by pittsburgh survivor judah samet. he arrived at the synagogue as the massacre began. but not only did judah narrowly escape death last fall — more than seven decades ago, he narrowly survived the nazi concentration camps. today is judah's 81st birthday. judah says he can still remember the exact moment, nearly 75 years ago, after 10 months in a concentration camp, when he and his family were put on a train, and told they were going to another camp. suddenly the train screeched to a halt. a soldier appeared. judah's family braced for the worst. then, his father cried out with joy: it's the americans.
some of the other unhappy campers interviewed by the times described themselves as living in fear because obamacare has forced them to make do without health insurance. some were willing to pay the inflated obama premiums at first, but bailed out as soon as they actually tried to use their benefits and were hit with jaw-dropping deductibles. what ringing endorsements of the president's scheme!
in a critique of the senate's better care reconciliation act, several heritage experts advocated for shifting medicaid to what's known as a premium support system involving private plans, rolling back obamacare's requirements for insurers to cover certain preventive services, and permanently repealing its tax on high-cost health plans.
elizabeth 'pocahontas' warren, who was going nowhere except into mini mike's head, just dropped out of the democrat primary...three days too late, trump wrote, referring to warren's previous claims of native american ancestry. she cost crazy bernie, at least, massachusetts, minnesota and texas. probably cost him the nomination! came in third in mass.
leftist in sports can do pretty much whatever they want to do. they can take knees. they can do this. they can do that. conservatives in sports had to be very careful because even the sports media is quite left-wing.
i wish he'd maybe speak less, the twitter feed can just go. you know, i'm excited to see that he got tax reform through. it's a challenge other presidents haven't gotten accomplished.
we must choose between greatness or gridlock, results or resistance, vision or vengeance, incredible progress or pointless destruction.
what i did not see, for example, was republican governors refusing [federal] medicaid dollars that would provide health insurance to millions of their people.
permanent spoiler alert: we simply can't imagine anyone other than donald j. trump ever occupying the top spot in the rankings. but we won't get tired of him winning. believe me.

the new research contributes to the limited knowledge on how medicaid expansion affects health outcomes, said dr. olena mazurenko, an assistant professor in the richard m. fairbanks school of public health at the indiana university-purdue university indianapolis campus, who was not involved in the research.
we're eyes wide open to the fact that when it's signed, we can't just cease our communication efforts, white house press secretary jen psaki, who helped lead communications efforts around the stimulus bill, told huffpost in an interview. i think it'll be different than what we did with the [2009 stimulus].
trump and his advisers have repeatedly said they support some form of taxation on imports. one possibility is the plan proposed by republicans in the house, including speaker paul d. ryan (wis.), which would tax imports at the regular rate on corporate income.

mr. trump's chumminess with heitkamp has evoked the annoyance of her republican opponent, rep. kevin cramer, who has suggested that mr. trump was not targeting heitkamp forcefully because of her gender. however, in a june rally, mr. trump went after heitkamp, saying that she was liberal who voted in line with senate minority leader chuck schumer and house minority leader nancy pelosi.

he has a more direct approach to politics and policies and how he handles things, and from what i've seen, he seems to care about the issues of baltimore city, which is something that we desperately need, baylor said.
the louisiana republican became a national figure after his near-death experience last june when he was shot by a gunman targeting gop members at a morning baseball practice. his remarkable recovery was featured in a 60 minutes story and after returning and being barely able to stand, scalise now is walking with crutches and has hit the campaign trail to raise money for his colleagues.
-- it will be cold and windy in d.c. today, foreshadowing possible weekend snow. the capital weather gang forecasts: sunshine is back in control. a few scattered clouds race by as northwest winds gust as high as 35 mph. highs in the upper 30s to low 40s feel about 10 degrees colder thanks to those unabating winds.
i never did politics before. now i do politics. i will tell you i'm very disappointed at certain people, particularly one, for not having pushed this faster. but i've learned. [was it former] speaker [paul] ryan? let's not talk about it, what difference does it make? but they should have pushed it faster. they should have pushed it harder, and they didn't, they didn't. if they would have, it would have been a little bit better.
acp recommends transitioning to a system that achieves universal coverage with essential benefits and lower administrative costs through two potential approaches: a single payer financing system or a publicly-financed coverage option with regulated private insurance, the group writes in a policy framework.
on the other side, if punditry is to be believed, there are the medicare for all hard-liners who believe in expanding a significantly improved medicare system to every american, with coverage that includes dental, vision and long-term care. this is portrayed as radical or even unreasonable.
clinton then began to shift the subject to news about the u.s. intelligence community accusing russia of hacking into u.s. political groups in an effort to undermine the election. she went on to accuse trump of having ties to russia and called on trump to release his tax returns. he said he'll release them when his audit is over.
perhaps the biggest change in the document released thursday is that it leaves in place the affordable care act taxes on wealthy individuals. it uses that money to reduce the number of people left without insurance coverage by the law's changes. this latest version adds $70 billion to a fund for states — bringing the total to $132 billion — to help support coverage of low-income people.
cuando la transición comenzó a hacerse eterna, obama experimentó una creciente inquietud ante una actitud que le parecía la alegre indiferencia del nuevo presidente y su equipo de novatos. muchos de ellos ignoraron por completo los documentos de información que el personal de obama había preparado con tanto empeño, recuerdan sus antiguos colaboradores, y en lugar de centrarse en la política o en el funcionamiento del ala oeste, preguntaron por la calidad de los tacos en el comedor del sótano o dónde encontrar un buen apartamento.
this idea — aimed at addressing persistent affordability concerns among middle-income earners — was a mainstay of biden's health-care plan during the campaign. it's also included in the coronavirus relief package congress is working to pass.
some lawmakers and activists stress the importance of spending the money in smart ways by sending it to the highest-need areas and investing in evidence-based practices proven to help those struggling with drug addiction.
then the news broke yesterday that trump has asked comey to stay on. normally, this would not be surprising because he's only four years into a 10-year term. but the president had said previously that he would not decide whether he should stay on until they had a private meeting.
medicaid would be phased out under the bill beginning in 2021, with gradual reductions until 2024 in the amount of federal obamacare funds that have financed the entitlement program's expansion. the senate bill would also slash funding to medicaid from what republicans call gimmicks that drive up federal costs. president trump repeatedly promised during the 2016 presidential campaign that he would not cut medicaid, medicare or social security.
we just haven't seen any move toward that end from the administration, she said.
he will be a trusted problem solver who is able to help northern ireland transition through the difficulties of brexit, manning said.
either way, the process is opaque, even for the often-byzantine senate. no written decision is formally issued and sometimes even the staff can be unsure why the parliamentarian ruled the way they did or how much weight as a precedent a call has.
but, as the threat grows, the department of homeland security may shut down in a matter of weeks because congress is blocking its money in a partisan fight over immigration.
while it seems that every candidate — including president trump — is vowing these days to protect people with preexisting conditions, you can't just click your heels together three times and make it come true, larry levitt, senior vice president of the henry j. kaiser family foundation, wrote recently.
the democratic party doesn't stand for very much at the national level with respect to what the american people think, argued bennet. a process like this is long overdue in the democratic party.
last august, four cities sued the administration for undermining the act. the cities — baltimore, chicago, cincinnati and columbus, ohio — accused the administration of actively discouraging enrollment, raising rates and limiting health-care services.
all of this is embedded in really what we're seeing across the board in the city of new orleans, cantrell says. and really the state of louisiana is on the front line as it relates to these matters
[it is a lie] that the white working class that finds itself attracted to trump has been victimized by outside forces. it hasn't. the white middle class may like the idea of trump as a giant pulsing humanoid middle finger held up in the face of the cathedral, they may sing hymns to trump the destroyer and whisper darkly about globalists and — odious, stupid term — the establishment, but nobody did this to them. they failed themselves. ... if you spend time in hardscrabble, white upstate new york, or eastern kentucky, or my own native west texas, and you take an honest look at the welfare dependency, the drug and alcohol addiction, the family anarchy — which is to say, the whelping of human children with all the respect and wisdom of a stray dog — you will come to an awful realization. ... the truth about these dysfunctional, downscale communities is that they deserve to die.
friday. the 2018 american society of clinical oncology annual meeting begins on
the republican nominee has led some to conclude that he intends a sweeping expansion of presidential authority. his rhetoric implies a muscular, almost unitary, presidency that would be at least as expansive as what historian arthur schlesinger jr. famously dubbed the imperial presidency — his critique of richard nixon's abuse of power in the era of watergate and vietnam.
why trump would expect to get democratic votes when he was gunning to gut their primary domestic policy achievement and refusing to talk to them about doing so is not clear. but he clearly felt that it was in their self-interest to have worked with him even though he never asked. speaking to reporters, the president said he expected democrats to now be supportive of reform because they'd have no one else to blame when or if obamacare collapsed.
bias in lending, as well as predatory financing that focused on black americans in the years before the 2008 recession, have been key reasons for the wide wealth gap between blacks and whites, experts say, leaving african americans at a disadvantage when it comes to passing down resources to future generations or funding the launch of a business.
in other words: future economic growth isn't expected to benefit poor people, which will accelerate the aca's overall costs.
well, i think they have lurched in a completely different direction, a radical left direction.

there are four people testifying for democrats: sara collins from the nonpartisan commonwealth fund; dr. doris browne, the former president of the national medical association; dr. farzon nahvi, an emergency physician and professor in new york city; and dean baker, the co-founder of the center for economic and policy research.
the iran deal used to be important to the ideologically based republican party, which no longer exists, tyler said. trump's supporters are not paying attention to policy in any deep way. it's basically: 'whatever trump says goes, and that's fine with us.'
the clinton-sanders rift would never fully heal, and indeed resurfaced several times when he ran again four years later.
i will need some time to absorb this, but i want cindy —and the entire mccain family — to know they are in my prayers. — lindsey graham (@lindseygrahamsc) august 26, 2018
washington ― in 2017, now-arizona sen. martha mcsally really, really wanted to repeal obamacare. mcsally, then a congresswoman, reportedly stood up in the middle of a gop conference meeting and urged her colleagues to vote for a bill to gut the signature democratic domestic policy achievement of the past decade, telling them to get this fucking thing done.

that plan has garnered support from at least eight declared or potential 2020 democratic candidates: rep. eric swalwell, d-calif.; sens. elizabeth warren, d-mass., cory booker, d-n.j., bernie sanders, i-vt., and jeff merkley, d-ore.; obama hud secretary julian castro; rep. tulsi gabbard, d-hawaii; and former texas rep. beto o'rourke.
but bentlage, 60, hadn't yet logged on to healthcare.gov, the federal insurance marketplace, to shop for a plan. he did that over the weekend and afterward, he was much happier.
more than 300,000 people have now died from the coronavirus in the u.s., according to data from johns hopkins university. the u.s. has set records for covid-19 hospitalizations for eight days in a row, and the number of patients requiring intensive care is up 80% from a month ago.
and although it's impossible to know what role health care played in that race, analysts agree it was a big reason why republicans nationally suffered such big losses, enough to cost them control of the house of representatives.
there are not 50 votes signed on the dotted line, the democratic senator told cnn on the state of talks right now. i have still got changes to this package that i want.
the 63-year-old lives in venice beach where there has been a surge of homeless vagrants that have vandalized his multi-million dollar home and spoiled the beaches with poo and needles.
repealing the 40 percent excise tax on generous employer-sponsored health plans would increase projected federal deficits by $197 billion through 2029, according to the budget office, and so far there is no plan for replacing the lost revenue. many health economists, who have generally been the biggest supporters of the tax, still see it as an important way to contain rising health care costs, contending that generous health benefits encourage people to get more medical care than they need.
monday's rallies were the latest in what has been a seemingly endless string of protests against the president. several cities hosted similar events over the weekend.
secondly, we should help americans purchase their own coverage, through the use of tax credits and expanded health savings accounts — but it must be the plan they want, not the plan forced on them by the government.
that more contemporary story begins as republican scott walker wins the governorship in 2010, the tea party year, running against obamacare and the democratic power structure in madison, the state capital. walker would drive legislation known as act 10 to take down the public employee unions (including their right to collective bargaining). he would then survive a recall, win re-election and push new legislation to make wisconsin a right-to-work state in 2015, breaking a promise he had made to the private sector unions.
-- the federal hiring freeze trump put into place on monday could turn out to be a more symbolic, less forceful measure than it appears to be, lisa rein reports – and in fact, the memo regarding the 2.1 million civilians in the federal workforce leaves plenty of room for exceptions: federal offices in many corners of government could continue to hire, as long as the job has — or can be construed to have — a national security or public safety mission. individual cabinet secretaries and agency heads have broad leeway to decide on exemptions. and the hiring ban is scheduled to last 90 days, after which the [omb] is slated to come up with a long-term plan to shrink the federal workforce through attrition. a more permanent approach would still constitute a freeze of sorts but would resemble more of a selective slowdown, experts said. yet the language of the memorandum instituting the freeze is so vague that a day after trump signed it, agency officials were scrambling to determine whether and how the move will affect them.

during the speech, trump listed off several of his administration's accomplishments, notably the passage of tax cuts and repealing the individual mandate under obamacare.
one by one, republican faithful are coming out of the woodwork to bemoan the gop tax bill's negative impact on average americans, the north dakota democratic party's alex rich said after price and rubio's comments. north dakota sen. heidi heitkamp is one of the most vulnerable democrats up for re-election this year.

sometimes, it isn't until after the interview that an employee gets a real sense of the company's culture. take into consideration how you fit in and what you're doing to get there. this could take a negative turn for your new job, unfortunately, but that's okay, salemi said. people can become numb to unpleasant situations, such as a rude coworker, which can create workplace conflicts. it's better to be honest about these situations, and take note of what you like and don't like about the place for when you're looking for your next job. if after a few months you don't plan to stick it out, be honest with future interviewers about your values, what you want out of a job and what you can give. you want to be vigilant in the first 100 days, and self-aware, salemi said.
trump's sotu health care talk is a smokescreen to make us forget his miserable record
if we are in something of a go-slow holding pattern, he said, i don't expect it will last very long.
if we can repeal part of obamacare as part of a tax bill, and have a tax bill that is still a good tax bill that can pass, that's great, mulvaney said in a cnn interview. if it becomes an impediment to getting the best tax bill we can, then we're okay with taking it out. so i think it is up to the house and the senate to hammer out those details.
as insurers finalize plans for participating in the 2018 exchanges, policy experts have speculated that the uncertainty surrounding the affordable care act will lead insurers to continue to pull back from some markets or exit them altogether, leaving a growing number of people with fewer, pricier options.
in advance of the speech, which the romney campaign billed as major, the conservative wall street journal editorial page hammered the massachusetts republican on the issue, writing: mr. romney now claims obamacare should be repealed, but his failure to explain his own role or admit any errors suggests serious flaws both in his candidacy and as a potential president.
i imagine going forward, he's gonna engage in south carolina in a very different way, mitchell said.
we must choose whether we will squander our inheritance — or whether we will proudly declare that we are americans. we do the incredible. we defy the impossible. we conquer the unknown.
three years ago, when i was in south carolina and other states campaigning, my opponent and editorial writers all across the country ... they said, 'bernie sanders is nuts. he is far out. his ideas are extreme. nobody supports those wild ideas,' he said with a mock sense of alarm. well, guess what happened folks? three years have come and gone, and those ideas that were seen to be radical and extreme three years ago are today mainstream, supported by the vast majority of america.
meanwhile, four states have signed on to join 16 states and the district in an effort to defend the affordable care act. colorado, iowa, michigan and nevada filed a motion to intervene last thursday, arguing that they should be allowed to intervene in the lawsuit to protect their existing health-care infrastructure, which would be 'thrown into disarray' if the affordable care act, or aca, was ruled unconstitutional, the nevada independent's megan messerly reports.
for his part, mr. trump criticized the aca and praised republicans in congress for excising the individual mandate from the law. he also said he asked his administration to run [obamacare] as well as you can, and said the cost of premiums have declined.
this isn't the first time obama has weighed in on events during donald trump's presidency. in late january, in the wake of trump's travel ban executive order – and the protests that almost immediately sprung up – the former president released a statement through a spokesman praising the demonstrations as what we expect to see when american values are at stake.
with the help of prime minister justin trudeau, we have formed a council with our neighbors in canada to help ensure that women entrepreneurs have access to the networks, markets and capital they need to start a business and live out their financial dreams.
recently, i followed the outrage over a new york abortion law, which conservatives claim allows abortion even as the woman is giving birth, and the gop's failed attempt to pass the born-alive abortion survivors protection act, which would add specific penalties for actions already illegal under a prior law that received bipartisan support in 2002.
senator rubio did meet with mr. crane, and we welcome his suggestions to improve the bill, rubio's spokesman alex conant wrote in an april 2013 email to breitbart news. our legislation is not a take-it or leave-it proposition – we welcome input and ideas from mr. crane and other law enforcement officials as the senate works to improve the proposal… ultimately, we share mr. crane's frustrations with the current, broken immigration system and his frustrations with the current administration's failure to enforce our laws. that is why we're working to fix the system, and why we want law enforcement's input.
self-described socialist sen. bernie sanders of vermont, who says he will launch a political revolution if elected president in november, has made his radical medicare-for-all proposal the centerpiece of his campaign.
so in that context, it makes sense that these senators would want to have a bill they can cite as evidence that they don't think people with pre-existing conditions should be excluded from the health care system. the legislation doesn't actually do that, but it's enough for a campaign ad.
now that democrats will control the u.s. senate, president-elect joe biden is poised to implement an agenda that could affect the personal finances of millions of americans, from how much they pay in income taxes to whether they can pare college debt – or afford college at all.
sanders also has a proposal in the works. an outline provided to npr shows the plan would be more sweeping than booker's pilot program by establishing 2,500 job centers nationwide.

many ended up buying more generous plans, while others kept their plans and just pocketed the savings. restoring csr funding now would reverse that process ― reducing premiums on the subsidized plans, but reducing tax credits too. the federal government would end up spending less money subsidizing insurance, but lower-income consumers would actually have to pay a lot more to keep the same plans.
wednesday . the health it expo begins on
david blanchflower, an economics professor at dartmouth college, thinks full employment is closer to an unemployment rate of 2.5%, which would mean that the fed needn't be in such a hurry about raising interest rates.
for republicans, the 48-year-old is a young and personally unassailable nominee.
sanders released details of his plan following pressure from clinton and her allies. one independent analysis, by gerald friedman, an economist at the university of massachusetts at amherst, found sanders proposal would reduce health care spending in the u.s. by $6 trillion over the next 10 years. sanders says the typical family earning $50,000 a year would save nearly $6,000 annually in health care costs.
it will be a fundamental broken promise if the bill fails, ryan said wednesday on hugh hewitt's radio how. there is no more prominent promise any republican has made over the last seven years than this one.
-- republican senators promised william barr would not interfere with mueller's investigation if he is confirmed as attorney general. karoun demirjian, seung min kim and devlin barrett report: 'based on what i heard, he has a high opinion of mr. mueller, believes mr. mueller is doing a professional job, will do a professional job and be fair to the president and the country as a whole,' senate judiciary committee chairman lindsey o. graham (r-s.c.) told reporters, adding that barr sees 'no reason for mr. mueller to stop doing his job and is committed to allowing mr. mueller to finish.' graham is one of four republican senators with whom barr met on wednesday, as he prepares for a two-part confirmation hearing before the senate judiciary committee next tuesday and wednesday. sen. john cornyn (r-tex.), one of the senators who met with barr on wednesday afternoon, emerged citing similar confidence that the nominee would be largely hands-off when it came to mueller's probe.
trump said he agreed to pulling the bill once ryan made it clear the legislation lacked the votes to pass.
(cnn) — donald trump soltó una fuerte retórica contra sus rivales así como contra un manifestante que estaba en una congregación del lunes por la noche, en el crepúsculo antes de las asambleas electorales de nevada.
kelly: right. i mean, he had control, the democrats of the house and senate, he didn't prioritize this. he didn't push for it. and when the democrats lost the house, years after he decided to push for it and he couldn't get it through. it's not like he's never believed that this is within congress' authority. he tried. congress said, no. and who are these congressmen? not just some random people who i don't know how they wound up in washington. they're the people's representatives. they get a vote. their vote was no. and now he's just so irritated, he said, well, too bad. i'm going to do it on my own. how can that be? how can that be allowed?
it's not like we're looking around and saying, 'hey, you know what would be a great idea? attacking stimulus checks to people,'  one senior gop official told cnn.
spicer: well, first, i would argue that bilateral deals are mostly what china's been engaging in, and that's something that i just said that we're gonna -- you know, the president's gonna look to countries to engage with.
plus, with an annual salary of $255,300 for associate supreme court justices, this elite group of jurists likely doesn't feel the pain of out-of-pocket costs as much as the average aca recipient. the high court doesn't disclose how many justices opt for the federal employees health benefits program. they are allowed to receive coverage elsewhere, such as through a spouse's plan.
instead of (unconstitutionally) subjecting everyone to a one-size-fits-all health insurance plan with deductibles so high that people can't afford to use them, health care reform should allow for a diversity of choices.
a firm union will be of the utmost moment to the peace and liberty of the states, as a barrier against domestic faction and insurrection. – alexander hamilton, federalist no. 9

pete buttigieg: it's original. i'll give you that.
mcauliffe told the crowd he expected they would have the greatest nga meeting in the history of nga meetings and offered a toast to the president.
so let's look at obama's track record to find evidence of anti-colonial mindset, itself a phrase devoid of much meaning but for argument's sake will translate as anti-western populism.
we've all been drinking from a fire hose since noon last friday. to help you not lose track, here are 11 moves by team trump that would lead the news in any ordinary time but have gotten relatively little public attention:
policy experts are urging more end-of-life conversations not just to accommodate patients' desires, but to save money on aggressive medical interventions that patients and their families don't want and that won't prolong life.
but two things were missing: money and a detailed plan.
levin: well, here's what i want to add to this. the first civil rights amendments were the post-civil war amendments. the first civil rights law was proposed by eisenhower in 1956. the '64 civil rights act, the '65 civil rights voting rights acts, the vast majority of republicans voted for both. i happen to disagree with goldwater on this.
clinton added that she worked to change the adoption and foster care system and she worked to rebuild new york after 9/11 and get healthcare for first responders.
schilling: yes. the democrats, when they want something, they don't care. they'll go -- they'll ruin your life. they'll ruin lives. they'll do whatever they need to do to get what they want. we've always been, excuse me. may i, please. i'm sorry. in the sense that you know, we don't want to play dirty pool because we don't believe that dirty pool is a way to play.
attorney general nominee jeff sessions won't commit to recusing himself from potential justice department investigations into controversies involving trump — from russia to business conflicts of interest — despite his vigorous campaigning on behalf of trump during the 2016 election season, politico's seung min kim reports. in written responses to members of the senate judiciary committee, sessions said repeatedly that he is 'not aware of a basis to recuse myself' from issues surrounding trump such as potential violations of the emoluments clause, a constitutional ban on officials accepting payments from foreign governments. that differs from sessions' vow to recuse himself from any ongoing issues involving the federal probe into clinton's use of a private email server. sessions said during his confirmation hearing that he would step aside from any such investigations because his political rhetoric against clinton during the campaign 'could place my objectivity in question.
an estimated 27 million people may have lost job-based coverage due to layoffs, and it's unclear what — if anything — they're turning to as a fallback. people who lose employer health care are eligible for a special sign-up period for subsidized plans under the obama-era law. many may also qualify for medicaid.
in the fight to replace obamacare, vice president mike pence decided to pay the freedom caucus a visit. but it's who's missing that has everyone talking. nathan rousseau smith (@fantasticmrnate) explains.
generally we'd like to avoid including generals mattis and mcmaster in our rankings because, although trump's over-reliance on active duty or recently retired military personnel for national security jobs is concerning, at least these men are qualified for their positions and are a major improvement over trump's favorite good guy, the corrupt, vengeful hothead michael flynn.
yet, the trump administration and republican lawmakers have been prone to say things that are unhelpful to the candidates they back or legislation they championed. this week alone, the vice president praised a controversial former sheriff in arizona who is running against a sitting gop congresswoman. and a former trump cabinet official and sitting gop senator criticized republicans' major legislative achievement, tax reform.
last month, the president secured a promise from chinese president xi jinping to ban all variants of fentanyl, although government officials said it is too early to tell whether the chinese government will follow through amid the escalating trade war.
the breakfast was an opportunity for the president to hear directly from america's top business leaders about the challenges they're facing and take some suggestions about what policies and action can be taken to help them create jobs and grow our manufacturing base. the meeting included a really great exchange of ideas and the president has decided to reconvene the group in a month and then have them meet on a quarterly basis.
it's been more than 18 months since that conversation – and nearly seven years since president barack obama signed and affordable care act into law – but trump and republicans do not yet have a viable replacement to shop. in a sunday interview with fox news, the president called the process very complicated and suggested it could last into 2018 – a midterm election year.
levin: before he became a republican, before he decided to run, before he was the nominee, before he was president of the united states, the liberals loved them. the media loved him. hollywood loved him and they couldn't say enough good things about him. they took his money. they took his donations. they made money off of his program. all of that was well and good

by wednesday afternoon arpaio was touting pence's words: i was humbled by the kind words from @vp and the standing ovations from the packed house at the @americafirstpol rally yesterday.
inskeep: ok. now, let's talk about that because that in and out in 15 minutes, that's about the efficiency of the system. that's about doctors being pressed to see a lot of people very, very quickly. we're in the midst of implementing obamacare, which is about insuring people but also about cutting down costs in the system. has obamacare made people's experiences any better or worse the last couple of years?
when sanders attacks me for having baggage, i have to tell you the 60-plus candidates that i campaigned for, the toughest districts in the country just two years ago, don't see me as baggage and they wanted me in their districts, he said.
on thursday, the president did a fox news interview, delivered a speech in michigan nominally about the new us-mexico-canada agreement, and held a campaign rally in des moines, iowa. he was dishonest in all three venues, repeating some of his favorite falsehoods in rapid succession.
talks for bipartisan legislation on improving roads, railway systems and other infrastructure needs could be back on the table, especially due to the climate crisis and after winter storms crippled southern states and texas.
for trump's people — the working-class voters who backed a bumptious billionaire who they hoped would shake up things as their champion — the betrayal is clear and specific. many of these americans voted for trump in 2016 despite thinking he was unfit for office. they knew he was a scoundrel, but they hoped he would be their scoundrel. as he nears the end of his first term, it is increasingly clear that they voted for a con man without realizing they were the mark.
rep. dave brat (r-va), a member of the house freedom caucus, told breitbart news daily on thursday that newly tapped national economic council chairman larry kudlow is going to be a breath of fresh air in the white house.
in september 2017, attorney general jeff sessions announced that daca — which shields young illegal aliens from deportation — would end on march 5. however, since then, a california judge claimed the decision to end daca violated regulatory procedures because it quickly ended amnesty for the hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens.
uniontown, about 15 miles away, is also in fayette county. it has 175 beds — more than double highlands — but no behavioral health services to treat problems like addiction. frick, another small rural hospital about 12 miles away, technically serves neighboring westmoreland county. for more serious conditions, and trauma care, university hospitals are about an hour away — in pittsburgh on one end, and morgantown, west virginia, on the other. patients in extremis often get stabilized at the local hospitals before transfer.
johnson: if people in congress want to have that debate about immigration reform, let's have that debate, but don't tie that to funding public safety at homeland security for the american people. we need a fully funded department right now. bash: actually, since you mentioned the -- the potential risks,
a top white house adviser said sunday that the trump administration may use its executive authority to weaken or effectively eliminate obamacare's individual mandate.
but the plan was attacked by democrats as a step back from the affordable care act's protections, and it was unlikely to win acceptance from conservative republicans who want to get rid of the law and its tax increases as soon as possible. if anything, the proposal — by senators bill cassidy of louisiana, a medical doctor, and susan collins of maine, a moderate republican — may show how difficult it will be for republicans to enact a replacement for the affordable care act.
less than two weeks later, wikileaks released a trove of hacked and stolen emails revealing that several democratic national committee staffers had a clear preference for clinton over sanders. angry sanders supporters marched through the streets in philadelphia, and disrupted the first day of the party's convention.
meanwhile, de blasio on sunday said he wouldn't rule out running for president in 2020.
i cannot sell trump in my community, price said. his attitude and his comments are very negative, and he's just hollering.
the current unemployment rate of 3.9 percent refers to the portion of people who are actively looking for work right now who can't find a job.
some of the loudest jeers came over republicans' promise to repeal and replace the affordable care act as people held up red cards signaling their discontent.

on top of that, the economy is booming: jobs are being created, real wages are up for the first time in decades, energy prices are low, and the trump policies that have made us energy independent have ensured no spike in pump costs when things go sideways overseas — such as this recent dust up with iran. honestly, you cannot overestimate how this kind of stability affects people's peace of mind.
i want to point out one theme that keeps popping up in altman's piece — and existed long before obamcare: a lot of americans are deeply frustrated by the logistical headaches built into our health care system.

eliminating the filibuster would mitigate, although not eliminate, the small-state bias ― and obama said that may be necessary. when i pressed to see if he'd endorse the idea more clearly, he said, that's a longer argument and discussion to have. (several months later, at the funeral of democratic rep. john lewis of georgia, obama offered a stronger endorsement for ending the 60-vote requirement, though he was specifically speaking about voting rights legislation.)
tom williams via getty images there's wariness that the hearing on medicare for all could end up supporting house speaker nancy pelosi's position that the best way forward is to make fixes to the affordable care act.
he lives in an alternative reality, clinton said. his plan will give the wealthy and corporations the biggest tax cuts they've ever had.
* top conservative says tax cuts don't have to be paid for: on abc's this week, rep. mark meadows, the head of the freedom caucus, which just helped kill the gop health plan, said he won't hold out for tax cuts to be paid for.
before the current stalemate set a new record, the longest shutdown lasted 21 days and occurred in late 1995 and early 1996. the lapse in government funding was triggered by a budget battle between president bill clinton and house speaker newt gingrich. it ended when the two sides agreed to a seven-year budget plan with some spending cuts and tax increases.
levin: all right, we'll be right back.
pelosi told fox news she destroyed the speech because it was the courteous thing to do considering the alternatives and said she was trying to find one page with truth on it but couldn't.

mental health crisis isn't about guns. it's about trump & gop gutting medicaid: kennedy
russia is new in terms of nuclear. we are old, we are tired, we are exhausted in terms of nuclear, trump said.
question: first of all, congratulations and thanks for taking my question. getting back to saturday at the cia and your statement here at the podium. why make this crowd side issue -- or crowd size issue something to talk about at all? i mean, why get into it? did it bother the president that much that he felt that you needed to come out here and straighten that out for us? and why did he choose the cia as the venue to talk about that?
despite ongoing speculation of her possible retirement, ginsburg signaled last summer that she has no plans to leave the bench.
everyone is in the same place, one house democratic lawmaker told cnn. there are things we want fixed, but we aren't aggressively opposed. it is the president's first major package, and there are a lot of people who feel like this is his first ask, so for all those factors people are not aggressively threatening not to vote for it.
turley: well, it does sound like congress is going to aggressively assert its authority through legislation and other means. what congress and what the american people have to insist on from this president is a limiting principle. what the president is saying lacks a limiting principle. he's basically saying if these reports are correct that he can claim discretion to simply not enforce a federal law. well, that comes very close if doesn't cross the line of legislation. if a president can do that, as you've said, he can do that with environmental laws or anti-discrimination laws. the american people have got to force this issue and say, look, we may agree with you on what you're trying to do. but we don't agree how you're trying to do it.
put another way, the court doesn't lead as much as it follows.
president donald trump is threatening to declare a national emergency so he can access federal funds to build a wall along the u.s.-mexico border. that would allow the government to reopen since the shutdown stems from a budget battle between the white house and congressional democrats over border wall funding.
and as to his claims about how long veterans were waiting for care previously, the government accountability office found in april 2018 that the va cannot systematically monitor the timeliness of veterans' access to choice program care because it lacks complete, reliable data to do so.
normally, the u.s. department of justice defends federal laws from challenges like this. not this time. instead, attorney general jeff sessions is asking a federal judge to leave most of the law in place, except for the parts about protecting people with pre-existing conditions. no, really.
but that was in the 1960s. today we are in 2019, sanders concluded. in my view, now is the time, not for tinkering around the edges ... now is the time to do what the american people want us to do, now is the time to pass a medicare for all, single-payer program.
whether the upsides of the alexander-collins package justify its downsides has been the subject of increasingly intense debate among democrats and progressive analysts in the last few weeks. families usa, a liberal organization and prominent advocate for coverage expansions, actually came out in opposition to the bill.
the post's editorial board says the senate should not confirm sessions until he agrees to such a recusal: mr. trump has tapped rod j. rosenstein, a respected career prosecutor, to be deputy attorney general. mr. sessions should have no qualms about entrusting him with these politically vexing issues. it would raise confidence in his justice department and save him plenty of headaches.
cornish: so we're talking about what seems like minor glitches, right - the smokers thing or some of these other rules. but at some point, does all this sort of combine to create a sense that the rollout of the law is kind of coming off the rails?
the libertarian cato institute fact-checked trump's dire warnings about undocumented immigrants:
you know, i said everyone would say they oppose obamacare, but there's actually one candidate on that stage – well, actually technically speaking now not on that stage – who doesn't say that, cruz said. donald is entitled to have that view. you might even call that view a new york value. you know, as donald might observe, both he and bernie sanders are native new yorkers.
the rhetoric harkens back to earlier this decade when republicans lashed out at former president barack obama for including similar provider payment cuts in the affordable care act, saying that he was hurting the elderly.
eleven of the 12 fictitious applicants were able to dupe the system using invalid social security numbers as well as inaccurate citizenship information, according to the report. the 11 were given the go-ahead to receive $30,000-a-year in health care credits and subsidies.
the insurer will stop offering policies on the exchanges in 11 of the 15 states where it currently operates, according to a press release it issued monday evening. aetna (aet) will only sell obamacare products in delaware, iowa, nebraska and virginia.
the republican argument, which eventually gained traction with readers and viewers, held that private enterprise knew what was best and should be left to its own devices. executives and their allies in elective office advanced climate change skepticism in the service of environmental deregulation; during george w. bush's presidency, they advocated partial privatization of social security; they defended the right of bake shops to decline customers ordering same-sex wedding cakes; they argued successfully on behalf of companies like hobby lobby declining to pay for employees' contraceptive care under obamacare; they battled the nebulous foe of political correctness, labeling those on the left as snowflakes for favoring, in their view, restrictions, not freedom, in the domain of political speech.
medicaid has also been the target of criticism and targeted changes from officials because it benefits those on the lower end of the income scale, offering services for americans earning only up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (that threshold is lower in states that haven't expanded medicaid under the aca). shalala made this observation, too: fewer capitol hill staffers specialize in medicaid policy compared to medicare policy, since medicaid is run by the states.
tolson: well, i think he's done well for jobs. obviously, the statistics out there are showing that jobs are on the rise. i think the border wall - he's getting a lot of opposition there. but i think his stance on trying to move forward with illegal people coming into the country - we see that those statistics are down, so i think he's making progress there. so i think that those two things are definitely part of what he's wanting to move forward. and that seems to be getting support in moving forward.
karen pollitz: the mandate to have health insurance or pay a penalty, the mandate on employers to provide health benefits and the tax credits and cost-sharing subsidies that make it affordable for people to get health insurance would be repealed.
using the hospital funds to pay for uninsured coronavirus patients could be a targeted way to pay for coronavirus care for the growing number of americans who lack health insurance. but critics say it may not go to hospitals in the states hit the hardest so far and does little to address concerns over the millions of people now without coverage for medical care unrelated to the virus.
this time, activists see a turning point with not just alabama, but with the confirmation of brett kavanaugh to the supreme court, solidifying a 5-4 conservative majority. the threat of the court overturning roe v. wade is suddenly real.
.@realdonaldtrump will try to call not my presidents' day rallies in britain fake news, but really they're accurate af. — chris walker (@thatchriswalker) february 20, 2017
the herd immunity strategy would also yield far more deaths, as stephanopoulos pointed out.
this all means that the new version doesn't make major changes to one big part of the bcra: medicaid. under the original senate bill, the obamacare medicaid expansion would be rolled back, and medicaid spending would be capped — states would either be allotted a certain amount per capita, or they could get a block grant instead. it also caps medicaid spending growth in the medium-to-long-term. this bill doesn't change any of that.
as for what congress can do, they have to use every resource available. you know, the president has made a mockery of the power of the purse. you can't just rely on that. it's like running a nuclear reactor with an on/off switch. it doesn't really do what people think it does. it's very hard to use appropriations to control a president who is engaging an overreach.
1. set consistent, evidence-based guidance to stop outbreaks
for example, someone at 200 percent of the federal poverty level wouldn't have to spend more than 2 percent of their income on premiums. those earning 150 percent or less wouldn't have to pay anything. and, for the first time, earners at or above 400 percent of the federal poverty level would be eligible for income-pegged subsidies.
we must build bridges of cooperation and trust –- not drive the wedge of disunity and division.
and i think i became hopeful at the end of writing this book, because there is a yearning, i think, in all of us for human connection. the bullhorn that is the loudest is the zero-sum, but it's also true that the largest social movement in american history is black lives matter in 2020, that you now have millions more white people who want a way out of the moral and economic quandary that is american racism. there are these moments where the brutal ugliness of the american lie causes a groundswell and an opening and a pivot. all of this is our history. it's the struggle and the beauty at all times. and i think the more we can see these kinds of conversations where people really connect on a human level and at the local level — i hate to sound like a federalist here, but i do think it's really important for people to experience this with people they have relationships with in communities where they really have real bonds, to see what it's like to have a shared story of american struggle and american progress.

reauthorizing the vawa had stalled in both chambers since it expired, with republicans and democrats introducing their own versions of a reauthorization bill during the previous congress. both sides have accused each other of playing politics with it and the sensitive issue of domestic abuse.
caregiving, caregivers and long-term care: the most striking part of biden's platform — to me — is its emphasis on supporting the professional long-term care workforce serving older adults in nursing homes, assisted living facilities and in homes, as well as assisting family caregivers.
they spent a year reinventing the wheel on opioid policy with things we already knew, said andrew kessler, a policy consultant who specializes in behavioral health. it's all been recommended before.
schilling: because if i went to new york and helped them win the 28th and 29th world series, ho-hum. if i go to boston and break -- and help break the curse or whatever they call it, there's something no one's ever seen in there.
and to see reports that made it sound like there was some, you know, fence mending that needed(ph) to happen, that sure didn't look that way when you walked in. i'm going to move on.
voters in ohio and iowa voted twice for barack obama to be president, and then switched to donald trump in 2016, helping push him to his electoral college victory.
it is further noted that drug overdose deaths are increasing almost twice as fast in expansion states, hospital stays for opioid-related issues massively spiked after expansion, and medicaid spending for drug abuse treatment is rising faster in expansion states.
as slate's ben mathis-lilley has noted, among others, williamson's essay is remarkable in that it echoes rhetoric long deployed against americans who rely on financial assistance from the government — takers vs. makers, welfare queens — but here, that rhetoric is being weaponized against downscale white folks. (the essay is behind a paywall, but mathis-lilley quotes extensively from it.)
ben marter, a spokesman for senate minority whip dick durbin (d-ill.), noted that trump had called the post and the times today to discuss health care reform defeats, but not us.
there is no other way to go than for the speaker and his team to start over, paul said. they are going to have to, they don't have the votes.
does it matter how the world sees the u.s.?
in a separate statement, the cms said it was disappointed by the court's ruling, adding that billions of dollars in risk adjustment payments and collections are now on hold.
that logic shows just how much the risk pool is deteriorating in the aca and how poorly structured the funding mechanism and premium model is, bertolini said. i think you will see a lot more withdrawals this year of plans.
over 915,000 people signed up for obamacare from november 29 to december 5, the fifth week of open enrollment and most recent data released by the centers for medicare & medicaid services' weekly enrollment snapshot. that's nearly double the week prior, when 523,020 people selected plans, which itself was about a 50% increase from the same time period last year.
kurtis: he got 8 out of 8, 16 more points - total of 19. it almost never happens.
pauley asked pelosi, was that bluster? hyperbole?
there is just no question that under trump, more people are satisfied with the direction of the country.
we are one people, with one destiny.
the law doubled the amount of estate value that is exempt from the estate tax, but the law did not eliminate the tax entirely. and there is no basis for his suggestion at both events that small farmers and small businesspeople would especially benefit from his changes; few paid the tax even before. you can read a full fact check here
and small towns like this tend to be far sicker than the norm. in fayette, more than 1 in 10 people is estimated to have diabetes. out of 67 counties in the state, fayette ranks 66th for health outcomes and more than a third of its residents are obese.
the number one reason [for big hollywood's launch] is that the conservative movement has completely detached itself from the concept of popular culture and thinks it can survive in the 21st century on politics and legislation alone, and political rhetoric and great writing reflecting conservative principles, and that's not going to happen. what needs to happen is that the conservative movement — based in washington, dc, for the most part, and with ancillary entities around the country, new york city, dallas, virginia — these people have ignored anything west of the mississippi for a generation, and they're suffering the consequences, and the election of obama is evidence of that. the conservative movement proper did not embrace ronald reagan initially, but it eventually came to accept him as the standard bearer of conservatism. he was successful less because he carried conservative principles, but [more] because he came from hollywood and he understood the importance of communication and pop culture. it took [the conservative movement] a long time to realize that that magic was a good way to sell conservatism — that bright-eyed optimism — and so the conservative movement needs to go focus on hollywood in countless ways. it needs to encourage its young to go out to hollywood and become screenwriters actors, producers, below-the-line workers. it also needs to focus on hollywood proper, film reviews, and become engaged in the debate out there.
the texas senator, who has never served in the military, has used the carpet bombing line several times over the course of the campaign. during the cnn gop debate in december, moderator wolf blitzer asked cruz if he would carpet bomb the isis-held city of raqqa.
if trump fails to win a second term, the law will likely outlast his political career.
you are somebody who actually has been there. you were in combat in iraq. do you think it is the right thing to be sending in as many as 10,000 ground troops that some are calling for in order to just try to completely annihilate isis once and for all?
president donald trump suggested friday that he is learning not to trust gop leaders as he pushes for the border wall and promotes his popular pro-american trade and immigration agendas.
fatima goss graves, president of the national women's law center, said his remarks suggest a disregard for precedent. when you put on a robe, there is an expectation for people, and part of that expectation is around the rule of law and a consistency in approach, she said.
but there's a surprising bottom line: although prices are going up in almost all areas, they're not significantly higher than they are for people living in areas served by multiple insurers, according to data reviewed by consulting firm avalere health.
for weeks, biden has been making the case that his candidacy would be the most strategic for democrats, particularly that he can help democrats win down the ballot in competitive house and senate races. he has also argued that sanders' democratic socialism is too big a risk for the party.
the senate health, education, labor and pensions committee holds a hearing on primary care costs and outcomes on tuesday.
in fact, the agreement has forced iran to give up most of its nuclear material as well as dismantle the machinery it could use to manufacture more. the $1.7 billion the united states gave to iran was money it held in u.s. banks at the time of the 1979 revolution, plus accrued interest, which had been frozen there by u.s. sanctions for the next three and a half decades.
what he said: life expectancy is rising again in the u.s.
inskeep: ok. so with the exception of many lower-income people who are disappointed, people broadly approve of the health care they individually are getting. what happened though when you asked the same people about the health care system as a whole?

trump is following the playbook of other enemies of democracy—here's how to stop him
i got laid off and had insurance through my job
mr. obama tried to be the president for everyone in the country, while mr. trump is concerned only with his base. mr. obama was attacked from day one by republicans, who refused to work with him in any legislative capacity and routinely stymied his efforts to repair the economy.
pro-biden super pac plants flag in nevada
bertolini said his company has not decided whether to continue selling insurance in the exchanges in 2018, but it already has exited most of the markets where it previously sold plans, remaining in only four states this year. he said that aetna is the only insurer left in nebraska's public exchange.
schilling: he is very conservative, but he's the first politician in our lifetime that kept his work. that's why i believe -- and mr. president, if you're watching this show, do not give in. the american people are behind you. don't give in until the democrats give you what they were giving each other ten years ago, that $40 million or $50 million for the wall, a billion dollars for the wall.
trump said a family of four bringing in around $75,000 a year would see an average greater than $2,000 income tax cut.
we didn't get into this crisis overnight. we're not going to get out overnight, kellyanne conway, counselor to the president and the administration's leading voice on the epidemic, said in an interview.
senate leaders are struggling to build conservative support for their emerging bill, with gop aides and senators voicing growing skepticism that hard-right sens. rand paul (r-ky.) and mike lee (r-utah) can be persuaded to back it. conservative organizations, meanwhile, are complaining that majority leader mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) is offering proposals that would not sufficiently dismantle the law known as obamacare.
it is my fervent hope and the hope of millions that, regardless of party, such courage is still possible, obama said while accepting a profile in courage award at the john f. kennedy library in boston. that today's members of congress, regardless of party, are willing to look at the facts and speak the truth. even when it contradicts party positions. i hope that current members of congress recall that it doesn't take a lot of courage to aid those who are already powerful.
the black-tie dinner is the first major social event of the trump administration, planned by the east wing under first lady melania trump and a cadre of aides and advisers, including acting senior adviser stephanie winston wolkoff.
last month, a federal appeals court held that the law's individual mandate was unconstitutional , but sent the case back down to a lower court to decide whether other provisions of the sprawling law should remain in effect.
when it comes to businesses, trump touted the lowering of the corporate tax cut so the american worker finally has a level playing field. he promoted the business tax reforms, including immediate expensing and cuts to the unfair estate death tax.
question: thank you, sean. thank you, sean.
question: and -- and if i may --
the law gives the department of health and human services broad discretion to grant hardship exemptions to people who say they can't afford the mandate. there are signs that the trump administration intends to use that leeway to minimize the penalty's impact, in ways that go beyond what the obama administration did.
that argument, however, has not exactly been met with a warm reception by the conservative majority on the supreme court. last month, chief justice john roberts and justice brett kavanaugh, one of three justices appointed by president trump, both signaled they disagree with arguments made by the republican-led states.
although it's actually even worse than that. a 64-year-old making $26,500 would, according to the congressional budget office, see their premiums for a silver plan go from $1,700 under obamacare to $6,500 under the senate bill — but it'd be for a silver plan that covered 17 percent less of their expected medical expenses. so they'd be paying more to get less. how much more? well, the kaiser family foundation calculates that, in the case of our hypothetical 64-year-old, their deductible would go from $809 to $6,105. and it'd be an even bigger jump for people a little bit lower on the income ladder. someone making just $18,090 would see their deductibles increase from $255 to the same $6,105. the senate bill, then, would leave a lot of people with a choice between plans they couldn't afford to buy and couldn't afford to use.
insurance premiums are probably still lower than they would have been if the congressional budget office's early high projections played out, burwell said. she added that it's important to consider the affordable care act's overall effect on americans, including those who have employer-provided coverage rather than just the 11 million people enrolled in insurance through the exchanges.
republicans have argued that the law doesn't work and promised to override the veto next year.
after listening to conservative groups like the club for growth blast the bill as a warmed-over substitute for government-run health care, ryan went on offense, saying this is just the first step of an ongoing overhaul of the health system.

unemployment in the black community is … half what it used to be. i think he's doing a number of very good things. tactics and the ways he's doing it, i wouldn't necessarily go along with it, but you can tell he's a guy that has had experience and he knows what he is doing and he's playing three-level chess versus everybody else playing checkers.
the gop still has what could be insurmountable advantages heading into november. but what's going on in the rust belt in general should have republicans praying for intervention from their higher power, vladimir putin.
trump is against keeping the affordable care act, but he hasn't proposed a detailed alternative. during an abc town hall last month, trump was unable to explain his campaign's proposed alternative other than saying the current law is too expensive. he also did not outline a plan in the first presidential debate against biden.
maryland and virginia health insurers are among those considering double-digit health insurance premium increases in 2019 for individual plans, according to bloomberg. these states' rates are the first 2019 rates being revealed. maryland insurance commissioner al redmer jr. said one insurer is looking to nearly double rates in his state. i believe we've been in a death spiral for a year or two, he told reporters on a recent call.

as a result, some middle- and upper-income americans are likely to see pretty big premium spikes this fall, above and beyond the usual increases, right before the midterm elections. and they may be looking for somebody to blame.
republicans got rid of one of the most unpopular parts of the law – the individual mandate – by using their 2017 package of tax cuts to eliminate the aca's tax penalty for people who don't have insurance.
question: so (ph) you're not gonna renegotiate, to be clear...
their plight has hardly been eased by the gop, which wasted two years of ultimately futile efforts to completely repeal obamacare when it enjoyed a monopoly on power in washington.
between september and december 2017, an additional 9,940 people died from fentanyl and other synthetic opioids. samantha huntley, 20, a tanning salon employee from springfield, mo., was one of them.
according to a new gallup study, based on polling data, the percentage of democrats identifying as liberal averaged 51 percent in 2018. that was up from 50 percent in 2017, but underscored a steady increase over the years. among americans overall, conservatives outnumbered liberals by 9 points, although that is down from 19 points in gallup's first poll in 1992.
biden has recommended raising the marginal income tax rate from 37% to 39.6% for the nation's highest pool of earners, according to the tax foundation and the committee for a responsible federal budget.
many parents who support the traditional american values of self-responsibility, individual liberty and free markets, have been left to wonder how they can teach their children the truth about collectivism and resist the rise of socialism.

there were multiple legal challenges to the aca's original workaround for religious organizations. the supreme court ruled in july that religious nonprofit groups, such as the little sisters of the poor, can keep contraceptive coverage off their plans instead of having insurers offer it directly to their employees.

after sorting 20 options, the certified nursing assistant was stunned to find a subsidized plan that would cost her $22.30 a month and not more than $700 a year out-of-pocket in co-pays and deductibles. she would pay nothing to see a primary care doctor.
we're not surprised to see donald trump continue his destructive race to the bottom. hillary clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn't change that. if donald trump doesn't see that, that's his loss. as always, she's prepared to handle whatever donald trump throws her way.
i didn't downplay it. i actually in many ways up-played it in action, the president told the voter who asked him why he would downplay a pandemic that is known to disproportionately harm low-income families and minority communities.
on nov. 1, christie's commission released its final report, with 56 recommendations on the opioid crisis. some drug policy experts criticized the commission for taking too long and repackaging old ideas instead of crafting a new strategy.
the american hospital association urged republican leaders to wait until the congressional budget office analyzes the bill.
so is this just a racialized phenomenon, or is this a deeper thing in which this idea that somebody else is getting more than we are when we're the ones who deserve more than they get just fouls up politics everywhere and always?
the majority of consumers get tax credits that discount premiums, sometimes so deeply that coverage is basically free, and that's one reason that the number of people without insurance has fallen to historic lows while access to care appears to have improved. but plenty of middle- and upper-income people are stuck paying more ― and in some cases coverage is now flat-out unaffordable.

but the president is not the only one getting wisconsin wrong. assumptions based on fleeting impressions have long led outsiders to misinterpret what goes on between lake michigan and the mississippi.
but the truth is that american capitalism licked poverty decades ago. the so-called poor in this country now have cable tv, central heat, air conditioning, videogames, microwave ovens, iphones, and struggle with over eating. the homeless are an altogether different problem.
he's done good things as president: this is the most frequent defense we've heard. trump has been a means to many ends they wanted to reach: a conservative judicial branch, including a very conservative supreme court; tax reform; deregulation across the government; weakening obamacare.
well, that would be depending on what comes forth from the special counsel's office. if and when the time comes for impeachment, it will have to be something that has such a crescendo in a bipartisan way, pelosi said.
in a city that has a 38.6% poverty rate, this covid-19 is exacerbating all of the issues that we're having, simmons says. the acute nature of the pandemic's economic downturn is felt more here than many other places.
hi, everybody. when i took office seven years ago this week, more than 15% of americans went without health insurance. for folks who did have coverage, insurance companies could deny you coverage or charge you more just because you'd been sick. and too many americans gave up their dreams of changing jobs or going back to school because they couldn't risk giving up their employer-based insurance plan.
this time they have just one: blue cross blue shield of south carolina, which had the most obamacare enrollees in richland county in 2016 due to its low prices.
trump on friday night urged republicans to vote in south carolina's democratic primary, and pick who he described as the weakest candidate. the state's open primary means voters may participate in any contest. south carolina's republican party canceled its primary, one of just a handful of states to scrap gop nominating contests this cycle.

but the new statements from kellyanne conway, senior counselor to president donald trump, come with all the usual caveats.
another member, bertha madras, said she was proud of the work. while she understood the importance of getting buy-in from the federal agencies, she was frustrated by the amount of time it took. the commission had to wait several months for officials to respond to the recommendations before the report could be issued, she said.
when meadows did it, most of the washington establishment wrote him off and considered the effort unserious, but quickly and quietly he—working with his fellow house freedom caucus members—amassed the votes necessary by september 2015 to knock out boehner. when boehner realized meadows had succeeded, he resigned before a public spectacle tanked him on the floor of the house in order to avoid embarrassment.
i don't want to see the country sold to the highest bidder. i want to see a system, something like a change in the system that martin luther king talked about, that we change the country, the system, that people are treated fairly no matter what station is in life, said bronson.
the white house has repeatedly avoided endorsing the position of the health officials whose scientific guidance biden assured the nation would be the north star of his administration's coronavirus response, he adds.
levin: why does that offend the left?
the two men hit the campaign trail together in 2000, during mccain's first presidential bid for the gop nomination. that race didn't go mccain's way, but when south carolina voters promoted graham to congress' upper chamber in 2003, they collaborated on legislation that would have major impacts on foreign policy. their senate gang once included now-former sen. joe lieberman, an democrat-turned-independent, until his retirement announcement in 2012. they were, the three amigos. when lieberman left the senate, that trio became a duo.
trump afirmó que el manifestante era «desagradable como el infierno» y acusó al hombre de intentar pegarle a los agentes de seguridad que le forzaron a salir de la concentración, aunque no parecía que el hombre estuviera peleando contra esos agentes.
in order to build consensus quickly, aides and members say that a decision was made early to write a bill that tracked very closely with biden's own american rescue plan. the thinking from the start was that beginning from the ground up in committees could take too much time and potentially result in unnecessary democratic infighting in a moment when unity was paramount.
the department of health and human services seems to be caught between critics on both sides as it confronts the task.

romney said that our plan was a state solution to a state problem, and his is a power grab by the federal government to put in a one sized fits all plan across the nation.
[andrew breitbart] lived about three miles from me, at the time, where i grew up. … we had the same interests, baseball, music, he had an incredible sense of humor — i was always a huge comedy fan — so we had so much in common, marlow recalled. core interests, similar politics, similar background, lived in similar places, even had the same hobbies. … it was a pretty clear match that we were kindred spirits.
the energy we saw around this day of action was even bigger than what we saw in the early days of kavanaugh because what we said then is becoming real to people, which is: they're going for broke, said ilyse hogue, president of naral pro-choice america. and that doesn't mean just overturning roe. it means criminalizing abortion, challenging rape, trying to control women. women all over the country see that as a very real threat now.

if a president does overstep his authority, congress could cut off his funding or impeach him, but a president trump could counter with the power of the bully pulpit.
the president also said the senate's failure to pass a bill that would have repealed and replaced the affordable care act 'cost our country $1 trillion in entitlement saving. congressional budget experts say it would have saved a net total of $321 billion over 10 years.

obamacare has also ended insurance company practices that caused misery for the minority of americans buying coverage on their own, rather than through employers ― practices like denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions, or selling skimpy plans that left out benefits like mental health and rehabilitative services.
retiring early or starting a business might become too hazardous if your access to health insurance isn't guaranteed. you might have to wait a year before preexisting conditions are covered by an employer's plan. young adults could be kicked off their parents' policies. millions of people who buy insurance through the aca marketplaces or who now qualify for expanded medicaid coverage funded by obamacare in many states could lose their coverage as well.
«¿acaso me perdí la parte en la que donald desafía nuestros hechos?», le dijo la portavoz de cruz, catherine frazier, a cnn. «él no puede, porque nuestros anuncios hablan la verdad… él no es un verdadero conservador. él no puede defender su historial, así que como un niño frustrado, él recurre a los insultos».

trump said the individual mandate provision of the affordable care act was so unconstitutional. the supreme court upheld the mandate. in june 2012, chief justice john roberts wrote that the penalty can be considered a tax that is within the power of congress to impose.
garcia-navarro: the investigation that's going on right now in the fbi, in the senate...

vance's office had said it would be free to enforce the subpoena and obtain the records in the event the supreme court declined to step in and halt the records' turnover, but it was unclear when that might happen.
2.) it wasn't the only politically expedient lie the president told about obamacare. he also said explicitly that calling the public option a trojan-horse for single-payer healthcare was an illegitimate claim made by his opponents who were not telling the truth.
the aca allows people to buy a policy outside of open enrollment if they've had a big change in life — maybe they got married, or they lost their job.
and kate marvel, a nasa climate scientist, told axios in january, 12 years isn't a deadline, and climate change isn't a cliff we fall off — it's a slope we slide down. she added, we don't have 12 years to prevent climate change — we have no time. it's already here. and even under a business-as-usual scenario, the world isn't going to end in exactly twelve years.
what's more, while house conservatives did kill the gop bill, it's important that many moderate republicans — senators, governors and even some in the house — opposed the plan precisely because it would take coverage from lower-income people. indeed, we've now learned that there may be a hidden majority in both houses of congress (democrats plus moderate republicans) behind leaving in place the type of spending and regulations (with the exception of the mandate) that broadly make up obamacare. the genuine moderate republican opposition to such cruelly regressive policy is a pleasant surprise.
the trump administration's decision and, now, mcelvain's departure have some experts worried about the future of the justice department, which historically has tried to insulate these sort of legal functions from partisanship and political meddling from above.
honorable mentions: new jersey, mississippi and california
medicare for all is a huge challenge for republicans because a recent poll put out from gallup this month showed that 70 percent of americans believe that our healthcare system has major problems or is in a state of crisis, mansour said. we see the polling that americans are really latching onto this medicare for all thing, including even republican voters, and the gop has no answer to it, really. what do you think is going to happen with this? the gop is not addressing the needs of the median voter that's getting hammered by our current healthcare system.
on top of that, multiple senators and aides point to polling showing the bill with overwhelming popularity even among some republican voters. they also argue the onslaught of local support from mayors, governors and county governments has made it hard for republicans to effectively message against it at home.
when mccarthy returns later this month to his congressional district, a mostly agricultural region in california's central valley including the city of bakersfield and edwards air force base, he is likely to face quite a few confused and frustrated constituents.
we have, after all, gone well beyond the point where trying to kill the a.c.a. was a smart if cynical political strategy. the act has become increasingly popular since trump took office. health care was central to the 2018 midterms, and 75 percent of voters who considered it the most important issue voted democratic.
since even before his election, trump has been viewed as dishonest by the american public according to quinnipiac university polling. the lowest percentage of poll respondents to say that trump was not honest came in november 2016, shortly after trump won the presidency and during the brief stretch that constituted his honeymoon period.
other celebrities jumped on the bandwagon, seizing the moment to make mccain's death about hating trump.
-- the house energy and commerce committee will hold hearings on the first pieces of gop health-care replacement plans next week, signaling lawmakers are set to move swiftly on plans to repeal and replace the affordable care act. (mike debonis)
the facts: the tax bill that trump signed into law in december is not the largest tax cut in history. it is estimated to reduce tax revenues by $1.46 trillion over 10 years, according to the nonpartisan joint committee on taxation. it needed to cost roughly $6.8 trillion over 10 years to beat the 1981 tax cut under president reagan, which was 2.9 percent of gdp, according to the nonpartisan committee for a responsible federal budget.
as for the current health care law, on which some 20 million people depend for insurance, its odds of survival seem better than at any time since trump's election, when its repeal seemed nearly inevitable.
among the republicans who early on recognized biden's win and signaled a willingness to work with the new administration are utah's mitt romney, maine's susan collins and alaska's lisa murkowski.
you built zoning policy on the zero-sum racial idea, and now you have zero-sum zoning policy which only works to the advantage, if it works to anybody's advantage, of either the rich or the people who already live there, the incumbents. and that as a way of thinking about policy generally, that strikes me as very powerful that if you are engaged in zero-sum policy construction or zero-sum policy framing, that no matter whether or not you think now that you've cut the division well, you have no idea, eventually, which side of that you are going to be caught on — that zero-sum logic — it grows.

question: hey sean, i want to ask you two questions money (ph) related. the president campaigned on a corporate tax cut rate of 15 percent and today when he met with the business leaders, he had mentioned that the tax rate would drop to somewhere between 15 to 20 percent. is he moving the goalpost there in anyway? and my second question is on government spending, there have been reports that you might be looking at $10 trillion over the course of 10 years. is that accurate? and would you be willing to wrap up entitlements to get there?

biden calls for improving the pay and benefits of the low-wage direct care workforce, such as home care aides and personal care assistants. they often earn minimum wage with no benefits.
after 24 months of rapid progress, our economy is the envy of the world, our military is the most powerful on earth, and america is winning each and every day. members of congress: the state of our union is strong. our country is vibrant and our economy is thriving like never before.
biden's new and expanded team, however, looks more like a sanders administration. in addition to ocasio-cortez, who will co-chair biden's panel on climate change, biden has recruited stephanie kelton, a former sanders adviser who is described as the foremost evangelist of a fringe economic movement called modern monetary theory, which, in part, argues that the government should pay for programs requiring big spending, such as the green new deal, by simply printing more money.

preventing the executive branch from overstepping the boundaries of its constitutional authority is not a republican or democratic issue. it is an american issue that touches the very core of the constitutional design of our government. the separation of powers and its checks and balances are designed to protect individual liberty and we must ensure that it is preserved for future generations.
the good news for the biden team is that millions upon millions of people are at home — and for once may be eager to pick up the phone even for a number on caller-id that they do not recognize. they have time to watch biden's events on the computer and time to watch his appearances on sunday shows.

states will need a lot of money to distribute a vaccine and make sure it gets to everyone who wants it. there are complex logistics that will require planning and resources. for instance, states may need freezers to store their vaccines, and given how many people are hesitant to be vaccinated, they will need public education materials and guidance. currently state governors are asking for more guidance and financial assistance.

there is an instinct among political pundits to confuse caution for practicality — an assumption that those who advocate for incremental change are being reasonable, while those pushing for bold reforms aren't. this is seen most starkly in the debate around health care reform, despite the fact that the practical pushers of limited reform fail to address the real problems in our health care system.

white house chief of staff reince priebus issued an order friday night to freeze all regulations that haven't yet been formally published in the federal register. politico's josh gerstein reports that at least 62 new regs have already been withdrawn, and the number could go far higher: some of the matters are weighty, like planned cancellation of sanctions against burma (now on hold) or rules to give military spouses preferences in federal hiring. some have already drawn public attention, like a delay in new rules about mistreatment of horses. other actions suspended by the white house move seem less than earth-shattering, like the planned campground fee for public land in richland county, north dakota. however, at least a few of the halts seem troubling, like the withdrawal of a rule about inspecting aircraft fuselages for cracks. the department of housing and urban development also pulled new rules to streamline income tests for federally subsidized housing.

like the vast majority of federal employees of all ranks, the government's judges have the option of enrolling in plans offered by the federal employee health benefits system. it includes hundreds of plan choices throughout the u.s. -- far more than even the largest private employers. many plan options also have broad networks of providers, often nationwide.

even as roberts has tried to keep the nation's highest court above the fray, it has been buffeted by a series of bitterly fought confirmation battles, often stoked by trump's rhetoric. justice amy coney barrett's abrupt confirmation in october following the death of justice ruth bader ginsburg represented a sea change, making the court the most conservative since president franklin d. roosevelt's administration.
sen. sanders wands to devolve the authority to set up state health insurance programs to individual state governors, clinton continued. now maybe if i lived in a place like new hampshire, with your governor, i would feel okay about that. but if i lived in a state that had a republican governor, particularly a republican governor who already turned down medicaid expansion matching funds, i don't think i would be comfortable, right? because i don't want to live in a country that has an unequal health care system again.

a group of prominent scientists is calling on the biden administration to implement enforceable standards aimed at preventing airborne transmission of the coronavirus, kaiser health news's christina jewett reports . in a letter sent to the cdc on monday, the experts say that broader use of n95 masks, better ventilation and other public health measures are needed to protect workers in risky workplaces, including health care, food processing and prisons.
but here too it is easy to forget another reality of 2009 politics, one still very relevant today: the big pressure to compromise came from conservative democrats who had leverage to kill legislation if they wanted. in the senate, this was a function of the same small-state bias that gave republicans outsized power, and as a practical matter, it meant that democratic leaders were constantly trying to satisfy senators from places like arkansas and nebraska where voters were especially suspicious of big new federal programs and prone to believing conservative propaganda about what proposed legislation would do.
we will get through this crisis if we look out for one another and work together to expand coverage, lower costs and ensure that health care truly is aa right for all americans, the president said.

addiction experts also say they're worried about ensuring the money is directed to treatment supported by evidence – like medications helping those addicted wean off drugs paired with counseling – instead of pouring more money into law-enforcement tactics favored by attorney general jeff sessions, many of which appeared to be ineffective during the war on drugs of the 1980s and 1990s.
one thing to note is that congress has put funding in some of its emergency funding bills that may help hospitals and health systems pay for covid-19 care for the uninsured. while people who are uninsured might still receive bills from providers, [these federal funds] will help reduce the burden on patients because the hospitals will be compensated at least partially for their costs, says corlette of georgetown university.
the poll matches other previous polls on the topic. the exact same percentage of voters (67%) said they agreed with the decision reached in roe in a 2017 quinnipiac university poll.
sanders: how are you going to pay off a hundred...
instead, that has produced two front-runners who are more bent on political destruction than legislative victories, he said. cruz … has spent most of his campaign trying to destroy the republican party, he said, and trump wants to blow up all of washington. there's no policy attached.
mr. ryan had said the bill included huge conservative wins. but it never won over conservatives who wanted a more thorough eradication of the affordable care act. nor did it have the backing of more moderate republicans who were anxiously aware of the congressional budget office's assessment that the bill would leave 24 million more americans without insurance in 2024, compared with the number who would be uninsured under the current law.
higher health-care costs and the fate of obamacare are major talking points in the 2016 election season.
cruz: well, dana, the premise of that question is not true, and it's frankly ridiculous. this is a strategy that came from republican leadership. this is the cromnibus strategy.
he did not vent or rage. instead in the oval office afterward trump was sullen and quiet as he contemplated his first blow, dealt by the washington swamp he had vowed to drain, one insider source said. the president was well aware he failed to deliver on an issue that stirs the passions of his political base. he was also mindful that the health care disaster would make his quest to tackle a behemoth tax package that much more difficult, the source said.
yes, right. so i'm there. i'm just a senior in college, i'm a kid. and he shows up. he gets out of this car, and he's like my best friend. he's like, brian, it's so great to see you! you have no idea how glad i am to see you. and i'm like, senator biden, so nice to meet you. no, you have no idea how glad i am to meet you — uh, to see you. not meet you. you know, he's very good. it's like, in case he has met me before, he's like, so glad to see you! and it was like [gasps], we're best friends. this is amazing.
in exchange for their votes for gold-plated populism, midwesterners got a plutocrat in need of platinum pacifier. if trump is going to fool them again, he'll need a new act — or an old one with a super strong dose of what he knows best: scaring white people.
schilling: he's like voldemort, he-who-must-not-be-named in -- i mean, he carried the bruins to a stanley cup and he was the greatest thing ever until then me, i said vote bush in 2004. it blew up. the patriots refused to go to the white house. they are icons. they are people to follow it's just and so --
the u.s. department of immigration and customs enforcement recently arrested a number of immigrants in the center's neighborhood, and lacayo worries about further actions. what if the united states revokes his residency?
sanders: if you're spending 50% of your limited incomes on housing, how do you pay for food? how do you pay for transportation?
when campaigning never stops, governing never begins, he adds.
since shortly after trump took office, his administration and the gop congress have taken a variety of actions to weaken the affordable care act and its health insurance exchanges in particular.
one sign of a death spiral would be fewer young adults, who tend to be healthier, signing up -- something that cox says hasn't happened. another protection against a death spiral is that roughly 85 percent of the people who buy insurance through the exchanges are insulated from premium increases by subsidies, she said.
has he tried to weaken pre-existing conditions protections as president?
sanders argued, as he has before, that the middle class tax increases needed to pay for medicare for all would be more than outweighed by the savings people would earn from the elimination of private health insurance plans' premiums, deductibles and co-payments.
later trump suggested that clinton's solution, providing more financial assistance to people with higher expenses, was a bad idea because the country already has almost $20 trillion in debt. but clinton has called for raising taxes on wealthy americans in order to pay for her new initiatives, including the proposed health care assistance, and the committee for a responsible federal budget ― an independent organization that is obsessive about reducing the deficit ― has concluded she's identified enough specific revenue to pay for nearly her entire agenda.
biden, who was first elected to the senate in 1972, accused harris of a mischaracterization of my position across the board. in telling her personal story, harris left out a key detail: it was the local school district's decision to integrate its schools.
the budget process republicans are using to avoid a democratic filibuster in the senate, called reconciliation, has very strict rules that require every piece of the bill to be directly related to the federal budget. it will be up to the senate parliamentarian, a republican appointee, to make those determinations.
mary actually took her own necklace off and tossed it onto her bed! insouciantly. it clattered.
blitzer: so, hillary clinton says she wants to pursue the strategies laid out by president barack obama. bernie sanders, though, he has a different idea, right?
they don't have enough nerve to repeal obamacare. and if they do, they are just a lot more visionless than i can imagine, reid told the huffington post.
there's no evidence whatsoever that the money's been massively poured back into the american worker, rubio said.
we have always believed that there are better approaches to expanding health care coverage and lowering costs than the a.c.a., but it is the law of the land and as such we want it to function as smoothly and efficiently as possible, neil bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer for the chamber, said in an emailed statement.
but that's not the prime motivation of obama. brexit has emerged as the number-one economic concern for the globe. that was clear from the spring meeting of the international monetary fund, and it's been made by policy makers from tokyo to berlin.
so i want to try to draw out more this psychological model you're suggesting here. so human beings are born, and we're pretty malleable in the way we can understand society working. there have been lots of different ways society has been composed going way, way, way back through the ages, and lots of different ways they're composed around the world now. so it's obvious to me looking at some of these studies that we all have a tendency to be willing to either be altruistic and believe we should be helping each other, or to be pulled towards a selfish, zero-sum, angry, resentful — i have a toddler, and i will see this — just flipping every couple of hours depending on mood. and so what you're saying is that in a society riven by racism, more of a story that gets people thinking in a zero-sum resentful way is told and told and retold and retold. and if i understand you, it falls within particular power. that's why people say, look at black people. but it's a way you have structured your thinking so that it also becomes natural for you to think of other white people this way, people of other social classes this way, maybe people of other countries this way. that once this model of this is the right way to understand your competition with others takes hold in your brain, it's an easy metaphor to start applying everywhere.
in south carolina, black voters don't need to be pressed hard to say what draws them to biden. it's obama.
axelrod writes that he knew obama was in favor of same-sex marriages during the first presidential campaign, even as obama publicly said he only supported civil unions, not full marriages. axelrod also admits to counseling obama to conceal that position for political reasons. opposition to gay marriage was particularly strong in the black church, and as he ran for higher office, he grudgingly accepted the counsel of more pragmatic folks like me, and modified his position to support civil unions rather than marriage, which he would term a 'sacred union,' axelrod writes.
and we begin with the war on isis, jordan carrying out new airstrikes on isis targets inside syria. on the ground, there's a tense standoff between the isis fighters and the kurdish peshmerga in northern iraq.
it was later doomed in the senate by the late sen. john mccain (r-az), who infamously gave it a thumbs-down on the floor of the senate as he voted against it. but it would have stopped in the house after ryan's failure had it not been for meadows' work to save the president's push for a better healthcare vision for the country than obamacare.
actor ron perlman tweeted: …and to the current holder of the title potus, you're not good enough to utter john mccain's name. not good enough. and definitely not american enough.
brooks: yeah, i think it's an incredibly stupid idea. donald trump - he's - represents a big change in american foreign policy, a big change in american identity. he plays on cultural and identity issues. it's really a comprehensive critique of where the american establishment has been. and what strikes me is the democrats are not even trying to answer that critique. they go to health care. they say, you know, obamacare gives you protection for insurance for pre-existing conditions, and we want to preserve that.
trump had actually started talking about obamacare in his opening statement ― when he said that premiums were going up with numbers that are astronomical, 68 percent, 71 percent. then, after clinton had given her assessment of the law, he continued with the theme:
spicer: look, i'm not -- i think that you saw from the response the other day, he walked into the cia, people were hooting and hollering, they gave him a five minute standing ovation. that doesn't look like a relationship that's a -- i mean, they were excited --
always protecting people with pre-existing [conditions], the president said. we're going to do even better.
the televised debates give the candidates valuable exposure and boost their status as serious contenders.
spicer: well, i think he is -- we're going to continue to sequence those out. i mean, part of it is to make sure that we don't spend our entire day signing executive orders and (inaudible). there's a way that we can do this to make sure that we're getting all of those things that he promised the american people done in short haste and doing it in a way that doesn't just jam them out in a fire hose.
in my time at demos, we really focused on these issues of wealth and debt, because it is so much more compounding in terms of opportunity and disadvantage than an income. you could get a great job today or tomorrow. you could get a great contract. you could have enough money in a given paycheck to pay your bills. but the question of what happens when that paycheck stops or is paused or you feel sick and can't go in is life determining. and that is where, basically, we're all paying compound interest on decisions made long before we were born — racially explicit decisions. there's a section in the book where i lay out the list of free stuff that was given to white americans to help build wealth. and it's so important to recognize that the divides that everyday people observe today — what's going on with that black neighborhood? why does it feel like it doesn't have as many small businesses? why does it seem like the schools in black neighborhoods are underfunded? well, they're linked to property values, which are a result of generations of explicit laws forbidding black people from owning homes and selling them. and so we have this now somewhat colorblind story of economic disparity today that we try with the american mythology of individual effort and bootstraps and just overall individualism to justify by saying, well, black people just don't try that hard. but in fact, it's not that black people don't try that hard.

8 key moments that helped define bernie sanders' presidential runs
fox news' adam shaw contributed to this report.
bash: and real quick, when i said negotiate, what i meant was, what they want is money. they want ransom. and it is the united states' policy not to do that.
the reasoning is simple, sanders said this week before heading for texas and arizona: we have put a significant effort into going into states that trump won. not exclusively, but most of the states that i've visited have been states that trump won. the reason for that is, i think it's important for people who voted for trump to understand that many of the promises that he made on health care, on taxes, on many other issues, are promises that he did not keep.
a flashback to just last month:
the economic case for biden begins with the economic case against president donald trump. consider trump's costly corporate tax cut. it did not deliver anything like the investment and growth he promised, and the main effect was to run up fiscal deficits in the first three years of his presidency.
americans with more than $1 million in total income would see income brought in from dividends, as well as capital gains, taxed like their wages, and taxpayers could see the itemized deductions they declare pared, moody's says.
spicer: what's that? again, it's not -- i just don't know the answer. i'll try to get back to you on that one.
tonight, i am also asking you to join me in another fight that all americans can get behind: the fight against childhood cancer.
in an emotional, 13-minute recounting of events on jimmy kimmel live, kimmel said that last week, his wife gave birth to a son, william billy kimmel, the couple's second child. it was an easy delivery, but a few hours after the birth, a nurse noticed a murmur in the baby's heart. kimmel describes how they started doing some tests to see whether it might just be fluid in the lungs, potentially a minor thing.
the judiciary committee scheduled barrett's confirmation hearing to begin oct. 12 and it is expected to last several days with opening statements from senators, questions and testimony from experts. trump has urged the senate to confirm barrett before the nov. 3 election.
hud's failure to enforce its environmental standards contributed to children living in lead-contaminated housing.
from a political perspective, the administration's revival of the health care debate was a disaster.
just across first street from the capitol, the us supreme court was set to hear arguments in three cases that many gay rights supporters felt would dictate the level of protection they'd receive under the 1964 civil rights act and title vii's employment rules.
trump's promise to rip up the iran agreement actually began causing heartburn even earlier, within days of his taking office.
if trump was referring to household net worth, the unemployment rate or the number of jobs created, it's likely true. by other measures, such as the country's gross domestic product, it is not so.

it's true the aca marketplaces had a rough website rollout in 2013 and struggled in subsequent years to attract enough insurers to offer affordable coverage. but things have been looking better lately. the congressional budget office has said the individual market would be largely stable for the next 10 years, mostly because a majority of the enrollees are eligible for subsidies and are thereby sheltered from premium hikes.
alexander graham bell displayed his telephone for the first time.
but it is not clear that he could be defeated on these grounds alone. many americans dread a government devoted to ministering to a mélange of social groups without a thought to core matters of economic growth and job satisfaction.
weigel: i can't deal with this. i have huntington's disease.
trump said in michigan : in fact, i was honored, believe it or not. about 10 years ago, i came to michigan. i was honored by a wonderful group. i was the 'man of the year.'
the bureau also calculates the supplemental poverty measure, which accounts for government programs that assist low-income families and are not considered in the official poverty measure. the spm rate for children in 2017 was 15.6 percent.
sessions used an emergency declaration to make all chemical variants of fentanyl, known as analogues, illegal on a temporary basis; congress must pass legislation to make the ban permanent. chinese and mexican chemists and drug traffickers in the united states had been evading the law by tweaking the chemical compounds that make up fentanyl and producing products that don't fit the precise chemical formula for a banned substance.
a primary goal was to help people likely to struggle with medical bills because of their physical condition or finances ― which is why, for example, democrats wanted to prohibit insurers from denying policies to people with pre-existing conditions and to improve coverage of prescription drugs for seniors.
while he'd likely keep his seat, worrying about reelection could undermine his effort to build a national campaign and run again for president in 2020. and an upset could end his white house hopes.
-- metro passengers on a yellow line train were alarmed, but thankfully unhurt, after a huntington-bound train abruptly opened its doors while en route (and on an elevated structure). riders said the train continued on its route and the operator never acknowledged the dangerous mishap. (faiz siddiqui)
the push left by democratic presidential candidates and the embrace by some of single-payer proposals like medicare for all opened a lane for the gop to use health care to claim their opponents had embraced socialism.
'those at the top are not doing their part:' wh looks to raise taxes on wealthy
that's unlikely to play well at the polls in november, when there are more than democratic primary voters casting their ballots.
9:25 p.m. et martha raddatz asked clinton if it was extremely careless of her to operate a personal email server as secretary of state in which 110 classified emails were exchanged.
for now, people who aren't covered through a government or workplace plan can still get insurance through healthcare.gov. however, there's less support from the government to help them enroll. and there are options for other kinds of plans that are cheaper but less comprehensive.

schilling: the wall is a great example. you were mentioning how much the left love trump. back when they were loving trump, they were also approving $25 billion and $40 billion to fund a wall because you can go back and look at the sound bytes of obama and clinton and everybody saying, we need this. we need border security.
the military would still go to work, they will not get paid. the border will still be patrolled, they will not get paid, said mulvaney, the director of the office of management and budget. folks will still be fighting the fires out west, they will not get paid. parks will be open, people won't get paid.
a group of house and senate republicans is asking president joe biden to withdraw his nomination of california attorney general xavier becerra (d) to be health and human services (hhs) secretary, citing his support for taxpayer-funded healthcare benefits for illegal aliens.
and there's another potential obstacle. the health-care industry, already up in arms over medicare-for-all proposals, probably would hate the idea of medicaid-for-all even more because the program reimburses health-care providers at even lower rates than for medicare services.
and cruz, on cnn's state of the union: (trump's) position on health care is the same as bernie sanders'. they both support socialized medicine, expanding obamacare to put the government in charge of our health care.
it's the latest critique to emerge since sanders released the details of his plan hours before the last democratic debate in charleston. most of the criticism has been that sanders is promising a massive increase in benefits coverage for all americans – including for dental, mental health, vision and hearing – while assuming considerable savings that are only vaguely detailed.
appropriations for the program had already decreased to just under $685 million by fiscal year 2017, which began oct. 1, 2016, before trump was elected and nearly four months before he took office.
this bill would now subsidize health insurance far beyond what was ever imagined when the house and the senate passed the obama health-care law — way beyond the subsidies ever envisioned in that, barrasso said.
tonight, i ask you to choose greatness.
former house speaker newt gingrich and current speaker paul ryan, for example, built their conservative reputations and bases of power with sweeping plans to dismantle the federal safety net, and they have many acolytes. the main difference between those gop leaders and president donald trump is that the latter is even more brazen in his lies about what he plans to do.

after climbing 410 points on monday, the dow jones industrial average djia, -0.39% was 0.6%, or 166 points lower in late morning trading. the s&p 500 spx, -0.16% slipped 0.5% and the nasdaq comp, +0.09% was 0.2% down.
president biden was clear: we need to strengthen the affordable care act and give more americans access to health care, especially during this pandemic, which has further demonstrated the importance of having the right coverage, health and human services acting secretary norris cochran said in a statement.
i just met with officials and workers from a great american company, harley-davidson. in fact, they proudly displayed five of their magnificent motorcycles, made in the usa, on the front lawn of the white house.
twitter declined thursday to flag an ad criticizing president trump's response to the coronavirus pandemic as democrat groups continue to press the issue ahead of the november election.
the medicaid expansion has been the subject of substantial scholarly attention. strong evidence suggests states' expansion has helped improve the financial health of their low-income residents, as well as the financial performance of local hospitals. studies also show that medicaid coverage has helped low-income americans get access to health care, though there is not yet strong evidence about whether it has improved their physical health.
clinton is the top pick for 45% of likely democratic caucusgoers, with sanders at 42%, the des moines register/bloomberg politics poll shows. clinton's support is up 3 percentage points from earlier this month, and sanders' is 2 percentage points higher.
a man huddles in an abandoned garage in a drug-riddled section of baltimore's mount vernon neighborhood in april. the man was asked for his name but did not provide it.
at times, sanders' current tour revealed some of the limits of his reach. the crowd at the south carolina rally was somewhat diverse, but it was visibly whiter than the population of columbia, which is 41 percent black.
and that raises another important point — in this era in which trust in politicians, congress, washington and democratic institutions, including the news media, is on the decline, people are looking to others they trust to impart and make sense of information.
he says it's about a movement. it's not just about him. he will be elected, but people have to stay engaged.
that's an important shift because sometime this month the agency is expected to publish a regulation that would permit consumers to carry these plans for a full year. that means the plans will be competing for business more directly with the comprehensive insurance listed on the exchanges.

question: sean, i have a couple of questions if you'll allow me to take them one at a time.
schilling: if your foreign policy is not america first, what is it? china first? i mean, part of the reason i was so distraught over the eight years of obama is -- whoever was president this time, hopefully it was a conservative, he was going to have to unravel the kowtowing and the bending and the kissing of butt globally that the administration did, apologizing.
medicare for all would destroy our hospital system. doctors wouldn't be able to make enough money to pay off their loans, he said. people want to keep their private plans.

keeping some obamacare taxes. the first bcra version would have repealed an array of affordable care act taxes, which would have overwhelmingly benefited higher-income americans. this newer version of the bill keeps some in place, including the net investment income tax and a payroll tax that hit higher-income americans.
take it from me, tweaks won't fix health care. dems should focus on medicare for all.
calling ocasio-cortez an emerging democratic star, laura mcgann wrote that she and sen. bernie sanders (i-vt) share a lot in common — except for the reaction they receive from political movers and shakers:
sanders congratulated biden from a rally in virginia beach on saturday night, telling his supporters that you can't win them all. his campaign said it was confident in its ability to meet the threshold to win some delegates in south carolina, but already had set its sights on super tuesday. sanders spent the last week campaigning in california, texas, virginia, north carolina and south carolina.
spicer: yeah, i -- i don't know on that one. as i -- i'll have to get back to you on that one. i don't know that we've gotten that far on the list of executive orders, but i'll be glad to get back to you.
bash: do you think that is (inaudible)?
what's different about the job guarantee is that it is universal and it's permanent. so it's an option that would exist not only in times of massive unemployment, but it also would exist in times where the unemployment rate is lower, darity said. but we still have large numbers of bad jobs. it's not just an emergency.
a prolonged slog for the nomination would raise the possibility of a contested convention, in which no candidate will win the magic number of delegates on the first ballot at this summer's convention in milwaukee. the last time the democrats' convention went past the first ballot was 1952.
and this is all playing out against a very awkward backdrop: comey briefed trump last month on the dossier that alleged that moscow had gathered compromising financial, political and personal material about him. the ensuing conversation came with seemingly unavoidable conflicts, matt zapotosky, ellen nakashima and greg miller note. it is not clear whether comey told trump that the fbi had or was still pursuing allegations made in the dossier, but doing so would have involved telling an incoming president with significant power over the fbi that his associates were potential investigative targets.
5. hard stories at health care town halls
some parts of the country have struggled with limited insurance market competition for many years, which is one reason that, in the original debate over health reform, congress considered and i supported including a medicare-like public plan, obama wrote in the piece.
9:05 p.m. et both candidates entered the debate hall. the candidates didn't shake each other's hands.
perhaps health care will come up. perhaps, trump said at the annual governors' dinner.
trump's assistant secretary for health, adm. brett p. giroir, said if medicaid is cut and the aca is declared unconstitutional, those programs would have to be replaced so tens of thousands would not be left without coverage.
former arkansas gov. mike huckabee went even further, essentially accusing obama of enabling the eventual genocide of israelis. it is so naive that he would trust the iranians. by doing so he will take the israelis and march them to the door of the oven, he said on july 26, 2015.
it's true that, under medicare for all, people wouldn't have to pay private health insurance premiums any more. and sanders proposes $22.5 trillion in tax increases and military spending cuts to help offset the cost of his spending spree. but that still leaves a gap of more than $25 trillion.
kelli ward is facing former maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio and u.s. rep. martha mcsally in the republican primary for a u.s. senate seat.
georgia, kentucky, ohio and mississippi have passed bans on abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected. similar bills are working their way through the legislatures of south carolina, louisiana and alabama.
on roe vs. wade, the landmark 1973 ruling on abortion, barrett said in 2013 that the public response to controversial cases like roe reflects public rejection of the proposition that [precedent] can declare a permanent victor in a divisive constitutional struggle rather than desire that precedent remain forever unchanging. court watchers embrace the possibility of overruling, even if they may want it to be the exception rather than the rule.
he was diagnosed with brain cancer, then voted against republicans' efforts to repeal obamacare. he gave speeches and wrote op-eds urging americans to fight trumpism. his very last statement, prepared to be read after his death, was an indictment of trump.
we know one thing. it is actually more communicable than the flu. it passes between people very, very easily, he added.
new york (project syndicate)—commentators have offered many reasons why one should vote in november for joe biden, the democratic nominee for u.s. president. yet the economic dimension of the election has been of little interest to pundits, and few, if any, economists speaking on the subject have bothered to highlight how the outcome bears directly on people's welfare.
there's a reason major health care stocks surged by double-digits after biden's super tuesday victories. if the former vice president wins the nomination, and is serious about beating trump, he'd be wise to embrace single payer. in all 20 primary contests to date with an exit or entrance poll, most democrats — in some states as many as two-thirds or more — said they favor a government plan for all instead of private insurance.

for cruz, the looming dilemma is the same one confronting many conservatives who, like him, rose to prominence during barack obama's presidency in part on the promise of ripping up the president's affordable care act: is it better to accept a final bill that falls short of the repeal they have long championed or walk away from it?
[18:47:25] blitzer: the iowa caucuses are about to get under way, the first big test for the presidential election and for senator bernie sanders. the question tonight is whether he can overcome what seems to be hillary clinton's razor-thin lead over him in the polls in iowa.
but for republicans running for president in 2015 and early 2016, the correct position on the iran deal was simple: oppose it, the more vociferously, the better.

and it was interesting, i know when we talked about carrier at one point, someone said well, that's a thousand jobs. when you talk about those thousand jobs and their families, during the holiday season i would beg to differ that those people were unbelievably ecstatic that the president and the vice president intervened.
you know what solves it? trump asked, referring to obamacare. when the economy crashes, when the country goes to total hell and everything is a disaster — then you'll have riots to go back to where we used to be when we were great.

wow, the supreme court passed @obamacare. i guess @justiceroberts wanted to be a part of georgetown society more than anyone knew. — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) june 28, 2012
olsen continued, it's one of the reasons why you saw nothing happen when republicans controlled congress rather than reduce taxes for corporations and wealthy people and some individuals, thanks to marco rubio's tax credit, which most of the leadership fought until they had to give it to us.

on march 7, cummings, as the new chairman of the house oversight and reform committee, summoned the white house's newly confirmed drug czar to testify before his panel. he said he was angry it had taken carroll so long to appear.
there's riots and people have become so divided. instead of being american citizens, they decided to either be one side or the other. i think that that is just horrible, nickel said.
the national bureau of economic research study found that in the decade before donald trump took office, there might have been a correlation between deportation fears and the drop-off in the number of latino immigrants enrolled in the supplemental nutrition assistance program (snap), known as food stamps, and the affordable care act insurance program, also known as obamacare.
democrats need to win three senate seats to take the majority if they also win the white house, four if they do not. although cook political deems one democratic incumbent, senator doug jones of alabama, an underdog in his race, it also rates senate races in five states — north carolina, maine, colorado, arizona and montana — as tossups. all have republican incumbents.
the key thing about this moment is that when it happened, it didn't feel key at all.
so it is a pretty significant shift that they're now kind of downplaying expectations. ted cruz himself today, you can sense a little bit of doubt in his voice today. he said he is at peace where he is in iowa. he's saying, although he does feel good, he went on to say this is in god's hands. this is in voters' hands. he says if donald trump wins here tonight, he will happily congratulate him and then move on -- wolf.
that fall, the department brought its first criminal charges against chinese nationals accused of selling fentanyl to americans over the internet in cases that were filed in federal courts in north dakota and mississippi.
in 2018, sanders told npr that he didn't especially care whether the progressive candidates he was endorsing were winning their primaries. the point, he said, was to push the policies and the platforms more and more into the mainstream. i hope they win, he said in his senate office. maybe they don't. but if you get 45% of the vote now, next time you may well win. you have to start somewhere.
these memorial services aren't just about looking back on mccain's life through a certain frame; mccain used his impending death to try to steer a country he thought was going in the wrong direction back to his vision of a hawkish america championing democracy abroad.
planned parenthood has said that money it accepts for fetal tissue is used to cover costs, not to generate profit. in october, the group announced that it would no longer accept any reimbursements for fetal tissue used for research.
from there, appropriations fell further to an estimated $527.6 million in the current fiscal year, according to the crs report. that's a reduction of just under 23 percent.
and in that wzzm interview, james dodged questions for a full 10 minutes while correspondent nick lafave repeatedly (and admirably) tried to get him to offer something, anything, resembling a specific proposal. the most james would say is that he thought more transparency about hospital prices would bring down prices through competition and that i believe the decision-making should go to the people, not the federal government.
it's a comprehensive look at how we're keeping people out of this country that shouldn't be here, that people who are coming to visit are leaving when they're supposed to, to make sure that we're tailoring immigration policies that make sure that we're not an open door for anyone to just walk in, that the people who are here to visit our country safely or to come here to bring jobs or to support our economy are coming in. but i think he have to do immigration smartly, and that's what he's looking at.

clinton was campaigning in new hampshire on behalf of her mother, hillary clinton, ostensibly to tout the campaign's early childhood education plan. but she took sharp aim at sanders, who advocates for a single-payer system that would place control of health care in the hands of the federal government.
but in the wake of this fall's presidential election, highlands — like many other rural hospitals — will likely face new financial challenges that will intensify longstanding struggles, experts say.

mulvaney made a simple comparison: he said more people paid a fine for not having health insurance than people who gained from the aca, a.k.a. obamacare. so how do the numbers stack up?

lincoln was right — and it is time we heeded his words. i am not going to let america and its great companies and workers be taken advantage of anymore.

eisbrenner: right. she was in between jobs, and instead of having to pay the penalty, she figured she could put those dollars to use and get herself a policy. you know, it helped her out in that situation. you know, for somebody in her age bracket, in her situation, it worked.
democrats, meanwhile, are concerned that she would rule to kill the affordable care act, chip away at abortion rights and expand the scope of the second amendment.
as he returns to capitol hill after ending his presidential campaign, cruz has grown more powerful and influential with core gop voters, giving him a major platform to upend his party leadership's most carefully constructed plans. and as congress prepares to deal with major national issues – including a rescue plan for puerto rico requiring immediate action and government funding in the fall – many believe cruz could use his new bully pulpit to wreak havoc on capitol hill should he want to.
marlow described harvard westlake as the ritziest, most prestigious private school is los angeles, adding, it's an ultra-one-percenter environment.
without insurance, women can expect to pay $600 to $1,000 annually for oral contraception and more for longer-acting methods such as iuds.
it is not likely that any of those ideas will go anywhere, but doing this would demonstrate to voters that the law can be made to work better for them.
as his colleagues have rolled out scores of different medicare-for-all-style bills, sen. brian schatz (d-hawaii) has proposed the state public option act, which would allow people to use obamacare subsidies to buy a medicaid-type plan offered in the individual marketplaces.

trump is set to take office at a tricky time for the health law, with many americans in both parties complaining about rising premiums and other out-of-pocket costs. the republican-led congress has refused to make changes to the law that would help it work better — such as offering a fix when insurers cancelled policies that individuals thought they would be able to keep. as staunch opponents of the law, they, of course, have little incentive to improve it.
at planned parenthood, we treat thousands of patients who have never before been able to access cancer screenings, hiv tests, or treatment for diabetes and other chronic conditions. nearly 63 million people have gained access to preventive services such as no-cost birth control, well-woman visits, domestic violence screenings, and sexually transmitted disease and hiv screenings thanks to the aca.
widespread vaccinations could herald the beginning of a gradual return to normal life. politico reports the centers for disease control and prevention is set to release guidelines on safe activities for people who have been fully vaccinated as soon as tomorrow. the guidance will recommend that vaccinated americans limit their social interactions to small gatherings in the home with other vaccinated individuals and that they continue to wear masks in public.
underscoring washington's interest in lowering drug prices, white house press secretary sarah sanders on april 30 said president donald trump and top democratic lawmakers agreed during a much-anticipated infrastructure meeting that they should get together again in the near future to discuss prices for prescription medicines. trump feels drug prices should be much lower than they are today, sanders also said.
— and here are a few more good reads:
an estimated 4 million hispanics aged 18-64 gained coverage, and the share without insurance fell from 41.8 percent to 30.5 percent. among working-age african-american adults, the uninsured rate declined from 22.4 percent to 10.6 percent as 3 million got covered. and the proportion of non-hispanic whites without coverage went down from 14.3 percent to 7 percent as a result of 8.9 million adults between 18 and 64 becoming insured.

a top trump official would later testify before congress that the public health declaration was intended to bring awareness.
what to watch: the 21-member unity reform commission recommended a 60% reduction in superdelegates – binding dnc members to their states' results on the first ballot but allowing elected officials and former presidents and vice presidents to retain their unpledged status. vermont sen. bernie sanders' allies are pushing to go further – doing away with unpledged delegates altogether, at least on the first ballot.
abortion-rights opponents believe this is just moral consistency. if an embryo or fetus is a person, then ending that life is murder. nobody should be murdered, ergo an 11-year-old who has been raped should be forced to carry her pregnancy to term.
alternatively, the party may well unite behind trump or cruz if they win the nomination, even if it appears they are destined to lose the general election to the democratic nominee, said john feehery, a washington gop consultant. then maybe that loss would spark the kind of soul-searching that he thinks is needed to rebuild and repair the party.
the company will continue to offer individual policies outside of the obamacare exchanges in the vast majority of markets where it now does business. off-exchange products are not eligible for federal subsidies.

maybe market forces - ie. profitability - are incompatible or inapplicable when saving people's lives? unless, of course, you believe that only rich people's lives are worth saving because their wealth is merely a sign that god truly loves them (c.f. max weber's the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism).
trump said at the iowa rally: we are protecting people with pre-existing conditions, and we always will the republican party.
you have to go to school with those people. it was a level of betrayal to the white consciousness that made white people want to disengage from a collective that was no longer trustworthy.

bloomberg decided even before he launched his bid in late november to skip the early voting states of iowa, new hampshire, nevada and south carolina and instead invest hundreds of millions of his own money to compete in the delegate-rich super tuesday states holding contests on march 3 – and beyond.

biden has been critical of sanders' proposed medicare for all, which calls for a single-payer system.
trump absolutely, through executive action, could have tremendous interference to the point of literally stopping a train on its tracks, said sara rosenbaum, a professor of law and health policy at george washington university in washington, d.c.
americans got a big break on gasoline prices in 2015 as well as furnishings for their homes, but they got less relief on some of their largest expenses such as medical care and shelter.
-- noteworthy: trump held stock in the company building the dakota access pipeline – raising concerns that his investments could affect his decision making related to the $3.8 billion project. cbs news reports: trump's 2016 federal disclosure forms show he owned between $15,000 and $50,000 in stock in texas-based energy transfer partners … [and] owns between $100,000 and $250,000 in phillips 66, which has a one-quarter share of dakota access. while trump's stake in the pipeline company is modest compared with his other assets, ethics experts say it's among dozens of potential conflicts that could be resolved by placing his investments in a blind trust.
he turned out to be a horrible human being. he came in and said, i didn't vote for a nolan ryan. proud and i said, what do you mean you didn't vote for nolan ryan? he said, no, if don sutton didn't get in unanimously, nolan ryan doesn't deserve. and he wrote a huge article on it.
kurtis: it doesn't happen often. but we have seven right from mo, 14 more points and a tie...
his message is twofold. first, he explains that the shock of trump's win in wisconsin in 2016 was misplaced. yes, obama had won there twice, but his wins stood in stark contrast to what was going on in the state during his years in office — a drastic rightward shift in the state's power arrangements from the top statewide jobs to the local precinct level.

ellison grabs the single-payer torch: minnesota rep. keith ellison, the dnc deputy chair, is the new lead sponsor of the house single-payer health care bill, taking over the title from former rep. john conyers. the house allowed the largely symbolic switcheroo by unanimous consent on wednesday, but it was an important one for folks who didn't want the legislation attached to conyers' name after his resignation amid sexual harassment allegations last year. the movement carries on, ellison said in an interview that afternoon. i remain a staunch advocate of the aca, but we can imagine a world in which we can have universal health care styled on a 'medicare for all' bill.
conant, who is a former aide to rubio, said it's not unusual for senators to decline to campaign against their colleagues because they have to work together in the senate. nelson didn't go after rubio in 2016, conant pointed out.
the answer to that is, given the obstruction in d.c., it's remarkable what he has gotten done, he said. the crowd drowned out his answer forcing him to struggle for a moment — the stock market is going like 'zing!' for the first time — before moving on to a question about the second amendment.

and then the republicans and conservatives in congress will look up and say, wait a minute, how do i feel about this dividend? a lot of people in my district seem very excited about it. the one state that's had a dividend for almost 40 years, alaska, is a deep-red conservative state and it was passed by a republican governor. this is a big win for rural areas that are struggling and red states on the interior that have gotten blasted by automation. and so we just need some of these republican congressmen to say, i am for the dividend because i'm for economic freedom. and if you get a majority, then you can pass it. now, can you get all of them? almost certainly not. but this is a law like any other. so you don't need a supermajority. you just need a congressional majority to pass the bill.
president biden told reporters thursday that coronavirus relief will be passed with or without the support of congressional republicans.
2. no discrimination based on pre-existing conditions
the new america foundation conducted an in-depth analysis of 225 terrorists that had been apprehended since 9/11, and the study found that the contribution of nsa's bulk surveillance programs to these cases was minimal.
still, with the health coverage of more than 20 million people hanging in the balance, along with protections for millions more who have preexisting conditions, biden has said he has a plan for not only salvaging the law but making it stronger.
he went on to praise the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, for bringing access to health care to people who couldn't afford it.
and the torrent of new ads continued all day, with a new keep the promise spot monday evening that targeted trump on a different vulnerability: his support for obamacare, or as the ad christened it, trumpcare.
trump's unwillingness or inability to offer a comprehensive plan of his own to improve the health care of americans, other than his campaign trail hyperbole, hampered the repeal efforts to the gop in the house and the senate.
cornish: david, the democrats are putting a lot of stock in conversation about health care. how are you thinking about that?
a month later, the president changed course and apologized, saying of people who were losing their plans, i am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me. it was a politically expedient lie told about his own signature law.
not surprisingly, it was trump himself who took this to a ridiculous level last week when he tweeted: republicans will totally protect people with pre-existing conditions, democrats will not! vote republican.
my administration has acted decisively to confront the world's leading state sponsor of terror: the radical regime in iran.

but with just a two-vote margin in the senate, they can't ignore republican senators. so it was notable when arkansas sen. tom cotton tweeted that the house bill won't be able to win a senate majority. to my friends in house: pause, start over. get it right, don't get it fast.
former vice president joe biden falsely claimed president trump immediately discontinued an aid program to central america, and implied that's the cause of surging immigration across the u.s.-mexico border.
but once you subject this strategy to a moment's scrutiny, it becomes obvious that it will not bring about the result trump wants. indeed, the thinking here reflects a resolute refusal to appreciate an important reason the repeal effort melted down in the first place.
blitzer: grassley, of course, being the long-time iowa senator chuck grassley, who visits every county in the state every year.
still, the clock is ticking. if you've lost coverage because of a job loss, that's what's called a qualifying life event. you can go to healthcare.gov or your state's insurance exchange right now to enroll in a new plan.
even without the rare moments of honesty, however, we would know this is what republicans want because of the simple fact that they've been trying to slash health care programs for decades.
johnson: yes, it is that big of a deal.
that same month, the white house proposed slashing medicaid by $1.5 trillion over 10 years, which could further undercut drug treatment coverage nationwide.
but the whole conversation appears to have become moot because of additional conditions republican leaders have attached to any affordable care act stabilization proposal. and by far the most important among these is the language around abortion.
complicating matters further, republicans have been trying to pass repeal legislation through budget reconciliation ― an expedited process that would allow republicans to get a bill through the senate without the threat of a democratic filibuster, so that a simple majority vote would be sufficient.
the state is the first in the country with a proposal testing the administration's push to allow states flexibility with the safety net program.
after weeks of will-they-or-won't-they tensions, the house managed to pass its gop replacement for the affordable care act on thursday by a razor-thin margin. the vote was 217-213.
16 questions and answers about the 2016 gop delegate fight
the president threw another temper tantrum, added senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.).
the public still holds largely partisan views on the health reform law, and opinions have remained relatively unchanged since the republican efforts to repeal it. but according to recent democratic polling, the electorate still prefers congressional democrats' approach to the issue over congressional republicans' approach by a double-digit margin.

we were at a distance of some 10 miles from the southern gates of mosul. we heard, saw multiple detonations. the sound of fast-moving aircraft overhead was pretty constant, this as kurdish fighters on the ground are really digging in and holding defensive lines a small distance away from that city.
those changes are one reason the number of americans without health insurance is so much lower than it was before the affordable care act became law.
i was never under an illusion that we would get majority republican support, obama said. but it was my belief that a law signed by mitt romney, and that could be traced back to ideas that had appeared in the heritage foundation literature, would give some political cover to those republicans who were so inclined to vote for it.
a devout catholic, she is the mother of seven, including a child with down syndrome and two children she and her husband, jesse barrett, adopted from haiti. she is beloved in her community and by her students at notre dame law school, where she taught for 15 years; she was voted best professor three times and still teaches part time at the school.
the soi data shows that 3.3 percent of tax returns paid a mandate penalty.
declining government spending would reduce the federal deficit, the cbo predicted in that report, and average premiums for people buying coverage on their own would end up lower than they would have been otherwise. but those lower premiums would be a byproduct of older and sicker people dropping insurance altogether ― because insurers would have made it too pricey for them, and because the plans available on the market would have tended to cover much less.
it was a friendship that would remain strong to the very end. mccain died on saturday at 81.
schilling: greg maddux is the best pitcher in the history of the game.
another person submitted to the committee for consideration told huffpost that, while no one in the single-payer world wants to say this hearing is a farce, there's a significant concern it will be co-opted into a defense of the affordable care act.
levin: do you think you'll run?
the president hailed obamacare for reducing the uninsured rate from 16% in 2010 to 9.1% in 2015 and providing more comprehensive coverage for millions of americans. he also credited health reform for helping slow the growth rate of health care costs in recent years.
over the summer, a conservative group called the center for medical progress released undercover videos and accused planned parenthood of performing partial birth abortions and selling fetal tissue.
in ohio, a measure to limit the price on prescription drugs purchased by the state, which was strongly opposed by the pharmaceutical industry, was defeated. the referendum called for capping what the state pays for pharmaceuticals to the same price paid by the federal department of veterans affairs for the same drugs.

these reflections on the court's instinct for self-preservation lead me to a final question: what to do about the census case? as the world knows, the deeply contested question of the validity of the trump administration's plan to ask about citizenship has become even more fraught with revelations from the computer files of a recently deceased republican redistricting specialist, thomas hofeller. the documents appear to validate the conclusion reached by federal district judge jesse furman, whose ruling against the trump administration is before the justices, that the administration's purported good-government reason for adding the citizenship question was a pretext. the real reason, the documents indicate, was to provide a statistical basis for entrenching republican power by disregarding noncitizens in the population counts for future redistricting.
jonathan, thanks very much for joining us.
on medicaid, azar said the trump administration's previous proposal to slow the program's rate of growth should not be considered a cut. he dismissed the notion as washington speak.

the friday jobs report is the latest data to cast doubt on this premise, at least from an economic standpoint. but except for financial publications, it was not featured on print front pages and by saturday morning had disappeared from home pages online. even more significant, there were no celebratory tweets about the jobs numbers from democratic presidential candidates hillary clinton and bernie sanders. clinton's theme of the day, while glancingly acknowledging progress, was the need for more jobs and higher wages. sanders similarly said that despite gains, the american middle class has been declining for 40 years and railed against disastrous trade agreements.

trump said clinton wants to move to a single-payer plan like canada's. he added that it should be repealed and replaced.
but, his campaign on monday confirmed to fox news that if he were to qualify, the former new york city mayor and billionaire business and media mogul will take part in the primetime showdown.
the mandate was always among the law's most controversial features and was the basis for the first legal challenge, which suggested congress lacked authority to impose such a requirement. the court rejected that lawsuit, with chief justice john roberts leading a 5-4 majority, on the theory that the financial penalty was simply a tax and congress has the power to impose taxes.
the affordable care act protects people with preexisting conditions, mostly by prohibiting insurers from denying them coverage or charging them higher premiums. it also requires that all plans cover 10 essential benefits, including mental health, maternity care and prescription drugs.

he's a vote-getter: the senate majority — and whether republicans could block democrats' governing majority — hung in the balance the same week that congress was going to confirm president-elect joe biden's win. the two republican senate candidates had gone all in on trump and his false election fraud claims. trump held a rally in georgia on monday, the eve of the election and two days before the riot at the capitol. sen. kelly loeffler (r-ga.) joined him there, and announced that she'd be challenging trump's electoral college loss in her state despite there being no evidence or legal basis to do so.

between des moines, cedar rapids, davenport and dubuque, you have the biggest cities in iowa, they're not huge, but they're the population centers. can donald trump win those area areas? that's the fight for the suburbs or that's where marco rubio is organizing the hardest, along the romney map. so, watch out and see here. and then, of course, we're going to look for surprises.

health savings accounts will be able to pay for premiums. under irs rules, people with high-deductible plans are eligible for health savings accounts (hsas), accounts into which people can put money for health care expenses tax-free. under this bill, people would for the first time be able to use that money for premiums. americans' deposits in hsas have ballooned over the last decade, according to hsa consulting firm devenir. however, those accounts also tend to benefit higher-income people more than others, as kaiser health news' michelle andrews wrote in december — for example, richer people are more likely to have the extra money to sock away for health expenses.
dnc moves to curb superdelegates: the fight over exactly what role superdelegates should play in the 2020 nominating process won't be resolved until this summer – but the democratic national committee voted over the weekend on a big-picture goal: reducing them. the full dnc accepted a recommendation to revise the role and reduce the perceived influence of superdelegates. what that means, exactly, will be sorted out by the rules and bylaws committee ahead of a june deadline to prepare a final proposal for the august dnc meeting.

for the last two years, republicans promised to protect preexisting conditions while trying to gut them. for the next two years, they may pretend to abandon health care repeal, but they're doing everything they can to repeal, sabotage and overturn it, said jesse ferguson, a top democratic strategist. if they were serious about stopping health care repeal, they would be doing something to stop trump's department of justice from trying to strike down the entire law.

and then to hear, well, look at this shot, and it's not -- it wasn't that big. it's a little demoralizing because when you're sitting there and you're looking out and you're in awe of just how awesome that view is and how many people are there and you go back and you turn on the television and you see shots of comparing this and that. and then you look at the stuff that's happening.
aside from providing health care to a largely poor population, it provides hundreds of jobs in a town that locals say never recovered after industries such as coal mining and glass manufacturing disappeared.
premiums are rising more quickly this year, with insurers requesting an average increase of 25 percent, according to charles gaba of acasignups.net. that's an average, with a great deal of variation ― and there are, in fact, people whose plans are getting dramatically more expensive next year.

after all, since you're running a business you'll be on the hook for both the employer and the employee share of social security and medicare taxes. that can be a costly surprise to many just starting out as self-employed individuals or independent contractors getting 1099s instead of w-2 tax forms.
aside from trump's dubious characterization of the result as an electoral college landslide -- the winning candidate has earned a larger share of electoral votes in 45 of 58 presidential elections, the new york times has noted -- it's not true that people haven't seen such a margin of victory in a long time. obama had a bigger margin in both of the two previous elections.
so that is our position. the next question then is, how much does it cost? he said. what's the value that we will get from having people be able to have affordable insurance? what's the value? and what this data help to provide in that conversation is that, 'yes it matters.'

unsurprisingly, it immediately received flak from both sanders' and biden's campaigns, who criticized it for going too far, and not far enough.

vandalism also has been a problem. at joshua tree national park, vandals created illegal roads through the southern california park by cutting down several joshua trees, which are native to the desert and have an average lifespan of about 150 years.
big majorities also support rejoining the paris climate agreement, offering a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants and expanding obamacare with a public option. one month in, biden's presidency gets the approval of well over 50 percent of americans, something trump never had in the aggregate of polls in his four years.

i want to know why we had to have a civil rights movement in 1960 to give minorities the rights that they were given in 1870?
yeah. i mean, i do my best in the book to try to find examples time and time again that give lie to the idea of the zero-sum not only enumerating the costs of racism to white people, to widen the aperture that has completely unwittingly and not at all with anything but positive intent communicated a story in recent years of white privilege that suggests that racism is good for white people, so maybe they should actually keep it. if i'm told all the time that racism is to my benefit, the only thing i have to make me want to join with racial justice advocates to fight against racism is a sense of self-sacrifice. and at a time of widening insecurity, that's not enough. it's also not true. i mean, we hit on the formula in this country for making broadly-shared prosperity for the masses. and we walked away from it because of racism. that is more clear to me now than ever. and you get reports coming out every six months it seems from citigroup this summer saying that we've lost nearly $20 trillion in economic output because of the racial-economic divides over the past 20 years. or the federal reserve bank just this past week — a report saying we lost $2 trillion in economic output in 2019 because of the economic gaps between white men and everybody else. it's no way to run a country. we're leaving some of our best players on the sidelines.

and i think that for those people around him, his senior team especially, but so many of the other folks that are either here in the administration, that gave up their time during the transition, they left a job to work for three or four weeks because they are so committed to having his nominees get through, it's a little demoralizing to turn on the tv day after day and hear, can't do this, this guy's not going to get confirmed, not way they're going to go through.
cities that didn't cooperate with secure communities didn't see the same declines.
so far, the incoming trump administration hasn't released its health plan to replace obamacare. but, experts say, it is likely to give the states less federal money for treating the poor. it is unclear how rural hospitals will compensate for the financial benefits they are likely to lose — or how many more rural hospitals will fall.
biden's campaign may enjoy only a short-lived boost, however, as he faces a steeper test on super tuesday. sanders is topping polls of states including california and texas, and is the front-runner in national surveys, according to realclearpolitics.

the new york times first reported on tuesday that the administration is giving some insurers and employers a one-year grace period to adhere to the limit, which otherwise would have capped individual costs at $6,350 a year. the full requirement will go into effect in 2015, rather than 2014. the change means some employers -- namely, those with more than one benefit provider -- could use plans with higher limits or no limit at all on out-of-pocket costs during that period.

with the supreme court poised to decide the future of the affordable care act and the senate set to confirm president trump's third appointee to the high court, judge amy coney barrett, health care was a key topic during thursday night's debate. mr. trump and democratic nominee joe biden were asked to detail their health care plans should the justices vote to kill the obama-era health care law.

the message nextgen is deploying, however, is surprisingly simple. the best way to get young voters eager to pull the lever for a 77-year-old they overwhelmingly rejected in favor of sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) during the presidential primaries is to point out his agreement with them on a host of issues. the ads don't make grandiose arguments about how biden will unite the country but instead argue he's the best bet for progress on issues younger adults care about.
aside from sanders' pledge, however, the speech served as an implicit rebuttal to biden and other democrats who have adopted conservative talking points in their efforts to discredit sanders' plan.
paul was defiant that he did nothing wrong, despite bipartisan criticism for his behavior and even sharper private furor among senators and aides because he had potentially exposed them to a virus whose debilitating effect on the nation's health and economy lawmakers were working so ferociously to combat, they add.

during his 40-minute remarks in south carolina and in three speeches in iowa later on saturday and on sunday in iowa, sanders did little to conceal that he is strongly considering another presidential run. he spent a good chunk of his time recounting how the policies he championed as a presidential candidate are now squarely in the democratic mainstream.

a week later, trump mentioned fentanyl publicly for the first time as president; he had been in office for nine months. trump also took christie's advice by declaring the opioid crisis to be a public health emergency — a step obama officials had decided not to take in may 2016, when health policy experts asked for the declaration for fentanyl.

what are your thoughts on whether political conventions serve any purpose other than providing a platform for long-winded speakers and advertising revenue for the networks? would it imperil our democracy if we just said, 'never mind, don't bother,' and directed our resources toward getting mlb back in business? – mary carol miller, greenwood, miss.
public opinion data suggests why some democrats remain hesitant about embracing an entirely government-run health care program. polls have shown repeatedly that medicare for all's support drops if voters think it means displacing their private insurance altogether. when asked in a henry j. kaiser family foundation health tracking poll to choose between medicare for all and proposals that augment the affordable care act, for example, 36% of democrats chose medicare for all and 57% preferred plans that build upon obamacare.
that 52 percent who said trump wasn't honest actually matched the highest percentage ever to say that about barack obama, which happened in 2013, after the botched rollout of the obamacare website.

the challenges we face as a nation are great. but our people are even greater.
polling shows biden leading trump by significant margins among young people, both nationally and in key swing states. but top democratic operatives have long worried about young people's relative lack of enthusiasm to actually cast a ballot in 2020 and fear it could prove politically deadly in a close race.
the organizations will almost certainly respond by downsizing and scaling back services, so that they end up providing less help, reaching fewer people, or both.
and america is a land of preexisting conditions. half of adults under age 65, or up to 133 million people, had health issues that could cause them to be denied coverage or charged exorbitant premiums, according to a 2017 government analysis.
a question about trump's chicago tweet:
my administration has sent to the congress a commonsense proposal to end the crisis on our southern border.
in the 12 months since january 21, 2017, women have been organizing and agitating like never before. the pussy hat has become an international symbol of the resistance. homegrown women's groups are popping up everywhere, from phoenix to kenosha, wisconsin. tried and true political organizations such as emily's list have seen record numbers of women expressing interest in running for office – more than 26,000 since the 2016 election, according to emily's list president stephanie schriock. and women have been a driving force behind scrappy startups such as swing left and run for something, which are changing the electoral landscape by bringing in new candidates with fresh perspectives.
we don't know the -- her fate. but, big picture, do you think it should be the position of the united states to negotiate in order to get aid workers or americans who are hostages of groups like isis? because, currently, it is not.
meanwhile, biden campaign spokesman michael gwin has told reuters that biden will effectively lower taxes for the middle class by giving them refundable credits that reduce what they pay for health care coverage and help them purchase their first home and pay for child care.
if there's a time that people particularly need access to good health care and health insurance, it's during a global pandemic.

digital first media/longmont times-call/getty images sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) greets supporters in boulder, colorado, on wednesday. as he campaigns on behalf of the democratic cause in this year's midterms, he's also gearing up for another white house run.
martin: you say you've been working on these issues. others might say you've been working in the swamp, to use donald trump's language.
the vote was 50-48 in favor of the measure with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell, r-ky., yet to vote.
this is the closest we will ever get to repealing and replacing obamacare. the time is here; the time is now. this is the moment, said ryan, summing up the situation as a binary choice for republicans: ditch obamacare, or keep it.
that said, biden's platform is big on promises and light on funding details, which isn't uncommon for party platforms. and, of course, if biden does become president, the fate of his legislative ambitions will depend on which party controls the senate and the house of representatives. we'll know that on nov. 3, or fairly soon thereafter.
the first 100 days of a new job are crucial for both employer and employee. for the employer, those days set the stage of an employer's work ethics and productivity. for an employee, it helps gauge if this was the right move — executives and human resources staff say new hires tend to know if they're going to stay with a job for the long haul within the first six months. plus, keeping track of your work and progress builds good habits.
every president expands the power of the presidency, said neal devins, a law professor at the college of william & mary. this is a constant pattern. they never shrink the presidency. a president trump could say 'i'm going to use the obama playbook' and go pretty far. the difference between hillary clinton and donald trump is not going to be one of lawlessness, but of the policies they pursue.

as gop hails barrett, democrats convene a parallel hearing: about health care
i love the guy, but can you win? and then in that case, it's like, so i need to go with a guy that's a person who's going to win. and so now i'm, like, ping-ponging back and forth of who can win, who can win, and i have to give up the guy i love, you know?
this was the argument made by supporters of sanders in 2016: that while his positions were more liberal than the norm (and than clinton), he could have beaten trump simply by virtue of not being clinton running against a very unpopular republican. the energy he engendered from democratic primary voters might, they argue, have been key to goosing turnout enough for a victory.
health care has been a politically damaging issue for republicans, who before the pandemic repeatedly attempted to repeal obamacare, end medicaid expansion and significantly cut medicaid funding. the trump administration has continued to support a gop lawsuit to dismantle the affordable care act and pushed an effort to add work requirements for medicaid. since the pandemic, the trump administration promised to use some of the coronavirus stimulus funds to reimburse hospitals treating uninsured patients with covid-19, but there has been no plan to address the growing millions of uninsured americans more generally.
vice president mike pence and sen. kamala harris engaged in a more civil, substantive debate than president donald trump and democratic nominee joe biden did one week earlier.
he also falsely accused then-trump campaign manager now senior campaign adviser corey lewandowski of assault:
nyt: [former vice president joe biden] has shown his hand in a big and unusual way for a front-runner, saying he would pick a woman as a running mate. that has opened the path for democratic officials to start picking favorites — from a socially safe distance. in discussions with the times since mr. biden's big primary victories on tuesday, 60 democratic national committee members and congressional and party leaders most frequently proposed three former rivals of mr. biden as his running mate — senator kamala harris of california, senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts and senator amy klobuchar of minnesota. next up was stacey abrams, a former state house leader whose defeat in 2018 georgia governor's race remains disputed by many in the party. other popular suggestions included senator catherine cortez masto of nevada and representative val demings of florida. the democrats interviewed also proposed seven other women, including govs. gretchen whitmer of michigan and michelle lujan grisham of new mexico.
obamacare isn't working. by nearly any measure, it has failed, and no amount of 11th-hour, reality-denying or buck-passing by democrats is going to change the fact that more americans are going to get hurt unless we do something, he said on the floor after the bill was posted. republicans believe we have a responsibility to act, and we are.
sagal: following a two-day meeting, the federal reserve decided to leave key blank rates unchanged.
the jail, built in 1884 to hold 24, now houses 55 men and women, a number that can swell to as many as 90. the inmates are sprawled on metal bunk beds and mattresses that line the floors as they wait for court appearances or serve time on low-level drug offenses.

does the republican party see that the federal government has a role to play in helping to address the nation's economic and social challenges? asked olsen. the default position on the right — although they will often deny it — is no.
no one knows what trump would really do, which is why people are so freaked out, devins, the law professor , said. if he did push the boundaries dangerously, it really would depend on congress, and it would take an awful lot for republicans to join with the democrats to assert themselves and slap him down.
some of that is due to polarization, with obamacare popular among democratic voters and unpopular among republicans for reasons that probably have little to do with anything but partisan loyalty. but performance is still an issue. many millions still can't pay their medical bills, because they don't have insurance or their insurance covers too little. the u.s. still has the world's most confusing and expensive system, with little evidence that the extra money buys better quality.
cuba is decorated with murals showing famous moments in the town's history, like an 1864 battle during the civil war. it's a town that knows something about a divided country.
the 142-page measure would provide tax credits, based on income, age and geography, which would make more money available to lower income recipients to help them buy insurance. this differs from the house bill, which tied its tax credits to age. obamacare taxes would be repealed under the bill. the senate bill would provide for expanded tax-free health savings accounts, and it would also eliminate federal funding for planned parenthood.
remember when you were told that you could keep your doctor, and keep your plan?

the state that sent to the senate gaylord nelson, the father of earth day, also elected sen. william proxmire, the maverick known for his golden fleece awards that pilloried government waste. and the state's current brace of senators, republican ron johnson and democrat tammy baldwin, share little in common beyond the state flag.
we must choose whether we are defined by our differences — or whether we dare to transcend them.
at the same time, roberts began incorporating arguments that would invalidate the medicaid expansion. this was a strange turn. none of the lower courts that had taken up the aca had rejected the medicaid expansion, and it wasn't seen as controversial in terms of constitutional debate and public controversy.

president trump is coming up on his first 100 days in office — officially, april 29 — but he's not the only one who can make an impact in the first few months of a job. and as hiring managers are sensitive to first impressions, it's good to be on you're a-game during the first 100 days, too.
i said to [trump] that i thought there was a lack of urgency to the way president obama's administration had dealt with this issue, and that as a result, the problem had gotten worse, christie recalled in an interview. we needed to go after this in a really aggressive way.

freedom in republicans' description can often be a rationalization for widening inequality and refusing to protect americans from dangers to health and safety. we might be maximizing ivanka trump's and jared kushner's freedom with huge tax cuts, but for the rest of americans, the massive tax cuts for the rich or rollback on workplace safety or proposing to cut funds for the special olympics (how do these people sleep at night?) don't look like freedom.

and we've already seen both bernie sanders supporters as well as hillary clinton supporters who have arrived tonight. in fact, the hillary camp set up shop where barack obama's group was eight years ago when barack obama won this caucus site. and hillary obviously did not. so they're hoping that this will give them good luck, and that things will change this time around.
martin: well, on that, how much does the perception of honesty have to do with transparency? there have been all kinds of calls for donald trump to be more transparent about his own financial holdings. do you think that he needs to open the books? does he need to be more transparent?
that proposal is separate from the democrats' intraparty debate on whether to expand coverage through government plans instead of using subsidized private insurance. while the strongest advocates for medicare for all envision eliminating all or most private insurance, others want to give people the option of remaining in a private plan or buying into a government-run plan like medicare or medicaid.
i think what we got wrong was underestimating ... the degree to which political polarization meant that the issue was never settled. former president barack obama

the vast social-distancing project of the last 10 days or so has been necessary and has done much good. warnings about large gatherings of more than 10 people and limiting access to nursing homes will save lives, the board wrote.  … yet the costs of this national shutdown are growing by the hour, and we don't mean federal spending. we mean a tsunami of economic destruction that will cause tens of millions to lose their jobs as commerce and production simply cease. many large companies can withstand a few weeks without revenue but that isn't true of millions of small and mid-sized firms.
operated as nonprofits and seeded with federal loans, co-ops were conceived as an alternative to commercial insurance. co-ops' members serve on the board. advocates envisioned co-ops spurring competition by giving americans a way to buy health insurance from companies with a strong consumer focus.

this is one of the biggest disasters in the history of american government, and that's saying something. it's also one of the biggest lies ever peddled to the american people. obamacare is fraud on an unprecedented scale. remember, it was sold to the american public as a voluntary exercise – if you like your plan, you can keep your plan, period. barack obama smugly assured skeptics that his health care plan would be so awesome that millions of americans would rush to drop their old plans and buy into obamacare, saving thousands of dollars in the process.
congress has long struggled with addressing gun violence in america, even in the wake of mass shootings going back to columbine in 1999. but democrats reintroduced the background check expansion act, gun control legislation which would expand background checks for all firearm sales or transfers in the country. the likelihood of actually passing the bill remains small and it would need significant republican support to overcome a legislative filibuster.

more provocative ideas from project syndicate:
sanders claimed that trump tried to throw 32 million people off their health care that they have, a figure that includes people who would choose to no longer purchase insurance if congress repealed the affordable care act without replacing it. as we've written before, it's misleading to say 32 million would all be thrown off.

zach wamp, in august 2017—nearly a year after trump won the election and months into his presidency—attacked the president claiming he put all republicans at risk:
the more liberal arm of the democratic party, though, has been pushing for years to go further. what in 2004 was a fairly quiet push for single-payer — that is, government-centralized — health care championed by former vermont governor howard dean had, by 2016, become sen. bernie sanders's (i-vt.) medicare-for-all campaign platform. as 2020 looms, announced democratic primary candidates have broadly supported the idea of going a step further than obamacare in ensuring coverage for all americans.
but in the u.s. 33.5 million people so far have had to file for unemployment benefits — and most people in the nation get their health insurance through their jobs. an analysis from the kaiser family foundation published wednesday estimates that 27 million people have recently lost their health coverage.
davis: you know, there are put up or shut up moments in life, audie, and this is one for the united states senate and republicans in the senate. mcconnell is essentially asking republicans to vote for something they've already voted for. this is a rehash of a 2015 vote in which every republican senator except one - susan collins of maine - voted to essentially repeal all of obamacare and didn't offer much to replace it with. and one advocate of this strategy is kentucky senator rand paul. and this is what he had to say today.

biden admin tells supreme court obamacare is constitutional, a reversal of trump's doj stance in pending case
but barr is refusing to meet with several democrats on the committee he will appear before next week, with the administration citing the shutdown as the reason. a daily beast reporter wondered:
hawley cited what he called inappropriate questioning about barrett's catholic beliefs and affiliation and said it was nothing less than bigotry, a bid by opponents to bar barrett from public office based on her religious identity — which is protected under the constitution.
all the king's men by robert penn warren (1946) - you know the king in this novel, willie stark, better as his real-world inspiration, louisiana's dictatorial governor of the 1930s, huey long. warren's writing is so good and his characters so real that you will practically smell the acrid cigar smoke and whiskey in the back room of slade's pool hall. if you never read it -- or never gave it a chance as required reading in school -- you owe it to yourself.
spicer: what regulations are stopping you from conducting more business? what are the ways that we can give you more market access into other countries around the globe? and i think that's what his focus is going to continue to be, is how do we create a tax and regulatory environment that grows the economy and benefits the american working? so it's not just about creating more jobs but it's also about lifting up those job through higher wages.
schilling: i would argue, it's probably the same reason you have a hard time getting a liberal sit in this chair because the second you -- i'll converse and debate anybody. i am open -- one of the things i was when i played, i was coachable. i would listen to anybody about anything because it would help make me better.
nothing is ever that simple in politics, of course. analysts have attributed the rise of hyperpartisanship and trumpism to a confluence of events. there was the 2008 recession that aggravated polarization on both sides of the aisle. the weakening of campaign finance laws allowed outside groups to spend millions to steer politics in their preferred directions and made politicians dive for safety in the ideological corners of their party. gerrymandering. voters self-sorting into liberals in cities, conservatives in rural areas. mistakes democrats made in the 2016 presidential race.
mr. obama's veto — only the eighth of his presidency — was expected, and his decision to issue a simple message without holding a public ceremony indicated that he did not wish to draw attention to the showdown. republicans do not have the votes in the house or the senate to override the veto.
rovner: that's right. the law allows insurance companies in these new marketplaces, the exchanges, to charge higher premiums for people who smoke - up to one and a half times the premiums that nonsmokers will be paying. but some insurers had wanted to charge younger smokers a smaller surcharge, if you will, than older smokers. maybe one and a quarter times instead of one and a half times, since they've been smoking less long and are likely to be healthier overall.
the shutdown entered its 22nd day on saturday, surpassing the previous 21-day record set in late 1995 and early 1996 during the clinton administration.
even taking the lower number would more than double the percentage of the population who gained from obamacare. so it would be 7.7 percent, versus 3.3 percent or fewer making payments.
levin: curt schilling, you read a lot of history you said. military history, in particular. you see what the president of the united states is trying to do with north korea. it's very, very difficult. he was handed a real bad hand there. he's accused of going soft on russia, yet he's tougher on russia than obama has ever been.
since entering the race last spring, former joe biden has slipped eight points in iowa, according to the latest cbs news battleground tracker poll. biden continues to lead nationally and remains a top-tier candidate for his party's nomination, but in interviews during the first two weeks of november with a dozen top democratic leaders, officials and strategists, many expressed concerns to cbs news campaign reporters musadiq bidar and adam brewster about biden's standing in iowa.
as we have seen, when we are united, we can make astonishing strides for our country. now, republicans and democrats must join forces again to confront an urgent national crisis.
manchin has made his reputation as a conservative democrat, voting to confirm justice neil gorsuch to the supreme court in 2017 and gina haspel as director of the central intelligence agency in 2018. he is a major target of republican efforts to get vulnerable democrats to vote for supreme court nominee brett kavanaugh. manchin hasn't ruled out voting for mr. trump in 2020.
but in a time when he's trying to unite this and he keeps talking about uniting this nation, bringing this nation together, and then a tweet goes out in a pool(ph) report to -- what? -- a few thousand people saying that he removed the bust of martin luther king, how do you think that goes over?
esos esfuerzos por hacerlo desaparecer fueron más enfáticos en lo referente a las políticas. un exfuncionario de la casa blanca comentó que trump interrumpió una presentación para verificar que una propuesta del personal no fuera una cosa de obama.
for one of the important consequences of the 2012 election was that mr. obama was able to go through with a significant rise in taxes on high incomes. partly this was achieved by allowing the upper end of the bush tax cuts to expire; there were also new taxes on high incomes passed along with the affordable care act, a.k.a. obamacare.
trump administration officials instructed employees at multiple agencies in recent days to cease communicating with the public through news releases, official social media accounts and correspondence, raising concerns that federal employees will be able to convey only information that supports the new president's agenda, juliet eilperin and brady dennis report. the environmental protection agency as well as the agriculture and interior departments now have formal policies restricting what they should convey to the public about their work. … many new administrations — including former president barack obama's — have moved quickly to take control of the u.s. government's public relations machinery and centralize decision-making upon taking office. but the sweeping nature of some of the new controls is unusual.
it's a great start, alexis mcgill johnson, head of the planned parenthood federation of america, said of biden's actions. but, i'll emphasize again, this is a start. we need to both undo the damage of the next four years and move policy and our collective imagination forward.

such grants are central to kettl's solution, which draws inspiration from the writings of alexander hamilton, who championed a strong central government because he was skeptical that the states could ever give the country the direction it needed. kettl's advice is to transform the grants' role by focusing them primarily on inequality-busting initiatives to redistribute wealth from rich to poor, and social benefits to the very young and very old from the rest of us. as part of this effort, washington would take a stronger hand in how medicaid is administered by the states and in encouraging the states to adopt policy innovations successfully tested by their counterparts.
dionne: well, first of all, good for law enforcement for finding mr. sayoc so quickly. it shows what's happening on the right side of politics that there were already people saying, oh, this is a false flag operation by liberals. and whatever else we know about mr. sayoc, his van is plastered with pro-trump and anti-liberal messages. as ryan said, his twitter feed suggests he's on the trump side if he's on any side at all.
washington — several republican senators on monday proposed a partial replacement for the affordable care act that would allow states to continue operating under the law if they choose, a proposal meant to appeal to critics and supporters of former president barack obama's signature health law.
i think it's important for us as a country, as leaders of this nation, to not allow ourselves to be terrorized by these radical extremists, not allow ourselves to fall into the trap that they are trying to set up. and understand that when these very difficult things happen, just as we've seen most recently in jordan, that we must strengthen our resolve, we must strengthen our focus and commitment, understanding exactly who our enemy is, why they are perpetrating these horrific acts and then come up with an effective strategy to defeat them.

to get covered, americans will have to navigate the country's fragmented health care system ― there's the aca, known as obamacare, public options like medicaid, and cobra, the federal program that lets individuals continue their former employer's health care plan at personal cost. as huffpost's jeffrey young explained, there are barriers to all these options.
following publication of this article, it came to huffpost's attention that harris had in fact received contributions over $200 from 14 people who appeared to be pharmaceutical executives. the harris campaign told huffpost it had already returned two of those donations and was in the process of returning 10 more. the campaign said it wasn't sure whether the other two are from pharmaceutical executives and is seeking clarification.

which brings us back to the markets and the economy, of course. obamacare, bank bailouts, reckless spending, infrastructure investment and anything else the u.s. government wants to do is a lot easier to do and has a temporarily positive effect on the economy so long as the government can borrow money at close to 0%. and whatever clinton or trump spend our future generation's money on by borrowing trillions will probably seem to work well at least while rates are this low.

under the senate's procedural rules, republicans can't repeal all of the affordable care act with a simple majority. it takes at least 60 votes, for example, to repeal the provision requiring insurance companies to cover everyone. leaving that piece in place while doing away with the requirement that all americans have insurance could trigger a sharp spike in premiums.

another case may determine whether the requirement in the 2010 affordable care act that all americans have some form of health insurance is still constitutional, even though republicans set the tax penalty for ignoring the requirement to zero. the court is also being asked to decide whether the entire obamacare law must fall because of that single provision.

much of that was how america had always been. we changed it, many of us, through some of the proudest struggles of our history. it wasn't easy, and sometimes it wasn't pretty, but we did it, together. we won voting rights for all. we ended jim crow, and we pushed open the golden door again to welcome immigrants. we achieved full rights for women, and fought to let people of all genders and sexual orientations stand in the light. and if we have not yet created the america that langston hughes swore will be — the land that never has been yet — if there is still much to be done, at least we have advanced our standards of humanity, hope and decency to places where many people never thought we could reach.
voters want to hear a positive message around health care: recent polling data revealed that preserving health care is the top voting issue for americans. democrats can be the party offering a bold and viable solution.

-- rick scott blindsides desantis on his way out, by politico's marc caputo and matt dixon: the contentious handoff of the florida governor's office from scott to fellow republican ron desantis has cast a shadow over their relationship, raising questions about whether the two prominent swing-state republicans are on a collision course as a result of their future ambitions for the white house. tensions between the old governor and the new governor had been simmering under the surface for more than a month, but it burst into public view tuesday after scott abruptly left his successor's inauguration ceremony, leading desantis to ad lib the parts of his speech in which he planned to personally thank scott. … desantis loyalists were already miffed that scott's political committee decided to throw a ball in washington to celebrate his installation in the u.s. senate that overlapped with the traditional inaugural celebration for the governor in tallahassee. those slights followed two other perceived insults friday, when the governor made more than 70 appointments without consulting desantis.
now, the democrats are politicizing the coronavirus, trump told the crowd. coronavirus, they're politicizing it. we did one of the great jobs. you see, 'how's president trump doing?' they go, 'oh not good, not good.' they have no clue. they can't even count their votes in iowa -- not they can't, they can't count their votes.
big pharma is clearly feeling the heat, said the campaign for sustainable rx pricing in a statement on phrma's first-quarter lobbying. that campaign, which regularly criticizes drugmakers, is backed by health insurers, hospital operators, physician groups, the aarp and pharmacy benefit managers, a sector that also has drawn flak on capitol hill for its role in pricing.

for weeks, democrats have been in an internal policy debate around the issue of health insurance. house democrats' latest relief package included several health care provisions, expanding how much the federal government chips in on medicaid payments, and subsidizing cobra at 100%. in other words, it would have the federal government temporarily foot the bill for the health insurance plans employers were once covering.
-- lindsey graham is one of the very few republican senators with the courage to speak forthrightly on this in public: i would urge the president to knock this off; this is the greatest democracy on earth, we're the leader of the free world, and people are going to start doubting you as a person if you keep making accusations against our electoral system without justification, lindsey told cnn.

he's close to obama and he believes in the same traditional things obama believed in and that's my number one priority, said jermaine edwards, 36, of orangeburg.
as of 2016, after excluding massachusetts and wisconsin, 29 states and the district of columbia expanded medicaid eligibility, but 19 states had not, according to the data that came from the us centers for disease control and prevention's wonder database.

switching the spotlight of the national debate from russia to health care so quickly would be risky under any circumstances but is particularly problematic given that a) the past five elections have shown that people care deeply about and vote on the issue of health care and b) getting rid of obamacare is not a broadly popular view with the american public.
as washington aims to rein in soaring drug prices, the spending by the industry's main trade group and seven key drugmakers has climbed to a level not seen in a decade.
what i did not see, for example, was republican governors refusing [federal] medicaid dollars that would provide health insurance to millions of their people, obama said. we've never seen in american history a situation in which state governments reject benefits for their people purely on ideological grounds.
-- a general rule of thumb: whether in sports or marriages, companies or campaigns, the more often you feel compelled to say publicly that your team is unified, the less likely it's true.
the mood of the negotiations is not very upbeat, said republicans familiar with the talks. mcconnell has presented ideas in closed sessions and has closely guarded the senate's plans in the hope that they will not leak to critics or the media. hatch struggled to project confidence about the process this week as he betrayed concerns. there's a difference between optimism about passage and optimism about getting it all put together the right way, hatch said, noting that senators have a lot to work through.
for example, analysts have suggested that the gop replacement for the much disliked individual mandate requiring most people to have insurance or pay a fine might not pass byrd rule scrutiny either. that's because the 30 percent premium penalty that people with a lapse in insurance would have to pay under the bill would go to the insurance company, not the federal government, so it would have no budget impact.
that's true. there were 12.3 million manufacturing workers in the u.s. last month, down from 17.3 million at the start of 2000, according to the federal bureau of labor statistics.
the facts: census bureau data show that the u.s. trade deficit in goods and services with mexico was $69 billion in 2017, up from $63 billion in 2016 and $58 billion in 2015.
when he was done: cheers. then it was on to the stump speech. he's going to repeal every word of obamacare and every illegal and unconstitutional executive action of obama., abolish the department of education and change the tax system so people can file their taxes on a postcard. cruz stood in the middle of a group of tables. a little girl waved to him much of the time. the two later talked about their birthdays.
plunging oil prices drove the average cost of regular gas to $2.14 a gallon by year end from $2.50 at the start of 2015, according to the energy information administration. as measured by the cpi, the cost of fueling up sank 20% in 2015.
staffer contact with these organizations may skew their perceptions of the public because the groups are more ideologically conservative than the public along the range of issues we study, the researchers wrote.
but people who look at only race will miss the larger story of what's going on with trump's crumbling numbers in the midwest. income tells a much clearer story. in wisconsin, trump is at 41 percent approval among voters earning at least $50,000 a year and only 28 percent with those earning less than that.in michigan, 32 percent of those earning under $50,000 approve of trump, compared with 37 percent earning at least $50,000 a year.

you get the program started, you figure out what the kinks are, what works, what doesn't. you amend, build, improve, refine ― that kind of iterative process, where you've set a goal and gotten the foundations laid, and then congress in a cooperative fashion works to keep making it better. that process, which is very beneficial because you're getting real data and feedback about what's working and what's not ― that's less available to you now. the process that built social security, built medicaid, medicare, that only works if you got both parties working in good faith.
on the daca piece. i think the president has been clear that he was going to prioritize the areas of dealing with the immigration system, both building the wall and making sure that we address people who are in this country illegally. first and foremost, the president's been very, very clear. that we need to direct agencies to focus on those who are in this country illegally and have a record - a criminal record or oppose a threat to the american people. that's where the priorities going to be and then we're going to continue to work through the entire number of folks that are here illegally. but right now the clear focus is on that.
the democratic congressional campaign committee released a statement this weekend touting edwards' emphasis on expanding medicaid. governor john bel edwards earned a second term by working to make health care more affordable and accessible for the people he serves in louisiana...house republicans are likely reconsidering just how eager they are to rubber stamp president trump's reckless agenda in washington, said dccc chairwoman cheri bustos in a statement.

the question now is whether this version of the bill could pass the senate. shortly after its release, maine sen. susan collins and kentucky sen. rand paul both said they intend to vote against letting the bill go forward. with two no votes, vice president pence could provide the 51st vote needed for passage. but if three republican senators defect, the bill cannot pass.

the house freedom caucus announced after a wednesday lunch meeting with sen. rand paul (r.-ky) that it has 25 hard-no votes, enough to defeat the american health care act crafted and promoted by speaker paul ryan (r.-wi) as a rescue for insurance companies caught in the obamacare death spiral.

in the midterms, 41% of voters said health care was the most important issue facing the country. three-quarters of that number said they supported democrats. obamacare, so long an albatross for democrats during the previous administration, is now much more popular than it was, despite its failure to provide all middle-income americans with affordable options.
you can have something that 70% of the country wants and it can't pass. and that can't be how any democracy functions over time.
simmons-duffin: yeah, it's really a lot of people. so 6 million of that 27 million actually do qualify for medicaid. they just don't know it. so they can go and enroll at any time. beyond that, if you don't qualify for medicaid, then you might be able to go to the obamacare exchanges. a dozen or more states that run their own marketplaces have opened what's called a special enrollment period. so if you live in one of those states, you can shop there. you don't have to prove you just had a job loss or something like that.

washington -- twenty million previously uninsured people have gained health coverage since the affordable care act became law in 2010, president barack obama said during a speech in milwaukee thursday.
in montana, gov. steve bullock, a democrat, jumped into the race to defeat the republican incumbent, senator steve daines, in march, just as the pandemic was exploding. three days later, a liberal group, protect our care, announced a $250,000 ad campaign attacking mr. daines as dead set on taking away montanans' health care after voting five times to repeal the health law. cook political moved the race to its tossup column last week.

clinton also said her mother has a plan to pay for her higher-education proposals, unlike sanders, who proposed free tuition at public colleges and universities. clinton has also proposed to make tuition at two-year and four-year public universities free.
the fact trump himself was the genesis for the $1,400 direct payments included in the democratic proposal is also not lost on republicans, multiple officials said.

the tax policy center projects that taxpayers exploiting this potential loophole could reduce the taxes the government collects by $2.6 trillion over 20 years. that is more than half as much as the main component of the individual plan, the reduction in rates on ordinary income. the lower rates are forecast to cost $4 trillion over the same period.
if democrats want to nominate someone who will build on obamacare, not scrap it; take on the n.r.a. and gun manufacturers, not protect them; stand up and give the poor a fighting chance and the middle class get restored, not raise their taxes and keep the promises we make, then join us. and if the democrats want a nominee who's a democrat [cheering], a lifelong democrat, a proud democrat, an obama-biden democrat, join us.
on the other hand, constituents like barton worry about the consequences of repealing the health law without an immediate replacement. they fear losing all or part of their health coverage, or losing jobs in the health care industry.
i long valued intellectual consistency above all. it was a theoretically laudable trait until it gave way to a myopic moral certainty that created troubling blind spots. this damaging predilection long predated my conversion to christianity, which turned a tiny spark of certitude into a raging inferno of unyielding self-righteousness.
but mccarthy seems to want a quick repeal. he told reporters that ending the affordable care act is easier and faster than passing an alternative policy, which would require more votes.

the aca guarantees health coverage for young people under 26 on their parents' insurance; now they could be disenrolled and forced to forgo health care altogether. repealing the aca means that health conditions insurers that had considered pre-existing conditions like pregnancy, hypertension, asthma and migraines will no longer be covered. americans will once again be priced out of the ability to care for their basic health needs.
garcia-navarro: all right, let's talk about the things that the president promised on the campaign trail - building the border wall, affordable health care, bringing back jobs. there's a lot there, but i'd like to know where you think he's done well and where you'd still like to see him do more. let's start with you, rena.
instead, premiums are up, and sky-high deductibles make the resulting health coverage virtually useless. the only reason many people are buying into this scheme is that obama is frog-marching them into it. the new york times analysis frankly acknowledges that word-of-mouth isn't helping.
america will again and soon be open for business — very soon, trump said at the daily white house news conference. we cannot let the cure be worse than the problem itself.

but in late night, as elsewhere, the personal is political. kimmel continued the story of his son's health crisis by discussing the broader context of health care in america.
for the combination of price hikes and weakened penalties would lead many healthy americans to forgo insurance. this would worsen the risk pool, causing premiums to rise sharply — and remember, subsidies would no longer adjust to offset this rise. the result would be even more people dropping out. republicans have been claiming that obamacare is collapsing, which isn't true. but trumpcare, if implemented, would collapse in a mar-a-lago minute.

republicans opposed the legislation from the start, saying it infringed on individuals and businesses as it aimed to insure millions more americans and control spiraling medical costs. texas and other gop states, which joined the national federation of independent business in the first obamacare suit known as nfib v. sebelius, have continued to challenge provisions of the law.

democratic sens. joe manchin, w.va.; joe donnelly, ind.; heidi heitkamp, n.d.; and claire mccaskill, mo. — all four in competitive re-election races in states that trump won — ended up crossing party lines to vote for the bill, along with newly-elected sen. doug jones, d-ala. but four republicans also voted no — sens. lindsey graham, s.c; rand paul, ky.; mike lee, utah; and jeff flake, ariz., meaning that a majority of republicans failed to vote for the measure.

president joe biden is set to begin his own victory lap this week, first by signing the law in a ceremony on thursday and then by delivering a prime-time speech on the anniversary of the nation's covid-19 shutdown. the white house is already promising biden, vice president kamala harris and both of their spouses will hit the road to sell the plan nationally.
please stop saying something globally bad is going to happen in 2030, he wrote. bad stuff is already happening and every half a degree of warming matters, but the ipcc does not draw a 'planetary boundary' at 1.5°c beyond which lie climate dragons.
biden's lackluster performance in the iowa caucuses makes a strong finish in next week's primary in new hampshire even more imperative.
in effect, bloomberg is asking democrats to overlook the fact that he hardly touches the party's heart -- and may be an imperfect messenger for grass roots energy that is moving to the left. he's implicitly arguing that only he can beat sanders and oust trump from the oval office.
the zero-sum story — i go back in the book to the beginning — where did we get the zero-sum story? it's not an obvious thing. it's not an obvious belief system. it's not a natural sense of group competition, and it's more widely held among white people than other people. and so i went back to the founding and the pre-founding of this country and showed how it was used to justify the first economic policies of this country, which were stolen people, stolen land, and stolen labor. that zero-sum racial hierarchy created the scaffolding. i do believe that since it's so aggressively marketed to white people through the lens of racial hierarchy, it's very clear to me that a white person can feel that way about other white people as well, that resentment and that desire to distinguish among the various small gradations on this ladder of human value. but it's that ladder of human value that was first mapped onto the american psyche as a racialized project. though disdain and distrust that particularly white americans have for people who are poor is a very racialized view — it's the idea that there's something inherently wrong with people who don't have enough money. it's also — of course, the whole thing is very rich. when you say that people are so resentful of people getting things in an unfair way, i mean, that's what the entirety of the white spoils system has been in this country.
khalid: yeah, you know, you mentioned california, and i should say that bernie sanders seems to have led both in nevada, as well as some of the polling we've seen even yesterday that looks at latino voters. and a sizable chunk of the electorate in both california and texas are latino voters.

obamacare is a big failure and it has to be changed, he told reporters tuesday. i'm not going to own it. i can tell you the republicans are not going to own it. we'll let obamacare fail and then the democrats are going to come to us and they're going to say, 'how do we fix it?'

lawmakers from both parties had collaborated in the late 1990s to create a new program for insuring children. the senators who led that effort were orrin hatch, the conservative republican from utah, and ted kennedy, the liberal democrat from massachusetts. at one point in 2008, a former kennedy aide told me, hatch dispatched his advisers to see if the two could work together on a universal coverage bill.
sagal: so how many, then, does adam need to win?
even the lesser burdens of a criminal investigation — including preparing for questioning by criminal investigators — are time-consuming and distracting. like civil suits, criminal investigations take the president's focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people. and a president who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as president.

now, the tables have turned. democrats are piling on trump, accusing him of breaking his campaign promise not to touch the federal health care program for the elderly.
i've seen him come along and be pretty constructive, said sen. orrin g. hatch (r-utah), who has been a cruz critic.
but i'm hearing you waffling over these two moderate candidates, biden and bloomberg. and the latest polling has sanders with close to what he had in 2016 in arlington. biden and bloomberg are around 20 percent too, because they're sharing a lot of voters. so if on super tuesday, sanders sweeps a bunch of these states, and he wins in places like virginia, it will likely have been because biden and bloomberg split the vote. and i wonder if you're thinking about that at all.
trump said at the iowa rally: we got rid of the individual mandate, the most unpopular thing, which essentially killed obamacare.
if the senate's parliamentarian allows the provision to remain in the bill, it could force leadership to have to make tough political decisions about whether now is the time for that intra-party fight.

the term carpet bombing dates back to world war ii, when the allies bombarded broad swaths of nazi germany and japan, killing thousands of civilians. as technology advanced, enabling the military to conduct more precise airstrikes, the united states shifted towards narrowly targeted attacks. during the gulf war, the united states used smart weapons systems designed to carry out attacks with surgical accuracy.

michigan gov. gretchen whitmer's administration agreed to pay former state health department director robert gordon $155,506 as part of an agreement that prohibited the two parties from disclosing information about the circumstances that led to his abrupt departure in january.
that idea had created worries of a two-tiered insurance system — one in which older and sicker people would opt into the more comprehensive plans, while younger and healthier people would choose the cheaper plans that covered less, potentially causing a death spiral on the exchanges for those older and sicker people.

the democrats today have one advantage, though. they can learn from the past. and when i asked obama to reflect on what he and the affordable care act's architects got wrong, he cited a failure to grasp the depth and duration of gop opposition. i think what we got wrong was underestimating the degree to which political polarization had ― the degree to which political polarization meant that the issue was never settled, the former president said, adding later, i think any progressive president, on any issue for the next several years, is going to have to confront the problem that the gop has shifted into a perpetual campaign mode.
furthermore, some of the republicans involved in this pre-existing conditions mess are particularly vulnerable.

yet he argued that what was right for his state is not necessarily right for the nation. romney grounded his argument in the founding fathers' vision for america, saying they didn't want a king-like structure grounded in a central government but rather for americans to have the freedom to choose our life's course, our enterprises.
also, the senate legislation provides a full premium subsidy through the end of september to laid-off workers who want to remain on their employer health insurance plans through cobra. the house bill would require them to pay 15% of the premium, which could still prove costly.
trump likes to trumpet his deregulation push as liberating the economy from bureaucrats. but this is not red tape that small businesses are caught up in. these are consumer protections meant to ensure that massively profitable multibillion dollar companies meet minimum standards. the economy, in fact, benefits from stronger health insurance protections so people with family illnesses can leave their companies to start new businesses.

treasury secretary steve mnuchin said on fox that while president trump doesn't regard the mandate as a bargaining chip in the tax negotiations, the overall goal of passing tax reform would take priority.
i've been writing about and prepared to profit from this ongoing bubble-blowing bull market for the last six years since i left tv and returned to trading. more recently, i've been outlining how negative interest rates around the world and how the u.s. economic/monetary cycle plus corporate earnings and financial engineering have been very bullish for both stocks and gold. those broader trends and cycles remain intact.
four years later, sanders pinpointed the new hampshire victory as the moment when his agenda of single-payer health care, a $15 minimum wage and free public college went from too radical, too extreme, to something viewed by many voters as a viable, appealing platform.

levin: well one of the things we'll be able to get is in that chair, i hope general flynn, who will for once be able to tell his side of the story. people don't understand that when a prosecutor is holding a legal gun to your head, you're not allowed to speak ...
in short, ryan has neglected his oath of office and has failed to fulfill his obligation to check the actions of the executive branch. by doing so, he has enabled and emboldened the most lawless and corrupt presidency since richard nixon.
5. this attack — that democrats want to eviscerate the medicare program — was popular among republicans in the 2018 election as they tried to turn the health-care issue to their advantage. trump has repeated such claims 56 times.
i'm so proud to endorse joe biden for president of the united states, obama said in a nearly 12-minute video statement. choosing joe to be my vice president was one of the best decisions i ever made, and he became a close friend. and i believe joe has all the qualities we need in a president right now.
levin: and that's an example on the wall.
the idea for the program came from talking to the company's employees and learning that many had a desire to finish college, but couldn't afford it, said noelle novoa, a senior manager for social impact communications at the company. starbucks officials realized they could help, she said.
oof: robin williams's suicide in august 2014 appears to be linked with a nearly 10 percent spike in the number of suicides in the united states in the following five months. our colleague amy ellis nutt reports on a study finding the increase was especially marked among men ages 30 to 44, whose suicide rate rose nearly 13 percent. even more notably, there was a more than 32 percent spike in the number of suicides by suffocation, which is how williams died.
free nations are the best vehicle for expressing the will of the people –- and america respects the right of all nations to chart their own path. my job is not to represent the world. my job is to represent the united states of america. but we know that america is better off, when there is less conflict -- not more.

archives spokeswoman miriam kleiman said the changes were made because the museum hosts young people and the messages could be deemed inappropriate and because, as non-partisan federal agency, the archives was trying to stay away from political controversy.
for years, arizonans expected flake to act on his campaign promises. they expected him to help secure the border, repeal obamacare in full and replace it with a free-market alternative, and hold the washington swamp accountable to americans outside the beltway. but establishment republicans such as flake have failed dreadfully. instead of supporting trump's america first agenda, which won trump arizona and nearly 63 million votes nationwide in 2016, flake and other never trumpers made it their agenda to undermine the president at every turn and curry favor from the failing anti-trump crowd.
i'm going to come to you for 45 seconds. 45 seconds for vice president biden.
the 2009 stimulus law started popular: a cnn poll conducted shortly before its passage found 54% of americans supported the law, with 45% in opposition. but unemployment remained high ― it was 9.8% when voters went to the polls in november 2010 ― and republicans ridiculed it as a waste of money, pointing to infrastructure projects that created few jobs and ridiculous-sounding scientific research it funded.
republicans are even inventing washington post fact-check articles that supposedly called their democratic opponents liars for saying republicans are lying about pre-existing conditions. some gop senators went so far as to introduce fake legislation about pre-existing conditions. it's a lot of lying.
before the law was passed, republicans said that they expected a future congress to extend the individual income tax cuts, instead of allowing taxes for many to increase. they structured the law that way so they could pass their tax bill through budget reconciliation, a process requiring only a majority vote in the senate, which meant that republican lawmakers could not add more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit over 10 years. also, they couldn't have a bill that added to the deficit beyond that 10-year window.
buttigieg specifically asked warren if her plan would increase taxes on middle class families, which the massachusetts senator has been loath to admit. your signature senator is to have a plan for everything, except this, buttigieg said at the last debate.
spicer: i think areas in the south china sea that are part of international waters and international activities i think the u.s. is going to make sure that we protect our interests there. so it's a question of if those islands are in fact in international waters and not part of china proper, then yes, we're gonna make sure that we defend international territories from being taken over by one country. does that answer...
employees considering taking advantage of these types of programs should ask themselves some questions, according to bergeron, including: will your employer will support a major or program that makes sense for your career trajectory? and do the completion rates for these programs for students like you indicate you'd be successful?
you can do all the advertising you want, all the rah-rah-rah rallies. when it comes to election day, it's all over. and if you don't have the old gotv, people, they know -- you have to know who your voters are. and you have got to get them out. it's as simple as that.
but there's also the risk of putting in so many checks that applicants, like luis martinez of hialeah, fla, get caught in bureaucratic red tape.
i know you're hoping for a sanders win tonight in iowa. but if hillary clinton does win and he loses, how does that affect his strategy moving towards new hampshire and beyond?
our healthcare system is broken and articles with photos like the one above subconsciously perpetuate a myth that black people and minorities are the problem and those poor white ceo's earning $10-$15 million dollars per year are really trying their darnedest to make sure that the healthcare system is fair.
as we reach the seventh year of a law that has done so much — but without the bipartisan collaboration the nation has needed — the best question for your member of congress is when is it time to slow down, abandon an ill-conceived bill, and reach across the aisle for a bipartisan solution?
ending the filibuster wasn't on the political agenda in the way it is now. and democratic leaders rejected the idea of using the budget reconciliation process, where they wouldn't have to worry about the filibuster, in part because they thought its complex parliamentary rules would prohibit essential parts of the proposal, turning legislation into swiss cheese.
ward has consistently attacked mcsally for being a liberal republican who is weak on border security. as part of those claims, ward said that mcsally voted for amnesty 11 times.
the most provocative section of the report introduces facts and figures to buttress the argument that opioid abuse has grown worse in states that expanded medicaid under obamacare.
question: (inaudible) first one, with the congressional meeting today and also at the retreat, you said talking about his legislative agenda. besides healthcare, can you give us one, two or three legislative things that he wants to get through right away? so not the executive actions, legislation.
clinton said, we will have vetting that's as tough as it needs to be, but then she asked about trump's policy about banning people based on a religion, how do we do that?
what editor thought it would be a good idea to include a photo of a white doctor helping a sullen black patient (obviously a beneficiary of obamacare and probably some other wasteful democrat subsidies or entitlement programs) in this article???

the report out of california — which, like a half-dozen other states, is allowing people special permission to sign up for affordable care act plans during the pandemic — underscores yet another economic ripple effect of the virus: it will spur large new health-care costs that many americans will eventually feel.

president trump delivered his second state of the union address tuesday, feb. 5, 2019, from the house chamber. the white house released the president's remarks as prepared for delivery.
how could house republicans under the leadership of paul ryan, who the media keeps assuring us is a smart, serious policy wonk, have produced such a monstrosity? two reasons.
obamacare got some serious attention in sunday's town hall debate, following an audience question about why insurance seemed to be getting more and more expensive, while covering less and less.
another senate republican, who would speak about the path forward on health care only on the condition of anonymity, said republicans should revisit repealing the health-care law since most of them were elected on an anti-aca platform.
thank you, god bless you, and god bless these united states.
predatory lenders and corporate criminals are getting lush new protections while the great lakes are under attack. and if there is an economic boom going on, it's flowing mostly to the sort of americans who can pay a $200,000 initiation fee at mar-a-lago — and-or democrats.
last year, heritage and other conservative activists criticized most of the proposed republican-led health-care bills for leaving too much of the aca in place — and called for even more dramatic shifts in how the government's medicaid program fo low-income americans works.
norma pimentel , a sister of the missionaries of jesus, is director of catholic charities for the rio grande valley: welcome to the border, mr. president.
furthermore, sanders likes to tout that he doesn't have a super pac and doesn't want one. that is a principled position. but the republican candidate will have the support of many super pacs, awash in hundreds of millions of dollars in dark money, and the republican nominee himself might even be a billionaire. they are going to beat sanders like he is a nail with the socialist label and his proposal on new taxation. middle of the spectrum middle america is likely to be very susceptible to this negative messaging.
interesting, but also unlikely. go talk to all the blue dog democrats who lost their seats in the wake of obamacare passage. go talk to all the voters who are being disenfranchised by new voter suppression laws. go talk to all the poor people who live in states where conservative voters ensure republican leadership, and therefore prevent medicaid from being expanded in their states.
of the 15 people… eight of them have returned to their homes, to stay at their homes until they're fully recovered. one is in the hospital, five have fully recovered and one we think is in pretty good shape, he said. in almost all cases, they're getting better.
martinez, who has heart problems, says he's been trying for more than a month to work out his document drama.
in other words, the gop tax reform plan — which will include massive tax cuts for the rich — will probably run up the deficit, and conservatives will be fine with that. shocking!
many more americans would lose medicaid coverage because all but a dozen states have expanded eligibility to include everybody living below or just above the poverty line, providing coverage that's federally funded. that federal funding comes from the affordable care act, and it, too, would stop if the law is no longer in effect.
the court's 7-2 vote struck a blow against the birth control mandate, a hotly litigated regulation under the affordable care act that requires most private health insurance plans to cover contraceptives without a copay.
trump later added: john roberts arrived in malta yesterday. maybe we will get lucky and he will stay there.
thank you very much, nevada, he said – pronouncing it nev-ah-da.
we really are pushing this administration, not just to undo the harm of the trump administration but to move us forward in really important ways, said gretchen borchelt, vice president for reproductive rights and health at the national women's law center.
while biden's hope for gop support on capitol hill has all but disappeared in the last several weeks, his enthusiasm for the proposal -- and his view that despite its high price tag it will only serve to bolster democrats as they remain unified -- has hardly waned.
and it appears that some of the justice department's own career lawyers feel the same way. right before the trump administration filed its brief, siding with the conservative states, three career lawyers who were supposed to file it withdrew their names from the case, offering an early hint that something was amiss.
trump's numbers in the key midwest states that he pulled from democrats are plummeting and, as he claws for his political life, he seems to be dragging down his party with him. republicans are trailing in polls for the governorships they've held since 2011 in wisconsin, michigan and ohio.
i would like to see him hammering that in, howard said. of the khan comments, he said: unfortunately, it did look bad. ... i think about the best thing he can do is clarify it and move on.
it's not like i'm changing my stance, but the time to hedge is when you can and not when you have to. but the election looms, and those who want clinton or trump and think that their candidate will be best for the stock market will become increasingly worried about the possibility that their candidate will lose.
it's word of mouth, whatever their friends tell them, they take it as, 'it's going to happen to me,' delcid said. and a lot of them are saying, 'don't apply for benefits, you'll get deported.' we try to explain to them, 'that's not how it works.' but they just don't want to renew their benefits any more. they want them to expire.
the other big initiative in the alexander-collins proposal would resume cost-sharing reduction subsidies, which are a separate set of federal payments to insurers that president donald trump stopped in october.
a group of moderate senate democrats met frequently with republican counterparts to try and find a bipartisan compromise, holding out hope in happy hour settings, phone calls and zooms that the relief bill could be crafted in a way to attract gop support like the previous pandemic relief bills.
at the iowa rally, trump said the media humorlessly accused him of lying when he had told a joke that california gov. gavin newsom wanted to give undocumented immigrants a free rolls-royce.
graham, who leads the committee, publicly refused to take a covid-19 test when challenged by his democratic opponent last week to do so.
these assertions are based on official figures that most analysts agree are significantly under-stating the depths of the opioid crisis. one specialist quoted in the senate report said the opioid epidemic is deadlier than the aids epidemic at its peak.
however, the following december, a federal judge in pennsylvania blocked the trump administration's rule that exempted employers with religious or moral objections to the obamacare mandate.

trump's budget request for fiscal 2020, which begins oct. 1, calls for a further cut to $445 million — which would represent a cumulative reduction in annual appropriation levels of 35 percent since the last fiscal year that began under obama.
but the transformation of the republicans into a more ideologically and temperamentally extreme party really has changed american politics in profound ways, and democrats really do need to adapt to that transformation if they want to succeed. that means paying attention to what went wrong with the affordable care act ― although, to be clear, it also means recognizing what went right. and obama has some ideas about that too.
still, those cases have been the exception.
10:37 p.m. et the debate has ended. trump and clinton just shook hands -- they didn't at the beginning.
ask your boss for regular meetings, where you can both track progress, larssen said. people tend to wait until the boss says now is the time to check in, she said, but being proactive is a better choice, she added. employees who had routine meetings with their managers were almost three times as likely to be engaged in their jobs than those who didn't have meetings, according to a 2015 gallup survey. also, if anything is in fact misaligned with your job description or what was discussed during the interview, talk about that too — just make sure to bring solutions to the problems you want to bring up, salemi said. and always mention how what you want or need can help the business.

be willing to change plans. true, all the jumping around in the marketplaces is making it hard for insurers to estimate costs going forward, but from the consumer perspective, this is one of the best options you have to keep premiums down.
[we] campaigned for nearly a decade on repeal of obamacare, and we ought to bring it back up, the senator said.
he was gone, but the anger of many g.o.p. voters remained. rick santorum, not mr. trump, wound up being the insurgent who gave the party establishment fits. he came a lot closer to beating mr. romney than a lot of people remember (and it's not hard to imagine that mr. trump could have done even better).

palin, who has a child with down syndrome, went on to say, the america i know and love is not one in which my parents or my baby with down syndrome will have to stand in front of obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care. such a system is downright evil.
we have a venue. we have a time. all we're missing is a candidate, cruz told a ballroom crowd. it's not that he's afraid of me. he's afraid of you. he doesn't want to answer questions from the men and women of iowa about how his record doesn't match what he's selling.
one of those structural problems, he said, is that the conservative media universe operates in an entirely different universe, less tethered to reality. another, he said, is the makeup u.s. senate, where the small-state bias gives lawmakers representing a small portion of the population the ability to block legislation ― and to escape accountability for doing so.
emanuel's criticism followed a press conference where president trump announced the appointment of vice president mike pence on wednesday to lead the united states' response to the illness that originated in wuhan, china.

call me a skeptic, but i'm quite certain that house speaker nancy pelosi's recent claim to the washington post that i'm not for impeachment of president trump doesn't match her actual position on the issue.
kodjak: well, most people actually are pretty happy with their own health care. they like their doctors. they think the care they're getting is pretty good. but there are a couple of really big gaps. if you are lower income, you are much more likely to think your care is not good.
no doubt, out-of-pocket maximums and co-pays will also increase as they say there will be 'changes' in the letter, but they don't specify what those will be, says frietchen, who works for a nutritionist and author. i'm certain the rate hike is the tip of the iceberg.
ex-cardinal theodore mccarrick could soon be defrocked after the vatican finished collecting evidence in his sexual abuse case. witnesses have testified in the past several weeks to american clergy about the alleged misconduct of mccarrick, a former archbishop of washington. (michelle boorstein, julie zauzmer and chico harlan) the archdiocese of chicago said the rev. c. john mccloskey was never officially restricted from ministering in the years after he was accused of sexual harassment. mccloskey's alleged victim, who received a $977,000 settlement from the catholic organization opus dei, said she was assured the priest would not be put in a position where he could potentially harass someone else. (julie zauzmer and michelle boorstein) the supreme court considered whether it should overturn a precedent decision in a case concerning whether one state could be sued in another state's courts. the justices' decision could indicate their future approach to respecting precedents, such as roe v. wade. (robert barnes) opposition candidate felix tshisekedi was declared the winner of congo's presidential election. the announcement, which comes almost two weeks after the election, clears the way for the country's first democratic transfer of power. (max bearak) some u.s. officials fear the growing power of iraq's shiite militias could fuel a resurgence of the islamic state. the militias' oversight of sunni areas they helped liberate from the islamic state has sparked complaints similar to those that helped power the extremist group's initial rise three years ago.
ted talk? late-night infomercial? nope — it was house speaker paul ryan, making a hard pitch for his health care plan after a week of loud conservative criticism.
in his rollout of a health care plan on monday that would create a public option for people to buy into medicare, biden described medicare for all as both an attack on the affordable care act, or obamacare, and traditional medicare.
jeffrey lord, cnn political commentator: ... county level and work their way up.
well, first, it wouldn't be a blue ribbon commission in washington like the kerner commission or the clinton commission on race. it would be a ground-up effort at the community level, which i think is really important. this is not about experts picking up history books and learning what they should already know. this is about communities coming together, people who really already have a stake in the well-being of their community. i talked to folks in dallas who have created this truth, racial healing, and transformation hub which invites stakeholders from the cops to racial justice advocates, from librarians and schoolteachers to business leaders, to come together and do a few key things to rewrite the racial history of their community to create what's known as a community history. and the people who did this in dallas said 90 plus percent the people we talked to just didn't know — white, black, or brown. there's just so much we don't know. there's so, so much in so many ways, like the lost cause profoundly won in terms of our historical imagination. i was talking to someone earlier today who's from st. louis, which is the city where there was the huge fairground pool riot that i talk about in the book, where the largest public pool that we can find record of was closed after a bunch of racial riots and integration. and she had no memory of it.

lisa murkowski ( alaska ) the moderate senator said in a facebook town hall there were some good things that came out of [obamacare], like protecting coverage for young adults and people with preexisting conditions as well as expanding medicaid. it's no secret that healthcare needs to be reformed, but it needs to be done right, she said in a june 22 statement. read more »

last night as i was closing my computer before taking care of my medically fragile (but less so than ever) daughter, amaris, i saw a picture of donald trump and hillary clinton on a headline on scutify. my happiness about playing with and feeding my daughter was momentarily suspended, as i felt myself stress out about this election once again. long-time readers know that i'm committed to my stance against ever voting for anyone in the republican-democrat regime, but this post isn't about politics. and the point of this intro is that i think it's finally be time to hedge our portfolios for some election-stress discounts coming into the markets.
cbs news' nancy cordes and alan he contributed to this report.
shortly after cotton's speech on thursday, the biden campaign sent out an email blast to reporters with the subject line: donald trump is the weakest president in u.s. history when it comes to china – and chinese officials are pulling for his re-election. the attack memo highlights, among other things, trump's initial reluctance to criticize china's handling of the novel coronavirus outbreak, his calls for the chinese government to investigate the bidens to benefit him politically and trump's inaccurate claim that he banned travel to the u.s. from china in order to contain covid-19.
as attention turns to the 2020 democratic presidential race, the 77-year-old sanders benefits from his surprisingly strong showing in 2016 against clinton, who began that race as the prohibitive favorite. but some party strategists believe a big reason for his success was voter antipathy toward her.
and so their campaign attacked congressman king today. it went over like a lead balloon. it was just not well-received by the iowans, who were there, actually, to see donald trump.
washington ― one month into his presidency, donald trump's popularity has begun tanking with every constituency, save one.
the company also added more degrees to the suite of programs employees can pursue for $1 per day and introduced a completion bonus for workers who finish their bachelor's degrees and haven't completed any previous college credits.
biden plans to provide a refundable tax credit of up to $15,000 that will help americans pull together a down payment to purchase a home, shore up rental aid provided by the federal government, and dedicate $10 billion toward expanding a tax credit that spurs the building or revamping of rental housing for low-wage earners.
perhaps responding to ohio republicans' desire for a plan, trump's event was set up like a town-hall meeting. at the end of his typically wide-ranging speech, he took three questions.

their communities deserve to die. yikes.
can ted cruz essentially infiltrate the evangelical turf and take some of that -- i mean, can donald trump, excuse me, do that to ted cruz? and then the battle will be on the romney map. the dark red is where mitt romney won in 2012 in the population centers, polk county, ames, cedar rapids, davenport and dubuque.
his return-to-greatness vision came as he and the fox panel blasted obamacare as a freebie for those who don't want to work. obamacare isn't free, and recipients pay premiums.

in the moments after it was announced that his health care bill was dead and pulled from consideration, president donald trump had pinpointed the culprit. democrats, he explained, were to blame for the failure because they refused to provide him with any of their votes.
question: what is the president's message to the millions of people here in washington and around the country who were protesting on saturday? i have a follow-up after that.
you all have the knowledge and expertise to solve these problems. we lack that knowledge and expertise, but if you don't solve it, we will, said burgess, the ranking member of the house energy & commerce committee's health subcommittee. he added that the companies probably won't like lawmakers' solutions. the hearing was titled lowering prescription drug prices: deconstructing the drug supply chain.

the senate's version was supposedly crafted by a working group consisting of 13 republican men -- and no women -- but one of the group's participants, sen. mike lee, r-utah, said even he had been left in the dark. lee said the measure was apparently being written by a small handful of staffers for members of the republican leadership in the senate.
and it's notable where marco rubio is going tonight. he is going into polk county. that's here in des moines, that county a very populous part of the state in which they believe they need to do very well here in order to get that strong third-place finish.
bagley said, that's almost unheard of. these are lawyers who have made arguments they personally disagreed with countless times. they're civil servants. they're good soldiers. yet they could not sign it. that's how far out the administration's position is.
in particular, rubio took issue with cruz's accusation that rubio said on national television in spanish that rubio would not immediately end obama's executive 2012 amnesty on day one of his presidency. rubio claimed this was a lie– despite the fact that rubio not only made this assertion in spanish— but rubio also reiterated his spanish-language declaration that he wouldn't undo it [obama's 2012 amnesty] immediately in english.

in fact, the obama-era aid program was reduced only about 23 percent during trump's first two years, while illegal border crossings surged to more than triple the levels than before the obama aid program commenced. trump has already relented on a recent threat to cut off the aid entirely.

and then in the central part of the state, again, obama won in ames, which is where you fin the college towns right there. he was huge. that's about 3 percent. and you find traditional democrats. they tend to be for hillary clinton, older democrats, people involved.
what we learned from 365 days of trump polls
the senate had convened friday morning, but lawmakers and aides said even then there was no consensus on how to head off the impending midnight partial government shutdown.
the disclosed outlays by these enterprises to influence washington climbed to a total of about $70 million in 2018, the second-highest level ever behind their spending of $87 million in 2009, when obamacare was beginning to shake up the health-care sector. that's shown in the adjacent chart and based on data from opensecrets.org, a website tracking money in politics that's run by the nonpartisan center for responsive politics.
we will not avert our eyes from a regime that chants death to america and threatens genocide against the jewish people. we must never ignore the vile poison of anti-semitism, or those who spread its venomous creed. with one voice, we must confront this hatred anywhere and everywhere it occurs.

the facts: trump is again distorting the diversity immigrant visa program, which uses a computer lottery system to randomly issue up to 50,000 immigrant visas each year to qualified applicants from countries with low rates of immigration to the united states. countries aren't sending us anybody. individuals submit applications, and those eligible must meet certain requirements and pass a security background check. stephen w. yale-loehr, who teaches immigration law at cornell law school, told us: among other things, the consular officer must make sure the individual is not 'inadmissible.' this means that the person has not committed a crime, doesn't have a serious health problem, isn't a terrorist, hasn't committed fraud, and hasn't overstayed in the u.s. before.
companies, now that the labor market is tight, are trying to figure out what's a smart way to attract and, especially, retain employees, said peter cappelli, the director of wharton's center for human resources at the university of pennsylvania. and these programs tend to work in that regard, according to a study conducted by cappelli. he found that offering tuition assistance allows companies to hire better quality and more productive employees, making the cost worth it.

back in march, this epidemiological reality prompted dan patrick, the republican lieutenant governor of texas and a prominent trump supporter, to suggest that risking the health of people in his generation (he just turned 70) was a worthwhile price for allowing businesses to return to operating normally.

the hhs contends that short-term insurance plans can help americans between insurance options, such as those between jobs, a student time off from school, or even middle-class families without access to subsidized obamacare plans.
since the high court's ruling, in the vance case, trump's attorneys made additional arguments that his tax records should not be turned over, but they lost again in federal court in new york and on appeal. it was those rulings that trump had sought to put on hold.
we have been friends for a long time, trump said from the white house rose garden with the kentucky republican at his side. we are probably now, despite what we read, we are probably now, i think, at least as far as i am concerned, we are closer than ever before and the relationship is very good. we are fighting for the same thing, we are fighting for lower taxes, big tax cuts, the biggest tax cuts in the history of our nation. we are fighting for tax reform as part of that.
in total for the first quarter, the trade group and the seven companies spent about $25 million, suggesting they could set a new record this year.
those hardships are real. people who can't pay their bills go hungry, lose their homes and can't pay their medical bills. that is why even public health experts want to come up with smart, careful ways to relax pandemic restrictions.
while flake prepares for political oblivion, ward is the newest face of the trump revolution — a movement not unlike the reagan revolution that i witnessed firsthand.
as with past weeks, presiding over pruitt's assault on the environment, the gop congress's assault on health care, devos's assault on students, and other policy outrages hasn't been enough for donald j. trump, who must always deliver his own personal brand of kleptocratic, misogynistic, narcissistic, and putinistic disgracefulness.
but our slow and burdensome approval process at the food and drug administration keeps too many advances, like the one that saved megan's life, from reaching those in need.
most campaigns launch with a big rally in the candidate's home state. not this one. sanders walked outside the senate, held a 10-minute news conference with a scrum of reporters, and went back to work. the first words of his political revolution? we don't have an endless amount of time. i've got to get back.
clinton said that she was alluding to steven spielberg's movie about abraham lincoln. she said that in order to get the congress to approve the 13th amendment, clinton said he used a principled and strategic approach in which he used an argument with one group of people and another argument with another group of people.
the senate bill would continue the existing $300 weekly federal boost and two key pandemic unemployment programs through september 6. the house bill would provide a $400 weekly enhancement and continue it and the two pandemic programs through august 29.
former obama-era health and human services (hhs) secretary kathleen sebelius – an abortion activist – and bureaucrats in her department inserted the mandate into obamacare. following objections by many religious employers to the requirements of the mandate, the obama administration devised accommodations that only gave the appearance the religious groups would not be footing the bill for the federal government's mandate of the offensive contraceptive drugs and sterilization procedures. in reality, the faith groups were being asked to passively approve of the contraceptives.
so back when this was happening, i went to austin. and i met a man named kevin polly. and he told me that the very same day he found out he was infected with hiv, another woman asked to share his needle.
plan has payments of $1,200 per person for middle class and poor - fox news: saying lawmakers 'need to take bold and swift action as soon as possible,' senate majority leader mitch mcconnell on thursday introduced legislation to provide as much as $1,200 per person and $2,400 per couple in the u.s. amid the coronavirus outbreak and skyrocketing jobless claims. the draft legislation, obtained by fox news, would provide minimum payments of $600, and aid would be phased down at adjusted gross income thresholds of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple. additionally, there would be $500 payments for each child. the rebate amount is slated to then be reduced by $5 for each $100 a taxpayer's income exceeds the legislation's threshold. the amount is therefore reduced to zero for single taxpayers with incomes exceeding $99,000 and $198,000 for joint filers. the irs would determine income based on taxpayers' 2018 tax returns, or 2019 tax returns in cases where there is no 2018 return...
there's no need to speculate about how insurance companies would respond to this, because this is how the system worked for people who bought individual policies before the affordable care act. insurers don't make money paying claims; they make money by avoiding claims or refusing the pay them. if they're allowed to keep the most expensive people and treatments off their books, they will.
this is a wildly expensive proposal largely unrelated to the problem, mcconnell said. we think this package should have been negotiated on a bipartisan basis. … instead, the new administration made a conscious decision to jam us.
the former vice president said he opposed busing ordered by the department of education, or what critics called forced busing, in the 1970s. you would have been able to go to school the same exact way because it was a local decision made by your city council, biden said. in fact, harris was attending an integrated school before biden even joined the senate.

-- rep. tulsi gabbard (d-hawaii), another potential 2020 candidate, accused fellow democrats of religious bigotry in their questioning of a trump judicial nominee. felicia sonmez reports: she argued that some lawmakers had gone too far in their questioning of brian buescher, whom trump nominated in october to serve as a district judge. 'while i oppose the nomination of brian buescher to the u.s. district court in nebraska, i stand strongly against those who are fomenting religious bigotry, citing as disqualifiers buescher's catholicism and his affiliation with the knights of columbus,' gabbard said in the op-ed.
on april 3, three weeks after the louisville investiture and six months after he first took the federal bench, trump announced that he would elevate walker, a harvard law graduate who still serves as a part-time law professor at the university of louisville, to a coveted seat on the dc circuit.
center for disease control officials have said they are not billing for the cost of covid-19 testing, but that doesn't mean it's free, or even affordable. as a lot of us are about to find out, depending on your insurance (or lack thereof) you can expect to get a bill in the mail for a covid-19 test, in some cases for more than $3,000. the test itself might be free, but the tangential costs related to being treated in a hospital are inescapable, and can be exorbitant. nearly 28 million americans have been left uninsured by obamacare. exactly how proactive do you think they are going to be about getting tested?
plus, said justin hernandez, of plum, a pittsburgh suburb: nobody asked me to vote in the poll.
the evidence to fight these arguments is right in front of democrats, but they seem loath to engage. in the case of the latest jobs report, the problem may be timing, with primaries coming up in michigan and other states afflicted by the long-term manufacturing downturn (even as the new report showed an uptick). but the larger pattern is one we saw in 2012 and 2014.

in an english-language interview, rubio said of obama's 2012 amnesty, i don't think we can immediately revoke that… i'm not calling for it to be revoked tomorrow, or this week, or right away. instead rubio adopted president obama's position on the matter, declaring that it will have to end at some point and that he hopes it will end because of some reform to the immigration laws—i.e. the president ought to leave the executive amnesty for dreamers in place until congress submits to the order by legislatively ratifying amnesty.
levin: curt schilling, was there an event, a book, a person your upbringing that caused you to be a conservative and a republican?
i am very familiar with that opinion, because i served as kennedy's law clerk that term, walker wrote. i can tell you with certainty that the only justices following a roadmap from brett kavanaugh were the ones who said obamacare was unconstitutional.
that decision, which caught even many trump allies by surprise, again thrusts the health care issue to the center of the political debate, and virtually ensures that the 2020 election – like the 2018, 2016, 2014, 2012 and 2010 elections before it – will turn on the aca.
gingrich: right. that will not last. this is not a country that wanders around trusting people with power. this is a country that wants accountability. they want some sense - now, again, he is unique. and i totally defend him against those who, for example, want him to put his holdings in a blind trust, which is an absurd...

coronavirus reset: how to get health insurance now
nobody knows how long this is going to last, bustos told reporters. and here's the thing, it's not like coronavirus hits dems and not republicans.
a few years ago, i came from the private sector to lead the implementation of the aca after it got off to a rocky start. and i can say that while it's not perfect, the aca set us on a course of record progress in cost, quality and access to care and changed the lives of millions of people, many of whom i heard from every day.
health insurance premiums have soared under obamacare. hhs reported in may 2017 that average individual market premiums more than doubled from $2,784 per year in 2013 to $5,712 on healthcare.gov in 2017 – an increase of $2,928 or 105%.

for example, biden wants to roll back trump's 20% long-term capital-gains tax on investments and restore the 39.6% top tax rate for anyone making over $1 million. he'd also close loopholes that wealthy americans avoid taxes on capital gains altogether and raise estate taxes back to the historical norm, according to the draft platform.
it's notable that trump is proposing even larger spending reductions for medicare than he has over the past two years. in fact, his first budget barely touched the program at all.
bernie sanders' plan will save people thousands of dollars. that's completely changing the health care system and that's just indicative of the way he looks at the economy in general and again, it's a political revolution and people are thirsty for that. they really understand that the system is corrupt and they want to change that, and bernie sanders represents a movement.
spicer: right. immigration's obviously going to be high on that last. tax reform, regulatory reform. that's three and four.

bloomy transfers $18 million from campaign to dnc - politico: mike bloomberg is sending $18 million from his defunct presidential campaign to the democratic national committee, a dramatic investment in the national party that appears to push the boundaries of campaign finance law. the money will support the dnc's 'battleground build-up 2020' program, the dnc's initiative in 12 swing states across the country. the money could fund potentially hundreds of organizers in those swing states. 'this will help us invest in more organizers across the country to elect the next president and help democrats win up and down the ballot,' dnc chairman tom perez said in a statement. 'the dnc has made early, historic investments in our battleground and general election programs, and the additional organizers we're putting on the ground will significantly bolster those efforts and help make sure donald trump is a one-term president.' the massive transfer signals a change of plans for bloomberg, who is nixing an earlier idea to form his own super pac to take on president donald trump in 2020.

officials are still considering — but have not decided yet — whether to indefinitely shutter the program that allows syrian refugees into the u.s. trump may also put the entire refugee program for all countries on hold for four months: one official said trump will also potentially bar for 30 days the issuance of u.s. visas to people from iraq, iran, libya, somalia, sudan, syria and yemen — all muslim-majority countries — until new visa procedures are developed. residents from many of these places are already rarely granted u.s. visas. trump may ask dhs and the director of national intelligence to evaluate whether immigrants are being adequately screened for potential terrorist ties.
related: insurers want to hike obamacare premiums 10% for 2017
president donald trump's justice department decided not to defend the law in court, which is not the normal way the department handles cases challenging federal laws. the administration, however, doesn't want to throw out the whole law ― just the parts that protect people with pre-existing conditions. some democratic state officials have stepped to take the federal government's place and fight the lawsuit.

the problem for advocates of medicare for all isn't simply the republicans in the senate, who have called it socialism and pledged to fight it tooth and nail. a number of more conservative and centrist-minded democratic senators remain uncomfortable with the idea, preferring instead more immediate measures that would bolster the insurance market under obamacare.

on the campaign trail, biden has noted how he was still in contact with the former president. biden said during a virtual fundraiser that he turned to obama for advice on choosing a vice presidential candidate, according to a pool report of the event. biden said obama told him to find someone who has experience where the former vice president is lacking, a dynamic that worked well between the two.

khalid: and, you know, within that answer, ari, i think there were obviously - there was, obviously, a subtext of bernie sanders. you know, he is somebody who wants to replace obamacare with medicare for all and has these bold promises that joe biden is sort of skeptical of; whether or not he can actually - whether or not any politician could actually implement them. i think what's most notable in terms of the new energy around biden is that we have very quickly seen the establishment - we have seen other moderate candidates in this field coalesce around joe biden as the single alternative to bernie sanders ahead of super tuesday. and that has happened with remarkable speed.
in the past, as recently as 2008 — as we saw with the scandals surrounding obama's racist church, his unforgivable relationships with a domestic terrorist and louis farrakhan, and the shady deal to purchase his chicago home — the establishment media were able to bury democrat scandals to get their guy over the finish line.
by the president's accounting, his accomplishments are legion. he boasts about his tax cuts — the biggest in history. he preens about his judges — a historic transformation of the judiciary — chosen to cater to the anti-choice passions of evangelical christians. he brags about slashing regulations. he says his wall is being built. he promises once more to trash obamacare and provide a much better alternative. he claims to still be avoiding endless wars. he champions his trade deals and his tariffs. and, of course, he takes — and gets — credit for the growing economy with low top-line unemployment.
criticism of international trade was paramount in trump's appeal to voters, but the document released wednesday does not answer basic questions about whether he would address this issue in terms of taxes.
despite mountains of historical evidence revealing the dangers associated with socialism, support for karl marx's collectivist ideas is steadily increasing.
obamacare looks the way it does because its designers wanted to cause the least possible disruption to the status quo while providing insurance to many more people. by that measure — and others, as a new times editorial notes — the law has been a big success.

i think a big challenge is people don't really have a concept of how little medicare offers, said matt salo, executive director of the national association of medicaid directors. medicare has made a huge difference in the lives of many people over the years, but it falls short in a lot of areas.
if the republican plaintiffs win ― an outcome made more likely by the death of supreme court justice ruth bader ginsburg last week ― an estimated 20 million people would lose their health coverage, and everyone with a preexisting condition, no matter how minor, would be at risk.
on may 12 that year, in one of his first actions, sessions reversed what had become known as the holder memo. the 2013 document written by then-attorney general eric h. holder jr. directed federal prosecutors to stop pursuing low-level, nonviolent drug charges that would trigger mandatory minimum prison sentences. over decades, u.s. drug policy had resulted in long prison terms and increased incarceration for first-time offenders, most of them young black men, and holder wanted to reverse what he saw as a historic injustice.

in the early 1980s, democratic sen. robert byrd of west virginia, already suspicious of anything that allowed bills to bypass normal senate rules, was alarmed by the number of extraneous measures his fellow senators were trying to stuff into a reconciliation bill.

but although he can implement some of his health care plans with the stroke a pen, other issues he campaigned on -- like instituting a government-backed public option and increasing federal premium subsidies -- will take congressional action. that will be a challenge since biden can't afford to lose a single democrat in the senate -- and few in the house, after his party lost seats in the chamber.

brooks: but it follows three years where he's basically destroyed every norm of common civility and the rules by which we used to do our politics. and so we've entered a world where a lot of people apparently treat politics as a cult, as, like, the most important form of identity, which is asking more of politics than it can bear, and then who think politics is a war to the death between two opposing sides, which is also not true. politics is a competition between two sides with partial truths. and so we've got this catastrophizing view of politics which filters down to disturbed people.

turley: well, i think that's right. and i think what i tell a lot of my friends on the democratic side is that we will rule the day that you help create this uber presidency. it's been developing a long time. but is reaching a very dangerous point. this will not be our last president. and you may not agree with the next one. but what the democrats are creating is something very, very dangerous. they're creating a president who can go it alone. and to go it alone is something that is a very danger that the framers sought to avoid in our constitution.
and i said, so you didn't vote for nolan ryan so you could get content because you're too lazy to go out and get it yourself. and you realized that this is -- you're being asked to pass judgment on a career you have no business giving comment on, but anyway.
we've changed that. as the affordable care act has taken effect, nearly 18 million americans have gained coverage. in fact, for the first time ever, more than 90 percent of americans are covered. up to 129 million americans with pre-existing conditions can no longer be denied coverage or be charged more just because they've been sick. 137 million americans with private insurance are now guaranteed preventive care coverage. we've done all this while cutting our deficits and keeping health care inflation to its lowest levels in fifty years. and we've begun filling the gaps in employer-based care so that when we change jobs, lose a job, go back to school, or start that new business, we can still get coverage.
trump's misguided crusade to reduce the harmless trade deficit has shrunk world trade, thus worsening the efficiency of resource allocation at home and abroad.
washington — republicans won the first round thursday in a separation of powers battle against president obama that once again focuses on his most prized achievement: obamacare.
to get on the ballot, advocates in each state had to gather tens of thousands of signatures. early polls show voters back expansion, they say.
in addition, biden would push to strengthen the affordable care act. that means expanding coverage, murthy says, for instance by making more people eligible for premium subsidies. biden would also push for expansion of medicaid in states that have still yet to do so, his advisers say, and he has proposed making medicare coverage available to americans beginning at age 60 (instead of 65).
making sure people who have pre-existing health conditions don't get screwed by health insurance companies is very popular. so popular that a bunch of republican senators who are freaked out about the party's electoral prospects have introduced legislation to guarantee that no americans may be denied coverage because of their medical history.
only after the house passes the senate version would it land on biden's desk.
friday on msnbc's morning joe, sen. rand paul (r-ky) made the argument that those who might lose their medicaid coverage due to any obamacare repeal should be offered an inexpensive option for coverage.
let us work together to build a culture that cherishes innocent life. and let us reaffirm a fundamental truth: all children — born and unborn — are made in the holy image of god.
while speaking to a crowd in cedar rapids, ia, 2020 presidential hopeful sen. amy klobuchar (d-mn) called for universal healthcare in the united states, saying she wanted the public option system that former president barack obama sought in the past but failed to get congress to pass it as a part of the affordable care act, also known as obamacare.
she said she has a positive and optimistic view of the country's direction.

but once trump made his decision and the csr money stopped flowing, insurers in most states reacted quickly, jacking up premiums exclusively on customers who were eligible for tax credits. by design, those tax credits rise in tandem with premiums, which means those consumers didn't end up paying more out of their own pockets. they simply got bigger tax credits, which meant greater spending by the federal government.
obama did, in fact, go to congress in august 2013 to ask for authorization to strike the government of assad in retaliation for a chemical weapons attack. that resolution was never passed by either chamber but was presented to the senate after passing through a senate committee.
the biden campaign proposes investing $25 billion in a vaccine manufacturing and distribution plan that will guarantee it gets to every american, cost-free.
more fact check: did sinema stop raises for congress?
the aca imposed a tax penalty, known as the mandate, on those without health insurance, but the republican tax law repealed that penalty as of jan. 1 of this year. it's worth noting that in may 2018, the cbo revised downward its estimate of the impact of repealing the mandate.
he's a great team player, danny. he's a really great team player. and dean and myself, we really appreciate what he did, trump said of tarkanian.

this public support for medicare-for-all might be a function of their fuzziness on how it would work. some 47 percent of americans erroneously think they'd be able to keep their employer-sponsored insurance under medicare-for-all.
sagal: all right. excellent. we have flipped a coin. roxanne has elected to go first. here we go. on monday, senator john mccain returned to washington to help republicans start the process of repealing blank.
it's not just illicit street purchases increasing in tandem with medicaid expansion. national review points to centers for disease control data that opioid prescribing rates among medicaid enrollees are at least twofold higher than rates for persons with private insurance. in washington state, the cdc found that medicaid beneficiaries were 5.7 times more likely to die of opioid-related causes.
currently, ryan and other republican leaders don't need democrats to pass the bill. they can afford to ignore schumer.
for evidence, the authors note that wage growth remains relatively paltry in this expansion. underemployment reduces wage pressure.
right there in the text, it says health insurance companies would not be allowed to deny an individual coverage or charge extra because of health status, medical condition (including both physical and mental illnesses), claims experience, receipt of health care, medical history, genetic information, evidence of insurability (including conditions arising out of acts of domestic violence), disability, [or] any other health status-related factor determined appropriate by the secretary [of health and human services].
everything about trump's visit monday oozed swagger and muscle. he opened by blaming his smaller crowd monday on a fire department motivated by politics. thousands of people could have fit in the largely empty convention hall, he said, although the line of people dismissed outside numbered only in the few hundreds. the fire department said the campaign had agreed days earlier to a crowd of 1,000.
we continue to see a crisis of affordability in the individual insurance market, especially for those who don't qualify for large subsidies, said cms administrator seema verma in a statement on wednesday. this final rule opens the door to new, more affordable coverage options for millions of middle-class americans who have been priced out of aca plans.

the trump administration is energized by the failed overreach of the leftists during the obama administration. trump and republicans are ready to clean house and continue to make america great again!
sanders has led a marvelously fact-free campaign. when asked how he will fund his programs, he dismisses the question and acts as though trillion-dollar price tags are insignificant details.
we continue to engage with policy makers and others about the proposed solutions regarding patient access and affordability while continuing to support scientific innovation, an astrazeneca spokeswoman said. the proposals include reforming the u.s. rebates system, capping out-of-pocket costs for medicare patients and having greater transparency across the biopharmaceutical supply chain, she said.

also on the up and up in 2015 was the cost of renting or buying a home. rents climbed 3.7%, the biggest increase in eight years.
retirement security and savings: here, the approach is pragmatic rather than bold. the democratic draft platform doesn't favor universal retirement savings plans (an idea floated by various republican and democratic administrations since president carter). i was looking for the word to delink pensions from employers, said ghilarducci. i don't see it.
one thing this book is doing is providing a different deep story of american politics and policy making — a different understanding of what's been going on under the hood in the way we think and then the outcomes that kind of thinking has. and one of your suggestions in the final chapter of the book relates very directly to how we might change that story, which is this idea of a truth, racial healing, and transformation commission. and i think about this a lot. i've talked to people who are more expert in this area than i am. and i go back and forth on it, because i always wonder, how do you make sure, given what we see, let's just say, with the insurrection on the capitol — given how hard it is to get americans to agree on any kind of truth now, how could you do something like this that would result in more healing rather than more division? but you've thought about this. so when you imagine something like that, how would it look? what makes you confident that would help?
mcgann also cites studies that show males may be preferred hires because of perceived competence and that women are underrepresented on corporate boards.
i'd stand behind him until he is impeached, said eric finch of west virginia. because he is my president and i respect the office and the process. i'd probably go out and call for his impeachment if he shot someone. but there has to be a process. and i imagine there would be a story. maybe the guy attacked him, or secret service wasn't there.
the situation four years ago was looking desperate. today, it's looking dire, said scott gehring, president of the community health alliance, a drug treatment facility in butler county, ohio, which has the ninth-highest fentanyl overdose death rate in the nation. people are sicker. more people are dying.
myles allen, an author of the ipcc report and the leader of the eci climate research programme at the university of oxford, explained in a conversation story he wrote in april that the ipcc's timing is only a best estimate.
on one hand, even with the additional $85 billion added by house leaders to help older people pay for their insurance premiums, many moderates feel the age-based tax credits in the bill replacing those in the affordable care act are too small, particularly for people in their 50s and early 60s. the cbo estimated that under the original version of the house bill, premiums for a 64-year-old with an income of $26,000 a year could rise from $1,700 currently to more than $14,000.
and he contended that the creation of the cfpb is a gross departure from settled historical practice. consumer groups and democrats slammed kavanaugh's opinion as a politically motivated gift to financial companies. and they were relieved in january when a federal appeals court upheld the constitutionality of the cfpb. but the agency's legal structure is still being litigated. kavanaugh's blistering attack most likely reflects his broader wariness about the power of the administrative state. and it probably offers insight into how he views financial regulation.
no one in dc has any credibility on spending or fiscal responsibility- not president trump, not senate republicans, not house republicans. even the think tanks are rudderless. this is generational theft. #wemustdobetter — zach wamp (@iowamp) july 23, 2019
just two years ago, democrats chalked their victories in the 2018 midterm elections up to their promise to protect obamacare. now they're going to run on a plan for health care reform that results in the end of private insurance.
likewise, the consumer protections in the affordable care act, such as those put in place to protect the tens of millions of americans with pre-existing conditions, have been undermined by new unregulated insurance, permitted and promoted by trump. with these junk insurance policies, insurance companies decide whom not to cover, what not to cover and how much to charge — with nothing to stop them. even state regulators who want to maintain consumer protections are becoming a target of federal officials racing to remove those standards.
the affordable care act is responsible for historic progress, bringing the number of uninsured americans to a record low, thereby improving access to care and bolstering financial security. but millions of people are unhappy with their coverage, and in some states, newly regulated insurance markets have struggled ― with premiums rising even higher and insurers, stung by financial losses, pulling up stakes.
trump did not get the veterans choice program passed, nor had there been an unsuccessful 52-year effort to get it passed. the program was signed into law by president barack obama in 2014 . in 2018, trump signed the va mission act, which expanded and changed the choice program.
so i want to hold here for a couple of minutes and talk about the psychology. i think it is easy to listen to something like this and say, well, that's in the before days.
throughout the campaign, biden has invoked obama's legacy, noting that he would build on the affordable care act, colloquially called obamacare. the health care legislation is one of the obama's biggest accomplishments as president.
at this point, with biden holding a stable lead and fewer than 70 days until election day, biden wins by not losing.
still, after huffpost asked those questions about a potential lack of medicare for all voices on the panel, the rules committee tweeted the video of nahvi making the case for single-payer health care.
we passed va choice so they can see their doctor. our veterans were waiting online for two days, seven days, three weeks, five weeks. ... we passed va choice. you go out now, you get a doctor. you fix yourself up. the doctor sends us the bill. we pay for it. ... va choice for the veteran? they've been trying to get that passed also for about 44 years.

rovner: well, i think that's exactly what the administration is most worried about. they want this law to have a sense of inevitability, particularly with the opponents still so very vocal and outspoken. and while all these glitches and delays won't really affect how many people will or won't get health insurance, they do create a perception, first, that things aren't going as well as the administration keeps saying. and second, that there may be other shoes yet to drop.
he also claimed trump is not even a conservative:
the national institutes of health issued an email to its institute and center directors informing them they should not communicate on public forums and with public officials on new or pending regulation, policy or guidance that is under review.
over at the bar at schlafly's, inskeep met a progressive couple who favors democrats, but they know much of their conservative state will not.
the presidential candidate, in a nevada campaign stop, pushed back on criticism of his medicare for all plan. instead of asking sanders questions, people have vented about health insurance problems.
the white house did not respond to a request for an explanation of mulvaney's math. it's possible that he's simply confused about how many people pay what are known as shared responsibility payments. on cnn's state of the union, he said, there were tens of millions of people who were paying a fine, paying a fee, rather than take obamacare.
paul proposed a $1 a day plan and said the existing system and the current proposals were predicated on propping up health insurance providers, which he claimed was $15 billion annual industry that benefits from socializing its losses.
it's also feasible that more people entering the marketplaces could help insurers lower premiums in subsequent years.
so far, trump has kept his hire american policy, which is helping to drive up wages for americans. in 2018, for example, wages rose by three percent nationally, and by higher levels in areas with few migrants. minnesota employees, for example, enjoyed a wage raise of 5.2 percent, while migrant-heavy texas gained only a two percent increase in wages.
paul said the sooner the house republican leadership disposes with the ryancare bill, the sooner leadership can get together with capitol hill conservatives to draft a bill that repeals and replaces the 2010 patient protection and affordable care act, which created obamacare.

arpaio is now running for the republican nomination for sen. jeff flake's senate seat. flake announced he would not seek re-election after it became clear his criticism of the president had cost him the path to the nomination. but establishment republicans want mcsally to represent the party in the general, instead of arpaio or former state senator kelli ward, who was backed by steve bannon. while pence's praise of arpaio was more effusive, he did mention mcsally as one of a list of great conservative representatives' and attended a fundraiser with mcsally later tuesday.
there appears to be no limit to the types of schemes used to scam the medicaid program, from large drug rings that employ beneficiaries as 'runners' to fill oxycodone prescriptions, to nurses working the night shift who steal hydrocodone pills from patients. illicit painkillers obtained with medicaid cards are being resold at handsome profits nationwide, in places ranging from the streets of milwaukee to a native american reservation in upstate new york, says the report.
the truth was, i had no idea.
if the democrats want a nominee who's a democrat, a lifelong democrat, a proud democrat, an obama-biden democrat, then join us, biden said.
jane schacter: both cases pit religious liberty against equality claims. in hobby lobby, the business argued that for religious reasons it objected to the obamacare mandate to offer insurance that covered contraception — something many women argue is essential to gender equality. but that case was decided not under the first amendment but the federal religious freedom restoration act, or rfra. that act grants stronger protection to religious liberty than does the first amendment's free-exercise clause. but because of an earlier precedent, the supreme court uses first amendment as a standard in cases like masterpiece involving the states.
murray: when donald trump was holding his rallies earlier today, he said he wanted to emerge victorious. he has made it clear that he really wants to win this state. but i would say that he and his team are cautiously optimistic right now. they know that the poll numbers look good for them. they feel confident in their ground game, even though they have been really tight-lipped about it. it's been very much behind the scenes.
is donald trump himself an apotheosis of drain the pool politics? and i mean this in two ways. one is that he follows barack obama, so there's, for the first time, an african-american president. and then white people, largely — i mean not exclusively, but overwhelmingly are the ones who make donald trump his successor. and trump is a pretty manifestly unqualified, incompetent, erratic guy. we get a lot of death and destruction as a result with coronavirus. but then at the end, when trump loses reelection, and you have the storming of the capitol, it's such a perfectly literal if we can't have this country, no one can — this political system that did pretty damn well for white people, actually. i mean, you can actually make a somewhat different argument for non-white people until much more recently, but did pretty damn well for white people. america has gotten pretty rich. and it's like, enough of it. enough. we'll pave it over. we'll fill the pool. there's a lot of policy in the book, but i actually thought there was this amazing literalization of it into politics — it must have been right while you were finishing, or probably after you had finished, actually — that you really see the power of this.
let's get this out of the way first: democrats don't have to do anything to protect people with pre-existing conditions because they already did. that law is called the affordable care act, it includes an ironclad guarantee that no one can be turned down for health insurance regardless of their medical histories, and then-president barack obama signed it on march 23, 2010.
texas rep. sheila jackson lee, a democrat, introduced the violence against women reauthorization act of 2021 along with fellow democratic rep. jerry nadler of new york and pennsylvania rep. brian fitzpatrick, the only republican supporting the bill so far and who also co-sponsored the house-passed bill in 2019.
ryan's pitch comes at a time when many key trade groups are voicing major concerns about the repeal. the american medical association sent a letter to lawmakers bemoaning an expected decline in health insurance coverage and the potential harm it would cause to vulnerable patient populations.
courrielche concluded the episode with a preview of its sequel, which will examine andrew breitbart's role in the anthony weiner sexting scandal.
trump, after all, famously promised during his presidential campaign that he wouldn't touch medicare or medicaid. then he won the election. the gop is hoping that pattern repeats itself this election day.
pointing to the meetings with governors slated for the next day, trump said obamacare has tremendous problems and needed to be repealed and replaced, which he said would be one topic among others at the pretty big sessions they would have.
this really gives us an opportunity to sort of address two policy objectives with one policy step, glied says. she is not an adviser to biden, but has written a perspective in the new england journal of medicine on how policies to address the impact of covid-19 could shift under a new president.
repeal and replace obamacare with … what?
another large household expense, medical care, also accelerated. the cost of going to the doctor's office or the hospital rose 2.9% in 2015 to mark the fastest increase in three years, the cpi report showed.
with the exception of bloomberg, who hasn't yet qualified for a presidential candidate debate and wasn't on the ballot in iowa and new hampshire, candidates kept off the debate stage have fared poorly and many dropped out before voting in nominating contests began.
states would have to quickly decide whether to continue covering some or all of these adults with their own funds, according to judy solomon, a senior fellow at the left-leaning center on budget and policy priorities. it's doubtful many would be able to do that.
levin: i'd be scared to death.
romney also suggested that he will contrast president donald trump's immigration policies to restrict legal immigration, saying, utah welcomes legal immigrants from around the world. washington sends immigrants a message of exclusion.

nonetheless, trump has repeatedly assured americans that people with preexisting conditions would still be protected. neither the white house nor congressional republicans have specified how.

control of the senate hinges in part on a race in missouri. democratic sen. claire mccaskill is locked in a close contest with the state's attorney general, josh hawley. missouri voted for president trump in 2016 and has grown more conservative over time. cbs news contributor and host of npr's morning edition, steve inskeep, took a road trip down historic route 66 for three meals with missouri voters: breakfast in a small town, lunch in a suburb and dinner in a city.

-- an early test of trump's ethics pledge is a glittering new tower in canada, by drew harwell, alan freeman and jenny peng: as president trump settles into his first week in the white house, the first paying guests will begin checking in tonight into the lavish suites of the trump international hotel & tower vancouver, a glass skyscraper developed by the son of one of malaysia's wealthiest business executives. the tower, the first foreign business launch of the trump brand during the new presidency, is an early test of trump's controversial decision to retain ownership of his businesses while promising to combat ethical conflicts by removing himself from the management. it also shows how trump properties around the world are likely to become focal points for protest or other forms of expressions aimed at the u.s. president and his policies…
«escuché que la familia (ricketts), que es la propietaria de los chicago cubs, en secreto está gastando dólares en mi contra. ellos deberían tener cuidado porque tienen mucho que esconder», tuiteó trump.

for the time being, it's a reminder that the court knows how to get itself out of a tight spot when it needs to. a dig requires no explanation. its effect is to wipe the supreme court slate clean, as if the appeal had never even reached the court. a dig here would leave judge furman's opinion in place and would enable the professionals in the census bureau, who strongly objected to adding the citizenship question, free to go about their business counting us — all of us. if i'm right about these recent signals that the court knows how to save itself, now is the time.
he acknowledged that the government needs to spend more money and move faster.
the ukiraine accusations led to the house impeachment effort and, finally, the president's acquittal. every step of the way, meadows was at trump's side, fighting back against the leftists and fake news attacks that ended up failing to take trump down.
the trump administration plans to use money from the recent stimulus bills to pay hospitals for treatment of uninsured coronavirus patients. it says the plan is more efficient than reopening enrollment in the obamacare markets to achieve the same goal.
continuing his re-entrance into the political world, former massachusetts gov. deval patrick will be speaking at the national constitution center in philadelphia on thursday at an event called renewing the founders' promise.
those comments he made [about repeal] just demonstrate how disconnected he is from the people he's supposed to be representing, said edgar aguilar, program manager for community health initiative of kern county, an organization that helps enroll residents in medi-cal and covered california in bakersfield.
unlike the relief package congress approved in december, this legislation should be signed before any laid-off workers run out of benefits, and there are far fewer changes than in the prior bill, said andrew stettner, senior fellow at the century foundation. still, some states will wait until the us department of labor releases all the necessary guidance to reprogram their systems.
jim acosta: i think you heard the president there and various officials on the coronavirus task force lay out these next steps. the question is how long this are going to take in terms of getting the system testing moving. the president was saying this, as well as other officials, that they're going to be waiving regulations to make sure that the private lab industry can run these tests more quickly, that they're going to be setting up a website where people can go. it sort of sounded like obamacare, healthcare.gov and it's going to be run by google.
if you had told me a year ago that two days out from the iowa caucuses we would be neck and neck, effectively tied for first place in the state of iowa, i would have been thrilled, cruz told the register in sioux city on saturday.
and congress this year repealed the tax penalties associated with the individual mandate that most people obtain health coverage, effectively ending the mandate and removing a key incentive for less-expensive healthy consumers to pay into the insurance system. that will cause premiums to rise for those who remain in the exchange market.
however, rudolph w. giuliani, one of trump's personal attorneys, said the president's lawyers have made clear to justice department officials that they want to see mueller's completed report before the department decides what to share with congress.

-- to be sure, many house democrats who just got elected in districts trump carried in 2016 are feeling some heat as the shutdown drags on. the freshmen arranged an impromptu 90-minute meeting over the weekend at a retreat in virginia because several new members were 'freaking out' about the ongoing shutdown and the party's strategy, politico's heather caygle and sarah ferris report. 'i don't think that it's the democrats in the house's fault that we are in a shutdown,' said rep. colin allred (d-texas), who attended the huddle in williamsburg, va., and is one of two freshman class presidents. 'but i do think it's setting us back in terms of those coalitions we're trying to build.'

the affordable care act, which president-elect donald trump has vowed to repeal, threw a number of life-savers to these vital but financially troubled centers. and its full repeal, without a comparable and viable replacement, could signal their death knell.
biden also has proposed several steps to root out the systemic racism that has hindered the ability for people of color, particularly african americans, to buy or hold on to property – from onerous interest rates that leave them vulnerable to falling behind on payments, ending up in foreclosure, to biases that undervalue homes simply because they are owned by black people.
declines in snap and aca enrollment were largest in mixed status households where some people are in the country legally and some are not, the study found. for example, one family member may be a citizen, another an asylee or a permanent resident, and still another undocumented.
if biden can win southern states like alabama, arkansas, north carolina, oklahoma, tennessee, and texas and cross the 15% delegate threshold in a state like california, he will firmly position himself as the sanders alternative, wrote analysts at beacon policy advisors in a note on friday. those seven states, plus seven more and u.s. territory american samoa, vote on super tuesday.
mccammon: (laughter) nice one there, scott. of course, christie is under a bit of a cloud right now after some of his close aides were recently convicted in that bridgegate scandal. so he put pence - and we don't know for sure if this is why, but these events did follow each other. pence is stepping into the lead, you know, leading the effort to create a cabinet and fill other appointments. we did see some hints of this because christie himself had said that trump was not in the initial transition meeting on wednesday this week, and pence was there, apparently leading things. pence, of course, has experience in both congress and as the governor of indiana - experience that will likely be useful for trump, who, of course, has never held a position in government.
and i think that's why he wanted to do it is to make sure that they understand they heard first hand how much he respects them. how much he wanted to dispel the myth that there was a rift.

a senate republican and house republican shared this uniquely divisive exchange about trump's attorney general nominee:
despite biden's strength at the grassroots level among black voters, groups that represent black activists and other minorities haven't lined up behind him. the florida-based racial justice group dream defenders endorsed sanders, as did center for popular democracy action, a network of progressive community organizers looking to mobilize black and latinx voters. the center for urban and racial equity gave biden an f rating on its 2020 scorecard, saying the most of biden's plans do not explicitly mention race or racial inequity.
schumer also sent a letter to president trump and to congressional leaders asking for legislative changes that he argues would make it easier for states, including california, to develop a single-payer healthcare system.
he falsely said the bill will provide better coverage for low-income americans.
switching away from this current system of lower-skilled immigration, and instead adopting a merit-based system, will have many benefits: it will save countless dollars, raise workers' wages, and help struggling families — including immigrant families — enter the middle class.

surprise bills are one of the worst aspects of the u.s. health care system, and that's really saying something considering how awful it is in so many other ways. over the past couple of years, congress has tried and failed to devise a solution to this problem that would protect patients from unexpected bills from out-of-network providers the patients often don't even know treated them.

also, take a look. two gop candidates who have already jumped ahead to new hampshire, john kasich and jeb bush.
everyone knows that pelosi – who was first elected to the house in 1987 – is an old-school machine democrat who rules from the top down with an iron fist. she recently warned vulnerable freshmen in her caucus who were voting with republicans that this is not a day at the beach. this is the congress of the united states.
as you know, the president's vision is to negotiate fair trade deals that create jobs, increase american wages and reduce america's trade deficit. he's appointed a tough and smart number of trade experts who will fight on behalf of american workers. with that vision in mind, the president has already taken several steps today.

the iran deal is just one instance where trump's not knowing or caring about policy has put his administration in a bind.
«me gustaría darle un puñetazo en la cara», dijo trump al hacer la observación de un hombre que creó problemas en su concentración y que fue acompañado hasta afuera con una sonrisa en su rostro. «él está sonriendo, está pasando un buen rato».
for the 2017 enrollment season, most co-ops have proposed increasing premiums, often by at least 10%. but raising premiums is only part of the solution.
obamacare has failed -- harming patients and making it harder for families to make ends meet, health and human services secretary tom price wrote in a statement announcing actions the administration was taking in advance of a broader effort to reverse the harmful effects of obamacare.
that is the case with the new bureau of labor statistics report on february employment: 242,000 new jobs, 555,000 more people joining the labor force, upward revisions in previous job statistics, and an unemployment rate steady at 4.9%. investors business daily called those blowout numbers. other news outlets used words like hefty, surprisingly strong, and a sign of the nation's economic durability.
but tuesday's events were the first real sign that such an approach will not sustain trump in his re-election race.
cooper: chairman rogers, i just love that you know what a bedazzler is.
obamacare originally required all states to participate in the expanded medicaid program; the supreme court, in a 2012 split ruling that upheld most of the law, struck down the requirement. the law as written also required all americans to buy health insurance -- the so-called individual mandate -- at risk of a tax penalty. the trump administration whittled away at obamacare with executive actions, including one that cut funding for so-called navigator programs that help sign people up. a tax overhaul passed by republicans and signed by trump in 2017 eliminated the penalty for noncompliance, rendering the mandate moot and paving the way for the broader constitutional challenge to the law now before the supreme court.
after the industry rebuffed the white house's request not to raise prices, the president publicly denounced the ceos, opened a federal investigation and shifted some contracts to firms that toed the government line.

washington — the power struggle that has played out over the past five years between the obama administration and the supreme court is about to lose its central player.
keep in mind these numbers reflect where he is when the economy is strong, when the special counsel report has not been released, when congressional and southern district of new york prosecutors are still combing through his finances, and when hope exists of a face-saving deal with china that would avoid escalation of the trade war. if all or some of those turn out badly, things could really get ugly.
the american health care act ― the aca repeal-and-replace bill that the house passed and that trump threw a party for in the white house rose garden ― specifically was designed to make it harder for people with pre-existing conditions to get and keep their health insurance. in fact, the measure wouldn't have made it through the house if gop leaders hadn't made it more hostile to people with pre-existing conditions as a means to attract more conservative votes. this bill would have meant 23 million more uninsured people by 2026, according to the congressional budget office. the failed senate obamacare repeal bill authored by gop sens. bill cassidy (la.) and lindsey graham (s.c.) was the same.
would have been great to do it earlier, trump said about the 2019 appropriation of $1.375 billion for building 55 miles of border wall. he continued his veiled criticism of gop leaders in congress:
our colleagues add: the fiery developments reflected rising tensions among lawmakers over the nation's predicament and what's happening in the senate itself; sen. rand paul (r-ky.) announced sunday that he has covid-19, and four other gop senators are quarantined. sen. amy klobuchar (d-minn.) disclosed monday that her husband, too, is infected with the virus.

as far back as the 1950s, federal spending has hovered around 20% of the u.s. economy. its highest in that span, 24.4%, was more the result of a steep recession in 2009 than a massive increase in spending.
mccammon: and here trump has said, you know, he wanted to make sure that people with preexisting conditions were still covered, but that's one of the costliest parts of the health care law. he didn't say whether he would keep in place the mandate for coverage and that helps balance out the equation for insurers. he did tell the wall street journal that he and president obama had discussed the law's provisions in their meeting this week. he said he'd consider the president's concerns and that he wasn't sure whether obamacare would be amended or repealed and replaced. of course, during the campaign, he promised - repeal and replace obamacare.

cruz is wrong in his characterization of the gulf war bombing campaign. the air attacks conducted during the gulf war were precision-targeted, with laser-guided bombs designed to hit enemy fighters and minimize collateral damage. that is the mirror opposite of carpet bombing, which is an indiscriminate attack blanketing an area with explosives. the united states hasn't engaged in attacks that could be described as carpet bombing since the vietnam war. in 1977, the geneva conventions adopted a protocol that banned indiscriminate air attacks of cities and towns with large concentrations of civilians.
the town hall came after constituents, many of them organizing online, made daily calls and sent repeated emails to brat's office to demand a public meeting.
efforts to fulfill the campaign pledges of many republicans to repeal obamacare stalled after a late attempt to pass even a skinny repeal bill sank with sen. john mccain's thumbs down vote. what the administration has managed to do is repeal the health insurance mandate with a provision in the major tax cut plan passed late last year.
so bernie supporters are mainly in these -- a lot of them in these college towns, right? the college towns, you could have 500 people. you will not get -- even if you win it, you don't get as many delegates as if you have maybe 300 people back home. so he has been telling his students go home and caucus. don't stay in your college town.

if the ruling were to be put into effect immediately, it would rescind coverage for millions of americans as well as undo consumer protections and regulations that have reshaped the business models for insurers, drug companies, hospitals and doctors, all during a pandemic that's prompted 485,000 americans to sign up for obamacare after losing health-care coverage from their employer. the court, as part of any ruling against obamacare, could also issue a stay to give the biden administration a chance to respond. or congress, now in democratic hands by the slimmest margin, could try to forestall the ruling by restoring a nominal tax for the mandate, or passing a law specifying that the loss of the mandate should not bring down the rest of the law.

in late august, mcconnell announced that he would appoint a bipartisan committee – referred to as a gang – to make recommendations on how to commemorate the late senator's legacy. mcconnell's office has not yet responded to a cnn request for comment this week as to whether the committee had ever been appointed and, if so, what work it has done so far to move toward the goal to memorialize mccain.
levin: so how does somebody get on the ballot?
pressed to provide a bit more detail, trump advocated for allowing people to buy insurance across state lines. but that carries concerns for critics from both sides of the aisle.
question: of all the policy, or actions that a president could have taken today, he chose to reinstate the (inaudible) policy. what message is sending here? does he see the elimination reduction of abortions as an american value? and also here at home, can full (ph) life american's expect him to put his signature that will defund planned parenthood.
the facts: protecting people with preexisting conditions by preventing insurance companies from denying them coverage is actually one of the most popular parts of the affordable care act, the health care law pushed by obama.
biden also wants to allocate $775 billion toward a plan for child and elder care. a lot of the funding would go toward cutting medicaid waitlists for people needing home and community care, and to provide tax breaks to people who care for older family members.

one year into the trump presidency, women and men in these two key states told cnn they are largely supportive of the work done, though there is some disquiet about trump's style and what comes next.
i want to move to another example in the book, which is higher education. you connect the transition from publicly financed higher education, which we really did have through much of the 20th century — you really could go to college on the government's dime and not come out with tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in loans — and you connect the racialization of this and the way that the politics of race deformed white attitudes towards public spending to the student debt crisis today. can you talk through that story a bit?

those close to cruz say his willingness to negotiate with gop leaders is born in part out of political necessity. mica mosbacher, a fundraiser for cruz's presidential campaign, said cruz was at risk of losing support from benefactors who worried about his combative posture.

mnuchin and mulvaney were reacting to comments by senator susan collins (r-maine) who said she has concerns over repealing the mandate. on sunday, she said in an interview with abc that including the repeal in the senate version was a big mistake.
the new version comes after the congressional budget office found that the original bcra would in the next decade increase the uninsured population by 22 million over what it would otherwise be. senate majority leader mitch mcconnell had hoped for a vote before july 4, but was forced to delay that because he couldn't garner the 50 votes he needed among the 52 gop senators.
the court heard argument in the case in april, a month before the new information surfaced in an unrelated redistricting case. judge furman, responding to a request by one set of plaintiffs to reopen the census case for further discovery, said that with the case now before the supreme court, he lacked authority to do so. those plaintiffs, represented by the american civil liberties union, have now asked the justices for a limited remand that would send the case back to the district court to allow exploration of where the truth lies.

abortion-rights supporters have made recent moves to push for state-based laws protecting access to abortion and expanding access to birth control and reproductive care. the intensified efforts are a response to the addition of conservative brett m. kavanaugh to the supreme court, prompting concerns the new conservative majority would reverse roe v. wade. in new york, where democrats won full control of the state government in november, the first measure of 2019 expanding abortion rights was enacted. other efforts are underway in rhode island and new mexico, annie and ariana write.

so it is worth revisiting what the trump administration did while congress was impeaching, from the moment the president's efforts to use ukraine as a tool in his reelection campaign was exposed in early september through today. these are not impeachable offenses, but they are the kind of misguided policies that, along with trump's impeachable conduct, should be in voters' mind as the election nears.

mcghee: i agree. i think that, you know, frankly, the american people are paying lots of different people a lot of money for their health care and still not getting the results that they want. and so it is true that people think about, how much, you know, money do i have left at the end of my paycheck? and so i think it makes sense for the warren, you know, sanders wing to talk about it in terms of overall cost.
a related hangup is that a reconciliation change must make a change in outlays or revenues or the terms and conditions under which outlays are made or revenues collected, with the meaning of terms and conditions not always clear.
trump is right in noting that there was no bipartisan appetite for his health care proposal. and certainly, when you start without any support from the other side of the aisle, it is hard to pass much of anything.

capitol police arrest democracy spring protesters participating in a sit-in at the u.s. capitol.
the law, commonly known as obamacare, was first upheld by the supreme court under the justification that by tying the individual mandate -- the requirement to buy health insurance -- to a financial penalty it fell under congress' taxation power. when president trump eliminated the penalty, republican-led states claimed there was no longer a legal basis for the mandate.
leana wen, the health commissioner in baltimore at the time, had to choose who could receive the lifesaving medicine.
the second major lie was that biden supports efforts to eliminate police budgets, part of trump's efforts to portray biden ― a veteran politician with a clear center-left ideology and track record ― as a stalking-horse for the left-most elements of the democratic party. if you give power to joe biden, the radical left will defund police departments all across america, trump said.

the ultimate futility of courting republicans — so memorable today — is one of many grievances more progressive democrats still hold over obama's handling of the health care law. and in the popular imagination, it is the main reason obama made so many key compromises, like dropping a public option — the idea of a government-run insurance plan that would offer a more efficient, more patient-friendly alternative to private insurance.
this is our vision. this is our mission.
-- farmers who have come to rely on government assistance amid trump's trade war are struggling to cope without checks. annie gowen, jeff stein and sean sullivan report: the trump administration had promised to help farmers like [john] boyd, those who suffered as a result of the international trade war after chinese purchases of soybeans — once 60 percent of the market — plummeted to next to nothing. with farmers on the edge of ruin, the u.s. government offered $12 billion in support since september, checks that had become a lifeline. but with the government shutdown moving into its third week, boyd was left waiting for his support check to arrive.

after the financial crisis, former federal reserve chairman ben bernanke pushed zero interest rates and quantitative easing to get companies to invest more in the economy. he figured that zirp and qe would drive down the cost of capital for corporations. they did. but he, and everyone else, has been baffled that this hasn't unleashed quite the flood of new investment that you'd expect. and now we know why.

after launching the asu-starbucks partnership in 2014, edplus, an institution within asu that designs online courses and degree programs for the school, was able to use that as a model to work with other companies to offer similar programs, said sean hobson, chief design officer at edplus.
this will be shocking news to biden, who won the democratic primary by opposing the kinds of health care reforms, like medicare for all, that his progressive opponents favored and that also wouldn't do what trump says they would. instead, biden is running on a potentially consequential but also kind of boring plan to make obamacare coverage cheaper.
shopping for obamacare opens to mixed reviews from consumers
but at least its members are being brutally honest about the political pickle in which their allies in congress find themselcves: it's republicans – and not democrats – who are taking heat for obamacare's rate hikes since they hold the reins of power and have tinkered with the aca marketplaces without actually revamping them.
question: more than ronald reagan's in 1981?
if you are looking for an alternative path for a conservative leader, one who even knows how to appeal to populist and nationalist sentiment, look at british prime minister boris johnson. johnson, who initially bungled covid-19 but is now tackling the pandemic with much greater seriousness, has gradually emerged as the most consequential conservative politician since margaret thatcher. he has been slowly but surely reshaping his party to make it more compatible with modern-day britain. his cabinet is remarkably diverse, with two of the three most powerful positions filled by asian britons.
another day, another delay of a piece of the federal health care law known as obamacare. the administration is having trouble setting up some of the new computer systems required by the affordable care act. last week, they announced a year-long delay in the implementation of some of the law's requirements for businesses. today, it's smokers who are affected. critics say this is more evidence that the administration is not ready to roll out the law, which takes effect in october.
infrastructure is building around these programs, indicating they're likely to become even more widespread.

well, in either case it doesn't matter to me, pelosi laughed. what matters to me is that he recognize that the congress of the united states is the first branch of government, that we're a co-equal branch of government, and that we represent the people. and that when we go to the table to speak with him, we're respectful of the branch that he represents, the office of the president. and we want him to be respectful of the branch of government we represent. co-equal.

pelosi again delivered the votes for the affordable care act in 2010, which republicans derisively called obamacare. that fall, they retook the house.
we passed a massive tax cut for working families and doubled the child tax credit.
but scholars of the presidency say that barack obama, george w. bush and their predecessors have added so many powers to the white house toolbox that a president trump could fulfill many of his promises legally — and virtually unchecked by a congress that has proven incapable of mustering much pushback for decades .
women in pink hats and t-shirts flooded town hall meetings, demanding answers. members of congress couldn't handle the heat and started avoiding their own constituents. an avalanche of angry callers bore down on the congressional switchboard. an analysis by democratic pollsters lake research partners examined the usage of the popular app daily action, which directly connects people to their representatives, and showed that 86% of calls made to lawmakers in the months immediately after the march were coming from – you guessed it – women.
the mandate has been credited with significantly reducing birth control costs across the country. before the affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare, contraceptives made up about 30% of women's total out-of-pocket health care costs, according to the national women's law center. in 2013, the mandate saved women more than $1.4 billion in out-of-pocket expenses for birth control pills.
this is a shameful decision from the supreme court, said brigitte amiri, deputy director of the aclu reproductive freedom project. denying employees and students coverage for birth control will limit their ability to decide whether and when to have a family and make other decisions about their futures. and it will exacerbate existing inequalities, falling hardest on people with the fewest resources and people of color.
2. shift the entire fleet of 500,000 school buses to american-made, zero-emission alternatives in five years. this is among the more wild-eyed proposals in the platform's climate change section. it is not clear who will produce these buses (presumably to run on battery power), or what is to be done with half a million currently functional buses that run on ordinary fuel, and how local school districts are meant to afford the cost. the platform provides no further details.
tell us where things stand right now. it is a standoff over the idea that republicans are trying to push funding this bill along with making sure that the president's executive order on immigration doesn't happen.
some democrats have long wanted to develop a government-sponsored health plan that would insure americans under the age of 65, but they have never succeeded.
it's not clear if it has occurred to him, and others, what should be obvious: the first amendment protects private speech from government censorship, but not from de-platforming by a private concern. or that twitter's decision to ban trump, or a publisher's decision to cancel publication of hawley's book, are expressions of corporate values that reflect market forces. some argue that twitter is more like a public utility than a private outlet — and therefore shouldn't censor certain voices — but that view runs counter to how conservatives have framed the role of private enterprise: twitter isn't the phone company; it's the christian-owned bakery, or hobby lobby.
also, lawmakers added the $300 weekly enhancement and made changes to the pandemic programs. and trump waited to sign the bill until after benefits had lapsed for millions more out-of-work americans.
but reconciliation isn't a cure-all for the senate's structural problems, especially given the strict, quirky rules about what provisions can even pass through that process. and at least for the moment, ending or even reforming the filibuster seems to be off the table.
ahh: more than 100 billion doses of oxycodone and hydrocodone were shipped across the country between 2006 and 2014, according to newly disclosed federal drug data, our washington post colleagues steven rich, scott higham and sari horwitz report.
although the details of the argument evolved over time, the gist was always the same: obamacare would ration treatments for society's most vulnerable members, like the disabled and the elderly, because their lives wouldn't be deemed worth the expense of saving.
reality check: santorum on americans without college degrees
a spokesman for sen. joe manchin told me that while the west virginia democrat is pleased with the new funding stream, he's concerned with making sure his state gets a fair share of the dollars give it has the highest rates of drug abuse in the nation. manchin, up for reelection this year in a state won by trump, is also well-placed to weigh in, as he sits on the senate appropriations committee.

i myself am undecided about whether i'll vote for joe if he's the nominee. there's a lot of election left and i don't need to decide today. but biden needs to show me something. like tens of thousands of other people, i've given everything i've got to fight for bernie over the past months. the thought of settling for someone who appears to share very few common goals with me is a painful one. it's also a familiar one. it cannot be overstated how little most young voters like me care about restoring some dignity of the office.
former top christie aide backing clinton over trump
this is a progressive administration that wanted to use the power that we believe ... the constitution gives the federal government to address the great problems confronting the nation, verrilli said during an exit interview in his justice department office. those actions were being evaluated by a court whose majority probably started out with a degree of skepticism.
that spirit was contagious at clinton's rally. as a 4-year-old girl skipped away from the event, she chanted to herself: hillary! hillary!
that approach differs from clinton's list of policy cornerstones. her speech nevertheless included typical political platitudes, from taking on the gun lobby to making the wealthy pay their fair share of taxes. she's not campaigning on a budget rollout.

the story that allows them to be heroes by cutting off their noses despite their face, for example, is a story in which black people have a poverty that is contagious — that black people are both physically unclean and dangerous, more prone to violence, and so would therefore be threatening to the little kids and the — heaven forbid — women in bathing suits. there's a sexualized stereotype around hypersexual black masculinity, that we can't have our white women being anywhere near black men. but there is also the idea, i think, on a deeper level that when generations of white people have been the beneficiaries of these invisible government benefits from the homestead act, the g.i. bill, that have created an actual economic superiority over black people, that idea reifies the idea that there's something innately superior about white people. and so the way i made sense of it was, if you've been taught for generations to disdain and distrust a group of people and exclude them from the circle of human belonging, from citizenship, from economic inclusion, from schools, from unions — the list goes on — neighborhoods, mortgage markets, and then suddenly the same government that was the purveyor of all of that, the government that wrote into its housing codes, do not sell to black people or we will not give you money — that same government almost on a dime said, ok, now you have to swim with those people.

martinez told the miami herald he tried multiple times to contact the government. he reportedly has receipts showing he mailed five identical packets of information to the hhs that contained copies of his u.s. passport, his wife's residency card, their joint 2013 income tax statement and his florida driver's license, the paper reported.
partial birth abortions are illegal, and planned parenthood has repeatedly denied that it performs partial birth abortions, or that it has participated in any illegal activity. on monday, a texas grand jury investigation into planned parenthood cleared the group, instead indicting two members of the center for medical progress who secretly recorded planned parenthood members.
in addition, consumers should be willing to drop a metal level to save money, advised dillon. according to his calculations, consumers can save approximately 15 percent in premium costs by shifting from gold to silver, or from silver to bronze plans. such a drop will likely mean more out-of-pocket costs, so based on your health care needs, you'll have to calculate if the savings on premiums in exchange for higher out-of-pocket costs makes sense.
or maybe those canadians aren't so dumb after all and have figured out how to provide better healthcare opportunities to a wider range of people and not just the anointed elite?
those findings, which the cbo published early last week, halted the political momentum the repeal legislation had gained when it sailed through two committee votes earlier this month. as trump administration officials and house republicans began preparing for consideration by the full house, they quickly realized the bill lacked enough support to pass.
sanders may be a dreamer, but he's not dishonorable. trying to sully him in this way only sullies her.

the waste goes beyond administrative savings. while pharmaceutical companies and hospital groups are consolidating and forming regional monopolies, our fragmented, multipayer system leaves no one insurance plan with a large enough share of the market to negotiate effectively. that allows these companies to essentially set their own inflated prices and bilk the public for hundreds of billions of dollars.
schilling: well, i find it ironic. i don't know if irony is the right word, but a couple years ago, i remember before the election, weren't we all screaming for something different? we don't want a career politician. we want somebody to break the mold.
the bill does try to strike a middle ground, she said.
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (ky.) and many republicans have pushed back against the need for additional stimulus during the pandemic, saying they see no urgency in passing a fifth relief package. but among the ideas republicans have put forward, like expanding the ppp program, implementing tax credits for hiring workers or bonuses for rehired workers, health care has largely been left out of the emergency relief debate.
between 2010 and 2016, cardiovascular-related deaths rose from 141.9 to 142 per 100,000 residents each year in the counties in expansion states, while cardiovascular-related deaths rose from 176.1 to 180.6 per 100,000 residents annually in the counties in non-expansion states, the data showed.

the debut of this phony bill friday is the latest installment in republicans' long-running campaign to make the health care system worse for anyone who has ever been sick while loudly proclaiming they are doing the opposite.
clinton went on to say trump never apologized for mocking a new york times reporter's disability or to president obama for spreading the birther conspiracy -- that he was not born in the u.s.
if you were a voter who was only willing to tolerate trump's race baiting in order to get some actual relief for your community or to punish the elites, then putting kids in cages, cracking down on legal immigrants and deporting veterans' wives is a poor substitute.
according to the navy, the navy decommissioned many older ships after the end of the cold war in 1991, a decision that led to a smaller overall fleet. ship levels also were not greatly increased in the aftermath of the september 11 attacks as older surface warships have been replaced at a less than one-to-one ratio.
john sides: it sounds as if this case didn't exactly end the debate between religious liberty and anti-discrimination principles.
if they don't [report], it's a very difficult situation for our country, trump said.
trump's decision to pick this fight at this moment is, therefore, tough to understand. there's no question that his base hates obamacare and would like to see it gone. and that he believes that at least part of his 2016 victory – and maybe his chances at re-election in 2020 – hinge on him making good on removing the most visible footprint of his predecessor. at rally after rally during the 2018 campaign, trump re-told the story of john mccain's decision to vote against the so-called skinny repeal of obamacare, a line that always drew boos and jeers directed at the late arizona senator from the crowd.

there are many reasons that this should be concerning to the american people. when a president fails to follow statutory mandates or prohibitions, he reverses the votes of the people's duly elected representatives in congress. and when the president unilaterally refuses to enforce parts of statutes he himself signed into law, he makes a mockery of our system of government and avoids accountability. if this practice is allowed to continue, no longer would presidential candidates running for reelection have to stand on their records, because they could sign one bill into law, and enforce another version of it in practice, and thereby avoid responsibility for their actions at politically opportune times.
and if trump was woefully ill-informed about the iran deal then, his views did not emerge from a vacuum. rather, they tracked congressional republicans' attacks on the agreement, which were then amplified by candidates seeking the gop nomination, which were then further escalated by fox news hosts and others in the right-wing media ecosystem.
if the administration takes such action, it's likely that fewer people would pay a financial penalty for not having health insurance, but people who hold onto their coverage would face higher premiums. in addition, the number of people without coverage would rise, maybe even dramatically.
i don't think he has any ambition in mind beyond managing it, he said.
some 91,000 residents would qualify for coverage if idaho expands, and the state will receive $368 million in federal funds for expansion in fiscal 2021, its first full year, said strizich, citing an actuarial report done for the idaho department of health and welfare. (the federal government picks up at least 90% of the tab.)

many republicans still aren't willing to vote for any proposal that might appear to prop up obamacare, otherwise known as the affordable care act, which they and many of their supporters would rather just repeal.
cornish: but that's hard to sort of frame in 10 days, right? i mean, this is...
trump also took aim at democratic presidential nominee joe biden's health care plan ― or a caricature of it, anyway.
but, the other billionaire in the race – environmental and progressive advocate tom steyer – has failed to qualify. he has remained three national polls shy – or two nevada or south carolina polls short – of making the stage. and, rep. tulsi gabbard of hawaii has been even further from meeting the thresholds.
all of this means the plans come with low premiums. but monday's announcement means that the less generous plans could become cheaper still ― and thus more attractive ― because states would have authority to redirect financial assistance. today, the affordable care act's tax credits are available only to people who buy comprehensive coverage.
during his first year in office, trump's top foreign policy advisers unanimously supported staying in the iran deal. but in the past two months, trump has fired national security adviser h.r. mcmaster and secretary of state rex tillerson, leaving defense secretary jim mattis as the sole major voice for keeping the deal.

south carolina was widely seen as a must-win for biden, who is aiming to be the moderate alternative to self-described democratic socialist sanders.
not that the affordable care act's architects thought they were fixing all of the health care system's problems. after nearly a century of failed attempts at passing universal coverage, most recently during bill clinton's presidency, democrats were determined to find a more politically viable path. by around 2006 or so, a consensus had taken shape around a plan that leaned heavily on private insurance and minimized disruption of existing arrangements, and a strategy that stressed negotiating with the health care industry rather than fighting it.
levin: and i have this question for you. when bernie sanders talks about government, when elizabeth warren talks about government, when all of these people talk about government, can they give us some names? in other words, exactly who's going to the healthcare system? and exactly where do these experts come from? they're not experts. they're people who are in the bureaucracy. they are civil servants. they're members of unions in some cases, some of them have seniority. do they have expert tests?

those plans would very likely be cheaper than the policies currently offered on the obamacare exchanges. but for people who would like to purchase plans that cover the essential health benefits mandated by the affordable care act, including mental health coverage, addiction treatment, maternity care and prescription drug coverage, costs could go way up.
● immigration. the supreme court, dividing 5 to 4 along ideological lines, allowed a trump administration rule to take effect that will make it more difficult for poor immigrants to obtain admission to the united state or secure green cards giving them the permission to live and work here. this public charge rule allows authorities new leeway to deny visas to those who they suspect could turn, at any time, to safety-net programs such as food stamps or medicaid.
well, i had never heard the expression, 'get a life,' but then i did! she laughed.
obviously, health insurers must collect sufficient premiums to pay patient costs (plus an additional amount to cover overhead and profit). in fact, under federal law insurers are required to spend 80% of all premiums collected for the actual cost of patient care.

mr. trump nominated barrett to the supreme court in a ceremony in the white house rose garden where there was limited social distancing and few wore masks. dr. anthony fauci, the nation's leading infectious diseases expert, described the ceremony to cbs news as a super-spreader event because so many of the attendees, including the president and first lady melania trump, soon tested positive for covid-19.

it's worth being extremely clear about why anyone is worried about people with preexisting conditions in the first place. after all, it's been a full decade since the affordable care act made it illegal for health insurance companies to deny coverage or charge higher rates to people based on their medical histories.
sessions also ramped up federal prosecutions of all fentanyl offenses and sent additional prosecutors to 10 areas in the country with the highest number of overdoses.
once one of these men wins the democratic nomination to run against president trump, the president will call attention to the fatal flaws in his opponent's plans. as a result, that could mean that health care will become a losing issue for democrats, unlike in the 2018 midterm elections.
obamacare's biggest problems lie in the risk mitigation efforts, said timothy jost, an emeritus professor at washington and lee university school of law. in addition to the risk adjustment program, there were two other initiatives aimed at helping insurers cover high-cost patients. but both are ending this year.

these realities do not impress sanders. he has a fantastical vision of what the united states should look like. he wants to give everyone free health care and free college and, like the ideologue he is, doesn't know or care where the money will come from.
trump has gravely weakened the nation's economy, while biden has shown over his life that he cares about people's chances for prosperity and rewarding lives—for achieving the american dream.
the republicans included the repeal of the individual mandate in the tax bill, because they were unable to pass the better care reconciliation act of 2017, a republican bill that would have repealed and replaced the affordable care act.
pressed further to say whether he had actually engaged in such behavior, trump claimed he hasn't.
this time, democrats insist, will be different. the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package, dubbed the american rescue plan, provides far more direct relief to americans than the 2009 legislation. the white house, full of veterans of president barack obama's administration, and democratic outside groups are preparing to wage an extended political battle to make sure voters appreciate the aid they're receiving.
obama administration officials were slow to address the fentanyl epidemic. the administration saw fentanyl as an add-on to the overall opioid crisis, rather than a singular danger that required a strategy of its own because it was so deadly and was coming into the country largely unimpeded through the mail. senior white house and justice department officials, motivated by a desire to rectify racial inequality in sentencing, emphasized drug treatment over incarceration, and drug prosecutions fell off as fentanyl coursed through sections of the country.

the deal was achieved by obama. the republican primary voting base hated obama. anything obama did, therefore, was by definition bad and had to be undone quickly.
lawmakers on capitol hill were growing impatient with the administration's lack of plans to confront the opioid epidemic. on july 26, the house oversight and reform committee summoned then-acting drug czar richard baum, who had been in his job for four months, to explain why he had not submitted a comprehensive plan to operate and fund the office.
the affordable care act intended to expand medicaid eligibility to 138 percent of poverty level from the previous threshold of 44 percent, and provide tax credits for those making between 100 percent and 400 percent of poverty. but the supreme court ruled in 2012 that the federal government could not compel states to expand their programs, and 19 states declined to do so. this created a gap in which people making between 44 and 100 percent of poverty neither qualified for medicaid or subsidies in those states.

due to problems with the va database, some of those records include people who died before the va had even started its health care enrollment system, or people who did not apply for health care benefits specifically. to say definitively that 307,000 people have died waiting for health care may be a stretch, so we rate her claim as it's complicated.

these laws effectively outlaw abortion at six weeks, just two weeks after a missed period, a point at which many women don't even realize they are pregnant. the likelihood that a preteen or teenage girl would know she is pregnant in time to beat this cutoff is almost nonexistent. indeed, the only reason an 11-year-old ohio girl recently impregnated by a rapist wouldn't be forced to give birth is because the law ins't in effect yet and its implementation will likely be delayed by legal challenges.
cummings also was furious that the white house had not produced its national drug control strategy to congress. it was two years past the congressionally required deadline. instead of submitting a strategy that normally consisted of more than 100 pages of detailed plans, carroll had given the committee what cummings called a 23-page pamphlet that did not outline specific goals or measurable objectives. at the hearing, triana mcneil, a director of the government accountability office, said the document failed to meet congressional requirements.

the facts: as we wrote, the pew global attitudes project last year found that citizens in 35 out of 37 countries have less confidence in trump than they did in obama — significantly so, in some cases. the decline in confidence in the u.s. president has been especially pronounced among some of america's closest allies in europe and asia, as well as neighboring mexico and canada, pew found. a more recent gallup world poll survey, released in january, found similar results. median approval of u.s. leadership across 134 countries and areas stands at a new low of 30%, gallup found.

perhaps trump's easiest action — and the one that would produce the largest impact — would be to drop the administration's appeal of a lawsuit filed by republican house members in 2014. that suit, house v. burwell, charged that the obama administration was unconstitutionally spending money that congress hadn't formally appropriated, to reimburse health insurers who were providing coverage to working-poor policyholders — those earning between 100 and 250 percent of the federal poverty line.

but figuring out how to actually pay for something like this - and as you talked to congresswoman ocasio-cortez, she didn't have a lot of ideas on how this would actually be paid for aside from taxes and deficit spending. and deficit spending - obviously something that democrats, like you pointed out, have been critical of republicans on in some of their tax cuts.

in an age of hyper-partisanship, it's unclear whether donnelly's tactics will be successful, or whether ruby-red indiana will elect a republican senator in november.
executive orders like these are little more than campaign press releases printed on fancier stationery. since trump doesn't have the interest or patience to actually work with congress to make laws, he tosses off toothless executive orders and farms out his obamacare repeal efforts to a court system he's packed with his own judges.
she pointed to her bill with sen. chuck grassley (r-iowa) on drug importation as well as her bill to stop generic drugmakers from taking money from big pharmaceuticals to keep their products off the market. the issue here is there are two pharma lobbyists for every member of congress, she said. they think they own washington. they don't own me.

but many struggled early — and their problems became part of the highly politicized debate over the law on capitol hill. either they increased enrollments too fast, and then could not keep up with rising health costs, or they could not gain enough members to help spread their costs.
there's a reason that left-wing commentator chris mathews compared sanders' win in nevada to france falling to the nazis in 1940. for democrats, it's almost that dire.
what's more, these critics don't trust him because he has been part of the establishment; he is a bushie who grew up in the d.c. suburbs. they believe he is exactly the kind of potential nominee who has disappointed conservatives before.

barrett wrote roberts pushed the affordable care act beyond its plausible meaning to save the statute. his decision, she continued, might be explained by the fact that chief justice roberts has not proven himself to be a textualist in matters of statutory interpretation, unlike scalia, a staunch textualist and originalist.

they are allowing insurers to sell more so-called short-term policies, which insurers can refuse to sell to people with pre-existing conditions. they want to permit states to set aside the aca's insurance regulations and set up new markets for policies that people with pre-existing conditions can't buy. at the state level, iowa and tennessee already have parallel insurance markets that allow insurers to turn away people with pre-existing conditions, and idaho wants to join them.

there is a growing sense that the special counsel's closely held investigation could come to culmination soon. some trump advisers think mueller could deliver the confidential report explaining his findings to senior justice department officials next month. under the rules authorizing the special counsel, the attorney general can then decide whether to share the report or parts of it with congress and the public. some house leaders have vowed to immediately seek to obtain a copy of mueller's findings. but the white house would resist the release of details describing confidential and sensitive communications between the president and his senior aides, trump advisers say. it is unclear whether the special counsel's report will refer to material that the white house views as privileged communications obtained from interviews with senior white house officials. some trump advisers anticipate that mueller may simply write a concise memo laying out his conclusions about the president's actions.

in fact, blocking its own pay increases seems to be one of the few things congress has been able to consistently do. congress has not seen a raise since 2009, and not all of that is thanks to sinema. her claim was rated one out of four stars, mostly false.
the decision came after an internal debate about how to proceed in the wake of a december court ruling that invalidated the entire affordable care act. trump's justice department moved to back the court's decision. but that decision – while important in terms of keeping a campaign promise to the president's base – has highlighted the administration's lack of health care policy going forward.

you know, it's kind of sad, really, actually, that donald trump, you know, wants to do name-calling and invective and insults and thinks that that's really effective. and i just don't think -- i think the voters of iowa are just kind of sick of that behavior.

gop voters remain loyal to the president. and not by small margins. while just 39 percent of all respondents in a recent pew poll said they approved of the job trump was doing, 84 percent of republican and republican-leaning voters said they felt that way. gop support for trump surpasses that for george w. bush, his father, and ronald reagan at similar points in their presidencies.
the second argument i'd make is that cash is much, much harder to demonize than health care. if you go to a conservative in kentucky and say the government wants to take over your health care, you can get people very, very upset about that. if you say, hey, this cash is going to hurt you, it's going to be tougher. i mean, there might be some someone there who's like, yeah, the cash is going to hurt me, but others would be like, wait a minute, they do this in alaska. if i got that money, i think i'd be very productive with it. sure, some of my neighbors less so, but, you know, first things first. so we can get americans on board because it's such a simple, straightforward vision of citizenship.

on its own, the administration stopped reimbursing insurers for the discounts they're required to give lower-income customers to reduce out-of-pocket expenses. (insurers, however, are still required to give customers the discounts.)
some people are working two, three jobs just to get by. and to see money get wasted in washington on a job that is duplicative is insulting to the hard work that they do to pay their taxes. and i think that that comes into your question, in overall spending as well. we've got to look at how we're spending the american people's tax money.

it's a complicated set of changes, but it means that some residents of states seeking the waivers could end up with easier access to cheaper, skimpier health plans, providing an alternative to those who cannot afford to pay for comprehensive coverage that the affordable care act has made available.
so one of the things i'm going to want to push on during this conversation is some questions of causality. and so one here is about whether or not this reflects a often counterproductive human belief in certain forms of zero-sum fairness or racism directly. so there are all kinds of studies and experiments in which if people feel somebody else is getting something that is unfair, they will make it so they and everyone else get less in order to keep it from that person getting more. my colleague, sarah kliff — we're both at the new york times now, but back then, we were at vox — she did this extraordinary reporting trip to kentucky early in the trump era. and she was going and looking at and talking to white people in kentucky, poor white people who were benefiting from the affordable care act but were supporting donald trump and supporting a republican party that wanted to repeal it. she got a bunch of explanations, but one thing she kept finding was anger and resentment that the slightly better-off working class white people had towards the slightly poorer white people, because they were paying premiums in the exchanges, and the slightly poorer white people were not paying premiums for medicaid. they felt the poorer white people were getting too much for nothing.
what the president's suggesting is tearing at the very fabric of the constitution. we have a separation of powers that gives us balance. and that doesn't protect the branches. it's not there to protect the executive branch or legislative branch. it's to protect liberty. it's to keep any branch from assuming so much control that they become a threat to liberty. and i'm afraid -- go ahead. i'm sorry.
at a campaign rally in nashville, president trump repeated a bushelful of false and misleading claims, and added a few new ones:

[have you lost a family member or loved one to a fentanyl-related overdose? tell us about them.]

it is not compassionate, but reckless, to allow uncontrolled entry from places where proper vetting cannot occur. those given the high honor of admission to the united states should support this country and love its people and its values.

talker:donald trump was proven right, this was a witch hunt
one republican adviser close to the white house said on condition of anonymity that trump has made no effort since taking office to inform himself ― not on the iran deal or policy issues generally. he doesn't know, the adviser said. and he doesn't care.
the bill, drafted by ryan and other house republican leaders, cleared a key hurdle thursday, passing two house committees after marathon markup sessions. but many members from the tea party wing are upset that it keeps too much of the affordable care act in place and effectively replaces the law's signature tax with a heavy surcharge assessed to people who forgo health insurance.
but we must reject the politics of revenge, resistance, and retribution — and embrace the boundless potential of cooperation, compromise, and the common good.
the right track/wrong track numbers are the best we've seen since february of 2017, reports rasmussen polling, and well above the dismal numbers that defined the last year of barack obama's failed presidency.
but a lack of action on health care could have its own political consequences. if the polls are right, voters will hold republicans, not democrats, responsible for problems with the affordable care act ― and for problems with health care more generally.
his approach to solving illegal immigration is to rebuild honduras, guatemala and el salvador so people do not have to flee their own countries. he is a co-sponsor of the green new deal, which is a fable that only an aging socialist could love. he vows to eliminate the profits in the health-care industry, but hasn't explained how companies will invest billions in new drugs if there is no reward for doing so.
the financial data billionaire also drew on his own professional heritage to try to defuse the attacks and to present himself as the antidote to the chaos ripping through washington.
question: i haven't heard that you al -- you said or someone else has said specifically. will the president -- has the president spoken to any of the intelligence agencies about the investigation into the russian connections? and will he allow that to go on?
already, both sides are preparing their arguments. glen bolger, a republican pollster at public opinion strategies, predicted the legislation would get less popular over time as the public learned more about its non-covid-19 provisions.
but, she's 99% committed to biden.
we shouldn't extrapolate too much from the first three weeks of pelosi's speakership, but if anything it seems having a long-unpopular and volatile president as her own foil could play to pelosi's strengths. what people forget about pelosi, given her years featured in gop attack ads, is that she was relatively popular when she had this setup before. she first became speaker after the 2006 election and served in that role for the last two years of the george w. bush administration. her poll numbers only took a turn for the negative when barack obama and obamacare came along.
-- meghan mccain says trump told her he will no longer go after her father. mccain told politico the president called her in the fall to say he would back off sen. john mccain, who is being treated for brain cancer, following months of criticizing the arizona republican for his vote against the republican skinny repeal health-care bill in august.

the facts: customs and border protection said construction crews have built 119 miles of border wall along the u.s.-mexico border since trump took office. the administration's goal is to complete a total of 450 miles by the end of 2020, meaning they have 330 miles left to build with 315 days left in the year.

1. trump is particularly fond of making bold claims about how the veterans affairs mission act came about and what it did. he has claimed the legislation was all his idea. he has suggested congress couldn't get the measure approved for 44, 45 or even 48 years. he has made these claims — or iterations of them —113 times, according to the post database.
president trump on jan. 9 said he could use his emergency powers to build the southern border wall if he can't make a deal with people who are unreasonable. (the washington post)
on the other hand, some conservatives in the senate are ideologically opposed to offering any tax credits. ted cruz, r-texas; mike lee, r-utah; and rand paul, r-ky., have all expressed concerns about the bill being too much like the aca, with paul referring to it as obamacare lite. they worry that the tax credits amount to a new entitlement.
without the mandate or some other policy device to keep healthy people buying coverage, most experts say insurers would have to charge everybody else even more ― and, partly as a consequence, fewer people would end up having insurance.
the story with james in michigan is pretty much the same.
and as much as republicans point to tillis' bill as evidence of their desire to protect people with preexisting conditions, it has little chance of passing in a divided senate. moreover, experts say it would allow insurers to exclude coverage of some preexisting conditions anyway, calling its provisions a mirage.
still, the trump white house had worked hard to shift blame back to the democrats.
walker has called roberts' 2012 opinion indefensible. in his recent remarks at the march investiture, he further revealed an us-versus-them mindset. after thanking mcconnell, kavanaugh and other supporters, he referred to his nomination's opponents, including, he said, the american bar association.
hagerty's team also rolled out a website called massachusetts manny that claims he is too liberal for tennessee, including much of what's in the new ad and more including that sethi made a small contribution to actblue—the political fundraising arm of the democrat party—when he lived in massachusetts. sethi also, documents contained on the hagerty team's website unveil, applied for a job in former president barack obama's administration before he later moved to tennessee.

in comparison to the 2009 law, which contained a relatively paltry $25 boost to weekly unemployment checks, the covid-19 relief bill offers a $300-a-week boost, along with $1,400 checks for most americans and an expanded child tax credit that should regularly funnel money to poor and working class families soon.

federal travel ban expands - usa today: the u.s.-mexico border will be closed to nonessential travel to further help stem the spread of the novel coronavirus, president donald trump announced friday. 'as we did with canada, we're also working with mexico to implement new rules at our ports of entry to suspend non-essential travel,' trump said. 'these new rules and procedures will not impede lawful trade and commerce.' trump said that mexico is also suspending air travel from europe. secretary of state mike pompeo said the u.s. has taken 'two important steps' this week to curb the spread of the virus. he noted the border closure with canada, announced wednesday, would go into effect at midnight. he said the closure would last 30 days and reiterated the news trump shared that the border with mexico would also close.

breitbart news asked azar about insurers in areas like maryland and virginia who are considering double-digit health insurance premium increases in 2019. there's a maryland regulator that's said something like the aca is in a 'death spiral,' echoing past words of the president [donald trump]. what are you doing to deal with that? does hhs just accept these premium increases as reality? what are you doing to reduce those costs?
that issue is increasingly familiar to residents of urban centers around the country, and making a dent in the problem here would be one way for newsom to build a case for higher political office – even if candidate newsom told usa today last fall that his train stops in sacramento.
but as the size and scope of government ballooned, the president became the de facto manager of a sprawling, vital sector of the economy, and presidential authority expanded almost continuously. a century ago, theodore roosevelt argued that presidents were allowed to do anything not specifically prohibited by law or the constitution. and nixon famously asserted, after he had resigned from office over the watergate scandal, that when the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.

in 10 years, obamacare has inexorably steered health care toward bureaucracy, stagnation and eventually total government control. the way forward now, better late than never, is innovation, competition and choice.
and overseas, we have inherited a series of tragic foreign policy disasters.
exactly seven years ago thursday, after decades of effort to make health care available to all americans, the affordable care act was signed into law. now, in what house speaker paul ryan calls an act of mercy, the house is planning an anniversary vote to repeal it and, in addition, to radically alter the medicaid program that has been a staple of the national safety net since the 1960s. for members of congress, this is one of the most consequential votes they might ever face.
perhaps the one issue that recurs most often in kaufman's diagnosis is the near extinction of unions as a political force. private sector union participation was down to 8 percent by 2016, he says, and those who remained were not nearly numerous or generous enough to compete with the gop's coffers.

the beautiful thing about a bilateral agreement is that if any one of the true parties in the agreement decides at any time they want to get out of the agreement, or they're not being treated fairly, they can renegotiate much easier. in a multinational agreement, that's not the case. in many cases, all of the other countries have to agree to an action or to let somebody out. that's not putting the u.s. interest's first.

all of that has contributed to a firm sense inside the white house that the politics are firmly in their favor, several aides made clear. and not just that supporters would be rewarded politically, but that those who opposed it -- congressional republicans -- would take a hit.

you've got the worst drug crisis we've had ever, and it takes you two years to get somebody in the white house who wakes up every day thinking about the problems? said keith humphreys, who served as a drug policy adviser to the george w. bush and obama administrations. that to me is just an astounding dereliction of duty.
this was quite apparent tuesday night with the president's hateful rhetoric criminalizing immigrants and further inciting hatred and fear against them. yet the truth is that a majority of hispanic immigrants in the united states are law-abiding citizens.
self-insurance: without the ready-made benefits package provided by larger corporations, many self-employed americans also must be self-insured. thankfully, premiums for medical insurance as well as dental and long-term care insurance are deductible from your taxes. the deduction can be very large, but also saves you by preventing the individual mandate penalty suffered by uninsured taxpayers with the affordable care act known as obamacare. while it's uncertain what will happen with the aca going forward, for tax year 2016 there is a penalty of $695 per adult or 2.5% of household income if you're uninsured, whichever amount is greater.

when the court tries to get ahead of public opinion, it can inflict a major backlash. the most noticeable example is when the court outlawed the death penalty in 1972. although the public's favoring of the death penalty was dropping at the time of the decision, more americans were for it than against it. after the decision, support for the death penalty climbed by about 15 points and states passed measures challenging the court's decision.

if he wins this tuesday, donald j. trump would be, at 70, the oldest president ever elected. but there is much about mr. trump that is always young, and not in a good way. there is something permanently feckless and immature in the man. it can be seen in how he mangles virtually the same words that langston hughes used.

in practice, obamacare's main thrust was a radical centralization of health care. the core of any marketplace is competition and price signals, and these have been nearly entirely obscured across much of the health care system by government mandates that favor inserting third parties between health care providers and patients. obamacare didn't invent these problems, but it did increase them.

they're ignoring something as they cry foul. years of republican rhetoric and policy priorities, leaning heavily on the notion that the free market can determine almost everything, paved the way for this moment: the gop worked for ages to ensure that companies could decide what was best for them. call it cancel culture, or call it the free market reacting, well, freely to events.

to the contrary, time and again, ryan has been an impediment to bipartisan dealmaking, most clearly in refusing to bring a daca fix to the floor. maybe gridlock will occur if democrats take control after november's midterm elections, but they could hardly be less productive than the gop-controlled house. moreover, left to their own devices, it is certainly possible that chuck and nancy [house minority leader nancy pelosi (d-calif.) and senate minority leader charles e. schumer (d-n.y.)] could make deals with trump on daca, infrastructure and even on shoring up the obamacare exchanges. the greatest obstacle to bipartisan legislation is the freedom caucus, which ryan allows to run amok.

perhaps most important, cato's cannon says, is not whether trump could single-handedly undo the health law, but whether he could undermine it enough to force congress to take action. if trump were to do just enough to cause the insurance exchanges to fail, he said, that would put pressure on congress ... to reopen the law.
but the bill came after mandatory across-the-board cuts, known as sequestration, were enacted that slashed defense spending. taking into account the lower levels under the sequester, paul's plan actually increased spending on the military.
as vice president, biden was reportedly reluctant to pursue obamacare. as a senator, he played a key role in writing and passing policies, such as harsh penalties for drug possession, that led to today's criminal justice system that disproportionately punishes minorities. and he backed the iraq war, while obama's opposition to the invasion was a key issue that propelled him ahead of hillary clinton in the 2008 democratic primary.

el problema es que para trump las normas no significan nada. desde un principio dejó muy claro que quería erradicar cualquier rastro de la presencia de obama en el ala oeste. tenía el peor gusto, le dijo trump a un visitante a principios de 2017 mientras presumía sus nuevas cortinas (que no eran muy distintas de las de obama, en opinión de otras personas que entraron al despacho durante ese periodo caótico).

democrats want to nominate someone who will build on obamacare, not scrap it, take on the nra and manufacturers, not protect them, stand up and give the poor a fighting chance and the middle class get restored, not raise their taxes and not keep the promises, biden said, taking aim at sanders' signature plan to move every american to a single government-run health insurance plan and the senator's votes in the early 2000s in favor of protecting gun companies from lawsuits.

just what kind of health insurance do federal judges and supreme court justices have?
collins could face a tough reelection. americans remain deeply divided over impeachment and a host of other hot-button political issues. although collins has carried her state's tradition of political independence in the senate, she has been assailed by her constituents in maine for her vote to confirm supreme court justice brett kavanaugh, despite her self-identification as an abortion-rights supporter. critics to her left have also attacked collins for her opposition to the affordable care act, aka obamacare, and for backing the republican-sponsored tax cut, a measure that liberals criticize as a giveaway to the rich.

look, i have no illusions that under a republican senate and a very right-wing house and an extremely right-wing president of the united states that suddenly we're going to see a medicare-for-all, single-payer passed, sanders told npr at the time. you're not going to see it. that's obvious.

to put it simply, the tax aims to reduce patients' utilization of health care, wrote thea m. lee, the president of the institute and a former leader of the a.f.l.-c.i.o., and the economist josh bivens. but the glaring problem of u.s. health costs is not excess utilization; instead it is high and rising prices for health care. smart cost-containment policy should address these prices, not seek to ratchet down how much care patients seek.
the fate of the entire law, however, remains in the hands of the supreme court. in the latest legal challenge to obamacare brought by republicans, the court will decide whether congress' elimination in 2017 of the penalty imposed on consumers who refuse to buy health insurance invalidates the law.
republicans have been vowing for six years now to repeal the affordable care act. they have voted to do so dozens of times, despite knowing any measures would be vetoed by president obama.

therefore, we recently imposed tariffs on $250 billion of chinese goods — and now our treasury is receiving billions of dollars a month from a country that never gave us a dime. but i don't blame china for taking advantage of us — i blame our leaders and representatives for allowing this travesty to happen. i have great respect for president xi, and we are now working on a new trade deal with china. but it must include real, structural change to end unfair trade practices, reduce our chronic trade deficit, and protect american jobs.
early reports have suggested that insurers were expecting better performance this year, thanks in part to the higher premiums. but insurers are already calculating next year's rates and are supposed to finalize them by the spring. if they are not sure the mandate will be fully enforced next year, they could decide on higher premiums or even more exits from state markets.

americans who do not receive obamacare individual premium subsidies would benefit the most from expanded short-term insurance plans. in plan year 2017, which began in november 2016, there was a 20 percent drop in those who enrolled in obamacare without affordable care act (aca) without obamacare subsidies. in six states, unsubsidized obamacare enrollment dropped by more than 40 percent, including a 73 percent drop in arizona.

ms. abrams was elected to the general assembly in 2006, two years after republicans had taken control of the georgia house for the first time in more than a century. she was young, but not green. she had served as student president at spelman college, atlanta's storied african-american women's college, and kept her life ambitions, eventually including the goal of becoming president, listed in a spreadsheet. the sheer boldness of my ambitions gnawed at me, she recalled in her 2018 autobiography, minority leader: how to lead from the outside and make real change.

democrats will also have the majority in the house next year. democratic leader nancy pelosi, the presumptive speaker of the house of the incoming congress, said that the house will move swiftly to formally intervene in the appeals process to uphold the life-saving protections for people with pre-existing conditions and reject republicans' effort to destroy the affordable care act. this resolution would allow the house general counsel to defend the health care law on the chamber's behalf.
she said different women were there for different reasons but they were all there to make sure that their core american values are going to be protected and i think many people like me were there for positive reasons. and i think the president shares debbie dingell's views that there were people that came to the mall as they do all the time, sometimes in smaller numbers...

that doesn't necessarily mean they'd prefer a presidential candidate who prioritized obamacare over medicare-for-all; some respondents might be recognizing the reality that trump, his rhetoric aside, almost certainly wouldn't sign such a bill into law. as noted above, primary candidates are also in the business of pushing the envelope, often with hopes of at least improving existing legislation even if not achieving a more extreme policy goal.
pressed by sen. sherrod brown, d-ohio, on whether hhs's anticipated move to allow states to impose work requirements for able-bodied medicaid recipients would hurt those suffering from mental illness or substance abuse disorder, azar said he doesn't have a definition of able-bodied. but throughout the hearing he expressed the importance of tackling the nation's opioid epidemic.
three political appointees at justice, along with one other career lawyer, ended up signing onto the federal government's brief. in court, they will square off against lawyers from states more supportive of the law and who have agreed to defend it.
insofar as we're maintaining an environment in which prices are lower for products because people are poorly paid, i think that that's a real ethical concern for any society, he said.
the court had been set to hear oral arguments in a major case involving trump's funding of his wall on the u.s.-mexico border and trump-era asylum policies – both of which evaporated with biden's win. the court also batted aside a question about whether trump's business ties violated the constitution's anti-corruption clauses, and it has been sitting on emergency filings involving his tax returns.
our preference is to make this important work bipartisan, to include input, ideas, and revisions from our republican colleagues or bipartisan efforts to do the same. but if our republican colleagues decide to oppose this urgent and necessary legislation, we will have to move forward without them, schumer said on the senate floor thursday.
mccain was highly regarded by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for both his bipartisan approach to negotiation, his six-term service in congress and his military service -- where he served in vietnam and was held prisoner and tortured for more than five years.
but let's check our numbers again. there are 209.3 million americans aged 25 and older, according to the 2014 census, and 142.4 million of them have not attained a bachelor's degree or higher. that's 68% of americans, not 74%.
bash: and up next, democratic senator, tim kaine, joins me for a very different perspective on what's needed to win the war on isis.
he might have added that if someone is addicted to drugs and cannot find treatment, or working two jobs but missing their kids' lives, or commuting for hours because housing prices are too high and public transportation is not available, that person is not very free, either.
it is take two for the president's big infrastructure promise. or, to be more exact, take one will wait until year two.
gabbard: ...were not only for the leadership of some of these more moderate muslim and arab countries but also for the people there to be able to support those actions.
what old men know, too, is that all that is gained can be lost. lost just as the liberation that the civil war and emancipation brought was squandered after reconstruction, by a white america grown morally weary, or bent on revenge. lost as the gains of our labor unions have been for decades now, pushed back until so many of us stand alone in the workplace, before unfettered corporate power. lost as the vote is being lost by legislative chicanery. lost as so many powerful interests would have us lose the benefits of the social welfare state, privatize social security, and annihilate obamacare altogether.
tyler: well, ted cruz has said over and over again he likes donald trump. he has not returned the invective. in fact, he never has. lots of people called him lots of names, because he doesn't want to get along with washington. he wants to change washington. but he never returns it in kind. so i think that speaks to the character of ted cruz.

8. thomas bossert, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism. last week's ranking: ―
so it's not -- it's not just other countries, but within existing trade deals, we can figure out is there a trade dispute that can be settled with the wto, is there a revision to one of the existing trade treaties that we have now? but there's a lot that can be done. there are things that congress can update to make sure that we're importing and exporting more to benefit american businesses.
i've got to tell you when i got -- when i realized that, when i was done playing and i looked back on that, i think about these guys that are -- they've got four-year degree from bu and they've got a journalism degree and they're standing in front of a kid who's 21 years old, doesn't speak english from the dominican and he's making $15 million a year and they're taking home, you know, $1,500.00 a month after tax or whatever and there was some bitterness. you can always see in the writing.
some economists worry about a death spiral of rising costs in the absence of a mechanism, like the individual mandate, that forces healthy americans to get covered, since healthier people buying coverage keeps costs down for sick people. that's one issue. another is the limited coverage options available to americans in rural and remote parts of the country. and in the mostly republican-led states where elected leaders have declined to expand medicaid eligibility, many residents fall in a coverage gap, earning just enough income that they don't qualify for subsidies.
what's more, several arguments that might be used against the idea of creating a single-payer plan spurred sharp opposition to the proposal. that it guarantees coverage and would eliminate out-of-pocket costs was popular; that taxes might increase and delays might increase were not. (note that some of these arguments would themselves be contested.)
use it — and lose it coverage
john p. walters, director of the white house office of national drug control policy during the george w. bush administration, said that after two years and a presidential commission to study the problem, the trump administration is still struggling to confront the deadliest drug crisis in u.s. history and is not dedicating nearly enough federal resources.
as harvard law school professor michael klarman has noted, many of the larger social changes inflicted by the court only occurred when public opinion on the issue changed. he points to brown v. board of education coming after the desegregation of the military, civil service and baseball. polling at the time indicated that a majority of americans were for the decision. when it came to same-sex marriage, the supreme court only legalized it when public opinion shifted in its favor.
donald trump has promised not only to be the voice of the american people, but also to take decisive, immediate action. as president, he has said he would move fast to destroy the islamic state, scrap bad trade deals, build that wall, stop the gangs and the violence, and stop the drugs from pouring into our communities. he would immediately suspend immigration from countries where terrorism is rampant. he might even defy treaty obligations and decline to aid nato allies.
we have seen the attacks in france, in belgium, in germany and all over the world.
indicated right from the start that there were not existing legal authorities from 2001 and 2002 that would justify this action and as soon as we decided to engage in a war on isil, and that's what the administration has called it.
after reading gary abernathy's latest paean to the president, i am not sure which is worse: that he is the editor of a news publication or that he was invited to meet with graduate students at the columbia journalism school in new york.
what's the big idea: supreme court justice anthony kennedy announced his retirement this week. many believe this vacancy will allow president donald trump to appoint a justice who is against roe and could be part of a majority to overturn it.
the congress has 10 days left to pass a bill that will fund our government, protect our homeland, and secure our southern border.
i can't even imagine a world like that, said greta mayer, who runs the mental health & recovery board of clark, greene and madison counties in ohio. all of what we've gained would be lost.
you're the one who can save the republican party, the 85-year-old, alice vanderwaart, called out when she was close enough.
spicer: i -- i think if there's a way that we can combat isis with any country, whether it's russia or anyone else, and we have a shared national interest in that, sure we'll take it.
not only that, but in many cases you're seeing these -- the rates go up 10, 15, 20, 30, 50 percent. that's not what they were promised either. and so what i think the president's doing -- and it's not just -- i think he's gotten bipartisan support for this.
and replace the affordable care act with what? the trump administration has yet to announce a solution. instead of coming together with democrats to find a solution, the trump administration is just going to leave millions with no coverage? wish i could say i was surprised.
cornish: so is there a real sense of what the impact would be, in terms of what this means for businesses or their workers?
it is precisely because we need a party willing to exercise its oversight responsibilities, including the subpoena power, that ending republicans' majority is a critical corrective action to restore democratic norms. ryan has it backwards: the system — of constitutional government and checks and balances — is currently shut down thanks to republicans, who time and again have put party before country.
david mcintosh, president of the conservative group club for growth, recalled a conversation with cruz last week in which he said the texan's message was we're making progress; hang tight and you'll be happy with the final product.

stone: they were looking at premiums costing the rest of them $400 to $600 a month and deductibles of more than $6,000 per person. and they just decided, you know, it's not worth it.
some struggle to pay premiums, while others decide not to get insurance altogether. those problems are likely to get even worse next year, because the 2017 republican tax bill eliminated the penalty for people who don't get insurance. without that penalty in place, healthy people are less likely to get insurance, causing premiums to rise.
but they're finding it tough to start those conversations. when they do, they're not sure what to say, according to a national poll released thursday.
i am not going to support continuing this fiasco for 30 more days by voting for a continuing resolution, graham said thursday, though late friday he was pushing for a three-week stopgap measure he said he would be able to support. it's time congress stop the cycle of dysfunction, grow up and act consistent with the values of a great nation, graham also said thursday.
and in june, he introduced legislation eliminating the use of cash bail, which a press release from his office noted disproportionately affects black, latinx and native american people.
the only thing he could do to piss me off is to stop being trump, said innis, arguing that, with an immense sense of brilliance and strategy trump picked mike pence as his vice president precisely for those who wanted political vanilla. if [trump] isn't that non-nonsense pit bull that he is, then i would be upset. then i'd be like, 'ummm. we don't want that.'
but ― as huffpost's jeffrey young pointed out on sunday ― most people facing increases will be able to switch to cheaper plans, and of course millions will get tax credits that amount to huge discounts. that's little consolation to the millions who don't get big tax credits, but, as a recent analysis from the urban institute pointed out, on average the plans the law makes available are not more expensive than the ones employers provide employees. if anything, they are a little cheaper.
if we're talking about which health care reform plans are serious about attacking cost, providing universal coverage and making sure everyone has access to health care, medicare for all is the only reasonable answer. no other plan does this effectively, which is why i suspect that the center for american progress has not come out with spending estimates. basic economic tenets tell us that their plan will not reduce health care spending as effectively.
california governor gavin newsom's first act in office was to propose extending state healthcare benefits to more illegal aliens.
for clinton and her supporters, the solution is more of the same.
our individual commercial business ended the year with improved results, aetna's chief executive, mark bertolini, said monday during an earnings conference call. despite our improved finish, this business remained unprofitable in 2015, and we continue to have serious concerns about the sustainability of the public exchanges.
on saturday, bannon further grilled the gop establishment and called out mcconnell by name.
that means it's time to roll out the scare tactics. we understand some people may be thinking through their choice of coverage, but going without health insurance is a serious gamble that can be catastrophic if wrong, argued health and human services spokesman ben wakana.
jane schacter: that depends on who will be deciding cases in the future.
no one can doubt that, if elected, biden would be eager to play a central role in the resumption of the battle against global warming.

the magazine's warnings have clearly gone unheeded by much of the republican rank and file. but the review is still at it. earlier this month, it published an incendiary essay by kevin williamson, one of its most reliably provocative writers, titled chaos in the family, chaos in the state: the white working class's dysfunction.
again this week, we have almost no idea what bannon did, beyond making marks on his white (supremacy) board. whatever he did, he's a disgraceful bigot.
levin: she gave -- that's right, a state-controlled company and also it is she and the dnc that funneled money through a law firm and so forth to a foreign ex-spy who worked with the russians.
but when you're constantly getting told that can't be true, we doubt that you can do this, this won't happen, and that's the narrative when you turn on television every single day, it's a little frustrating.
outside central park in manhattan, thousands of flag-waving protesters lined up. many in the crowd chanted no ban, no wall. the trump regime has got to fall. they held aloft signs saying uphold the constitution now and impeach the liar.
the bill would have ended the law's medicaid expansion and subsidies and would eliminate the tax increases imposed under the law. the legislation would also cut federal funding for planned parenthood.

wacky jacky is campaigning with pocahontas, you believe this? in your state! can you believe this? trump said at the nevada gop convention. when you see that, that's not the senator you want.
in the private dealings of his family business, trump's decision-making went unquestioned – at least publicly. but the presidency is ruled by a different calculus, one its new resident, three weeks into his four year term, is struggling to command.

it doesn't mean insurers have to cover all treatments associated with gender transitioning but they just can't outright deny them either. but the rule doesn't go far enough in clarifying what is discrimination, some say.

[democrats see opportunity for gains at the state level.]
senator bernie sanders took a lot of criticism from his fellow candidates in last week's presidential debate over his health care plan. so sanders used a recent campaign trip to nevada to defend his medicare for all proposal. npr's scott detrow was there. and just a quick note, this story has an exchange that some listeners might find disturbing.
cruz is wrong that the u.s. used carpet bombing in the first persian gulf war. to do so would have been a war crime.
a case scheduled for mid-november could grant an opportunity for a court with a new conservative majority to fire a torpedo into obamacare, the democrats charged — and barrett herself embodies that weapon.
but one difference between the fight over the affordable care act versus abortion was that on the aca, most of the battle was in congress ― and getting rid of gop members who wanted to repeal the law. but on abortion, much of the fight rests with the supreme court, symbolized by the fact that the protest was on the steps of the institution tuesday.

trump acknowledged he was caught off guard by the latest gop defections.
republicans say, however, that if obamacare were repealed, it would be replaced by a better plan that would still cover preexisting conditions.
levin: well is this why they don't, at this point now, they want open borders. they don't even talk about national sovereignty. would they actually have us surrender our form of representation to international organizations?
when you say washington's the problem, he's probably talking about us, and that's not really well received.
but those non-compliant plans, often called skinny or junk plans, don't offer better health care. a consumer could buy one only to discover the plan does not cover health services they need, such as maternity care, mental health care, prescription drugs and preexisting conditions.
but the sanders campaign in particular is using a lot of out-of-state volunteers, as well as in-state volunteers, to go back and redouble up their effort here. the specter of 2008 is not hanging over them. a tiny specter of 2004 is hanging over them. that was howard dean. we famously saw him crash in the iowa caucuses.
the team of reporters, researchers and editors across cnn selected key statements and rated them: true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it's complicated.
trump complained about his comments in a closed-door meeting being leaked and lashed out against the news media as totally bonkers:
o'rourke's tour of the state has garnered large crowds nearly everywhere he goes. he has also raised $10 million in the second quarter, compared to cruz's $4 million. the cook political report has even rated the texas senate race as lean republican, which means they don't believe it is a lock for cruz.
trump has made abortion and, more broadly, women's health care and women's rights, to be an issue in 2020, planned parenthood president leana wen told huffpost. he was the one who, during the state of the union, lied, deliberately spreading misinformation about abortion care and women's health care. he's the one who has made this a campaign issue. and we say: bring it on.

several plans — one co-designed by darity, a proposal from new jersey sen. cory booker, another outline from sanders — also would provide wages much higher than the federal minimum wage (currently $7.25) and benefits that are unheard of for many current low-wage workers.
notably, in an era of hotly partisan politics, kavanaugh has said that it's important not to be a partisan when one becomes a judge. check those political allegiances at the door when you become a judge, kavanaugh said in 2015 in a speech at catholic university's law school.
our president has betrayed israel, rubio said at a march 5, 2016 rally in florida. on my first day in office, i'm going to cancel the iran deal, he said two days later.
the less generous plans that verma and the trump administration are touting, and that monday's rule change will favor, frequently leave beneficiaries exposed to catastrophic costs if they get seriously sick or injured, precisely because they leave out benefits that people need when they have serious medical problems. often, the buyers of these plans aren't even aware of the limits until it's too late, because deciphering the fine print of these plans is so difficult.
republican lawmakers have pushed many repeal measures since 2010, when obama signed the health care program into law. this was the first of those bills to clear congress and reach his desk.
that brought a strong rebuke from the powerful aarp, which was an outspoken aca supporter. although no one believes the current health care system is perfect, this harmful legislation would make health care less secure and less affordable, said a statement from the group.
still in a tight race with sanders, hillary clinton has sought to portray him as an unrealistic idealist and herself as more grounded.
fear is a constant, he said, and these days many of his friends who don't have papers stay close to home. so, he said, gesturing to an extra bag of groceries from today's food pantry, he does what he can to help them out.
senate democrats stood firm in refusing to vote for a stopgap measure without an agreement for long-term increases in military and domestic spending and a pathway to citizenship for roughly 700,000 immigrants. those are individuals who are in the country illegally after being brought here as children and are enrolled in the deferred action for childhood arrivals program established by the obama administration. those protections from deportation are set to begin expiring in march after the trump administration announced it was rescinding daca last year.
sen. joe manchin is an endangered species: the last statewide democrat standing in west virginia, which voted for mr. trump by over 40 percentage points. if anywhere can truly be defined as trump country, it is west virginia, where formerly democratic gov. jim justice switched to the republican party in 2017 at a rally mr. trump.
some cruz associates said that opposing a repeal bill would be very difficult for him to defend with his political base as he gears up for reelection in 2018, and that he has come under pressure from donors to collaborate more with his gop colleagues. at the same time, some conservative activists are hoping that cruz can help move the bill to the right.

the incumbent is facing democratic rep. jacky rosen, who was first elected in 2016 in a district that mr. trump won. however, rosen lacks name recognition across the state. early polling shows a tight race, with different polls showing either candidate ahead by one percentage point or less.
the vice president attacked the democratic challenger for not revealing his positions on issues such as obamacare.
eighty-five percent of those folks actually receive tax credits or subsidies and for them that insulates them from these changes, she said.

i have not. no. i've heard of it, but i have not read.
as controversy still rages over his administration's handling of immigrant families at the southern border, trump said he sees the issue as immigration as a winner for republicans in the midterms.
these plans typically cover a lot less than the sorts of plans available through the affordable care act. they may have weak coverage of prescriptions, if they have any at all, and leave out mental health altogether. usually they do not cover pre-existing conditions and are often not available to people who have them.
in the interview he gave during that trip to his district in western north carolina, meadows explained how so many people come to washington, dc, and forget why they were elected in the first place—but how he wanted to be different.

in 2017, the first year of the trump presidency, a record 28,869 people died from synthetic-opioid-related overdoses, a 46.4 percent increase from the year before. most were from fentanyl, which is 50 times more powerful than heroin. estimates for the first eight months of 2018, the most recent available, show that an additional 20,537 americans died — a toll on pace to exceed the previous year's.
the university of illinois springfield is hosting a sanctuary healthcare event on february 13, to promote healthcare for all, including illegal immigrants.
bash: and on that note, you know, we've been hearing so much talk over the past couple of years about the fact that you've got to have a strong leader in the region to do the things that you just talked about. now, unfortunately because of what happened to the jordanian pilot, you have the king of jordan now being able to rally his people.
but going toe-to-toe in a televised standoff with the president may have helped seal the deal. she corrected the president – please don't characterize the strength that i bring to this meeting as the leader of the house democrats, who just won a big victory – and she left that meeting in shades and a flaming red power coat, making her a social media celebrity.
justice kennedy has had outsize importance on lgbt rights, writing majority opinions in all the signal decisions issued by the court in the last two decades. and now he has written masterpiece, which in part protects those decisions. what will happen if he leaves the court?
single-payer groups and activists are reflexively suspicious of primus after the intercept revealed that he had spoken to insurance executives and laid out his own objections to medicare for all.
there's nothing that says a state legislature can't come in and pass legislation, says zepecki. it's a long standing norm in this country to respect the will of elections and move on to the next legislative session.
the secretary of state arrived in cairo:
moreover, in 2010, the aca began requiring all insurers to allow young adults up to age 25 to enroll in a parent's health plan. most analysts generally accept that the number of people who gained insurance because of the provision is 2.3 million.
sasse agreed and lamented what he called the absorption of civics by politics, which he said has brought washington to the point where parties' need to win has subsumed a prior consensus about the rules and expectations of governance.
definitely, it's a dog whistle embedded, he said.
i think you can't cave. that's what the democrats don't understand — it's all or nothing, said trump ally rep. mark meadows (r-n.c.), a leader of the house freedom caucus. the democrats think that we're about ready to fold. i think republicans think that democrats are ready to fold, and neither of those two things are accurate by any stretch of the imagination.
if you want to know what an actual punk rock sellout looks like, i give you henry rollins, the vandals legend who endorsed … obamacare.
campaign ads attacking president donald trump's administration for trying to sabotage obamacare are already popping up in congressional races.
other republican senators, however, indicated they would back the proposal.
mr. trump also said tuesday night that biden has agreed to a bernie sanders-style health care plan. if you look at what they (democrats) want to do, where they have socialized medicine, they will get rid of pre-existing conditions.
in houston, at the epiphany community health outreach services, a local nonprofit that works with the immigrant community, snap enrollment dropped by a third compared with this time last year. meanwhile, participation in the food pantry program increased 266 percent, according to the center.
to me that the takeaway from this report is that the affordable care act is serving as the safety net it was intended to be, says sabrina corlette, co-director of the center on health insurance reforms at georgetown university. of course, the ultimate irony is it's performing this function at a time when the trump administration is arguing before the supreme court that it should be struck down.
trump told fox news' peter doocy of impeachment: it's a ridiculous, horrible partisan, situation. we won 196 to nothing in the house. at the event in michigan, he said, we won 196 to nothing on a little vote a couple of weeks ago.
every time that donald trump attacks congress,10,000 of his voters decide to vote for the democrats, luntz said. every time trump attacks the democrats in congress, they do exactly the opposite.
an answer barrett gave at her confirmation hearing, when the issue of the affordable care act came up repeatedly, suggests that she too has a traditional view on severability.
since there is little prospect of serious health care reform – possibly with the exception of a bipartisan bid to lower the cost of drugs – in the current divided government in washington, health care is sure to dominate the 2020 campaign.
biden withdrew his support for the hyde amendment, which blocks federal funding for abortion in most cases. he backed codifying the right to an abortion as a backstop in case the newly reconfigured supreme court overturns or eviscerates roe v. wade.
the idea of repealing section 230 of the communications decency act, a provision that trump and his acolytes — such as sen. ted cruz (r-tex.) — have repeatedly railed against, could very well lead to increased scrutiny of right-wingers on the internet. now, under the law, social media companies aren't treated as traditional publishers, thus they are offered protection from lawsuits related to content posted by their users and leeway to make good faith efforts at restricting content they deem obscene, violent or harassing. removing section 230 could increase the chances that these companies would be exposed to greater liability, potentially motivating them to more tightly restrict content that defames, incites or otherwise violates laws that apply to traditional media such as newspapers.
j.c. scott, advamed's head of government affairs, said, what we have seen from past experience is that it comes out of funding for product development, research and the jobs associated with those things. we fear we will see employment freezes or reductions and a slowdown in the pipeline for medical innovation.

are those the voters watching on debate night? perhaps. but it's more likely sanders will speak reach these people on the trail, or through door knocking and phone banking. still, sanders needs those committed democrats watching every debate night closely. can he win them over with a winning debate performance? he hasn't had any major flubs yet on stage, so if they haven't come to him now, will they ever?

the legislative effort comes as there are multiple standalone bills in congress aimed at revising smaller pieces of the country's immigration system -- and the administration has said they'd leave it up to congress whether it passes a standalone bill or break it up into multiple pieces. senate majority whip dick durbin, an illinois democrat, and sen. lindsey graham, a south carolina republican, for example, have reintroduced their dream act, which would provide a path to citizenship for immigrants who came to the country illegally as children.
to accomplish this, insurers that cover abortion pay for those services with separate spending accounts, filled only with premiums they have received directly from individuals. in theory, the same workaround would (or could be made to) apply to the money insurers get from alexander-collins.
you might view the dust-up over the national review pieces as conservatives fighting over where the line in the sand between real americans and everybody else rightly belongs. the establishment view seems pretty clear: those who reach for government handouts need not apply. but huge swaths of white, working-class americans seem to see things differently this election cycle: real americans — like them — deserve help, and everyone else needs to shape up or ship out.
the only significant change to the law that's been made during trump's presidency is a repeal of the mandate that people have coverage. it is now the case that a fifth of those younger than 25 and more than a quarter of those who make less than $25,000 a year don't.
his tax credit more than doubled to $664 a month, and he found a policy that would cost him, after that subsidy, about $150 a month. and his deductible was lower, too.

-- sen. kamala harris (d-calif.) is reportedly tentatively planning to announce her 2020 campaign over mlk weekend in oakland, the city where she was born and began her legal career. from kcbs radio's doug sovern: even though harris has alluded to a 2020 presidential campaign in interviews to promote her new memoir, aides said before the book rollout began that no formal announcement about her political future is expected before the first wave of the book tour concludes later this month. but several sources with knowledge of her plans said she has in fact decided to run, with the enthusiastic blessing of her husband and two stepchildren. the debate within her camp has been how, and where, to launch her campaign. a person close to harris denied the report to politico, saying that no final decision has been made but that it won't be in oakland on mlk weekend.
hillary clinton believes very strongly that fbi director james comey cost her the election with his two announcements during the run-up to nov. 8, and she's angry that he did not publicly discuss evidence of russian interference on behalf of trump. comey's decisions to discuss the clinton probe publicly are currently being investigated by the justice department inspector general. at a white house reception on sunday, trump literally embraced comey. he's become more famous than me, the president said.
between the subsidies the people are getting, the continued strong enrollment, generally, and the fact we haven't seen a significant drop off in the young adult age range -- those are the signs we're not really seeing a death spiral yet, cox said.
however, the trump administration believes the provision of the aca guaranteeing affordable rates to those with pre-existing conditions must be thrown out with the individual mandate.
the obama administration initially said it wanted to enroll seven million americans in the new marketplaces by the end of the six-month open enrollment period, aligning its goals with nonpartisan projections about the marketplace's popularity. yet when the marketplaces opened for enrollment in october, the significant technical problems with healthcare.gov and some state-based obamacare websites seriously slowed down the process.
peter suderman, reason.com: by all appearances, the trump administration is taking a political position for political purposes, ignoring the strongest legal arguments in the process. it is a selective approach to enforcing the law, in which the executive branch has simply declined to defend a statute it doesn't like that was passed under a rival administration. that decision could have significant implications for future administrations from either party, and they would not be good: administrations should not be in the business of picking and choosing which laws to enforce or defend.
this is always the problem for republicans. making insurance available to everybody typically requires some combination of government spending, taxes and regulations. and these are not things republicans want to do.
voters in maine have easily approved a referendum to expand medicaid for low-income adults, doing an end-run around republican gov. paul lepage, who vetoed the move — a key element of obamacare.

two massive scandals the corrupt media cannot hide
sanders said president trump is calling on congress to pass a measure that would replace the affordable care act, which is also known as obamacare. mr. trump, who campaigned on repealing the aca, said in a tweet that congress must act.
the timing seemed fortuitous because it was right before the 10-year anniversary of the affordable care act's signing, a milestone he planned to mark by attending a conference and celebration at american university nearby. then the pandemic hit, forcing it to be canceled, which felt somehow appropriate given that the law continues to inspire mixed feelings. approval of the program is higher than in the past, according to polls, but it's still lower than cherished programs like medicare and social security.
— the american college of physicians, the second-largest physician group in the country, for the first time says it supports a single-payer health-care approach, modern healthcare's rachel cohrs reports.
the bill would also need to be approved by the senate before becoming law.
responding to the threatening statements directed at associate justices brett kavanaugh and neil gorsuch on wednesday by sen. chuck schumer, d-n.y., trump said the comments amounted to a call for physical violence.
a house republican explained his awkward reaction to his democratic colleagues' applause for their funding bills:
via cbs news campaign reporter jack turman hawaii representative tulsi gabbard, who memorably dinged california senator kamala harris at a debate earlier this year, went on the attack against elizabeth warren in the last debate. gabbard has redirected her focus to hillary clinton since then, a response to the former democratic nominee's insinuation that the dovish congresswoman is a favorite of the russians. gabbard's campaign lawyer released a letter to clinton, who recently indicated that she could still run for president, saying that she defamed gabbard and demanded a retraction. will gabbard try to criticize warren again and will she continue to go after clinton?

sen. ron wyden (d-ore.) and rep. frank pallone jr. (d-n.j.) sent a letter to the department of health and human service's office of inspector general, saying the tennessee proposal would create an incentive for the state to reduce benefits. they asked the watchdog to monitor the center for medicare & medicaid services' approach to the waiver to ensure that medicaid funds are used for their statutory purpose of furnishing medical assistance to low-income individuals.
-- karen tumulty explains why trump is being short-sighted: trump allies — and adversaries — had hoped that with his inauguration, he would leave behind the hyperbolic reality-show culture that made him a celebrity. in the late stages of his presidential campaign, trump had disavowed his years-long promotion of the racially tainted falsehood that barack obama … was born outside the united states and therefore an illegitimate president. but the first days of his presidency show that, for trump, old reflexes are hard to break. veterans of previous white houses say they can recall no precedent for what trump and his top aides are doing [and] worry about the implications of this untethering from the truth … 'i don't think he realizes how much he is hurting himself,' [said former bush strategist matthew dowd]. then again, trump may well believe that this is the style which brought him to the white house, in defiance of every expectation. americans knew what they were getting when they elected him.
levin: and i want to thank you for coming on the program.
gingrich: well, a large part of his holdings are trump golf clubs, trump hotels. i mean, we have never quite had anyone of this scale to occupy the white house. and it's going to require us to think about - how do you deal with this in a way that's effective and that serves the interests of the country but also meets some kind of practical, common-sense test?
both romneycare and obamacare infringe upon individual freedom and exponentially increase the government's healthcare cost burden, he said. romneycare has, in fact, not made healthcare better or saved costs in massachusetts. it's done just the opposite. this is not a failure of execution, but a lack of foresight on governor romney's part to understand the implications of his policy proposals. we need leaders who believe in the american people again, not the power of government to solve our problems.
merkley 'keeping the option open': oregon sen. jeff merkley told local radio station koin he is keeping the option open for a potential 2020 run – but that his planned march 24 trip to new hampshire doesn't mean he's in. my main focus is the fight for 51, to get a democratic majority in the senate that can stop some of the worst of trump's policies and also the packing of the courts, merkley said.

this isn't a health-care plan that helps you if you need health care. not when it would give you higher premiums, higher deductibles and worse coverage. no, this is a health-care plan that only helps you if you're wealthy and have a lot of investment income. it would cut the tax on capital gains, interest and dividends from 23.8 to 20 percent for households making $250,000 or more. other than that, you're out of luck — and maybe out of being insured. indeed, the cbo estimates that the senate bill's $1.1 trillion of cuts to health insurance spending would result in 22 million fewer people having insurance in 10 years' time. all so that the top 2 percent of households, who are the only ones really getting ahead in today's economy, can have 2 percent more money after taxes.
is she ok? a stern-faced trump inquired multiple times, in addition to calling for a doctor and demanding his aides get the woman a glass of water.
republicans managed to repeal obamacare's individual mandate through the historic tax cuts and jobs act, however, obamacare's medical device tax will take effect in the new year.
another major american healthcare provider is signaling that it is likely to pull out of the obamacare markets in 2018 if its financial position continues to deteriorate.

but among iowa's three gop-held house seats, democrats like their odds better in the 1st congressional district, which includes dubuque and cedar rapids, and the 3rd, which includes the des moines metropolitan area. sanders' campaign did not reach out to the campaigns of abby finkenauer, the democrat running in the 1st, or cindy axne, the nominee in the 3rd. while finkenauer does not appear with out-of-state democrats, axne welcomed sen. kamala harris (d-calif.) to a campaign rally on monday.

president trump attributed strong job growth to companies coming back during a news conference on jan. 4. (the washington post)
that would include four cases involving obama's signature health care law — two in which the court upheld the statute against potentially fatal challenges, and two in which it overturned or questioned regulations requiring that religious objectors offer insurance coverage for contraceptives.
there's great demand that we're concerned about not being able to meet in the future, said burnette.
buttigieg — like sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) and sen. cory booker (d-n.j.) — is comfortable talking about faith in the context of his public views. warren likes to quote matthew 25 ('i was hungry and you gave me food. i was thirsty and you gave me water, i was in prison and you visited me. naked and you clothed me. and as much as you have done it to one of these, the least of thy brethren, you have done it unto me.') buttigieg says, living your faith might also have to do with paying more attention to those most in need and not celebrating those who already have the most wealth and the most power.

asked about trump's proposals to ban muslims or build a border wall without congressional approval, house speaker paul ryan (r-wisc.) said last month that he would sue any president that exceeds his or her powers.
in fact, the supreme court ruled the individual mandate was constitutional. in a 5-4 opinion on june 28, 2012, chief justice john roberts wrote that the penalty — as it was described in the affordable care act — is actually a tax collected by the irs, and it is within congressional powers to impose new taxes.
bossert is in charge of defending americans against violence ― not lavishing praise on trump when he broadcasts a violent revenge fantasy against our country's free press. disgraceful.
sponsors of private employer plans, through which roughly half of all americans get insurance, could once again impose annual or lifetime limits on benefits, since it's the affordable care act that made such limits illegal. that could really hammer patients with rare forms of cancer or congenital conditions, such as hemophilia, for which treatments can easily exceed $1 million per year or sometimes even per month.
but that's wrong. according to most recent internal revenue service data (statistics of income), for 2016, 4.95 million taxpayers made the payment, at an average cost of $732. that's a decline from the year before, when nearly 6.67 million taxpayers made payments at an average cost of $462. the penalty had been increasing, but effective jan. 1, 2019, the tax bill signed by president trump set the penalty at zero. (the mandate has not been eliminated.)
justice ruth bader ginsburg underwent non-surgical treatment for acute cholecystitis, a benign gallbladder condition, this afternoon at johns hopkins hospital in baltimore, maryland, the supreme court said in a statement. following oral arguments on monday, the justice underwent outpatient tests at sibley memorial hospital in washington, d.c., that confirmed she was suffering from a gallstone that had migrated to her cystic duct, blocking it and causing an infection. the justice is resting comfortably and plans to participate in the oral argument teleconference tomorrow morning remotely from the hospital. she expects to stay in the hospital for a day or two.
mientras que trump en ocasiones ha instado a no lastimar a los manifestantes, también ha sugerido repetidamente que los manifestantes deberían ser manejados de manera más brusca.
some of the career people there, respectfully, should be really excited to finally have an administration who cares enough to try to break the back of the worst drug crisis in our nation's history, conway said.
but when virginia gov. ralph northam (d) weighed in on the controversial virginia measure, he turned the focus from the protection of abortion rights in general to the debate over late-term abortion. annie and ariana report that while abortion opponents routinely try to turn the conversation to late abortions, abortion rights advocates often keep their focus on early, more accepted procedures. the debate about the new bills sought in multiple states proceeded along those lines, until the explosion of attention to northam's comments.
but you have a great array of option. and the congress appears to be exploring that. i think impeachment is the one that i would caution people not to look to in favor of some of these other options. i testified in the clinton impeachment, i represented the last judge impeached, it's not a road you want to go down unless there's any other option.
for weeks, reporters pressed him on using the defense production act to ramp up production of much-needed medical supplies before the president took action. he also claimed the virus would go from 15 cases down to zero quickly, and has insisted that the virus will eventually disappear. he has also been slow to embrace social distancing measures and practices like wearing a mask that scientists have encouraged to arrest the spread of covid-19.
i think what strikes me about this particular episode is that - again, the catastrophic tones people are using about it. we've had waves of refugees come to our shores throughout our history as late as april. some come ashore. some get granted asylum - about 22 percent in this last wave. and we're a big country, and we can handle a lot of people. and the idea that this is some existential threat seems to me completely overblown. it's an issue that we can deal with. but the way it's being portrayed as some out-of-control situation is just out of proportion to what's actually happening.
three republicans are vying to become the republican candidate for senate: rep. martha mcsally, the choice of the party establishment, conservative firebrand dr. kelli ward, and former maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio. arpaio, who recently received a presidential pardon, will likely leech votes away from ward, a former state senator who ran in the republican primary against sen. john mccain in 2016.
is it a farce? it probably is, but no one wants to say that, this person said, on the condition of anonymity.
warren was leading in polls in new hampshire just a few weeks ago. then she started a feud with sanders, claiming he had told her in private that a female candidate couldn't defeat president trump in the november election – a claim sanders strongly denied.
bloomberg also doubled down on his opposition to medicare for all and a wealth tax.

she went on to say that trump has insulted women and members of other communities throughout the campaign.
and let's not forget the non-stop anxiety with our southern border constantly under siege by waves and waves of illegal immigrants, a problem trump is a long way from solving, but thanks to his diplomatic work with mexico and the border wall, this is also improving.
sanders gained more and more momentum in november, december and january. he won new hampshire and nevada, while essentially tying buttigieg atop the muddled iowa caucuses.
for example, it doesn't include much to benefit middle-income recipients of long-term care and their families, howard gleckman, senior fellow at the urban institute, recently wrote for forbes. these are the millions of people who are not poor enough to be eligible for medicaid, but do not have sufficient resources to purchase assistance on their own, he said.
but it is not a consensus position in the party. some moderates support the current program, especially for children and people with disabilities. in addition, many gop governors took the federal government's offer in the aca of near-complete federal funding to expand medicaid to nondisabled, working-age adults, and they are worried about the impact on their residents and their budgets if the expansion goes away and the program's funding is restricted.
the decision doesn't affect people currently insured in the aca marketplaces or those who have just signed up for 2019 coverage. ultimately, however, if the ruling holds it would dismantle the entire law -- that includes many of the popular aca components such as protections for people with preexisting conditions, mandated coverage of essential health benefits and zero-cost preventive care. medicaid expansion coverage under the aca would also be in jeopardy.
i think we're making progress on daca, but i think it's unrealistic to think there's going to be a solution in the next five days, short said.

another [limitation] is that we looked at cardiovascular diseases as a whole, so we sort of lumped everything together: heart attack, stroke, arrhythmias, et cetera. because any one cause of death causes very few deaths in individual counties, which was our level of analysis, we're not able to say which specific disease is responsible for these changes, he said.
in that context, this new $6 billion infusion is the best indication yet that lawmakers and policy wonks are serious about making opioid abuse a top issue.

the ruling does not represent as big a threat to the health care law as two previous conservative challenges swatted down by the supreme court in 2012 and 2015. the first would have gutted the law; the second would have eliminated tax credits in many states.
a man at the entrance of baltimore's penn-north metro station in april snorts fentanyl, according to the man who gave it to him, from a credit card. he was standing a few feet from where members of a nonprofit, bmore power, were handing out free doses of narcan, an opioid reversal medication. the man was asked for his name but did not provide it.
there are also an estimated 17 million people already uninsured but eligible for marketplace coverage, according to a recent study from the kaiser family foundation. that study found that more than a quarter of those people were eligible for a bronze plan that would cost them nothing in premiums after federal subsidies were applied (they would still have a high deductible). a broad special enrollment period could protect that group from big bills, too, if they contract the disease known as covid-19.

another subject of the article, 61-year-old susan reardon, said she figures it's better to pay the tax penalty and pay for her fibromyalgia medicine out-of-pocket than shell out over $12,000 in premiums and deductibles for useless obamacare coverage. she felt it's better just to die if something catastrophic happens to her, and challenged the irs to come and get me for the obama tax.
republicans stepped up their attacks on democrats throughout the day friday, blaming them for forcing the standoff. mcconnell, r-ky., accused democrats of using immigration as a bargaining chip in the fight.
the georgia congressman also kept the door wide open to turning medicaid into a block grant, something he has supported as chairman of the house budget committee. in one particularly heated exchange with democratic sen. bob menendez, price was asked whether turning medicaid into a block grant program would mean fewer people would be eligible in the future, cnn notes. the decades-old entitlement program extends health coverage to low-income americans, and menendez noted that as an entitlement program, anyone who meets the criteria currently has the right to be covered. 'when you move to a block grant, do you still have the right?' menendez asked. 'no, i think it would be determined by how that was set up,' price said. price's apparent acknowledgement that some low-income americans may not be covered if republicans move medicaid over to a block grant system would mark a radical shift in the purpose that the program is supposed to serve.
it's a baffling move for trump, who spent most of monday basking in the glow of a series of conclusions, according to attorney general bill barr, in special counsel robert mueller's report that were about as favorable as the president could have hoped for: that the special counsel did not establish that anyone in trump's campaign conspired with the russian government in 2016 election interference, and that there was not sufficient evidence for barr to establish an obstruction of justice charge against the president.
the case was argued on november 10 and is currently before the justices, with a decision expected by july.

we realized there is a lot of energy around health care, she said. so many people had a parent, sibling or co-worker fall into the coverage gap.
the constitution is clear: it is the role of congress to make laws, the judiciary to interpret the laws, and the president to enforce the laws. this system was wisely set in place by the founders well over 200 years ago because they knew firsthand that the concentration of power was a threat to individual liberty and the rule of law. as james madison eloquently wrote in federalist no. 47: the accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and judiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and whether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny.

the votes of the liberals were known, too. justice ruth bader ginsburg, fifth in seniority, was the first to cast a vote to uphold the individual mandate. she believed supreme court precedent demanded the law be found constitutional. she was followed by justice stephen breyer, who agreed with her. next in seniority was conservative samuel alito, who cast the fifth and final vote to strike down the law. the eighth and ninth justices at the table, liberals sonia sotomayor and elena kagan, joined ginsburg and breyer in voting for the law as part of congress' power to regulate interstate commerce.
under the conditions of a federal job guarantee, everybody would be assured of getting to work if they were seeking work. so in effect, the unemployment rate would be zero, said darity. in an ideal world, if i lost my job in the morning, i could walk over to what we would now truly call an employment office and have new work by the afternoon.
the trump administration told a federal court in new orleans late monday that it would ask judges to toss out the entire affordable care act, a decision that cast further uncertainty over the future of a federal law that has extended health insurance to millions of americans.

preliminary reporting shows those predictions are accurate. in a study of 14 major metro areas by the kaiser family foundation, premiums for the second-lowest-cost silver medical plans (the plans that tax credits are based on) are expected to rise an average of 11 percent in 2017. in the cities kaiser studied, complete data was available on insurer premium change requests. it found the changes range from a decrease of 13 percent in providence, rhode island, to an increase of 18 percent in portland, oregon.

so in the 1920s, '30s, and '40s, america went on this building boom across the country of this novel thing which was the grand, resort-style, public pool. it was a tangible symbol of government largesse and commitment to the kind of high, leisure-filled quality of life that would become the american dream. it was a melting pot, almost literally. it was a part of the americanization project of bringing white ethnic communities together to have shared recreation. there was a sense that the new america of the 20th century, the early 20th century, needed this kind of public investment to cohere a national identity and improve everyone's quality of life. and there were over 2,000 in the united states, and many of them were for whites only and segregated, as were most of the public benefits at the time. then in the 1950s and '60s, civil rights advocates in black communities started arguing that their tax dollars had funded these grand public pools, and therefore, they should be allowed to swim too. and that's when white towns got really creative. in order to avoid integrating the public pools, they sold them to private entities for $1. they wouldn't provide them in a public way anymore. and then ultimately, in order to avoid integrating them, many of these towns drained their public swimming pools rather than let black families swim too. so of course, the white families lost a public resource as well.

they could change their minds of course. and the pressure to enact these policies could build, thanks to a progressive movement that is already louder and more organized around goals than it was during obama's presidency. but even if democrats succeed at reducing structural barriers to change, and even if a progressive movement succeeds in demanding more action, legislation is likely to be full of compromises and fall short of democrats' loftiest goals, just like the affordable care act did.

in a new paper, david blanchflower, and david bell, an economics professor at the university of stirling, argue that, in the wake of the great recession, underemployment is a better measure of labor-market health than the unemployment rate. the fact that millions of workers want to work more hours means that the labor market still has plenty of slack.

aside from inflicting damage to the exchanges, the administration could also affect the law's operations by refusing to approve states' changes to their medicaid programs. states rely on federal regulators to sign off on changes large and small, including which citizens are eligible, to keep their medicaid programs operating. there are so many things that an administration that doesn't want a program to work can do, rosenbaum said.
that doesn't mean her numbers will keep improving or that she won't still serve as a convenient lightning rod for republicans, and potentially help trump keep his base engaged for his reelection campaign. but this is a bit of a zero-sum game, and trump is dealing with something he has never dealt with before: a democrat with actual power who can stop him and reinforce his own weaknesses and miscues.

president trump himself has since seemed fixated on his wisconsin win, if fuzzy on the details. last month, while visiting that state, trump claimed to have been the first republican to win there since dwight eisenhower in the 1950s. (in fact, the gop's presidential nominee won the state five times between ike and trump: reagan in 1984 and 1980 and richard nixon in 1972, 1968 and 1960.)

beyond the provisions on pre-existing conditions, if republicans keep control of congress next year, they will come for the affordable care act again. but they still don't have a replacement plan that would protect people with pre-existing conditions or do any of the other things the affordable care act did to slash the rate of uninsured americans.

the new york times reports: the campaign against the constitutional convention drew a diverse collection of opponents, including conservative political groups, major labor groups like the a.f.l.-c.i.o., and liberal stalwarts like the new york branch of planned parenthood and the new york civil liberties union. and while their concerns were often different, the basic logic of the anticonvention forces was similar: such a convention could result in an erosion of protections for everything from collective bargaining rights to free public education.
the congressional budget office's initial estimate that the bill could lead to 24 million more americans without health insurance within a decade spooked many senate lawmakers. you can't sugarcoat it, cassidy told fox news when explaining that it's an awful score. the final house bill passed without the score being updated, although most outside analysts said the changes were likely to increase the number who would lose insurance.
that population estimate appears to be inflated, however: it's higher than the 350,000 unauthorized immigrants the department of homeland security estimated resided in arizona in 2010 and the pew research center's estimate of 325,000.
mr. trump asserted on friday that 2017 would be a disaster for the health law. that's the year it was meant to explode, because obama won't be here, he said, adding that as bad as it is now, it'll get even worse. on saturday, he took to twitter: obamacare is imploding and will only get worse. republicans coming together to get job done! and vice president mike pence traveled to louisville, ky., on saturday to assure residents that the obamacare nightmare is about to end.

these national review offerings help demarcate the widening, well-documented chasm between the republican party's base and, with apologies to williamson, its establishment. what's fascinating is the similarity of the charge on both sides of the fence. the base's ongoing complaint — that the party establishment is out of touch with the concerns of real americans — and williamson's screed essentially send the same message: act right, or risk getting kicked out of the club.

while republicans won back the house in 2010 with a message focused, at least in part, on outrage over wasteful government spending, it's unclear if that message will work as well with the party's culture war-focused trump-era coalition, which includes more voters without a college degree.

the next day she claimed that this is consistent with what was said during the campaign, but it is not. a majority of americans in every poll also still want the president to release his returns, just as they did before the election.

just 31 percent of americans approve of the new alabama anti-abortion law, according to a new huffpost/yougov poll. a quarter of americans who say abortion should be illegal in most or all cases disapprove of the law, as do about a third of republicans, self-described evangelical christians and self-described conservatives.

in salt lake city, hundreds of protesters chanting this is what democracy looks like marched. the salt lake tribune reports that the crowd marched to push back against mr. trump and his administration's stance on such issues as the environment, immigration, free speech and russia.
the pollsters offered four ways of changing the health-care system to expand coverage, including medicare-for-all (which they described as having a national health plan … in which all americans would get their insurance from a single government plan). a majority of americans viewed the idea favorably to some extent — but it also had the most and strongest opposition.
these demands for liberty were always partial — often philosophically inconsistent. antiabortion arguments often disguise a powerful role for government in regulating women's bodies; restricting illegal immigration necessarily implicates government prohibition on hiring undocumented employees; in the trump era, efforts to punish china for its trade policies led many on the right to endorse tariffs and quotas that raise prices and inhibit consumer choice — an approach long considered anti-free market. similarly, conservatives who once championed abolition of the fairness doctrine now seem to wish for some sort of government intervention to force social media platforms to look the other way when voices on the right post baseless conspiracy theories, dangerously incorrect health data or even foment violence on their platforms.

collyer previously denied republicans' effort to sue over another aspect of the law — the administration's unilateral delay in implementing its mandate that most large employers offer health insurance or pay a penalty. while gop opponents didn't object to delay, they argued obama lacked the authority to do it without congressional approval.

sanders, biden, buttigieg and sen. elizabeth warren (d-mass.) are in a four-person pileup in iowa, where polls suggest a variety of caucus outcomes are possible. sanders and warren are leading according to a selzer & co. poll, while a monmouth university poll has suggested biden and buttigieg will take the spoils.
king: so, we watch those lines outside. then, we get the early entrance polls, and we get a little sense of the composition of the electorate, how many young people turned out, how many evangelicals turned out. and then, anderson, finally, after all this talking, the wall will start to fill in with the results.
kaufman does include in these pages some of the elements of wisconsin history that further cloud its image as a progressive bastion. there were generations of fierce resistance to unionization, strikes that lasted for years, violence that took lives. he even unearths a particularly eye-opening episode in the 1960s, when alabama's segregationist gov. george wallace came to the state and did rather well in the democratic presidential primary – not once but twice.
although the trump administration has tried to repeal the aca — obama's signature legislation —and made it less comprehensive, biden would expand the aca with the goal of lowering americans' health care costs. if costs fell, that would be a boon to those in the second half of life and not yet eligible for medicare.
one of the most shocking things i found in this bill, and there were many, is on page 425, where the congress would make it mandatory ― absolutely require ― that every five years, people in medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner ... all to do what's in society's best interest or your family's best interest and cut your life short. these are such sacred issues of life and death. government should have nothing to do with this.
while covid-19 is a very present risk right now in a lot of people's minds, people have health care needs that go beyond the coronavirus. notes levitt. if you end up with cancer, for instance, or a burst appendix and you're uninsured, that could be financially ruinous, which is why health policy experts always recommend getting covered if you can.
ten years have passed since the passage of the patient protection and affordable care act, better known as obamacare, and the law has been more or less fully deployed for six.
and there was another dynamic at play on wednesday that suggests that even uninspiring debate performances will not fatally hole bloomberg's campaign for weeks to come.
it also cost more to eat out. prices rose four times faster than the cost of dining at home.
food stamp enrollment in the past quarter has fallen by about half from this time last year, aguirre said, even with increased outreach and after the center streamlined its application process.
the court offered no explanation for the delay, and the legal issue before the justices did not involve whether trump was due any special deference because he was president.
cures to illnesses that have always plagued us are not too much to hope.
gosar said, it makes absolute, perfect sense for the gop leadership to start coalescing support from americans and members of congress for his anti-illegal immigration legislation.
if the law is overturned, nearly all americans would be affected in some way, according to the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation.
clinton gave a nuanced response. the democratic nominee sketched out what she believes are the affordable care act's strengths and weaknesses, vowing to address the latter with a series of modest changes that she'd outlined previously in her speeches and writings.
now is no time to give in, not when we're this close, marjorie dannenfelser, president of the susan b. anthony list, wrote in a fox news opinion piece last week.
those rates could be adjusted, but broadly the pricing was set in the absence of full competitive information, pearson says. when open enrollment for 2018 begins next fall, you could see big price increases in regions without competition.
recently, the obama administration had to admit that americans will be forced to pay far more for their insurance costs, as premiums are set to soar yet again next year.
president donald trump is demanding $5.6 billion to fulfill his campaign promise of a wall along the mexico border. pelosi has vowed to block any funding to build it. a tense standoff between the president and democrats at the white house friday lasted two hours.
the generous explanation for these positions is that republicans and their supporters have a principled opposition to government, for reasons that are philosophical, practical or both. the not-so-generous explanation is the suffering of vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and meatpacking plant workers, simply doesn't matter that much.
republicans need a simple majority to pass it, rather than a supermajority since they're using the budget reconciliation process. they may still have to rely on vice president mike pence to cast a tie-breaking vote. the senate currently has 52 republicans and 48 democrats. that means if all democrats vote against the bill, only three no votes from republicans can torpedo it. even if republicans are successful in getting it through the upper chamber, they would then still need to reconcile it with version passed by the house in early may, reach a bicameral agreement with house republicans, and hold votes in the house and senate on that version again.
that insufficient opportunity he talks about hits some groups particularly hard.
a new federal report says the trump administration failed to uphold safety protections for workers.
some experts have warned that even hinting about efforts to undermine the mandate could destabilize obamacare's already-fragile insurance markets.
but he also expressed empathy for those frightened by a dramatic change in the system, encouraging them to see themselves in the traditions of presidents harry truman, john f. kennedy and lyndon johnson, all of whom sought to expand health care coverage against the wishes of the private health care industry.
spicer: i'm not gonna talk about what we may or may not do. i think the president's been very clear that he doesn't telegraph forward what -- taking options off the table. that's not a good negotiation skill. that's not how he works. there's a reason he's been successful at negotiating, is because he does it in a way that doesn't telegraph to people what he's gonna take on or off the table.
no letup in the bloomberg-sanders war of words
to be sure, such attitudes aren't persuasive for everyone.
that effort did not succeed, but as part of their 2017 tax cut, republicans managed to zero out the law's individual mandate, which encourages healthy people to sign up for insurance by hitting them with a financial penalty if they don't. the trump administration has also taken a series of executive actions, such as slashing the affordable care act's advertising budget, that have depressed enrollment or otherwise undermined it.
so this time around, 2020, did you know right away? did it feel like he was going to be your candidate?
the new rule came on the same day as the education department issued guidance to schools, telling that if they have sex-segregated activities and facilities, transgender students have to be able to participate according to their gender identity.
one candidate rolled in sunday, more than 90 minutes late to an outdoor party with several thousand people, complete with '90s music and many campaign themes from that decade, too. her selling point: a traditional approach to politics — with policy plans and heavy fundraising — from the first woman to win a major-party nomination.
this is a question of making sure that however john is honored, it's set in stone that john is always honored, cassidy said. i don't want to establish a precedent where somebody is unhonored in the future.
with the collapse of the republicans' health care bill, we consider the impact on arizona, a state where many have benefited from obamacare, but others have been hard hit by rising insurance premiums.
in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election, trump promised to halt the flow of heroin into the united states. he mentioned that drug, not fentanyl, at least 57 times during his speeches and appearances, and he tied the crisis to the need to build a wall along the border with mexico. on the campaign trail, trump was moved by the people he met who had lost family members to the epidemic, conway said. as he left one stop, someone called out: please follow through on the drugs and opioids. you promised.
here's what she said about obamacare in 2009:
policies also routinely had caps that limited how much insurers had to pay out over someone's lifetime. people who were sick enough could hit those caps and be on the hook for 100% of their medical costs afterward.
trump made a mistake in attacking something most voters care about. the president attacked the democrats on health care – but that issue helped democrats win elections in 2018, especially moderate democrats in red districts that trump won in 2016.
three quarters also believe it's their responsibility to initiate end-of-life conversations.
this attitude not only turns off voters who want to feel as though their vote has been earned, it keeps the candidate in a bubble, out of touch, rusty, and unprepared when the going does get rough.
the public has been deeply divided over the affordable care act since it became law in march 2010, according to surveys by the kaiser family foundation. but with people now worried that infection with covid-19 will become a pre-existing condition, democrats say the health law — which requires insurers to cover such conditions — is becoming more attractive to voters.
it's shocking. it's very upsetting. i did talk to health care advocates who could easily recall people they knew who had died because of a lack of health care coverage. and these are the stakes. this is why i felt the need to write a book making this somewhat controversial argument that racism has a cost for everyone. because when we continue to allow the zero-sum story, the idea that progress for one group comes at the expense of another, it's a lie that we are buying into, and it's a costly lie. i talk about health care in the book. i talk about the lives lost for our unwillingness to — in a way, it is swimming in the same pool, ezra. it's the same risk pool. it's the same health insurance pool. actually, insurers use the word pool.
earlier this week, the biden administration announced it is restoring a modest amount of funds for community groups to help people enroll. the trump administration had slashed funding for these marketplace navigators.
mcconnell and trump's relationship has been fraught ever since the senate failed to repeal and replace the affordable care act in july. over the august recess, trump publicly bemoaned mcconnell's leadership.
the supreme court eventually reversed its own decision and reinstated the death penalty.
we have got to take a quick break. a lot more to get to. we will get the latest from clinton caucus night headquarters, where the pressure could not be any higher, and late reporting from the sanders and o'malley camps as well. we will also be joined by a top cruz campaign official about expectations for his candidate, the senator now doing a little q&a with voters in marion as we speak.
cooper: wolf, doors open in about 20 minutes for the iowa caucuses. i want to check in with jim sciutto, who's at a republican caucus site in greenfield, iowa.

garcia-navarro: but there are people who have benefited?
reid also said that congressional republicans do not have the nerve to roll back obamacare.
is president obama right – do americans want more gradual change?
according to the bureau of labor statistics, there were 7,855,000 people who held multiple jobs in may, or 5 percent of all those who are employed. that percentage has remained virtually unchanged during trump's presidency — it was 4.9 percent in january 2017 when he took office. in fact, the percentage of the employed working multiple jobs has hovered around 5 percent since late 2009, and it's lower than the roughly 6 percent of workers who held multiple jobs during the late 1990s.
(cnn) the biden administration told the supreme court on wednesday that it should uphold the affordable care act, reversing the position of the trump administration that had urged the justices to strike down the entire law amid the coronavirus pandemic.
there have been questions for months about when or if obama would weigh in on the primary, especially during the early state primary and caucus contests in which biden placed lower than anticipated.
• immigration. one could make the argument that obama's policies, which encourage or at least don't discourage latin american migration, are anti-western. but they sure aren't populist, as corporate titans overwhelmingly support increased migration.
the impeachment process has run its course. the bad policies of this administration continue.
schilling: yes, and what happens, if you get less than 5% votes, you're off the next year, which is what happens to the ballots.
conversely, as investors business daily notes, eight of the 15 states with the lowest overdose rates did not expand medicaid. all of these observations should be considered with the usual caveat that correlation does not necessarily indicate causation – there are almost certainly other factors common to expansion states that help to explain their rising addiction rates, although the dramatic increase immediately after the expansion is not easily dismissed.

ted cruz is holding a pre-caucus rally right now at a baptist church in marion, iowa. he is counting on a big evangelical turnout this evening, but not a high overall turnout. a lot of experts believe that would mean a surge of first-time caucus-goers who would be expected, many of them at least, to go with trump.
rather than earn the nomination, he is sitting on his lead, on what he believes is a sure thing; popping up here and there to give a speech, but probably spending most of his days at home watching reruns of matlock — or as he calls them: his stories.
on abortion access, biden is in favor of restoring funding for planned parenthood. he does not support the so-called gag rule or the hyde amendment, which bans most federal funding for abortions. biden backed the hyde amendment for a significant portion of his career and only came out against the legislation in july 2019, saying he could no longer support an amendment that makes that right [to an abortion] dependent on someone's zip code.
in the early 1990s, house leader newt gingrich (r-ga.) doubled down on a rhetoric of radicalism and extremism. he promised revolution and described political opponents as the embodiment of evil, who won only because they lied and cheated. e.j. dionne jr. has described the toxic results of this strategy as the politics of disappointment and betrayal.
in response to industry criticism, the obama administration is taking steps to prevent the misuse of special enrollment so people can't wait to sign up until they need care. special enrollment is designed for people who lose coverage or need to make a change because of an event in their life, such as moving, getting married or having a child.
spicer: no, no. he actually apologized to my colleagues. that's the exact quote. ok? that quote, that report got tweeted out around. and to report -- where was the apology to the president of the united states? where was the apology to millions of people who read that and thought how racially insensitive that was? where was that apology?
republicans lost the other race that same day. under the trump era, the party has lost the house of representatives, the white house and the senate.

via cbs news campaign reporter zak hudak tom steyer's ad blitzes have kept him on the debate stage, but the billionaire climate activist will likely need earned media to rise above his middle-of-the-road polling numbers. the debate stage is an opportunity for him to tout his status as the earliest candidate to call for mr. trump's impeachment. but with campaign scandals in both iowa and south carolina since the last debate, steyer could himself be a target for any opponent looking to score easy points.
for all of these reasons and more, meadows has lots of allies in the conservative movemen. freedomworks vice president noah wall told breitbart news that his group could not be happier with the choice trump made here.

president-elect donald trump named his transition committee on friday, which contains many familiar names from his campaign, from top surrogates, to his children.
so democrats may rely on multiple budget reconciliation bills to get partisan priorities passed. this type of legislation — requiring just a simple senate majority instead of the usual 60 votes — is the same way republicans tried to repeal obamacare back in 2017.
under bernie's plan, everybody may well benefit, but there's going to be a substantial number of seniors who are going to feel like they're worse off, said john rother, president of the national coalition on health care, a nonpartisan coalition aiming to lower health costs. these tradeoffs are inevitable in any kind of big picture health care plan.
there are several categories of medical benefits covered only minimally by medicare or not at all, including long-term care, mental-health services and most dental care. enrollees in medicaid, by contrast, can access a pretty comprehensive array of inpatient and outpatient services. medicaid plans cover not only all 10 of the health benefits considered essential under the affordable care act but also nursing home care and long-term care services.
you can say the same of biden. does anyone know why he wants to be president — i mean other than a return to the normalcy of lost wars, managed economic decline, and kissing the corrupt media's ass?
now it's all about the coronavirus. rep. tom o'halleran (d-ariz.) said it's always about, 'what meeting are you going to on the virus?' or, 'what are you going to do on the virus bill?'

given that shift in the trump administration's policy-making lineup and iran's threat to resume its nuclear program should the united states re-impose sanctions, a top priority of both french president emmanuel macron and german chancellor angela merkel in their white house visits this week has been to persuade trump to remain in the agreement.

trump's problem is that voters in the rust belt know what actual populism looks like.
in florida, a state run by republicans, the $15 minimum hourly wage won more than 60 percent of the vote last november. let republicans in congress continue to defend a federal wage floor of $7.25. they can't. nor can they go after the popular central elements of the american rescue plan.
at issue in the case brought by a group of republican-led states — which are backed by the trump administration — is whether the health care law's individual mandate to have health insurance is unconstitutional, since congress abolished the financial penalty for individuals who do not purchase health insurance in its overhaul of the tax code in 2017. the justices are also tasked with deciding whether the rest of obamacare can survive if the individual mandate is invalidated.
these guys are ok, biden said as the protesters chanted. they want to do the same thing i want to do. they want to phase out fossil fuels and we're going to phase out fossil fuels.
it began in philadelphia with protesters from several groups marching 150 miles south to stage a sit-in on the capitol steps, denouncing the influence of big money on politics and congress' refusal to reverse it. on a single day of the lengthy protests, capitol police arrested more than 400 people for unlawful demonstration activity, and they were charged with crowding, obstructing and incommoding.
describing his plans for big spending during the pandemic and after, johnson said, it sounds like a new deal and all i can say is that, if so, then that is how it is meant to sound and to be — because that is what the times demand: a government that is powerful and determined and that puts its arms around people at a time of crisis. he adds to these innovations more traditional thatcherite ideas such as efficient government, free trade and a moral foreign policy. we will build better and build greener, he said, but we will also build faster — by dispensing with much of the red tape and regulation that burden britain today.

popular parts of the aca are intact. young adults up to age 26 can stay on their parents' insurance plans. preventive services, such as flu shots and mammograms, must be covered without co-pays or other cost sharing. insurers can't exclude sick customers or charge them more. insurers also can't put annual or lifetime dollar limits on most benefits. and they have to issue refunds if they end up needing less than a specified share of premiums collected to cover health care expenses.
the president is attacking me with lies and petty insults because i'm not afraid to stand up to him, rosen said in a statement. dean heller has been a rubber stamp for donald trump in washington, caving to the president's divisive agenda at nevada's expense. this was senator heller's reward for his loyalty.

(steven overly has more.)
but repealing obamacare may prove to be a hard promise to keep.
insurers need enough healthy people in the pool of consumers enrolled in their plans to offset the financial risks in covering the sick ones who need costly care. a shortage of healthy consumers on the exchanges to date is often attributed to the high premiums and relatively low tax penalties so far for remaining uninsured.
the republican leadership explained repeatedly that we'd need trump to help get votes out, that anonymous gop senator told the hill about georgia.

becerra's confirmation hearing before the senate finance committee was marked by sharp exchanges over abortion, with republican lawmakers questioning whether his involvement in litigation on reproductive health issues would present a conflict of interest. gop senators also pressed the nominee on his previous support for medicare-for-all.
bash: ok. senator, with respect, it's not a ridiculous premise because what you wanted to do was hold up the entire government funding back in december and the cromnibus, we won't get too much in the weeds here, was a compromise to try to work around that. so, that's i think the reality of what's going on here.

health carriers have fled cities like charlottesville, virginia under what kaiser health news described as the instability of the obamacare marketplace, which it said, created a coverage vacuum, leaving locals and insurance regulators scrambling.
millions could become uninsured if the aca exchanges are shut down, obamacare's expanded medicaid coverage is rescinded, and insurers are no longer required to cover children under 26 on their parents' plans. some employers may continue dependent coverage, since young people in general tend to use less health care. but young people in poor health or with preexisting conditions could be shut out.
cuomo orders massive new york shutdown
the president pledged to make health care more affordable and available for all americans. last month, he signed an executive order that gives uninsured americans who want to buy affordable care act coverage another three months to do so, opening the federal obamacare exchange for a special enrollment period, which he tied to the pandemic.

attorney general jeff sessions mysteriously cancelled his speech set for today (thursday) in philadelphia to discuss his heavy-handed efforts to pressure so-called sanctuary cities to stop providing protections for undocumented immigrants.
gingrich: although he - i'm told he now disclaims that. he now says it was cute but he doesn't want to use it anymore.
on wednesday the president will host a swearing in ceremony from new secretary of homeland security, general james kelly -- john kelly. and then on friday he will do the same for secretary mattis at the department of defense. on thursday he will travel to philadelphia to attend the republican house and senate retreat. and on friday he will welcome his first foreign head of state, british prime minister, may. with that i look forward to taking your questions.
warren said she'll use executive powers on her first day in office to help lower the cost of key drugs, like insulin, epipens and treatment for hiv/aids. she also called for increasing generic drug competition and said the pharmaceutical industry blocks access to them.
trump said at the iowa rally: we've ended the war on american energy. the united states is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere on earth, by far.
the election night map in 2016 brought many surprises, but none more stunning than wisconsin's switch from blue to red — marking its first vote for a republican presidential ticket since 1984.
on twitter, physician-author atul gawande said what most analysts listening to trump were probably thinking: i am still trying to decipher what trump proposed as a health policy and i have no idea what he was talking about.
and i think, again, going back to my last point, the king of jordan when he was here just a few days ago, he made that point that this is about having a decisive military strategy coinciding with and ideological war that's existing now within islam. and this is something the king of jordan said has been going on now for the last 1400 years. and it's time for leaders to step up and take action.
justice clarence thomas, who wrote the opinion, said that the trump administration had the authority to provide exemptions from the regulatory contraceptive requirements for employers with religious and conscientious objections. he was joined by chief justice john roberts, and justices samuel alito, neil gorsuch and brett kavanaugh.
scott, a former governor of florida, called his request simple and common sense, adding that money slated for state and local governments is wholly unrelated to responding to the pandemic.
the acceptance of a cradle-to-grave, government-controlled health care system for all, including illegal immigrants, is not only being inculcated into the minds of students by socialists in universities, but is also now a set of ideas being promoted by an ever-increasing radical democratic party.
ginsburg spoke from her hospital bed at johns hopkins university as the high court heard arguments regarding obamacare's requirement that women be provided access to no-cost contraceptives.
as representatives watch senator after senator declare they won't vote for the bill without significant improvements, it's right for some in the house to question why they are being asked to take such a difficult vote.
she suggests that didn't happen because insurers had to file their initial 2017 rates to regulators earlier this year, before they knew exactly where competitors were dropping out.
knowing what you know, i'll start with you, congresswoman, do you think that's true or is this understandably distraught feeling of a mother who lost her son?
there is no more greater multiplier of revenue than economic growth, sayegh argued, over a trout parmesan meal with cbs news chief white house correspondent major garrett and political director steve chaggaris. and that is the bottom line. and we again are forecasting some serious growth projections being able to be achieved if you enact tax reform.
now, as we work with our allies to destroy the remnants of isis, it is time to give our brave warriors in syria a warm welcome home.
on tuesday, the company went even further, saying workers could apply for one of seven bachelor's degrees and two career diplomas in health-related fields. the degrees include health science and healthcare management through purdue university global, southern new hampshire university, bellevue university and wilmington university. the career diplomas are for jobs as pharmacy technicians and opticians.
so, let's talk about the jihadists overall. americans looking at this, looking at the fighting, you know, probably constantly saying, how does this affect me, how does this affect the united states, and say, why does it matter?
a lot of what members on my side of the aisle predicted has come to pass, said senator susan collins, republican of maine, citing increased premiums, higher deductibles and confusion among employers as to what constitutes full-time work. a lot of the issues that directly affect people's pocket books have turned out to be negative. i continue to believe, however, that our party must have a plan for replacing and fixing obamacare and not just repealing it.
a sizable chunk of a family's budget goes toward covering the cost of housing.
when i saw alice's beautiful family greet her at the prison gates, hugging and kissing and crying and laughing, i knew i did the right thing.

while it's unclear exactly how outsiders' views of the us have shifted over the past three weeks, gallup found that only 29% americans believe other countries around the world have respect for the president. two-thirds of respondents said they did not.
married at 23, she had five children. while active in politics, she didn't begin a political career until age 47.
but while the president has claimed he would protect preexisting conditions, his administration has been trying to kill the affordable care act in the courts.
expanding opportunities in the female-dominated caregiving workforce would play a dual role in both helping families, and helping improve women's employment outlook, explains sherry glied, who is dean of new york university's robert f. wagner graduate school of public service, noting that this pandemic-fueled economic crisis has hit women harder.
we looked into a similar claim last july when then-congressional candidate alexandria ocasio-cortez wrongly claimed that the low u.s. unemployment rate was because everyone has two jobs. the number of people holding more than one job has no bearing on the unemployment rate.
workers at the sanders headquarters got a pep talk today from the boss. listen to this.
question: why did the president choose the british prime minister as the first foreign leader for him to meet? and can we take from that that he intends to make the relationship even closer?
several democratic sources pointed out that there has been no significant opposition effort mounted to the plan -- no big outside spending to attack the plan, no unified push by gop campaign or advocacy groups to puncture the growing bubble of momentum.
my anticipation would be that in '18, we'll see a lot of markets without any coverage at all, bertolini said.
kodjak: yeah, it is. and it - one of the problems is that there actually are a lot of additional benefits from obamacare and people's insurance, but they don't see that directly. you get free mammograms. you get free colonoscopies. you get free birth control. if you had an illness, you can still buy insurance because they can't exclude you for a pre-existing condition. those aren't apparent to most of the people that we surveyed.
spicer: i -- no. i think what he was talking about was the process, not the people, and that's a very different thing.
the states of pennsylvania and new jersey challenged the rules, arguing that they would have to cover the cost of birth control for people who lost coverage.
one of the latest examples: warren's campaign on monday announced latinas fight, latinas win – or latinas en la lucha – to highlight the senator's commitment to reach out to the community.
the judge ruled that the constitutional foundation for the law – the requirement that people buy insurance or pay a penalty – was no longer constitutional because congress had repealed the penalty. o'connor ruled that because that provision was so central to the health law, the whole thing had to be invalidated.
trump was elected without much of a mandate, given his narrow margin in the electoral college and his loss in the popular vote. but congressional republicans didn't have much of a mandate, either. although people seemed to forget about it as they focused on trump's upset win at the top of the ticket, republicans lost seats in both the house and the senate in last year's elections.
certainly rhetorically, trump's idea that 'i alone can fix this' does go beyond the template that president obama and president bush before him came in with, the idea that you try to fix things together, said andrew rudalevige, a professor of government at bowdoin college.
the cdc's new guidance is part of the agency's latest recommendations for distributing the three approved coronavirus vaccines, the post's lena h. sun reports. the health agency urged states to consider the unique needs of people with disabilities or cognitive decline and their caretakers, and those with limited access to technology, as appointments open to new groups.
she also said on tuesday that she would not raise middle class taxes to pay for the program.
emails released as part of massachusetts' lawsuit against the drugmaker reveal how the family pushed the products. in one email, former purdue president richard sackler personally directed sales representatives to push doctors to prescribe extremely high doses of opioids, our colleagues report, even as healey claims the family knew such a move would put patients at risk.

the implication of leaving millions uninsured is a matter of life and death. a 2019 report on medicaid expansion found there could have been 15,600 fewer deaths if all 50 states expanded medicaid under the affordable care act. there's a growing body of research that has shown expanded public insurance has improved health outcomes, increasing preventative care and saving patients with chronic illnesses, like kidney disease.
thank you very much, ezra. [music playing]
near the end of the conversation, i thought back to something obama said at the march 2010 signing ceremony: we are a nation that faces its challenges and accepts its responsibilities. we are a nation that does what is hard. what is necessary. had the difficulty passing and implementing obamacare shaken that faith?
he put the new jersey governor in charge.
with the numbers that we talked about and the new news (ph) from the inauguration day and the numbers (ph) saturday, do you believe that you have a mandate to be able to force through what you had talked about, replacing portions of obamacare, that really subsidized a whole piece of it to help low-income people get health care?
networks called the race for biden seconds after polls closed at 7 p.m. eastern. with around 45% of the vote in, vermont sen. bernie sanders was behind biden, and billionaire businessman tom steyer was in third place. steyer, who invested millions of dollars in the south carolina race, dropped out late saturday.
the department of health & human services is starting to make changes, including taking drug utilization into account. last week, it said it will propose modifying the risk adjustment program to absorb some of the cost for claims above a certain threshold, funded by payments from all insurers.
chang: ok, again, that was from abc news. so we never actually hear warren say yes or no to the question, will this raise taxes? she answers by talking about overall costs, about how overall health care costs will go down for people. but is that argument going to work with regular voters, people who just want to know if their taxes will go up, karen?
romney then offered the outlines of his federal health care proposal, which, he said, would start with an executive order on his first day as president to help states get waivers to opt-out of the federal health care law. referring to slides, he said he would then look to repeal and replace that law with his proposal.
sen. kamala harris (d-calif.) who ended her presidential campaign in december, took an early shot at biden's record on race, attacking the former vice president on his stance on integrated busing in the 1970s. but biden appeared to have weathered that attack.
last friday, the trump team deleted any reference to global warming on the white house web site. now they're going much further. the white house has ordered the epa to remove the climate change page from its own website, which contains links to scientific global warming research and detailed data on emissions, reuters reports. the page could go dark as early as today. if the website goes dark, years of work we have done on climate change will disappear, one epa staffer said, adding that some employees were scrambling overnight to download the information on personal devices so it cannot be deleted.
the shutdown ended after senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and senate minority leader chuck schumer made an agreement that the senate would take up legislation to deal with individuals who were part of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program, which trump has sought to end. a permanent solution for daca has yet to come to fruition as the program has been in legal limbo.
menendez won his primary with only 62 percent of the vote against a primary candidate who barely campaigned. menendez will probably prevail against republican bob hugin, but the margin of victory may be smaller than expected, depending on how many people cast a protest vote. hugin has also injected over $15 million in his own campaign.
meanwhile, having supported a legal assault on the affordable care act, the administration urged the supreme court to decline to review an appeals court decision invalidating the law's individual mandate — a delay that would leave the law's fate conveniently uncertain until after the election, and the administration conveniently spared from facing the wrath of voters who, it turns out, like their obamacare after all. having raced to the high court numerous times with claims that emergency intervention was warranted, the administration now argues that immediate view would short-circuit the ordinary judicial process.
kentucky sen. rand paul said, the bulk collection of your phone data, the invasion of your privacy, did not stop one terrorist attack. i don't think you have to give up your liberty for a false sense of security. when we look at this bulk collection – the court has looked at this – even the court declared it to be illegal. if we want to collect the records of terrorists, let's do it the old fashioned way. let's use the fourth amendment.
a recent nbc news/marist poll found that 63 percent of wisconsin voters and 62 percent in michigan say trump doesn't deserve another term. his approval rating is below his national average at 36 percent in both states. in two june polls of ohio, voters disapproved of trump by double-digit margins.
when stephanopoulos pointed this out to the president, mr. trump responded, doesn't matter. i have it already, and it's a much better plan for you, and it's a much better plan.
ward's agenda is to help make america great again, not score never trump brownie points. much like sens. rand paul, mike lee and ted cruz, we will see her go to washington to change it and fight for the america first agenda.
this year alone, obamacare premiums have gone up by an average of 25%, and in some places have risen by over 100%. individuals have insurance that they cannot afford — high deductibles distort the meaning of coverage. under the two most popular obamacare health plans, thousands of families have been forced to shoulder burdensome deductibles equivalent to 10% and 6% of the median american household income. this is not affordable.
also in the op-ed that sethi's top adviser praised, he accuses trump's supporters of harboring a gut-level notion that somehow america was greatest when it was white, male, christian, and straight—in other words accusing trump supporters of being racist, sexist, anti-gay religious bigots.
and florida is not the only state that has floated the idea of using stimulus money to offset tax hikes.
the scale of death here is really unprecedented, and so you have to judge the response against the scale of the problem, said joshua m. sharfstein, vice dean at the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health. you can have some progress, but it's really insufficient if you are not up to the scale of the problem.
he campaigned on repealing and replacing obamacare for years and then it got to a vote and he said thumbs down, trump said.
later, when trump actually won the gop nomination and kasich and sen. ted cruz (r-tx) dropped out of the race, barnwell-hagemeyer reposted in another since-deleted facebook post an open letter that sen. ben sasse (r-ne) wrote to what he called majority america, and in which sasse said of people who genuinely believed either trump or democrat hillary rodham clinton were honorable people that they were rare souls.
but in iowa last month, conservative republican gov. kim reynolds resisted calls to shut down plants with severe coronavirus outbreaks. patience roggensack, the conservative chief justice of the wisconsin supreme court, questioned the state's shutdown order because the big spike in illness was among meatpacking workers (often immigrants), and not and the regular folks.
fox news previously reported on how multiple media outlets similarly omitted context surrounding trump's comments to a rally audience in february. the ad splices several statements from trump, playing them against the backdrop of a chart showing the escalation of coronavirus cases in the u.s.
meanwhile, at the spanish catholic center, which is run by catholic charities, aguirre said, they're seeing kids go hungry.
but health policy experts say drug treatment funding is not nearly enough, and the administration's response was hobbled by the failure to appoint a drug czar in its chaotic first year and confusion over who was in charge of drug policy. the depth of the problem continues to overwhelm the government's response, and the administration has yet to produce a comprehensive strategy that is legally required by congress.
while he makes people jump through hoops, for companies that want to deny coverage to someone with a sick child or make it prohibitively expensive, trump aims to make that more possible than ever.
i think, look, you're seeing with respect to the other meetings, it's day one -- working day one here. he's gonna start with the leadership. he's gonna have a great conversation with them.
why do you think she's wrong?

one longtime consultant for the democrats, who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely, also pointed to bloomberg's lack of charisma.
cleveland.com writes: the proponents hoped to bank on the unpopularity of the drug companies in ohio as well as ill will toward them in general after recent price gouging controversies. the opposition backed by big pharma had nearly unlimited resources, outspending the yes side by three-to-one over the course of the campaign.
is that when he sees people that are hurting, that haven't had wages lifted up, that are unemployed, that can't save for their kids future, that are having a trouble with their healthcare costs, that's what he really cares about.
like any employer offering health insurance, the federal government pays a good portion of employees' premiums. except for some negotiated union contracts with postal workers, the feds generally pay about 72 percent of premium costs. but that's less than the average 80 percent that private sector employers kick in.
our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world. it is american leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.
she said the doctor advised her not to get tested — and noted she's been away from her husband for the past two weeks and is outside the 14-day period for getting sick.
and in michigan, where democrat gretchen whitmer defeated incumbent gov. rick snyder, republicans put forth proposals to give the legislature authority in legal fights and to create a commission to oversee the state's campaign finance laws, according to the detroit news. the moves come nearly two years after the republican legislature in north carolina made similar efforts, some of which are being challenged in court, to lessen the power of democrat roy cooper, after he narrowly defeated gop incumbent gov. pat mccrory.
[republicans are facing the ire of the anti-trump movement this week. will it last?]
oil prices have dipped below $50 per barrel in recent days as optimism over a production cut strategy agreed between major producers has faded. the idea was that production cuts would get rid of excess supply and help support prices. american producers, however, have increased their activity.
currently, companies are allowed to deduct any imports from the income on which they must pay taxes. the republican proposal is known as a border adjustment.
i will always protect your pre-existing conditions, he wrote. the dems will not!
detrow: several of the campaigns say immigration, climate change and affordable housing are key issues in nevada. in las vegas, sanders rolled out a $2.5 trillion plan to expand affordable housing and address homelessness.
kelly: so take me back to 2015. what exactly happened? how did this hiv outbreak begin?
corporations stand to gain substantially since their tax rate would decrease from 35 to 15 percent. this is considered the most aggressive step in the trump tax plan since the goal is to set the corporate tax rate on par or below that of other industrialized countries and, therefore, become more competitive. the objectives are to bring jobs to american shores, attract foreign capital, and incentivize global companies to establish subsidiaries or relocate to the united states while stimulating long-term economic growth.
it did not just distract from the president's attempt to make political capital out of an apparently favorable result from special counsel robert mueller's russia investigation, at least according to a summary by attorney general bill barr. it must also have irked trump that he was still being forced to deal with obamacare itself.
this story was produced by kaiser health news, which publishes california healthline, a service of the california healthcare foundation.
more than 80 percent of the nearly 13 million people who enrolled for coverage on the marketplace last year qualified for subsidies, which are pegged to the price of the second-lowest silver premiums. that means that as the cost of the silver plans rise, so do the subsidies.
even bloomberg's campaign seemed to admit he underwhelmed in the hideously tough assignment of walking into a debate cold after his rivals had been waging war for months.
brown: only in a good way, anderson. and that's one of the reasons they think the turnout is going to be so high tonight. it's because it's a nice day here. it's not even that cold here in iowa. the snowstorm hasn't set in yet. and so as one person we spoke to said, there is no excuse for people not to come out and caucus here, particularly in this precinct.
bernie sanders' plan to deliver medicare for all may be a good deal for many americans, but it might be bad for working seniors already enrolled in the government health plan.
as part of a bold new diplomacy, we continue our historic push for peace on the korean peninsula. our hostages have come home, nuclear testing has stopped, and there has not been a missile launch in 15 months. if i had not been elected president of the united states, we would right now, in my opinion, be in a major war with north korea with potentially millions of people killed. much work remains to be done, but my relationship with kim jong un is a good one. and chairman kim and i will meet again on february 27 and 28 in vietnam.
the claim was so outrageous that politifact named it the lie of the year.
obama noted that a biden administration would go much further on climate change.
«ya no se nos permite hacer retroceder más», dijo trump.
spicer: i'm pretty sure that reagan didn't have youtube, facebook, or the internet.
the trump administration's campaign to undermine the affordable care act notched another achievement tuesday.
there's no way around it, bernie sanders is losing. a path to the democratic presidential nomination still exists, but it's a hail mary. he lost in 2016, too, but it was one of the most successful losses in electoral history. what were once considered radical, career jeopardizing stances on issues like single payer health care, a $15 minimum wage and free college became the standard by which a large chunk of the democratic electorate measures a candidate. he changed the trajectory of the democratic party.
she could simply talk about something else – health care – which is all but certain to be more important to voters come 2020 than russia.
most notably: booker, new york democratic sen. kirsten gillibrand and sanders. in addition, the intercept recently reported that massachusetts democratic sen. elizabeth warren has begun looking closely at the idea.
he also called for increasing competition among drug makers, stopping them from exploiting protections they get from competition under patent laws, and changing federal rules to allow drug companies to be reimbursed based on the effectiveness of their product.
several conservatives have bristled publicly at this posture. sen. marco rubio (r-fla.) warned yesterday, for example, that trump declaring a national emergency would create a dangerous precedent. we have to be careful about endorsing broad uses of executive power, rubio said on cnbc. if today the national emergency is border security, tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change.
i'd like to talk about who we're running against -- a billionaire who calls women fat broads and horse-faced lesbians, sen. elizabeth warren said moments into the clash.
reviewing the senate homeland security report for forbes, sally pipes notes that state medicaid expansion had the perverse effect of enrolling able-bodied, childless adults in their medicaid programs than it does for children and the destitute elderly. able-bodied childless adults are also the group experiencing an anomalous increase in mortality rates, which in turn is believed to be strongly influenced by opioid addiction.
election 2020::biden talks about trump's 'twin legacies', health care in swing-state pennsylvania trip
senators on both sides of the aisle rallied to the defense of the late sen. john mccain, r-ariz., on wednesday, after president trump launched a fresh round of attacks against the senator's legacy this week.
for democrats, this should pose a number of questions. foremost among them: why are they spending so much time debating these costly, unrealistic plans when they should be focused on preserving obamacare protections and the rule of law?
the study, by alexander hertel-fernandez of columbia university and matto mildenberger and leah c. stokes of the university of california at santa barbara, found that congressional staffers were terrible at estimating constituents' support for various policies. on nearly every issue surveyed — from gun control to environmental regulation to obamacare — staffers in both parties believed the public was more conservative than they actually are.
sen. lamar alexander's office declined to comment on what congress should do on health care, saying they had nothing to add at this time. the tennessee republican is the chairman of the health, education, labor, and pensions committee in the senate. offices for sens. bill cassidy (la.), tim scott (s.c.), lisa murkowski (alaska), mike braun (indiana) and rob portman (ohio), who sit on either the help committee or the senate finance committee, which collectively have purview over obamacare, medicaid and medicare, did not respond to requests for comment.
schilling: yes, they're -- that's what a conservative is. a conservative looks at the constitution as an ironclad document. it's easy, it's simple, it makes sense and it's perfect.
pushing back against trump's claims that the economy is doing great, sen. kamala harris said, well yeah people in america are working — they're working two and three jobs. the percentage of american workers holding multiple jobs is 5 percent and is virtually unchanged from when trump took office.
on thursday, a trump campaign spokesman criticized the biden-harris plan and defended the current administration's work on health care matters.
in fact, obamacare is not a job-killer, according to the 2015 kaiser family founation/health research and education trust survey released in september 2015.
insurers would be free to raise their premiums to meet these requirements, but because current policies are locked in for the year, voters would not see the effects until 2018. if young, healthy americans flee the market, freed from the mandate, premiums could soar next year.
there are 54 million non-elderly adults with a pre-existing condition that would have resulted in coverage denial without the aca, according to the kaiser family foundation.
the original impetus for guaranteeing csr payments was to avoid disruption, since insurers had been counting upon those payments and trump was loudly threatening to stop them (as he eventually did). last fall, alexander, who is chairman of the senate health, education, labor and pensions committee, worked closely with his democratic counterpart, ranking minority member patty murray of washington state, on a bill that would have funded csrs. it was a rare show of genuine bipartisanship.
trump also spent valuable time on monday at a white house event designed to showcase domestic manufacturing. he posed for pictures behind the wheel of a gleaming fire engine built by pierce manufacturing of wisconsin. by coincidence, the white house had staged a similar photo-op with the president at the end of march, the day before a different obamacare replacement bill died in the house.
downton abbey should come with a warning label now, because julian fellowes is clearly going for broke in its final season.
in his monologue, kimmel urged that no matter how much money a family makes, there should be no annual or lifetime caps. because of the high cost of procedures like open-heart surgery, lifetime or annual caps on what insurers pay out mean families foot the rest of the bill.
yeah, they're all we need, really. let's write a children's book, ezra. what's your favorite these days?
the usa today network looked at a number of the promises – large and small, national and exceedingly local – that trump made on the campaign trail four years ago and early in his term, to measure his success.
the plan isn't likely to garner much — if any — attention from gop house and senate leaders, who after last year's repeal-and-replace debacle resigned themselves to the impossibility of fully ditching the law as they'd promised for so long. moderate republicans couldn't stomach dramatic medicaid cuts, and conservatives refused to vote for a replacement bill that left too much of the affordable care act intact.
at some point they're going to be looking for a solution, and our goal is to have a solution ready for them, holler said.
buttigieg and biden also separately expressed support for allowing medicare to negotiate prescription drug costs.
the department has also told states that they can create new types of insurance plans that don't comply with all the aca's rules – such as what benefits must be covered and the law's ban on tying premiums to health status. but no state has asked to do that.
the spending cut is not the only change that cms announced tuesday. going forward, it will encourage navigators to educate consumers about skimpier alternatives to traditional insurance ― including short-term, limited-duration plans that frequently leave out basic benefits, such as prescription drugs, and are unavailable to people with pre-existing conditions.
i might even go so far as to say that this face mask is more guaranteed to protect me against covid than when i take a covid vaccine, redfield said wednesday. ... if i don't get an immune response, the vaccine's not going to protect me. this face mask will.
john mccain ( ariz. ) mccain said in a july 13 statement that the revised bill does not include the measures i have been advocating for on behalf of the people of arizona. he said he plans to file amendments regarding the bill's impact on arizona's medicaid system. this is not what the american people expect of us, and it's not what they deserve, he said. read more »
i think you're going to see something very special, trump said.
i am definitely going to be involved in the hearings and performing my role and responsibility on the senate judiciary committee, harris said.
kelly: jonathan turley, great to see you, sir.
sen. lindsey graham, r-south carolina, said in a statement that he needs to carefully review the text first, but would prefer to address health care reform in a bipartisan manner, accusing democrats of being unwilling to negotiate with republicans.
trump also said addiction was a deeply personal issue for him. his older brother, fred jr., who suffered from alcoholism, died in 1981 at age 43.
biden called that ruling a disappointment and promised, if elected, to restore the obama-biden policy that existed before the court challenges.
in fact, rotten (whose real name is john lydon) is bucking an establishment that treats these vagrants as sacred cows while at the same time pretending they do not exist because their rising numbers reflect badly on the democrat-run strongholds that cannot manage the growing problem.
watch: jimmy kimmel blasts gop health bill, says it fails the 'jimmy kimmel test'
and senator, i want to start with what appears to be the question of the day, ground troops. do you believe that there should be ground troops in iraq to go after isis, as many as 10,000 as some are calling for?

correction: a previous version of this story said first lady melania trump attended the service. she did not.
the governor's forthcoming budget, his office said, will make california the first state in the nation to cover young undocumented adults through a state medicaid program.
republicans ultimately caved after 16 days in their efforts to strip funding for the health care plan, and agreed to fund the government at its current levels, in addition to a small change regarding income verification for health care subsidies.
carpenter: yes, i think it's very likely. huckabee, santorum, even rand paul people, if they're in that caucus and they see where the momentum is and they want to get behind a candidate to win, cruz can be their guy.
then, like now, that was largely at odds with objective reality. but it didn't matter – when the returns came in, republicans had picked up eight senate seats and control of the senate, and added another 13 seats to their already comfortable house majority. they also added two more governors for a total of 31, nearly twice the democrats' 17.
bruni: governor patrick, but aren't the means really everything? single payer and medicare for all are a world apart from obamacare, and when it comes to how things play out in the political arena, republican strategists tell me they're champing at the bit to have their candidates campaign against any plan that they can brand socialized medicine.
'oh, everything is great, i expected to eat my grandma miles ago, now excuse me i've got to go salt my cousin,' colbert added.
southern states are also subject to natural disasters. this month, there have been deadly tornadoes and flash floods; hurricane season starts june 1; and there's spring flooding on the mississippi river.
9:07 p.m. et a voter in the audience asked if the candidates can display appropriate behavior for youth. clinton, who won the coin toss to answer first, said it is very important for americans to make clear to children that our country is really great because we're good.
as conway took control of the opioid issue, confusion spread within the drug czar's office and across the government, according to former staffers who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared reprisals from the administration. staffers in the office said they would frequently field calls from other agencies and congressional offices, requesting direction on how to increase funding for treatment or how to launch anti-opioid public education campaigns. they said they had no authority to make decisions on their own, and the queries languished.

sagal: voter fraud. i'll give it to you.
there are other outrages too numerous to mention. but one of the most appalling was his effort to eliminate the so-called daca program for undocumented aliens who were brought to the u.s. as children, who, after being raised and educated in america, now face deportation. yet another outrage is his tactic of instilling fear of reprisals and arrest. as a result, there is a growing climate of anxiety and distrust.
marlow recalled, i started noticing the contrast between what my parents were listening to on the radio and what i was hearing from the rest of the media [and] learning in the classroom. … i would listen to a guy named larry elder — who is still a nationally syndicated broadcaster — and he really expanded my horizons.
i really like what he's doing with china, which has been stealing our technology and is expanding militarily in so many ways. i wish our media would focus on some of that and he's reversed the obama administration's policy vis a vis iran, which is a terrorist state that has killed american soldiers, which obviously is building icbms not for tel aviv, but for los angeles.

bloomberg is spending millions running ads that attack trump for wanting to repeal obamacare:
they're trying something new, wolf. and this will be a test of it tonight. social media. will social media through snapchat, through facebook, through instagram be able to turn out supporters, rather than a brick and mortar organization that they have used so many years here?
blitzer: and so far the weather is pretty good, so that should encourage turnout. sara murray, thanks very much.
but they need to have the help of pretty wise outsiders who are able, in a dispassionate way, to help them sort through this. i mean, they've never done anything like this before. and i certainly don't expect them, on phase one, to fully appreciate how complicated it is and how dangerous it is for the country. this is a country in which 75 percent of the people believe there's widespread corruption. we have got to go back to re-establishing a sense of trust. that has to be an assignment trump takes personally. and that has to be more than trust me because trust me never works in the long run as a model. it's just - it's not possible.
trump further complicated budget negotiations on thursday with a series of tweets that suggested he opposed the house stopgap bill. the white house put out a statement later that he did support it, and the president ultimately helped win over reluctant house conservatives to vote for the bill.

one leadership source told cnn that members have been approaching the leaders about what a post-paul ryan world would look like for some time.
simmons-duffin: in states that don't run their own exchanges, there's a bit of a problem. the trump administration has decided not to open a federal special enrollment period, and that means there are probably several million people who will fall into a coverage gap and not be able to enroll in medicaid or an obamacare marketplace plan.
by giving an address from the oval office, trump is doing something similar: asking america to trust him because he is the president. but the presidency is viewed as untrustworthy at least in part because trump holds the position. even trump's vice president can't argue that trump is viewed as untrustworthy, instead trying to argue, bizarrely, that concerns about the factual accuracy of trump's statements fall into a nebulous category of political debate and therefore not something that americans care about.
tasini: yes, absolutely. look, there are a lot of good things that barack obama has done. at every rally i've ever been to and heard bernie sanders speak, he said barack obama has done very good work and again, in the face of almost united republican opposition.

democrat governor john bel edwards will be the first democrat governor to win reelection in louisiana since 1975, after defeating republican eddie rispone by just over one percent on saturday. and after almost two days of no public acknowledgement from mr. trump's twitter account, edwards spokesperson eric holl told cbs news political unit broadcast associate aaron navarro the president called to congratulate edwards in private. at his election night watch party, cbs news political unit associate producer sarah ewall-wice reports edwards only mentioned trump briefly in his remarks: you didn't just vote for me, you voted for four more years of putting louisiana first...and as for the president, god bless his heart.
a potential vote to overturn crucial cases
even those who support the law say that mismatch would effectively shut down the health exchanges, because insurers would simply drop out. a trump administration really could collapse the federal exchange marketplace and the state exchanges if they end cost-sharing payments to insurers, said rosenbaum, who has been a strong backer of the health law. there is already some concern about the continuing viability of the exchanges after several large insurers, including aetna and united healthcare, announced they would be dropping out for 2017.

steven i. weissman, a south florida attorney, was interim president of palm springs general hospital from 2013 to 2014. he has taught as an adjunct professor at the university of miami school of law and the nova university graduate management program. last month, he delivered a petition to president trump asking him to support legitimate health care pricing.
he cast the pre-mandate system as the big government approach, since paying for care fell to taxpayers. he contrasted that with the mandate to buy insurance or pay a penalty, which he cast as the personal responsibility option.
a recent kaiser family foundation survey found that in 21% of counties in the nation, a 40-year-old earning $50,000 would have to spend 10% of their income just to pay for aca premiums.
the plan i'm going to describe for you is the same, he said. i'm not adjusting the plan to reflect the political sentiment.
whenever parents discuss socialism, they should always explain that it's important to engage in charitable activities. advocates of freedom do support helping others, they just don't believe the government is best equipped to do it.
it's hard to find a respected legal expert today who finds merit in this latest lawsuit. the basis for the states' argument is that congress originally intended for the pre-existing conditions protections to operate alongside the mandate; if the mandate is gone, the lawsuit reasons, then the pre-existing protections should go too.

but a deal will be made for good health care in this country. that's one of the things i'll be doing, he added.
the commonwealth fund estimated up to 7 million people might have plans with cost-sharing reductions this year.
if it's more than 170,000 people, the clinton campaign, i'm told, believes that that is essentially or close to being out of reach for them. to put it in some context here, this would be in between the 2004 turnout and the 2008 turnout, when there were some 240,000 people here. but the sanders campaign is doing something new.
blue cross plans generally dominated the individual insurance market before the 2010 health law was passed, and they have recaptured their place in many cities and counties, says pearson. that helped them outlast insurers such as unitedhealthcare and humana, which lacked that experience when they began selling individual plans under obamacare in 2014. even so, blue cross plans have withdrawn from nebraska and minnesota for 2017, as well as from densely populated counties in arizona and tennessee.
no one has more respect for women than me. ~trump
the reality is that republicans have never produced alternatives to obamacare that live up to their lofty rhetoric. they didn't in 2017 and they aren't now.
i can't in all good honesty, in all good faith, just look the other way because my party is now complicit in the deficits, paul said at the time on the senate floor.
trump lamented the failure to pass the health care bill, which failed 49-51 after sen. john mccain voted against it in the early morning hours of july 28, 2017, by signaling a thumbs-down. if mccain had voted for the bill, vice president mike pence could have broken the 50-50 tie, and the bill would have passed.
health and human services secretary alex azar pointed to short-term and association health plans during friday's white house press briefing as possible solutions to obamacare and health insurance premiums reaching new heights.
the meeting ended because alarms went off warning members that they needed to vote on the house floor. meadows and the previous hfc chairman rep. jim jordan (r.-oh) broke through the reporters and cameramen to reach the elevators–only to have the doors open in front of them for a carriage going up. frustrated, meadows turned to answer more questions as the passengers in the elevator had a front row view before the doors closed again.
every child is a precious and sacred gift from god, trump said from one side of his mouth, while demonizing democrats and undocumented immigrants out of the other.
it could be argued that any budgetary effects of the waiver are 'merely incidental,'  said the committee for a responsible federal budget in a blog post.
other democrats noted the stimulus was passed before the rise of super pacs and other well-funded outside groups with the capacity to spend millions promoting a law. both house and senate democrats have affiliated nonprofits that can promote the rescue act in key states and districts, and build back together ― a nonprofit aiming to boost biden's agenda ― is expected to come online soon.

our iowa preview: is donald trump for real?
ahead of her weekend trip through northeast ohio and down into columbus, clinton's campaign quietly removed the cliche label from her so-called rust belt tour, in an attempt to sweeten her appeal to blue-collar buckeyes. meanwhile, trump boisterously embraced the term, declaring to the residents of the rust belt: everything's rusting and rotting.
biden said that he was making way for the mayor petes of the world to come into my administration. but this week, he brought rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-ny) onto his team, alongside other radicals. that is who will drive the agenda.
anti-abortion pregnancy centers, which exist to talk women out of having an abortion, know this well. the first thing they do for a pregnant woman considering abortion is get her on medicaid if she is eligible, so that her pregnancy health care will be covered. yet these same people invariably support republican politicians who are working to dismantle obamacare and oppose medicaid expansion, government funding for child care and anti-poverty programs.
cruz's current role is one few would have predicted a couple of years ago for a man who once called mcconnell a liar on the senate floor and who, from his earliest days in the senate, set aside the chamber's customary politeness and built a foundation for his 2016 presidential bid centered on fighting the political establishment.

weston wamp, as recently as 2018, was publicly defending now former sen. bob corker (r-tn)—a devout never trump senator who regularly undermined trump:
and i think this next election, 2016, is going to be a fundamental fork in the road. and i believe the american people are looking for a new path. they want to get back to the free market principles and constitutional liberties that were part of the foundation of this country. and so it's something that i'm looking at very seriously. and i'll tell you, the support we're seeing both on the grassroots level and also among the donors has been extraordinary, really has been encouraging.
cornish: all right, so this rule for smokers, this was supposed to deal with smokers who would choose to get coverage through the new health insurance exchanges. and they would have faced some surcharges or penalties for that habit, right?
levin: you ask me. go ahead.
kodjak: and so that's the source of frustration. it's not the effectiveness of the medicine. it's not the mris or whether the antibiotic works or whether the surgeons are skillful enough. it's just the system is so complicated and so hard to get around, people get sick of trying to navigate it.
these are people who love their country, and don't buy bernie sanders and joe biden's claim that it is essentially racist. these are people who go to church and abhor the democrats' enthusiasm for legalizing full-term abortion. these are people who work hard, pay their taxes, and believe others should do the same.

ap photo/evan vucci these pieces of paper won't make your health insurance, medical bills or prescription drugs any cheaper.
olsen concluded, that's just not a selling point with the american people. americans want a limited but effective government. limited in its scope, but effective and engaged to get barriers for average people out of the way, and then the government gets the heck out of the way.
the donald trump administration released a new rule to offer americans more affordable, short-term health insurance options compared to obamacare.
cnn chief white house correspondent jim acosta on friday accused president donald trump of being the take-no-responsibility president after announcing a host of measures — from boosting coronavirus testing availability to suspending interest on federal student loans — to ease concerns as the united states combats the spread of the deadly illness.

the peshmerga have been our allies. they have been our friends. and they're actually fighting every day to stop isis. now, dana, what makes no sense whatsoever is, the obama administration is refusing to directly arm the kurds. we need to arm the kurds now because they are our boots on the ground.
if you do get a surprise bill from covid-19 treatment, the same advice applies as always (this will be familiar to those who follow npr's bill of the month series): call your hospital or doctor and/or insurance company, and try to negotiate a lower bill. if they won't budge, check with the doctor or hospital to see if they can help you with a payment plan, or forgive the debt, as a part of a charity care program.
white house counselor kellyanne conway tried the first damage control tuesday on an issue suddenly rocking washington, insisting that trump's budget would preserve coverage for patients with pre-existing conditions.

the south carolina event, organized by the state chapter of our revolution, the group built to carry on the mission of sanders' 2016 campaign, was billed as a medicare for all rally. it was sanders' first trip back to south carolina since the primary battle in '16.
just as donald trump displays the shadow side of xenophobic white america, the wall street journal's choice of this particular photo with this article unconsciously displays what many republicans think but seldom say (even david duke doesn't publicly say it anymore): we can't trust black people. they are lazy and when given the opportunity they will bilk the system. (they make marvelous singers, dancers, and athletes, but aside from their entertainment value, they are really quite a burden on society.) that is what the wall street journal tacitly told its readers when it decided to publish that particular photo with that particular article.
by design or by luck, the court's nine justices are so far steering clear of hostile political debates at a time when the rest of washington is still reeling from the fallout from the november election, including a second trump impeachment trial that brought to the fore images of americans storming the u.s. capitol on jan. 6.

desantis also lamented the fact that stimulus money will be disseminated to states based on things like unemployment rates instead of population, meaning florida will be penalized for having a stronger economy than some other states, he said.
he talked about it a couple of weeks ago at his briefing about how proud he is and how much he respects the intelligence community. and i think when he walked into that and he saw it, he wanted to make sure that people knew that what you're hearing on television or in reports about this rift -- i -- i have the utmost respect for you, i honor your service, i'm proud of what you're doing and the sacrifices that you're making.
president donald trump really, really wants to fool voters into thinking he has a plan to make the health care system great again. but he really, really doesn't.
in january, agents apprehended 29,200 migrants along the border, a 78% decrease compared with may's peak. it's also the fewest number of migrants detained at the border since february 2018, when agents apprehended 26,666 people.

this is a smart, strategic, see-through steel barrier — not just a simple concrete wall. it will be deployed in the areas identified by border agents as having the greatest need, and as these agents will tell you, where walls go up, illegal crossings go way down.
many defenders of the redundant born alive act claim that if even one baby is not provided medical care after surviving an abortion, it is reason enough to beef up the law. but when it comes to far more american children being murdered by guns, many of the same people provide only thoughts and prayers, not legislation. i'm struggling to see the moral consistency here. it's hard to escape the conclusion that the sudden uptick in anti-abortion measures are more about the upcoming 2020 elections than any real interest in protecting innocent lives.
the good news is that if you lose your employer-provided coverage, which covers about a 180 million americans, that is a significant life event, which makes you then eligible to sign up for the affordable care act, cornyn said in a pbs austin interview. as you know, it has a sliding scale of subsidies up to 400% of poverty. so that's an option for people.

the president has been an erratic negotiator in recent days, throwing already-contentious talks into disarray. after initially suggesting he would support any bipartisan proposal lawmakers could come up with, trump rejected a proposal authored by graham, a republican, and senate minority whip dick durbin, d-ill., on the advice of more conservative lawmakers and his own top white house aides.

talking about his starter home, obama told me, it's been vandalized. and people at times tried to undermine its foundations. but it's held up. he's right, and now the biden administration may even have a chance to do some of the repair work obama never could, starting with extra funding for subsidies that is already in the democratic covid-19 relief bill.

mr. trump brushed aside opinion polls suggesting that the 2010 health law was becoming somewhat more popular. people hate it, the president said, but now they see that the end is coming and they're saying, 'oh, maybe we love it.' there's nothing to love. it's a disaster, folks.
the 6-3 split changes the math, potentially stripping roberts of the swing-vote status he had possessed. the five other conservatives theoretically no longer need his vote to take up a case or decide it. on the other hand, barrett, justice brett kavanaugh and justice neil gorsuch are all relative newcomers who arrived at the court following bitter senate confirmation fights. the court often pumps the brakes when new justices take their seats.
unitedhealth ended last year with about 500,000 customers in the public exchanges, and it expects membership to grow to about 800,000 during the recent open enrollment. it has said it will decide by midyear whether to continue selling in obamacare marketplaces.

the justice department has an obligation to defend the law, and it has refused to do so because it dislikes this particular law, bagley told usa today. the administration decided its dislike for the affordable care act outweighed its respect for the rule of law.
no one program is typically responsible for stopping an attack, so it is impossible to say with certainty that the program by itself stopped an attack that could not have been prevented with more conventional methods.
while the law provides for tax credits, she said, it does not authorize an appropriation for slashing deductibles and copayments. without those reductions from insurers, many consumers could not afford to buy insurance.

the democrat base is primarily energized by one animating idea, the most un-american idea of all, and that is identity politics. until the party regains its senses, which is unlikely in my lifetime, white people need not apply.
though the debates have flown somewhat under the radar, the court has cut new conservative ground in shadow docket cases, shooting down regulations on religious services intended to combat coronavirus. in another emergency case, the court ruled that death row inmates may have a spiritual adviser during their execution.
5 things to watch as gop health bill moves to the senate
the president is now encouraging senate republicans to simply repeal the affordable care act, leaving any discussion of a replacement for a later date. that idea already appears doomed, as at least three gop senators have come out against it.
spicer: i think we're done with executive orders for the day. but as i always say, stand by. but we do not have any intention to have additional executive orders today. but i believe there could be some additional ones throughout the week on trade. and we'll have further updates for you on there.
but the truth is that mr. obama's election in 2008 and re-election in 2012 had some real, quantifiable consequences. which brings me to those i.r.s. tables.
i think he's taken on a difficult job – a job that not so many people would want because it's very difficult. and he's been scrutinized every second of the way. i think he's a man who literally and honestly tries his hardest and i think that people should give him slack. … it's as if he doesn't sleep, he's just constantly working for all of us. he took this job today to work hard for us and he didn't accept a single dime. his first year as president, he's just been giving it away and he's just doing an amazing job and i think that's what we should focus on.
question: thank you. just really simple (ph), what is the average national unemployment rate?
some polling shows younger black voters have been more receptive to the policy message from candidates. a washington post/ipsos poll in early january showed biden polling at 48% with black voters and sanders second with 20% support, driven primarily by supporters under the age of 35. but even that poses its own electoral hurdle; in 2008, a year known for its focus on young voters, voters under the age of 29 made up just 14% of the electorate in the south carolina democratic primary.
mandating every american to buy government-approved health insurance was never the right solution for america. the way to make health insurance available to everyone is to lower the cost of health insurance, and that is what we will do.

trump: biden against 'oil, guns and god' campaigning in pittsburgh, pa., president donald trump portrayed democratic nominee joe biden as an opponent of oil, guns and god, and said the election is a matter of economic survival for pennsylvania. ap
for instance, as the law steamed toward final passage on wednesday, the national republican senatorial committee ― which is partially under mcconnell's control ― pressured democratic senate candidates on whether transgender women should be eligible to play sports, not on whether they supported the covid-19 relief bill.
this was really important to me, because there actually has been a lot of reporting about poor and working class white people who reject welfare and means-tested medicaid, because they're so silly. they cut off their noses despite their faces and tsk-tsk about them. but i want to talk about something that was a much more middle class issue, which is college. the somewhat novel idea of well-funded public colleges, at least one in every state, was one of the hallmarks of the american whites-only social contract for the first half of the 20th century. all of that changed with a new post-civil rights movement anti-government ethos among the white voting majority which wanted tax cuts and not public spending, which wanted a sense of pulling up the ladder and divesting from these places that had become really fraught and contested spaces like public education of the k through 12 level. public college became a place where integration was being threatened. and so it's not normally conceived of. first of all, most people don't know that we have so much student loan debt because of government cutbacks of states spending less per capita on public college despite a growing tax base and a federal shift from grants to loans. people don't know that it's government cutbacks that created the student debt problem. and they certainly typically don't map the issue of race and racism onto it.

i remember them walking around in their bright orange caps. remember that? and so a lot has been learned from the mistakes of howard dean by the bernie sanders campaign. what was interesting about what jeff was just saying is that they're figuring it's around 160,000 that they need to get out.
the law applies to health insurers, hospitals, and health plans administered by or receiving federal funds from hhs.
i would love for joe biden to read a book called the color of law richard rothstein, which really helps explain the way that government segregated america. he's got a big commitment to racial equity at the center of his administration, and he's got to see all the different ways that it's government policy — many of those policies that are still on the books — that are segregating us and keeping us apart.
his critics have also been circulating an opposition research document trying to tie kavanaugh to alex kozinski, the former federal judge who was accused by several former clerks of sexual harassment. kavanaugh clerked for kozinski from 1990 to 1991 and is not himself accused of any wrongdoing.
jesse weber, an attorney and anchor on the law & crime network, told cbs this morning saturday that the ruling was not unexpected.
what's emerging on capitol hill today is a portrait of a republican party struggling to find a way to govern. so here's what happened in the last just 24 hours. majority leader mitch mcconnell was hoping to vote on the senate's revised health care bill this week. and then last night, he had to abandon that bill when two senators announced that they wouldn't support it. now his plan is to repeal the affordable care act now and figure out what to replace it with later. but it looks like he doesn't have the votes for that either. npr congressional correspondent susan davis joins us now to talk about the fallout over health care. hello there, sue.
major insulin makers lilly, sanofi sa and novo nordisk have been making some of their life-sustaining diabetes medicine available at lower costs to counter heavy criticism from lawmakers and patients, manas and michael add. …t1international, which represents people with type 1 diabetes, said lilly's half-price insulin has been difficult to obtain and said the latest move 'may be nothing more than a further pr response to continued pressure from advocates.'
moreover, the notion that obamacare, medicare and medicaid restrict freedom is absurd, reminiscent of the pre-new deal argument that abolishing child labor impairs the freedom of employers and children to contract for labor.
denver health medical center, for example, opened a new $26.9 million clinic in the city's southwest in 2016 to provide care to an area lacking in health services and saw more patients within six months than it had expected over two years. the health system planned to build or remodel five more facilities based on the new clinic's success.
roughly 20 million. about two-thirds of them joined medicaid as a result of the expanded eligibility. the rest found coverage by comparison-shopping among private insurers at government-run online marketplaces, where policies include subsidies for people who make as much as 400% of the federal poverty level. (the expanded version of medicaid enrolls people earning up to 138% of the poverty line.) even with obamacare in place, 28.9 million americans lacked coverage in 2019, two million more than in 2016, according to the kaiser family foundation. the u.s. is an outlier among developed countries by not having universal health coverage.
hawley called the publisher's decision orwellian. law professor jonathan turley described the actions of social media companies as mccarthyism. in a letter to colleagues, rep. devin nunes (r-calif.) described some of these developments as an oppressive attack on our fundamental freedoms. parler ceo john matze characterized the banishment of his platform as an attack on competition. this week, on the floor of the house of representatives, freshman rep. marjorie taylor greene (r-ga.) wore a face mask emblazoned with the word censored as she made remarks broadcast live to a national audience.
he isn't stopping – particularly with the health care system that bears his names in peril. if the senate wants to repeal and replace obamacare, obama seemed to be saying sunday night, they're going to have to go through me.
but we're not seeing leadership from the administration to get that done. instead, they continue to send weaponry to baghdad, who doesn't pass it onto the peshmerga, and it doesn't get put to use effectively.
but our partners must meet their financial obligations.
the law has allowed something like 20 million people to get insurance, bringing the number of uninsured to a record low. predictions that the law would cause national health care costs to skyrocket have proved spectacularly wrong, as have predictions that the law would cause the deficit to explode or kill the job market.
but trump and mccain repeatedly sparred with one another. in 2015, after mccain had said trump's platform had fired up the crazies, trump had mocked mccain's imprisonment in the vietnam war, saying: i like people that weren't captured.

the savings from this new cut account for less than half a percent of what the federal government is expected to spend to subsidized private coverage and medicaid next year.
biden will need to use the regulatory process to simplify payment for abortion coverage that is part of health plans under the affordable care act and to make it harder for employers to opt out of including contraceptive services in their health plans for workers.
-- sen. doug jones (d-ala.) asked the fec to investigate an alleged disinformation campaign by democratic strategists to help him win his 2017 special election. the new york times's alan blinder reports: 'such deceptive tactics have no place in american politics and must be repudiated by those involved in our political system,' mr. jones wrote in a letter to ellen l. weintraub, a democratic member of the commission. neither mr. jones nor his campaign is believed to have known about, much less approved of, any of the deception. mr. jones had quickly pledged to seek an inquiry, but his notarized letter on wednesday … represented his first formal step in support of an investigation by the commission.
insistence upon these abortion restrictions undoubtedly reflects genuine policy preferences from conservatives. it also reflects a political calculation ― namely, that republicans can't afford to alienate supporters who are strongly opposed to abortion, obamacare, or both.
congress has required that the cost of coronavirus testing be covered by insurers (though testing is still not always available). what's less clear is how much your treatment will cost you if you get seriously ill and need to be hospitalized for covid-19.
an emergency declaration by trump would be certain to face legal challenges that could drag on for years. but it would give the president an exit strategy from the budget impasse and end the government shutdown.
the other big topics on newsom's agenda tuesday were california's long-derided high-speed rail (newsom doesn't want a los angeles to san francisco run but supports developing such a train in the fertile central valley, whose residents deal with high levels of pollution and long commute times); education spending (the state currently ranks near the bottom nationally on spending per student); and the state's newly bankrupt utility, pacific gas & electric.
but that chance never came, because republicans focused on repeal and, at times, trying to sabotage the program outright. think about medicare, obama said. that was a big political fight, but once it got passed, everybody moved on and tried to make it work. bush's drug benefit program, right? it was a contentious issue. but once it got passed, even those democrats who had opposed it tried to make it work.
the plan also aims to eliminate poverty in the united states, and includes a job guarantee program that offers a living wage job to every person who wants one, according to a draft text of the plan that circulated around congress this month.

scott detrow, byline: the day after the debate, sanders was in carson city. his voice was still hoarse. and he was clearly still thinking about the night before, when several other candidates criticized his plan to entirely do away with private health insurance.
nearly three-quarters of americans said senate republicans should discuss their health care plans publicly, according to a cbs news poll released tuesday. a quarter of the public, by contrast, said it should be developed in private. it also found 57 percent said obamacare needs some changes, 28 percent said it should be repealed entirely and 12 percent said it should be kept in place.
trump later noted that he has always disliked the concept of shaking hands: if there was ever a time you could convince people not to shake hands, this could be it, he mused, before lamenting that politicians unfortunately are required to shake some hands.

we are joined tonight by one of those law enforcement heroes: ice special agent elvin hernandez. when elvin was a boy, he and his family legally immigrated to the united states from the dominican republic. at the age of eight, elvin told his dad he wanted to become a special agent. today, he leads investigations into the scourge of international sex trafficking. elvin says: if i can make sure these young girls get their justice, i've done my job. thanks to his work and that of his colleagues, more than 300 women and girls have been rescued from horror and more than 1,500 sadistic traffickers have been put behind bars in the last year.
his demeanor belied roberts' constant admonition that judges are impartial and non-partisan, ruling without fear or favor.
i wrote this book because i think it's important to talk about the benefits of moving beyond drained pool politics for all people, including white people. we have reached the economic and moral limits of the zero-sum world view that was handed to us at the founding of this nation. and i do believe that today's inequality insecurity dysfunction has as its unifying core this majority-white belief in a zero-sum racial hierarchy. and so i'm trying to make this an invitation to white americans to join in, to release this really false and illusory idea that they're so different from people of color and so much better than people of color that they don't want to be in fellowship with people of color, get a sense of patriotism about who we are as americans, all of us, and move forward together. joe biden, in his first speech on race as president, was issuing a bunch of racial equity executive orders. and he actually said, for too long, we've allowed a narrow, cramped view of the promise of this nation to fester. we've bought the world view that america is a zero-sum game in many cases. if you succeed, i fail. if you get ahead, i fall behind. if you get the job, i lose mine. maybe worst of all, if i hold you down, i lift myself up. but racism is corrosive, it's destructive, and it's costly. it costs every american, not just those who have felt the sting of racial injustice.

your options to get covered if you're one of roughly 28 million americans who were uninsured even before the covid-19 crisis depend on where you live. medicaid may work for you, but the rules for eligibility (including the income cut-off) vary by state. states that have not expanded medicaid — which is how obamacare broadened coverage to 12 million previously uninsured people — have more restrictive rules about who qualifies. according to the kaiser foundation, nearly 6 million adults already qualified for medicaid before covid-19 but were not enrolled.

cnn's brianna keilar explains why many republicans are hesitant to take the coronavirus vaccine.
of course i am concerned, said gov. brian sandoval, the republican governor of nevada, where about 300,000 people have gained medicaid coverage. i am someone who elected to expand medicaid. that's been very beneficial to my state, and i want to be sure those individuals can keep their coverage.
it's no surprise that someone named obama vetoed a bill repealing obamacare, house speaker paul ryan, r-wisconsin, said in a video released friday. this law will collapse under its own weight or it will be repealed...next year, if we're sending this bill to a republican president, it will get signed into law. obamacare will be gone.
donald trump's longtime adviser roger stone said monday that the gop presidential nominee should release his tax returns.
rep. abigail spanberger (d-va.), who represents a district trump won in 2016, said at a closed-door caucus meeting yesterday that democrats are losing the messaging war in her district and need to be clearer about the border security measures they support. if i am getting comments and contact from my constituents expressing concern that the democrats are not prioritizing security, then i think we can do better, she told her colleagues, per politico.
they would all later face a political balancing act of embracing the measure but also, to varying degrees, distancing themselves from two of its core goals: completely eliminating the private health insurance industry, and increasing taxes to pay for coverage. both warren and harris, especially, ended up twisting themselves in political and policy knots, as sanders unapologetically campaigned for a platform he conceded would raise taxes (but lower health costs overall, he said).

democrats in january 2018 refused to vote on a spending bill in an attempt to negotiate a plan for undocumented immigrants.
i don't think it is a wise policy to be negotiating with terrorists. the obama administration has gone down that road. for example, in the negotiations for sergeant bergdahl, it released five senior taliban terrorists. there are now multiple reports that one or more of them have returned to actively fighting against americans, trying to -- trying to kill americans.

[t]his court leaves women workers to fend for themselves, to seek contraceptive coverage from sources other than their employer's insurer, and, absent another available source of funding, to pay for contraceptive services out of their own pockets, she wrote, joined by justice sonia sotomayor. faced with high out-of-pocket costs, many women will forgo contraception … or resort to less effective contraceptive methods.
biden's promise to appoint federal judges who support the supreme court's 1973 roe v. wade decision establishing abortion rights is a long-term effort that may not be as successful as president donald trump's judicial accomplishments.
but now, he said, the company is driving me bonkers because it has fed this political frenzy that obamacare doesn't work. it's total spin and unanchored in reality.
short downplayed the merits of an even shorter stopgap, arguing that negotiators need more time to reach an immigration deal to determine the fate of the hundreds of thousands of people in the daca program.
several senators have suggested that the gop bill should keep at least some of the taxes, perhaps even including the widely panned tax on high-value employer plans known as the cadillac tax. the logic, according to aides, is that senators could delay the implementation of some taxes or promise to repeal others later, when they take up their next big agenda item: tax reform. but gop leaders do not have a clear path forward on that, and conservatives are anxious about leaving any of the aca taxes in place.
donald trump just called hillary clinton 'the devil'
according to the most recent official estimate, gdp grew by 2.3% last year. it grew 2.9% in 2018 and in 2015, before trump took office. it grew 3.8% in 2004 and 3.5% in 2005.
the fellow americans ad was just the latest to pop up as the coronavirus pandemic worsens. americans for public trust, another outside nonprofit led by former nevada attorney general adam laxalt, is claiming that similar anti-trump messaging is coming from a series of organizations tied to arabella advisors -- a dark money nonprofit providing help to liberal groups. specifically, it houses the new venture fund and sixteen thirty fund, both of which have supported another democrat-aligned group -- american bridge -- that's hitting trump on the coronavirus response.
even though the law was passed many years ago, the rollout is much more recent, and some components haven't even been implemented, said representative lee zeldin, republican of new york. for a few years the debate over obamacare was one about how it was going to impact individuals, families and businesses in the future. and when it actually started, the debate shifted and people had their own personal stories to tell.

it's unlikely that democratic sen. bob menendez is going to lose his re-election effort in new jersey in november, but it is not outside the realm of possibility. after a hung jury was unable to come to a verdict on federal corruption-related charges, the government dropped the case against menendez, but the specter of his alleged misdeeds overshadows his campaign.

on balance, the senate bill would have reduced deficits by a net $321 billion over 10 years, 2017 to 2026, when accounting for the lost tax revenues, according to a joint analysis of the bill by the joint committee on taxation and the nonpartisan congressional budget office. (the analysis was based on the version posted to the senate budget committee website as of june 26, 2017.)
at one point, newsom thanked trump – and he meant it. the governor was alluding to trump's state of the union comments about the need to bring down the cost of prescription drugs.

we were brought up to believe that we live in the greatest country in the world, but until a few years ago millions and millions of us had no access to health insurance at all, he said. you know, before 2014 if you were born with congenital heart disease like my son was, there was a good chance you'd never be able to get health insurance because you had a pre-existing condition. you were born with a pre-existing condition and if your parents didn't have medical insurance you might not live long enough to even get denied because of a pre-existing condition. if your baby is going to die and it doesn't have to, it shouldn't matter how much money you make.
despite decisively losing the primary, de leon was endorsed by state democratic party, and some progressives in the state hope that he can ride an insurgent campaign to victory over the 85-year-old incumbent.
donald trump held two campaign rallies today, which is a bit of an unorthodox move for a candidate on caucus night. and we're also expecting him to appear at some caucus sites. which ones, we don't know. and the same goes for his children. they have been all over the state today, doing some retail stops. and they too will appear at caucus sites.
that pessimism can be heard throughout this town of about 7,600 residents. while the law was described as historic, many here do not perceive that it helped them. like many other states, pennsylvania re-branded their expanded offering of federal insurance program for the poor, fearing that medicaid which is also often referred to as medical assistance would be off-putting; now it is called healthy pa.

it's a book about the economy, but i do include a chapter on democracy, because on the list of nice things that we can't seem to have because of racism, a functioning representative democracy is pretty high up on the list. and so i traced the history of all of the ways that, from our founding, elites attacked the bedrock of what is a pretty bold and beautiful idea, which is self governance and representative democracy, in order to keep room for racism and slavery and racial subjugation. i have an extremely long section of notes in this book that is kind of a joke with my publisher. but one of the longest notes — i think actually the longest note is what i put in the notes instead of going into long detail about colfax, louisiana, which is a story of one of the many but one of the most deadly anti-democracy racial mob violence stories in american history. i did finish the book long before january 6th, but colfax, louisiana, is in the book. and colfax, louisiana, is the story of a white mob storming the courthouse where an election result was going to be certified for a reconstruction era governor who won office with a multiracial voting population. and they attacked the courthouse. black people tried to defend the courthouse. they slaughtered 100 black neighbors, and then burned the courthouse. this white, racist mob was willing to burn down the edifice of their own government rather than submit to a multiracial democracy.

americans generally don't file for bankruptcy because of the price of food, clothing, technology, housing or any other product or service. it is not a coincidence that health care, the one and only item permitted to be sold in the u.s. at different prices for different people, has imposed tremendous financial hardship — and was the top cause of personal bankruptcies in 2013. obamacare was stillborn because it allowed the predatory pricing system to continue.

schilling: those are all common sense.
i always think of donald trump in this model, because trump is somebody who i think you really see had a temperament oriented towards this kind of zero-sum thinking, and then applied it to everything despite being at the very top of the ladder. i mean, he's somebody who was racist, but also his understanding, as far as i could tell, of all relationships between america and other countries was that we were either winning or losing the transaction. his understanding of all business deals was he was either winning the deal or he was losing the deal. his understanding of all human relations was he was either winning and dominating or losing and being made weak. and it always struck me in him and in its appeal to people that it is actually, sadly, much harder to make people think about the ways in which a world can be positive-sum, the ways in which a deal can benefit both sides simultaneously, than the ways in which it can be zero-sum. and so there's this real danger of people who have either felt this or seen this or oriented towards it, and then that becomes the only way they can think about life.

another conservative pundit, ben shapiro, was even more direct: if somebody who is 81 dies of covid-19, that is not the same thing as somebody who is 30 dying of covid-19, shapiro said, adding later, if grandma dies in a nursing home at age 81, that's tragic and it's terrible, also the life expectancy in the united states is 80, so that is not the same thing.
nashville has been ground zero for debate about school choice. the expansion of publicly funded, privately run charter schools has defined the last three local school board races. and in the state legislature, bills to bring school vouchers are under debate. trump's secretary of education betsy devos is an ardent champion of charter schools and vouchers, which give parents public dollars to send their children to private schools.

every day approximately 11 ohioans die from unintended drug overdoses, sen. rob portman (r-ohio) said in a statement. this crisis is overwhelming ohio and our country. the funding in this proposal would be another important step in the fight against this epidemic.
jonathan ernst / reuters demonstrators at the supreme court in 2015, which is the last time a lawsuit threatening the affordable care act got a hearing before the justices.
sen. jeff merkley (d-oregon) asked mick mulvaney to weigh in on the dispute over inauguration crowd sizes:
before going any further today, i want to address the horrific shooting that took place yesterday at the capital gazette newsroom in annapolis, maryland. this attack shocked the conscience of our nation, and filled our hearts with grief… pic.twitter.com/lalxghk04b — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) june 29, 2018
rovner: absolutely. the administration says that that won't necessarily be a problem. it will go back and audit people's claims and compare what they put on their insurance applications to their tax returns. and if they end up owing money they'll have to pay it back, which will be the case when the computer matching system is in place also, by the way.
while most of the rest of the media ignored him, breitbart news traveled to his district that august recess to profile him and provide a detailed report on his then-quixotic effort to change congress for the better by removing someone who, as speaker, had pushed a variety of deals with now former president barack obama that left the country worse off.
we've got great people in our audience, trump said. she's surrounded by doctors – no thanks to obamacare.
bash: and having been on the ground there, do you think that this was an unfortunate but maybe --
does -- does the president trump see a national security component to these trade deals and is he concerned that now china will write the rules for asia-pacific trade?
just months ago, 11 jewish-americans were viciously murdered in an anti-semitic attack on the tree of life synagogue in pittsburgh. swat officer timothy matson raced into the gunfire and was shot seven times chasing down the killer. timothy has just had his 12th surgery — but he made the trip to be here with us tonight. officer matson: we are forever grateful for your courage in the face of evil.
a biden presidency would function as a regency, run by obama alumni in pursuit of sanders policies. neither he nor his vice president would lead these groups, but take direction from them. the real power would be behind the scenes.
over and over again, gop leaders argued that their proposal represented the party's best chance to kill obamacare. but efforts to corral republicans failed, in part because leaders were dealing with two separate groups with divergent interests.
clinton went even further, arguing that sanders' plan would empower republican governors to eliminate health insurance for low-income and middle-income americans.
this is an absolutely classic error, it is the kind of error that ends recoveries, blanchflower said, in an interview.
garcia-navarro: so the president and others, as i mentioned, point to a sharp rise in insurance premiums in arizona since obamacare became law. how big an issue is this for the people of arizona?
so that is one sort of benchmark that bernie sanders wants to beat, that howard dean crash here in iowa.
arizona sen. kyrsten sinema, one of the eight democrats who voted against sanders' amendment, said in a statement that she is open to having a separate debate in congress over the minimum wage, just not through this reconciliation process being used to pass covid relief.
levin: one behind on third and you routinely and it's not that long ago you routinely pitch past six and seven innings which really isn't done anymore. this is a tremendous record.
i just wish he didn't use social media quite as much as he does. otherwise i think he's on the right track. i hope he gets it done. tax reform is significant in trying to recreate the medical industry as far as, you know, coverage for people, trying to get more people included with better coverage. that's a mess right now. obamacare i think is not on the right track. there's too many loose ends that aren't being addressed.
ryan also shed crocodile tears over the prospect of gridlock if democrats take the majority. really? since trump took office, what are his accomplishments other than an unpopular tax plan (see above)? did he push through a new health-care plan to replace the affordable care act? forge a deal to protect beneficiaries of the deferred action for childhood arrivals program? garner support for major infrastructure project? no, no and no. (he did push through a budget that exploded the debt, however.)
as breitbart news reported, 47 and 40 percent of gop voters respectively say immigration and national security are the leading issues in their opinion. meanwhile, only 11 percent of gop voters said taxes were the most important issue in the country, ranking lower than more obscure issues like school safety and defense spending.
the other campaigns know what they are up against.
gaffney was actually one of the witnesses that single-payer advocates put forward to testify. but the rules committee nixed his appearance, along with those of more than a dozen other suggested witnesses.
one important answer would be to spend a bit more money. … better subsidies would help enrollments, which in turn would probably bring in more insurers. but just in case, why not revive the idea of a public option — insurance sold directly by the government, for those who choose it? at the very least, there ought to be public plans available in areas no private insurer wants to serve.
it's really amazing because i'm just so back and forth and back and forth every day. and every hour of every day.

badlands national park tweeted out facts about climate change -- then they were deleted (see below). democratic lawmakers applauded the rogue ex-employee who posted them:
the problems for the brooklyn-born vermonter didn't end with the 2016 election. his april 2017 decision to campaign for democrat heath mello, an abortion-rights opponent who ran unsuccessfully for mayor of omaha, nebraska, raised eyebrows on the left.
the hearings will be a venue for democrats to air their criticisms of republicans' response to the pandemic, as well as to gauge how the senators — and barrett — react to the public safety threat. barrett contracted the virus and recovered from it over the summer, according to the washington post. the white house said on october 2 she tested negative after the september 26 event.
immigrants must have lived legally in the united states for five years to be eligible to receive snap benefits. a few other immigrant groups — refugees, asylees and the elderly — also are eligible to receive food stamps. undocumented immigrants are not eligible, although many of them work and pay taxes. immigrants living in the united states are twice as likely as u.s. citizens to be poor, despite working at the same rate.
burwell agrees. is it an important year to make sure that we're getting more folks in and to make that risk pool better? yes, she said.
cruz: oh, look, of course we all understand the agony of the families.
as he did on the campaign trail, trump then tied the epidemic — and his drug strategy — to immigration at the southern border.
the arkansas proposal would move about 60,000 people out of the program, by lowering the income threshold to the federal poverty level.
the last time wisconsin voted for a republican for president was 1984. that all changed on november 8. we go to kenosha county to ask why.
the case, known as california v. texas, is the third such challenge to reach the high court since the law's 2010 enactment. and the stakes are as high as ever. if the justices wipe out the affordable care act, as 18 republican state officials and the trump administration have asked it to do, roughly 21 million americans could lose health insurance, according to independent projections.
more money for the opioid epidemic. the senate's initial bill offered $2 billion to address the opioid crisis for 2018. this version would offer about $45 billion over 10 years, which is what republicans ohio gop sen. rob portman and west virginia sen. shelley moore capito had requested at one point. however, some experts say that around $4.5 billion a year is nowhere near enough for combating america's massive opioid epidemic, as the new york times reported in june.
but what would biden do? biden's campaign has a seven-point plan to beat covid-19 and other proposals for health care and economic recovery that support that vision. npr asked his advisers for details on his approach, which includes some familiar elements, as well as some less-expected ones.
but health policy experts argue that, so far, there aren't clear signs that bertolini's assessment is accurate. cynthia cox, associate director of a program focused on health reform and private insurance at the kaiser family foundation said that in a true death spiral, the people buying insurance on the exchanges should be a progressively sicker group of people each year. although the people buying insurance have been sicker than insurers projected, cox said there isn't evidence that the pool of people is getting sicker.
for a tool that's been mostly used for partisan purposes for the last 20 years, its name does sound odd. it stems from the technical purpose in the law creating it, that the bills that receive protection from the filibuster are meant to reconcile current law and pending bills in congress to the fiscal targets in the budget resolution.
but i'm -- i feel good about the thing. he's not going to give in. he is not going to end this shutdown until he gets his money.
the black families never knew the glory days of the well-funded public pool. we started seeing backyard pools crop up around the country and these private members-only swimming clubs — over 100 of them in the d.c. area alone after pool integration — these private clubs that you had to pay. and it was a tangible example, like of course, massive resistance to brown in virginia, where they closed dozens of public schools, where once the idea of the public included people of color, not only was the public no longer good, but white people didn't want public goods at all.
still, the insurance isn't as comprehensive as one might imagine a federal judge or supreme court justice would get. unlike the so-called cadillac plans that top corporate executives often enjoy that fully cover a host of health care expenses, the federal plans have deductibles, premium costs, co-pays and other out-of-pocket expenses.
of course, democrats may not always agree on every detail of the best way to bring about each and every one of these changes, obama continued. but we do agree that they're needed. and that only happens if we win this election.
from the outset of the campaign, sanders and elizabeth warren jumped on medicare-for-all, dragging others along with them, convinced that health care was the issue that would topple republicans. ironically, they might have been right. the gop has made a total hash of overhauling obamacare and proposing a better alternative, in part thanks to the late sen. john mccain, who single-handedly undermined the party's health-care initiative.
i don't believe it is necessary to put american boots on the ground if we are arming the peshmerga. they're fighting there. just today, they didn't ask us for boots on the ground, but what they did say is they need the weaponry to stand up and destroy isis. and the peshmerga on the ground, combined with overwhelming american airpower, can take out isis.
such discussions are becoming more important as baby boomers reach their golden years. by 2030, an estimated 72 million americans will be 65 or over, nearly one-fifth of the u.s. population.

governor greg abbott today held a press conference in houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session. the governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his state of the state address in february. governor abbott was joined for the press conference by senator paul bettencourt and representative briscoe cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in texas
the white house was bolstered by a pervasive posture from democrats on capitol hill: that letting the new president down in his first legislative push was never an option. even as democrats have privately grumbled about certain aspects of the bill -- whether it be the overall scope, the eligibility for who receives stimulus checks or the rise in the minimum wage -- most members acknowledge they'll ultimately vote for it.
there's a reason, after all, why republicans couldn't manage to repeal the law in 2017, despite controlling both the house and the senate — the law benefited too many voters by that point.

yeah, that's actually a really good way of thinking about it. i totally agree that the crisis of affordable housing is a great example of racism costing everyone. and i also, in my mind, when i think about the zero-sum logic growing out of control and leaping off the rails, as you said — i think about the financial crisis. i think about a totally racialized mortgage market where, for generations, the idea that black and brown people were risky — so risky that the government drew lines around black and brown neighborhoods and said, we will not guarantee a backstop — the mortgages, as we were doing for the entire mortgage market, of any mortgages sold in these neighborhoods, because it's just too risky. never substantiated. never substantiated, this idea, but it was just a common sense that black people are going to be risky. that then was replaced very quickly by a lightly regulated mortgage market in the 1990s that, at the end of redlining, which happened in the late 1970s, you had about 10 years of fits and starts of black people emerging into the mainstream mortgage market. and then you have the advent of the subprime mortgage, which was totally justified. it was pretty zero-sum. it was like, these lenders can make double what they were making by increasing the interest rates on these loans. and it will cost handsomely the borrower. but it's ok, because what's happening is these lenders are pricing for risk.
biden took sweeping executive action on immigration shortly after being sworn in, moving swiftly to undo many trump administration policies. but he told reporters at the time, there's a long way to go on the issue, and acknowledged that legislation was needed for a lot of his priorities.
joe biden decisively won south carolina's democratic presidential primary on saturday, according to projections, giving the former vice president his first victory in the 2020 nominating battle and a burst of momentum ahead of the critical super tuesday contests next week.
so, freed from the need to make a case for the nominee — although several senators are — republicans are using the opportunity for broader comments about what they call the strength of the judicial system at which barrett is poised to sit at the apogee.
insurers criticized the payment freeze, arguing it harms consumers and will cause turmoil for the insurance industry as they move to finalize their 2019 rates.
the rejection of the gop plan is an important historical marker in our interminable health-care debate. the american people were presented with the first genuine effort at a gop consensus ideological alternative to obamacare — one that would do away with the aca's effort to guarantee free or affordable coverage through government spending and regulations — and decided they preferred sticking with the latter. the quinnipiac poll also found that 51 percent oppose repeal and 61 percent disapprove of trump's handling of the issue. as jonathan cohn puts it, the aca has shifted the expectations of what government should do ― and of what a decent society looks like. there are zero indications that trump and gop leaders are capable of acknowledging this possibility.

among the many political realities of 2009 frequently forgotten today are that democrats had only 58 senate seats for the first few months, because of litigation over minnesota's close senate race (eventually democrat al franken won the seat) and because pennsylvania sen. arlen specter was still a republican (eventually he switched parties).

while few americans take joy in filing their annual returns, it's crucial to do a thorough job with your taxes if you're a self-employed individual. that's not just because it's the law, but also because there may be big deductions you're eligible for that allow you to keep more of that hard-earned money instead of paying up to uncle sam.
the national security agency's bulk collection of american telephone metadata, which included the telephone numbers that originate and receive calls, as well as the time and date of those calls but not their content, has proven controversial. there has been robust debate as to whether it has actually contributed to the prevention of terrorist attacks.
senator dianne feinstein of california, the ranking member of the committee, has been criticized for questioning barrett's catholic faith during the 2017 confirmation hearings for barrett's nomination to the federal appeals court on which she currently serves. if feinstein or any other democrats ask questions about how barrett's faith influences her decision-making on critical issues like abortion, republicans may take the opportunity to paint them as being anti-catholic.

trump and congressional republicans have long said they want to repeal and replace obamacare but have yet to offer legislation addressing what would take its place.
tasini: well, frankly, and with all due respect, the media did not catch this. it's very simple: bernie sanders is calling for political revolution. he is running against somebody who represents the status quo.
such a plan would be a boon for american taxpayers, who currently spend about $57.4 billion a year on paying for the welfare, crime, and schooling costs of the country's mass importation of 1.5 million new, mostly low skilled legal immigrants every year.
but then the quiet voices became a loud chorus — as thousands of citizens now spoke out together, from cities small and large, all across our country.
the delay opened the door to more criticism from republicans who say the law is not ready for prime-time -- and ultimately want it repealed anyway.
speaking to an audience in this small southeastern new hampshire city the morning after delayed partial returns from the iowa caucuses showed biden in fourth place -- trailing buttigieg, sanders and sen. elizabeth warren of massachusetts -- the former vice president admitted, i'm not going to sugarcoat it. we took a gut punch in iowa.
among the provision's chief proponents was sen. johnny isakson (r-ga.), who thought the incendiary portrayals of it were nuts.
in an effort to regain his footing, sanders has sought to emphasize to voters that while other candidates, including warren and harris, have adopted signature policies like medicare for all, the integrity with which he would fight for them is unrivaled.
but we can only get there together.
and it may be possible to avoid the crowding-out phenomenon, economist conor sen recently argued (sen, to be clear, isn't a proponent of the plans — in fact, he says he feels skepticism about the idea). his idea is to make sure the program's funding is countercyclical — that is, that it shrinks in good times and grows in bad.
members of the freedom caucus met with vice president mike pence before their meeting with paul, and nothing pence said changed the caucus's determination to oppose any health care reform bill that does not end the individual mandate and the essential benefits provisions of obamacare. meadows said, we had a really good conversation. i am not going to comment on private conversations.

the petition filed by supporters of the law is a long shot bid because the supreme court does not usually like to take up an issue until it has made its way through the lower courts. but if the necessary four justices agree to hear the case and expedite it for this term -- it would mean that the justices would render a decision concerning the fate of the controversial law this spring, just as the presidential election gears up.

that will be the distillation of our message to the american people in the coming weeks, that help is here for them and their families, jennifer o'malley dillon, the white house deputy chief of staff who served as biden's campaign manager, wrote in a memo to staffers. and we're going to carry that message to every corner of our country through travel, local press, and direct engagement in communities with the president, the vice president, the first lady, the second gentleman, cabinet members, and top officials from throughout the administration.

insurance companies could still raise premiums to offset some of the lost revenue from caps on out-of-pocket costs. the law, though, does aim to keep premium increases in check, and barring any other delays would still prevent health insurers from denying coverage or charging more based on pre-existing conditions.

home-office deduction: many self-employed people work out of their homes, and it's easier than ever before to access related tax breaks thanks to a simplified home office deduction, said lisa greene-lewis, a cpa and tax expert for turbotax. the irs allows you to declare $5 per square foot of your home used for business up to 300 square feet, or a maximum of $1,500, as long as the space is used exclusively and regularly for business-related use. and if you have significant expenses including utilities, maintenance or even mortgage interest on the home itself, you can itemize your individual home office expenses for an even bigger break above that maximum.
yang: i think that the attitude you are describing, while it does apply to a certain subset of americans, applies to a very, very low proportion of them. and i'm confident of this because when i campaign around the country, at every event i go to, someone comes up to me in the line afterwards and says, i voted for donald trump. this time i'm voting for you. one survey in new hampshire said that 10 percent of the voters who voted for trump would vote for me over trump in the general election. another survey said that 18 percent of college republicans would choose me over the president. now, this is not everyone. but this is enough. you don't need to convert 80 percent of the president's followers. you need to convert, let's call it 20 percent. so this attitude that you're describing is very real. but i believe that it does not contain 100 percent of the folks who voted for donald trump. and i know this because, again, they come to me at my events every single time and say, you're my candidate this time..

the trump administration and several republican-led states are arguing at the supreme court that the affordable care act should now be void — an argument that would end existing protections for those with preexisting conditions.

(that's significantly more than the uninsured projections for republican house and senate replacement bills.)
60 million americans are still out there not sheltering in place and instead tirelessly working to keep everything going for the rest of us. you keep the electricity flowing and the internet running, food and groceries moving. you are putting your own health on the line to ensure the rest of us are living as normally as possible. and then there are the tens of millions of americans who have lost jobs and businesses, or who fear that they're just about to. your anxiety about the virus is coupled with worry over having a paycheck, covering the mortgage, keeping the lights on, and buying food.
what we are witnessing today is the renewal of the american spirit.

kelly: right. that's not the point. agreement on the underlying principle.
he added that the house should signal to the senate that it won't pass another omnibus or cr.
deutch said the legislation is a transformative plan to boost vaccinations, offer financial relief and send children back to school and workers back to their job.
now, nominee or not, he could do it again. as we face down the covid-19 pandemic, bernie has an unexpected chance, and an obligation. a chance to change the conversation once again, and an obligation to push joe biden as far to the left on health care as he can. he has substantial leverage to do so.
carpenter: one of the things, i think they have learned a lot of lessons from the barack obama campaign, which one thing broadly i think we should all recognize. before it was conventional wisdom a senator could not win. now we have not only ted cruz doing well, but also senator sanders.
kaine and bennet want medicare-x to hitch a ride on a reconciliation bill. congress can only pass one of these bills a year and is using last year's vehicle to do coronavirus relief. two more budget reconciliation bills will be available during the current congress — and kaine and bennet say they've revamped medicare-x with an eye toward them.
really going out on a limb… gillibrand backs biden - wapo: sen. kirsten gillibrand (d-n.y.) threw her support behind former vice president joe biden on thursday, joining a dozen other former competitors to back his bid to become the democratic nominee for president. 'he's the absolute best candidate to defeat president trump, and i think he is the person who has gained the trust and the respect of the american people in a way that no one else has,' gillibrand said in an interview with the washington post. 'the truth is he's run the strongest campaign.'
house freedom caucus chairman mark meadows said wednesday that the freedom caucus needed a seat in leadership.
they were encouraged by the president's own outreach directly to republicans and a high-profile oval office meeting where biden invited 10 republicans to discuss their own ideas directly with him.
numerous media outlets, including cnn , have provided comparisons between the arrests during wednesday's siege and those made during the summer's black lives matters protests in the capital.
meadows was also critical in helping trump fight back one of the most vicious and unhinged conspiracies against a sitting president in history, which ultimately ended in the president's acquittal by the u.s. senate after the democrat-led house impeached him. a member of the president's team of house members fighting back against the coup attempt by the deep state, meadows was critical in securing the president's position and holding back the plotters. the coup attempt started out with various leftist and media attacks claiming russian collusion with trump's 2016 campaign that eventually led to the special counsel robert mueller's investigation that cleared trump in the en, which then led to the renewed attacks on the ukraine front.
one of the most dramatic moments for me was the first trip to new hampshire where governor sununu had 8,000 high school students gathered and 50 mothers stood before them holding large pictures of their children who died from drug overdoses, sessions said in an interview.
and a political threat continues to loom over obamacare, the republican congress is again vowing to develop a plan to replace the law, although they've made little noticeable progress since obama signed the aca six years ago this month.
although undoubtedly under the clean-sweep scenario there is the negative implications for risk assets to be considered, stemming from a democratic legislative agenda including higher corporate taxes and increased capital-gains taxes, creagh added.
but there is also a positive argument for supporting biden.
despite that, highlands cfo andursky said he barely noticed the increase — the threat of closure is a daily concern, he said. it seems like you're taking two steps forward, three steps back, andursky said. it's not like i can look to five years out — because i have to worry about tomorrow. i can't worry about next year.
as president trump makes the case that his leadership has saved lives in the pandemic and ushered in record-fast vaccine and therapeutics development, joe biden has described trump's handling of covid-19 as totally irresponsible and points to american's health as the nation's top domestic issue.
a cruz supporter sat at the bar at the next stop, drinking a beer. people waited and cruz showed up — only to tape a segment for hannity that would air on fox news later in the night.
but brooks-lasure was championed by allies on capitol hill, including the congressional black caucus. as we wrote a few weeks ago, mandy cohen, the north carolina health secretary and a fellow obama veteran, was also considered for the role.
(cnn) sixty-one: that's the number of arrests washington, dc, police made the day rioters laid siege to the capitol in protest of president-elect joe biden's electoral victory.
it is not clear whether the administration will establish a special enrollment period for the 32 states with markets it manages. (there are also six state-run exchanges that use the federal platform, and those states can't proceed without federal sign-off.) the administration continues to argue in court for the law's invalidation. in a press briefing on sunday, president trump reiterated that he would like to eliminate obamacare altogether and replace it with an unspecified program he prefers.
there's another potential hiccup. it's not entirely clear whether all the elements of medicare-x could go into a budget reconciliation bill, which can only include provisions directly related to federal spending.
i think people are going to be very pleasantly surprised when they see the child tax credit and the fact that they will be getting essentially bonus checks to support their family based on how many children they have, rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez (d-n.y.) told huffpost. so i think really aggressively messaging the specific tangible aspects of this bill that everyday people can see and feel is what's most important.
martinez, who was hospitalized while waiting for the insurance issues to sort out, fears he could be stuck with a $12,000 medical bill for his stay.
it really is hard, as 538's nate silver put it, to think of anything less populist than the republican health-care plan. you might be able to say the bank bailouts were, but even that's probably not true. as unfair as it was to give money to the people most responsible for the global financial crisis — and it was on a world-historical scale, especially when they were allowed to pay themselves that money in bonuses — it at least helped prevent what in all likelihood would have been an even bigger meltdown. the only thing worse than how much credit markets seized up before the $800 billion bailout is how much they would have if there hadn't been one. more people would have lost their jobs, loans would have become impossible to come by instead of just mostly so, and they would have stayed that way more than they already have, since it can take a while for new banks to replace the relationships and local knowledge that old ones had. that, at least, is what a professor named ben bernanke found was part of the reason the recovery from the great depression was as slow as it was.
trump often says he's 'the least racist person'
women are becoming the most powerful political force in america, and they will decide the direction of our country in 2020. cecile richards, supermajority co-founder
immigration reform: sort of. some parts of a plan similar to what was proposed by a bipartisan group of senators in 2013 would squarely be within the bounds of reconciliation, experts say. but some other portions, particularly those without any revenue or spending effects, would not be, leaving the possibility of a swiss cheese immigration bill with loopholes.
hot on the left: texas radio station bans madonna in the name of 'patriotism' after women's march, from huffpost: a texarkana, texas, radio station is venting its frustration over madonna's passionate women's march speech through its playlist. the station, hits 105, stated that it will no longer play the pop icon's tracks as of tuesday, three days after demonstrations in washington, d.c., and around the world attracted millions of supporters. a statement posted to facebook cited the 'f-bombs' in her speech' along with the singer's comments on 'how upset the election results had made her.' 'banning all madonna songs at hits 105 is not a matter of politics, it's a matter of patriotism,' the station's manager said in a statement. 'it just feels wrong to [be] … paying her royalties when the artist has shown un-american sentiments. if all stations playing madonna took their lead from us, that would send a powerful economic message to madonna.' hot on the right: gold star family members say they were assaulted during inaugural ball festivities, from fox news: a massive group of violent demonstrators spat on, assaulted and screamed obscenities at a gold star widow and sister friday outside an inaugural ball honoring the military, one of the women told 'fox & friends' on tuesday.
advocates for choice argued that public pressure can still make a difference. there are elected officials at the state level, and activists want to see congress take steps to protect reproductive rights. many people also felt encouraged that every major 2020 democratic presidential candidate supports abortion, and some are even offering proactive measures to strengthen those rights.
there are very thorough efforts underway … to bring forward a bill that might succeed, wicker told me recently. i do not, he responded when i asked whether he thinks repeal-and-replace is dead for good.
being the object of leftist contempt inspired marlow to expand his political knowledge base.
the real big lie at the heart of the modern republican party is about public policy, not conspiracy theories. starting in the 1930s, republicans promised their voters the repeal of fdr's new deal. when the next republican president, dwight d. eisenhower, did nothing of the sort, the modern conservative movement emerged, furiously branding ike a traitor. when lbj enacted the great society, conservatives pledged that once elected, they would tear it all down — and never did. ronald reagan launched his political career by denouncing medicare as a direct path to socialism. if it passed, he warned, [we] are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children's children what it once was like in america when men were free. of course, as president, reagan left medicare largely intact.
unfortunately, the penn state graduate changed his calculation to 74% and has repeated the same incorrect stat at two debates in a row. perhaps it's a pennsylvania hat tip to groundhog day or maybe he needs a math refresher. our verdict was and remains false.
clinton advirtió que el plan de sanders de un medicare para la atención universal aumentaría los impuestos a la clase media, reabriría el amargo debate con los republicanos y podría poner en peligro el obamacare.
many of us on the left don't believe he embraces religious tolerance, due to his blatant attacks on muslims and his travel ban – which we call his muslim ban.
criticized consumer protection agency: in addition to his writing that a president shouldn't be subjected to litigation or criminal investigation while in office, npr's uri berliner reports, kavanaugh wrote another opinion that will get a lot of attention. it involves the consumer financial protection bureau, and, in it, kavanaugh wrote that the cfpb's structure is unconstitutional, because it is run by a single, unaccountable director — unlike other agencies like the sec or fcc that have multiple commissioners.
momentos antes, otro hombre levantó una pancarta que decía: «los veteranos le dicen a trump: termina ya tu discurso de odio contra los musulmanes».
democrats have two tasks. first, avoid picking an obvious target for trump to shred, either someone far to the left or someone who seems shaky, uncertain, equivocating or weak. he's got his socialist tag ready for the first category. with regard to the second concern — gravitas, strength, leadership abilities — democrats should consider how their nominee will stand up to trump. does he or she have the focus, humor and self-discipline to avoid being dragged down to his level, and does the nominee know where he or she wants to take the country. trump's simplistic nostalgia is wrong and misguided, but it is comprehensible. to project strength, the democrat is going to have to be able to punch through the trumpian noise and make the case that voters are at risk if trump gets reelected.
mr. trump, who has not followed through on a pledge in july that he would have a health care plan ready and signed in two weeks, said his administration would not get rid of the preexisting conditions coverage that were implemented by the affordable care act. he was responding to ellesia blaque, an assistant professor who lives in philadelphia, who told him she's paying $7,000 a year for life-saving medicine because of a condition she was born with, sarcoidosis.
trump prodded heller – who famously helped tank trump's effort to repeal obamacare last summer – saying his re-election bid was a little bit shaky at the beginning.
cooper: what about on the democratic side?
shelley moore capito ( w.va. ) capito said in a july 13 statement that she continues to have serious concerns about the medicaid provisions of the bill. she opposed the previous bill, saying i'm not going to drop you off a cliff, and in my view, the senate bill was too much of a cliff. but she did say on monday she'd vote to open debate on various version of the health-care bill. read more »
sen. chris van hollen, d-md., who runs senate democrats' 2018 campaign operation, told npr's morning edition friday that democrats would support a stopgap measure for three to four days to keep the government running and give negotiators more time to clinch deals in stalled immigration and budget talks.
all of the democrats' political spin evaporates before the amazing number of people who are willing to pay a special tax to exercise the rights that were taken away from them in 2010.
i wanted to be a real christian.
in addition to being a great recruitment tool, cappelli's research found that tuition assistance can also help retain employees. workers stick around while they use the benefit in order to finish their degree, which often takes many years because slugging through college part-time while working can be a slow process, the research found.

hey i lived in new york city and manhattan all my life, so my views are a little bit different than if i lived in iowa, trump said on the meet the press interview, a quote spliced into the cruz campaign ad.
another possible gop partner was iowa sen. charles grassley, who had worked closely with the top ranking democrat on the finance committee, montana's max baucus, on the medicare drug program under president george w. bush. they had a close relationship and, at a private meeting of several senators that baucus convened just after the election in 2008, grassley said, i haven't heard anything here i don't like … i can't think of an issue that isn't compromise-able, according to the notes one participant took.
no stump speech here — cruz had a chat with james dobson, the founder of focus on the family and cruz surrogate. he discussed his faith and quoted the bible; he asked people to pray for his children. the ceiling leaked. cruz said if hillary clinton is elected the supreme court will rule that no american has the right to bear arms and the government could make firearm ownership a felony. a man in the back yells: come and take it!
biden then highlighted numerous other accomplishments during the obama years and asked is he really saying that the obama-biden administration was a failure? pete, just say it out loud.
rand paul: if you voted for it a year and a half ago, you got a lot of explaining to do when you go home if you're going to vote differently this time. we ran four elections on repealing obamacare. i think we can repeal obamacare. it's not even a complete repeal. it's a partial repeal. so i think, yes, if you voted for it in 2015, you should vote for it again.
cruz christened trump's health care plan as trumpcare, saying it is effectively no different from the plan of democratic candidate bernie sanders.
question: ... in d.c., that comes from being president of the united states and working at the white house?
michigan and pennsylvania also ended long democratic streaks that night. but the badger state was the big shock, because barack obama had carried it twice by comfortable margins and hillary clinton had led all through the fall in the most respected statewide poll.
spicer: what's the last part, please?
trump would also repeal a fee on wealthy taxpayers' investments imposed as part of president obama's health-care legislation, also known as obamacare. most economists believe that reducing the rate on corporate income to 15 percent would mainly benefit those who own stock in those corporations, who tend to be richer.

as it turns out, that was not true. in fact, it was always impossible based on the design of the law. when the president was called on the falsehood, he tried to move the goalposts. in november 2013, he said, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn't changed since the law passed. as you can see in the video, that's not at all what he had been saying.
and let's not forget what congress did last year, even though that's what gop candidates want everyone to do.
after the mob forced senators and staff into hiding for hours wednesday, loeffler emerged with a change in attitude. she addressed her colleagues when the senate reconvened and said she can't in good conscience challenge the electoral college results. she was one of several gop senators who reversed their positions.
inskeep: and just that basic question, is your doctor listening to you? is your doctor talking to you in a way that you understand? really, really important.
one new proposal is requiring able-bodied, working-age medicaid enrollees to work. the trump administration is promoting work mandates and has approved requests from eight states to add it to their programs. but his budget would make work requirements mandatory nationwide, said robin rudowitz, associate director for the program on medicaid and the uninsured at the kaiser family foundation.
and, acting on the first possible day to begin the one-year process of withdrawing from the paris climate agreement, the administration served formal notice to the united nations that it would abandon the accord, forsaking the global effort to combat climate change.
of course, this is essentially the same idea as offering a government public option plan on the marketplaces — an idea democrats tried to advance as part of the aca but eventually abandoned after strong opposition from republicans.
biden's draft platform would give everyone the option of choosing a public health insurance option like medicare. intriguingly, it also proposes lowering the medicare age from 65 to 60, for those who want to enroll earlier than they can today. that would benefit early retirees, whether they were laid off or voluntarily left employment, perhaps to start their own businesses.
in a statement, pennsylvania attorney general josh shapiro, who challenged the trump rules, said he was disappointed in the ruling but was not giving up. we now return to the lower courts to address whether the exemptions are arbitrary and capricious, he said. this fight is not over. in a dissent, justice ruth bader ginsburg issued a stark warning about the potential impact of the ruling on employees.
here's a brief history of president trump's record on pre-existing health conditions.
we as a party have been an opposition party for 10 years … now, in three months time, we have to go from being an opposition party to being a governing party, ryan told wisconsin talk-radio host jay weber on wednesday.
the same goes for creepy joe's inability to control his desire to inappropriately touch women and young girls. this has all been captured on video, and like hillary, biden is unrepentant about his behavior and refuses to stop.
cruz has been very up front in the race, saying this is between me and donald trump. if you don't vote for me, a candidate who has a chance of at least slowing down his momentum, you're voting for...
it's hard to draw a direct cause and effect, call said. they don't ask you why you're disenrolling.
late tuesday evening, as results from primary contests confirmed donald trump's victories in four out of five states, cnbc reported that ryan had not ruled out accepting such a nomination.
but exactly when trump might invoke an emergency isn't clear.
the iran deal is a terrible deal. we paid $150 billion. we gave $1.8 billion in cash. that's actual cash, barrels of cash. it's insane. it's ridiculous. it should have never been made, trump said earlier this week ― once again repeating his false and misleading claims from the campaign trail.
third, in several passages the majority resisted any broad exemption for religiously motivated merchants who object to serving same-sex couples, whether on free-speech grounds or on other constitutional grounds. justice kennedy said, for example, that society has come to the recognition that gay persons and gay couples cannot be treated as social outcasts or as inferior in dignity or worth — and that the exercise of their freedom on terms equal to others must be given great weight by the courts.

white house press secretary josh earnest was dismissive of the decision. it's not the first time that we've seen opponents of the affordable care act go through the motions to try to win this political fight in the court system, he said.
azar agreed that the price is too high, but said that what's so bizarre about the health care system is lilly's net realized price — what they collect for the drug — stayed flat even as the list price for humalog went up. patients who have insurance companies negotiating prices on their behalf may not be paying more, but others are, azar acknowledged.
treasury secretary steven mnuchin and house speaker nancy pelosi agreed to keep talking on pandemic-related aid for the economy, even as house democrats unveiled their own $2.2 trillion bill.
the scents of jasmine and roses fill the air as we give thanks for this great nation and the glory of renewal, the first lady said.
this time, individuals earning less than $75,000 and couples earning less than $150,000 would receive the full $1,400 payment, plus an additional $1,400 per dependent. but the third round of checks would phase out faster than earlier payments -- completely cutting off individuals who earn more than $80,000 a year and married couples earning more than $160,000, regardless of how many children they have. payments would reach about 90% of families, according to an estimate from the penn wharton budget model.

the group adopted a binding rule: 80 percent of its members could commit the entire caucus membership to vote together on a given proposal. within months, the group had roughly 40 members, enough to be pivotal on highly partisan votes.

dana bash, cnn anchor: a triple threat to u.s. security: atrocities from isis, a land grab by vladimir putin, and washington politics that could shut down the department charged with keeping america safe.
during the course of putting together the repeal-and-replace process for obamacare, trump never once reached out to a member of the democratic leadership to discuss policy matters or vote counts. house minority leader nancy pelosi's office confirmed as much. so too did senate minority leader chuck schumer's office.

it seemed that if the acorn story and nea story could be paired and weaponized, maximized, and forced into the eye of the american public, they could serve as a case study demonstrating the new media could supplant [the] old media. these paired stories could serve as notice that if the mainstream media wouldn't take helpful hints to right the ship, they were going to experience something akin to a mutiny.
but some experts supported the decision and, just two years later, the supreme court would invalidate doma as unconstitutional.
trump said he would do away with carried interest, which he said helps the wealthy.
another ad similarly paints biden's election as simply a part of the solution rather than a revolutionary act. our generation deserves better, and joe biden can help us get there, the ad's narrator says. we know the fight for progress won't stop after election day, but there are enough of us to start making progress again.

a federal judge in texas ruled on friday the entire affordable care act is unconstitutional due to a recent change in federal tax law. the ruling came a day before the december 15 deadline to sign up for 2019 health coverage through the affordable care act's marketplace.
stone: this is mostly in the hands of the federal government right now. arizona was not one of the states that set up its own exchange. it participates in the healthcare.gov. and leading up to open enrollment last year, we saw the federal governor making efforts to woo insurers back into the marketplace, even after they were concerned about costs and losing money. the question is - will the trump administration do the same? - and i think that's what a lot of folks who rely on the coverage right now are wondering.
president trump announced the policy on friday at his daily briefing. that should alleviate any concern uninsured americans may have about seeking the coronavirus treatment, he said.
i wouldn't do it if i didn't think i had a chance to win, bennet, the 22nd democrat to enter the race, told the colorado independent shortly after his diagnosis. i think, like everyone else does, it's a long shot. but i think everyone in the field is a long shot.
starting with this current legislative effort, the senate should maximize its opportunity to provide individual americans with better and more affordable health care options by making further changes to free states from obamacare's centralized insurance mandates, improve medicaid reform, and provide individual americans with better health care options, they wrote last june.
this credit, which helps working families offset the cost of care for children under 13 and other dependents, would be significantly expanded for a single year. more people would be eligible, and many recipients would get a bigger break. the bill would also make the credit fully refundable, which means you could collect the money as a refund even if your tax bill was zero. that will be helpful to people at the lower end of the income scale, said mark luscombe, principal federal tax analyst at wolters kluwer tax & accounting. read more. what student loan changes are included in the bill? there would be a big one for people who already have debt. you wouldn't have to pay income taxes on forgiven debt if you qualify for loan forgiveness or cancellation — for example, if you've been in an income-driven repayment plan for the requisite number of years, if your school defrauded you or if congress or the president wipes away $10,000 of debt for large numbers of people. this would be the case for debt forgiven between jan. 1, 2021, and the end of 2025. read more. what would the bill do to help people with housing? the bill would provide billions of dollars in rental and utility assistance to people who are struggling and in danger of being evicted from their homes. about $27 billion would go toward emergency rental assistance.

providing affordable, high-quality health care options to consumers is not possible without a balanced risk pool, said aetna ceo mark bertolini.
the scene in the normally quiet hallways of rayburn house office building was a raucous mashup of print and broadcast reporters, still cameras and video cameras, boom microphones, cell phones on voice recorder apps, and bright lights. as the lawmakers made their way in and out of room 2247, the media mob slowly moved in front and behind.
harris: i'm meeting people who are working two and three jobs — you know this president walks around talking about and flouting his great economy right — my great economy, my great economy … you ask him how are you measuring the greatness of this economy of yours? and they point to the jobless numbers and the unemployment numbers. well yeah people in america are working — they're working two and three jobs.

likely because of their fears about the virus, voters in every super tuesday state listed health care as their most important issue. but they appeared to trust biden's pitch for incremental reform more than sanders' promise to burn down the status quo.
no one was immediately nominated to become the drug czar. as the trump presidency entered its seventh month, there was no permanent official in charge of coordinating drug policy across myriad federal agencies — the cdc, the national institute on drug abuse, the justice department and the department of homeland security.
and he was unable to display empathy for women who are victims of workplace discrimination or americans who struggle through life without his riches -- as his foes slammed him over his past opposition to the minimum wage. still, he did point out that he was spending his money in philanthropic ventures -- and to get rid of trump.

what trump said: the president said progress on the border wall was moving faster than ever, and we will soon be almost one new mile a day.
rep. lamar smith (r-texas) made quite a remark on the house floor:
a majority of these patients will be over age 65, so the federal medicare program will pay their bills, which are typically around half or two-thirds of what commercial insurers pay. low-income people on medicaid will have coverage, too.
it's very stressful for my deputies. they're seeing more death than they've ever seen, said deborah k. burchett, the sheriff of clark county, which had the sixth-highest fentanyl overdose death rate in the nation. our biggest problem is, our drug addicts also have mental health problems, and all the hospitals have been closed. they all wind up in the jail.
in june, the trump administration asked the supreme court to overturn obamacare, arguing the individual mandate is unconstitutional and so, the rest of the law, which includes preexisting condition protections, should be struck down.
but even outside that specific outcome, it's just worth thinking about this whole conversation in terms of the deep stories we tell ourselves and the way that trains our mind to think, the way that trains our mind to interpret. when we are useful looking at things one way, we will look at almost everything that way. we'll be quick to impose that story on the world around us. and if that's a bad story, a story of scarcity rather than abundance, of zero-sum rather than positive-sum interactions, then that is a world we'll get. in many cases, that is a world america has now. as always, my email is ezrakleinshow@nytimes.com. i'm always interested to know who you'd like to see on the show next or what you think of the show. just send me your suggestions, your feedback. here's heather mcghee. so the metaphor at the center of the book is this idea of the drained public pool. but i want to start in the reality of the drained public pool. tell me about that.
james madison's solution was federalism, a division of power between the federal and state governments, including outsize influence for sparsely populated states — which would have as many senators as the most populous ones and disproportionate sway in the electoral college, which selected the president. together, these two branches populated the federal bench and the supreme court, further amplifying small states' influence.
tyler: because he has said that he would -- he would fund single- payer health care system, which is where obamacare is leading to. and senator cruz didn't say he supports obama care. he said he supports an obamacare-like system of where obamacare is taking us, which is single payer.
our new u.s.-mexico-canada agreement — or usmca — will replace nafta and deliver for american workers: bringing back our manufacturing jobs, expanding american agriculture, protecting intellectual property, and ensuring that more cars are proudly stamped with four beautiful words: made in the usa.
plenty of politicians have pledged wholesale, game-changing shifts in policy, but trump's hot rhetoric stands out because his promises are rarely accompanied by details on how he might implement his initiatives. he doesn't say how he might punish companies that ship jobs overseas, or how he'd get mexico to pay for a border wall, or how he would impose a ban on muslims entering the country. he says he will make it happen, believe me.
were this bill to pass the senate, it would then have to be reconciled with the house's attempt to repeal and replace obamacare, known as the american health care act.

the fed's latest estimate for full employment is a range between 4.1% and 4.7%. the unemployment rate stood at 3.9% in july.
but as a nominee to the 7th circuit, barrett told the judiciary committee she would follow all supreme court precedent without fail and during a speech at notre dame in 2013 said it's very unlikely the high court would overturn roe, according to the student newspaper the observer.
the new effort is a recognition that, while they lack the power of the presidency and the megaphone that comes from the white house briefing room, the campaign needs to try something to stand out, matt writes.
an adp research institute study had similar findings. one reason may be that the economy has been improving. some companies interviewed by adp said they may increase their part-timers' hours to retain talent and reduce training costs.
no one asked such questions in june, when black lives matter protesters, decrying the deaths of george floyd and other african americans at the hands of police, took to the streets to find military helicopters hovering over the city, national guard troops patrolling the streets and tear gas filling the air.
pelosi herself has repeatedly refused to endorse a medicare for all approach to health care, insisting instead that the best way forward is to make fixes to the affordable care act. and even though the single-payer advocates we spoke to this week emphasized the importance of this hearing, there's wariness that the meeting could end up supporting pelosi's position.
it's up to advocates working with immigrant groups to do all they can to allay the fears of immigrants, vaughan said, to let them know, no one will be deported for receiving food stamps.
other republicans who are facing a competitive reelection fight are similarly choosing their words carefully when discussing obamacare.
hardiman , 51, was the first in his family to attend college and drove a taxi to finance his education – a backstory trump may find appealing. he serves on the 3rd circuit with trump's sister maryanne trump barry, and is praised for his record on gun rights.
in an interview aboard his district-traversing rv sioux city sue, scholten dismissed the idea that sanders' left-wing policies might be a political liability in his district.
spicer: i think -- look the president has made it clear that he's going to work with congress to -- and part of the discussion that he's going to have tonight with some of these leaders, and then again with paul ryan, is how we can work to implement the -- both the repeal and the replace aspects of this.
the pitch was so predictable that trump mocked it the next day: we're going to build new roads; we're going to build new schools, he monotoned.
question: do you have any corrections that you would like to make, or clarifications on what --

however, the president has repeatedly said he wants the court to overturn the law. barrett is expected to be confirmed by the senate next week, giving conservatives a 6-3 majority on the court.
trump said at the iowa rally: drug overdose deaths have declined for the first time in nearly 31 years.
the hypocrisy is incredible, said sen. thom tillis of north carolina.

news you can use if you live in d.c.:
bash: so, you're saying lindsey graham and even some in the pentagon who apparently are considering about 10,000 u.s. troops on the ground, that would be a bad move?
this government shutdown was always about putting illegal immigrants ahead of americans, and senator casey just confirmed it. on friday, senator casey voted to shut the government down and deny funding for our veterans, military, seniors, and health insurance for our children. since then, none of the issues that senator casey said he cared about changed, other than the senate agreed to hold a vote on daca. only when casey got assurances that the senate would vote on daca, did casey vote to re-open the government. and i'm sure casey will again deny funding for americans on february 8th if he doesn't get what he wants for illegal immigrants.
trump could justify an all-out assault on isis by pointing to the same kinds of authority that allowed the bush administration to use torture against alleged terrorists and allowed the obama administration to expand the use of drones to kill terrorist suspects. recent presidents have used their constitutional authority as commander in chief even to take actions that are specifically restricted by law.
i listened to thousands of hours of talk radio, and he was getting reports from me, nunberg recalled. what those reports said was that the g.o.p. base was frothing over a handful of issues including immigration, obamacare and common core. while jeb bush talked about crossing the border as an act of love, trump was thinking about how high to build his wall.

you have to be able to explain in a tweet, said a cruz associate who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe strategy.
the first-term arizona governor is facing a primary challenge from ken bennett, the former arizona secretary of state and senate president who lost to ducey in the republican primary four years ago.
ryan refused to take up a resolution condemning the president's equating of neo-nazis with those protesting neo-nazis. he proclaimed, i think that would be — that would be so counterproductive. if we descend this issue into some partisan hack-fest, into some bickering against each other, and demean it down to some political food fight, what good does that do to unify this country? well, if republicans didn't oppose it then . . . never mind.
inmates in the women's cellblock at the fayette county jail in washington court house, ohio, a state hit hard by the country's fentanyl crisis. fighting fentanyl trump called the opioid epidemic a priority, but fentanyl deaths soar as resources fail to keep pace scroll down warning: this graphic requires javascript. please enable javascript for the best experience.
and priorities usa, the largest democratic super pac, launched the first ads of a multimillion-dollar campaign to promote the biden-harris-democratic agenda. the digital ads, running in the swing states of arizona, florida, georgia, nevada, pennsylvania and wisconsin, contrast the gop support for the trump-era tax cuts with the party's unified opposition to the covid-19 relief bill.
spicer: well, i -- i think, on china, he understand what a big market that is for u.s. goods and services. when he met with the head of alibaba a couple of weeks, that -- that was part of the point. there's huge market issue there. but in many cases, it's -- it's not a two-way street.
with the house's most hard-line conservatives holding fast against the bill, support for the legislation collapsed friday after more and more republicans came out in opposition. they included representatives rodney frelinghuysen of new jersey, the soft-spoken chairman of the house appropriations committee, and barbara comstock of virginia, whose suburban washington district went for the democratic presidential nominee, hillary clinton, in november.

but nothing could prepare him for the welcome that materialized and that left him struggling to counter attacks on his political and personal vulnerabilities.
kytv: amid the empty shelves and store closures, a springfield [mo.] walmart had its own commotion going wednesday afternoon. a baby was born in the toilet paper aisle of the walmart at sunshine and west bypass. one walmart customer didn't have a chance to get any of those groceries she came for, but she left with something much more special. 'we were like oh my gosh, is this actually going to happen,' said store manager jessica hinkle. hinkle said the woman warned store associates that her last child came in just 30 minutes. when the woman's water broke in the toilet paper aisle, she was prepared to go into labor right then and there. 'we were like what do we do now?' she said. 'another lady comes around the corner and she says 'i'm a labor nurse, can i help?' and we said yes, yes please. she had gloves in her pocket [and] she was ready.' hinkle said she grabbed a sheet and blocked the aisle to give the woman as much privacy as possible. … springfield firefighters rushed into the store and helped deliver the baby girl. 'they're the typical fire department that shops in our store, so they were pretty proud of themselves,' hinkle said. she said the entire process took about 45 minutes and customers were cheering for the woman the whole time.
there is no question that wage stagnation and income inequality remain major problems and major drivers of support for the sanders and trump candidacies. the new jobs report reminded us of that with data that showed a 3-cent-per-hour drop in hourly wages. still, that drop came after several months of increases and may be a blip rather than a trend.
still, trump's approach risks alienating another swath of ohioans: moderates and conservatives in the state who are used to candidates focused on policy and who find his controversial rhetoric off-putting.
voters will have to decide what's more believable: that 10 republican senators are standing up for americans who have pre-existing conditions or that this is a sham being perpetrated by the party that has spent the past two years trying to do the opposite.
not at this time, she testified.
under the proposed house legislation, individuals would no longer be subject to a penalty if they go without health insurance, a politically popular change that would be retroactive to 2016. but they would still enjoy the protections of the affordable care act: insurers would have to offer a suite of essential health benefits, could not deny them coverage because of pre-existing conditions and could not impose annual or lifetime caps on coverage.
this is a small step but an important step in the right direction, said grant smith, deputy director of national affairs for the drug policy alliance. if, in fact, it's going towards boosting our treatment capacity, that is certainly a welcome development.
aol trump's former top foreign policy advisers unanimously supported staying in the iran deal. but administration shakeups in the past two months have brought interventionists like john bolton and mike pompeo aboard.
for rep. elijah e. cummings (d-md.), the fentanyl epidemic has hit home; he has represented baltimore both in the state capital and in washington for the past 36 years. he has introduced legislation that calls for spending $100 billion to combat the opioid epidemic.
pauley said, president trump hasn't given you a nickname, that i know of.
co-host joy behar said, he also said that the republicans had a plan to repeal and replace obamacare. they did not. so he's completely lying in that entire statement. i think he's jealous of your dad. i really do. it's hard to see when somebody's passed away that you would still be jealous of them but this is a psycho that we're talking about here. he's not normal. he's obsessed with people that didn't support him. i'm sure he hates me in the same way. good.
contrast that with the soullessness, selfishness and cruelty of the president and his policies. what faith tells one to demonize the stranger, deny care for the sick, destroy the planet we've been given and snatch children from the arms of their parents? what religion tells us to prefer white immigrants over nonwhites? president trump's policies are not only wrongheaded (e.g. counterproductive) but just plain wrong.
-- john mccain slammed omb director-designee mick mulvaney over defense spending and his vote to withdraw troops from europe and afghanistan. politico's ben weyl and brent griffiths report: 'don't you know where 9/11 came from?' mccain asked at one point at the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee. the defense hawk said he was 'deeply concerned' about mulvaney's nomination and ripped mulvaney for saying he couldn't recall some of his voting record. 'i think i would remember if i was withdrawing troops from europe,' mccain said. mccain also slammed mulvaney for trying to shrink the overseas contingency operations account, which is intended to pay for wars abroad but has been used as a way to get around strict spending caps. after the hearing, mccain said he had not decided whether he would vote for mulvaney. asked whether he was satisfied with mulvaney's answers, an angry mccain deadpanned, 'you could tell, just totally.'
khalid: well, it's really such a change. i mean, parts of iowa and new hampshire felt pretty somber. the events just didn't have the type of energy that i've begun to see in the last few days. it has really changed dramatically so quickly. by the way, ari, i should mention i'm on a bus.
in june, i commuted alice's sentence — and she is here with us tonight. alice, thank you for reminding us that we always have the power to shape our own destiny.
it was an exhilarating time for alex, a guy that seemed to be somehow immune to the ideas of the left, courrielche said. i mean, think about it. alex grew up in the heart of liberal los angeles, attended a private high school populated entirely by hollywood elites, and was now being educated in practically the headquarters of the institutional left at uc berkeley. alex was steeped in the ideology of the far-left, yet still gravitated towards conservatism. being comfortable as the outlier must have been an intellectual boot camp for alex, preparing him for what was to come.
fewer than one-third reported any formal training on end-of-life discussions with patients and their families.
the ads will start running on june 1 in the presidential battleground states of arizona, florida, michigan, pennsylvania, wisconsin and north carolina. nextgen has purchased advertising space on facebook, instagram, youtube, pandora and steam.
and that's what is going to be put to the test, is whether or not -- it think this is a big test on whether or not momentum is going to be able to beat grassroots infrastructure.
the kids are born u.s. citizens, he says. they have a right to get food. we're going to have a huge population that will struggle. we might not see it now, but we will in 20 years, when these kids come into the workforce.
levin: i also consider you one of the greatest.
mcghee: you know, i think every time democrats talk about health care, they're winning, right? they're comparing themselves to the republicans who want to take away the protections for preexisting conditions, who want to kill obamacare altogether. and it remains the most popular and important and pressing issue for american voters.
levin: intentional. they were embracing not just the enlightenment, but aristotelian logic. the logic that came from cicero, who was murdered and all these people -- john locke -- who's on the wall there, montesquieu -- these were the great thinkers, the great minds of humanity and only in america when they set up the government did they embrace these things not marx who would come later.
after a meeting with a bipartisan group of senators and biden, vice president kamala harris and transportation secretary pete buttigieg last month , sen. jim inhofe, an oklahoma republican, told reporters it was a very good meeting and that there are mutual interests among both sides as long as no one tries to take the bill hostage.
9:18 p.m. et the next question came from a guy named jeff from ohio on facebook. jeff asked: trump said the campaign has changed him. when did that happen? martha raddatz piggybacked onto the question and asked when trump walked off the bus on access hollywood at age 59, was he a different man then and did that behavior change?
jeff zeleny, cnn senior washington correspondent: wolf, in a word, it is turnout again, which is even more important in these caucuses than the elections.
dr. fauci: if we can do this, we'll blunt covid-19's evolution
for the first time, federal funding for low-income people on medicaid would be limited, resulting in what house speaker paul ryan, r-wis., described at an event sponsored by the conservative national review as sending it back to the states, capping its growth rates. it's a longtime goal for many conservatives. we've been dreaming of this since i've been around, ryan said.
trump, however, slammed obamacare, the situation involving trade and the u.s. border.
john holahan, a health-policy researcher at the urban institute, said the obama administration does need to impose stricter rules for special enrollment. he also said concerns over affordability have hampered enrollment because some middle-class consumers and young, healthy people are put off by high premiums and large deductibles.
in a weekend tweet, the president tied the photo to the governor's remarks on the state's abortion measure.
i wrote recently about a lot of democrats and a few republicans defending being open, for example, to refugees in a way the trump administration is not. but the way we come together is to solve problems. that's what a candidate like stacey abrams is talking about down in georgia where i was this week, and it seems to be working pretty well for her.
the president, who doesn't drink, toasted with water. governors were spotted snapping photos on their cell phones as he gave remarks.
president trump last month proposed a $6 billion cut in funding to the national institute[s] of health, he said. and thank god our congressmen made a deal last night not to go along with that. they actually increased funding by $2 billion, and i applaud them for doing that.
the only gas that powers a candidate to the nomination is these delegates, and sanders now has 43 of them. that's more than his closest rival pete buttigieg at 26. and now you can see sanders also has more than triple the number of delegates of most other people in this race.
sen. bill cassidy, r-louisiana, said he's happy that the bill makes an effort to lower premiums immediately, but he said he wants to ensure that as medicaid is scaled back, we don't lose the the ability for lower-income folks to be able to afford insurance.
it's an idea moderate democrats are wary of, for a host of reasons.
9:49 p.m. et martha raddatz said the leaked emails of clinton campaign chairman john podesta showed excerpts from clinton's paid speeches to wall street and that clinton said you need both a public and private position on certain issues. uncommitted voters asked if it's okay for politicians to be too-faced.
i will need some time to absorb this, but i want cindy —and the entire mccain family — to know they are in my prayers.
despite democrats' attempts to salvage the affordable care act — a crucial law for millions of americans — sabotage by the trump administration and republicans has proved highly effective. they've cut advertising budgets aimed at getting more young people into the insurance pool, repealed the individual mandate which helped balance out healthy and sick people, announced they won't defend protections against price gouging for people with pre-existing conditions, and just froze billions of dollars in payments meant to help insurers cover sicker policyholders.
in the aftermath of that 2012 loss, ryan turned his attention to the task of governing rather than opposing, convinced that republicans shared responsibility with democrats and the president. as a result, he showed an openness to compromise on immigration and on budget issues that resulted in the erosion of some conservative support.
sagal: on monday, a new law in washington state made it illegal to hold your blank while driving.
fewer than one-third reported any formal training on end-of-life discussions with patients and their families.
harper: critics would say that governor pence responded too slowly. many people were calling for indiana to legalize syringe exchange programs, where someone who uses drugs can bring their used needles and get clean ones. other states allow this, and they help prevent infections. but pence was really resistant to that idea for a while. here he is back in 2015.
the admission came during the february 15 press conference in the rose garden, shortly before trump signed the 2019 spending bill. the law may allow construction of just 55 miles of border wall, it curbs enforcement, and it offers an amnesty option to any illegals who offer to care for some of the children and teenagers who are smuggled into the united states as unaccompanied alien children.
my administration has cut more regulations in a short time than any other administration during its entire tenure. companies are coming back to our country in large numbers thanks to historic reductions in taxes and regulations.
the medicare for america legislation was introduced last year by reps. rosa delauro, a connecticut democrat, and jan schakowsky, a democrat from illinois. but unlike most of the other medicare for all-type plans, it doesn't have a senate version that's supported by other candidates.
the facts: it is not the first time that wages are going up. the upward trend in wages started under president barack obama and has continued under trump. the average weekly earnings of all private-sector workers, in real (inflation-adjusted) terms, rose 1.1 percent during trump's first 15 months, after going up 4.0 percent during obama's eight years. those figures include managers and supervisors. the real average weekly earnings of rank-and-file production and nonsupervisory workers have gone up 1.4 percent so far under trump, after rising 3.7 percent during obama's years.
question: any other conversations between general flynn and russian members of the government?
garcia-navarro: kevin, i'm going to ask you a different question. the president has given a lot of interviews this week, and in many, he's contradicted himself. in one with the economist, he claimed to have invented an economic term that was coined in the 19th century. many of his critics say - and even in the economist article it said - that he's erratic and that he lacks knowledge. does that worry you when you look at his words and they don't necessarily match up with other statements that he's given at different times?
the stakes are enormous — for all kinds of americans as well as the broader american economy.
sen. kamala harris also partly echoed the claim during the debate, saying that she would repeal the tax bill that benefits the top 1% and the biggest corporations in this country.
as a consequence of the delay, some health plans in 2014 will be able to keep separate caps for both medical care and drug plans, or have no cap at all on drug costs.
if a guy is threatening to cut your throat, don't buy him a knife, south carolina sen. lindsey graham said at a feb. 10, 2016 town hall. this iran deal is the worst deal.
they resurrected their frequent pre-coronavirus messaging about the trump administration's constant bombardment of the law, most specifically its position that the entire measure is unconstitutional and should be struck down by the courts. pelosi asked the administration to reverse its position on the aca and to instead encourage the states still resisting medicaid expansion to accept it.
but sanders has since taken pains to court black allies, champion policies outside of what are often strictly defined as economic justice issues and incorporate them into his stump speech. he can no longer be fairly depicted as a politician narrowly focused on economic or class issues.
it's possible the additional subsidies could persuade more people to buy plans than the cbo is estimating, especially considering that healthcare.gov is open for a special enrollment period because of the pandemic.
she was quickly drowned out by other supporters who wanted to bend kasich's ear, but he seemed to hear her message. whether anyone else hears it is another question.
the day after the manchester speech, sessions directed his prosecutors to pursue the death penalty against major drug traffickers.
some legal observers today say walker's comments reflect a lack of judiciousness.
we are not going to beat donald trump with a man who has who knows how many nondisclosure agreements and the drip, drip, drip of stories of women saying they have been harassed and discriminated against, warren said.
on oct. 1, sanders suffered a heart attack while campaigning in nevada. in the days following the incident, as the campaign slowly released more details about what had actually happened, there were real questions about whether sanders could continue campaigning. he was off the trail for about two weeks.
speculation in november and early december, captured in national headlines, questioned the strength of biden's frontrunner status in south carolina, but the most recent survey showed him with a comfortable lead. the fox news poll conducted in early january showed him 21 percentage points ahead of runners-up billionaire tom steyer, who has been investing heavily in the south carolina primary. close behind steyer were sens bernie sanders of vermont and elizabeth warren of massachusetts.
the concept was notional until april 2006, when a state-level reform fitting those criteria became law in massachusetts, with the signature of a republican governor (mitt romney) and support of some conservative intellectuals (at the heritage foundation). it was proof of concept for the democrats ― including obama, who, while putting together his campaign health plan, was already thinking about what might get gop votes.
he added, right now, it's a season of war against a gop establishment.
new research shows corporate america's top bean counters and pencil pushers have been way too cautious. they've held back investment in new projects — even when those would have been very profitable, and good for jobs and growth.
the list goes on. the interior department is poised to weaken protections for millions of migratory birds, saying companies whose industrial activities kill birds accidentally should not be subjected to fines or prosecution. the department of housing and urban development is rolling back another obama-era rule designed to press cities to do more to combat racial segregation in housing. the agriculture department moved to tighten eligibility for food stamps in a way that the administration itself estimated would eliminate nearly 700,000 of the poorest adults from the rolls.
it's such a powerful visual. so you went to one of these pools, and they literally poured concrete in it.
tolerance for illegal immigration is not compassionate — it is cruel. one in three women is sexually assaulted on the long journey north. smugglers use migrant children as human pawns to exploit our laws and gain access to our country.
so many people remember where they were that day. in washington, marchers packed the national mall for as far as the eye could see. and it wasn't just women, either. folks from every walk of life came out to say, this is my issue, too. a young man carried one of my favorite posters: i'm proud to be marching with the future president of the us – i don't know who she is, but i know she is here!
given how the homeland security challenges we face are evolving, it's becoming all the more important to do that.
we had no democrat support. we had no votes from the democrats, trump explained. with no democrats on board, we couldn't quite get there.
this border emergency is a manufactured crisis, newsom said to a standing ovation. california will not be part of this political theater.
in terms of lowering costs on the individual health insurance marketplace, his proposal would do away with the income cap — which currently stands at 400% of the federal poverty line — that enables eligibility to receive a tax credit to help pay for premiums. the plan also would ensure that no household is putting more than 8.5% of their earnings (instead of the current 9.86%) into health insurance plans.
the executive order, which also paused the us refugee program and halted the entry of syrian refugees indefinitely, set off mass protests around the country. within 24 hours, judges were hearing arguments against it. now, after seeing it blocked in multiple venues, trump will have to decide if he wants a supreme court showdown or to go back to the drawing board.

one of my favorite heather mcghee facts is that you really wanted to be a television writer. so what's your favorite tv series?
but that needs to happen within 60 days of losing coverage — and especially for people who lost their employer-based insurance in early march, there's no time to lose. here is a guide to a few of the options available to you if you're one of the millions who've recently lost your job and your health insurance:
most of it, including tax subsidies to help people afford coverage and, in 39 states (including the district of columbia), expanded eligibility for medicaid, the u.s. health insurance program for low-income americans. key obamacare consumer protections that also remain in place allow children to stay on a parent's policy until age 26, require insurance companies to treat people with preexisting conditions equally and prohibit the imposition of annual or lifetime coverage limits.
right now, we are in a situation where truancy is at an all-time high, the achievement is at an all-time low. and if you can't read, you can't work, james added.
in recent decades, presidents have stretched their ability to act unilaterally, bypassing congress through executive orders, executive memos, national security orders, findings, signing statements and prosecutorial discretion. after vietnam and watergate, congress pushed back with a series of laws designed to rein in the president.
we can't even pay for medicare for some. we need to solidify that. we need to fix the affordable care act, sen. joe manchin (d-w.va.) said tuesday when asked about medicare for all.
no family buying insurance on the individual marketplace, regardless of income, would spend more than 8.5% of income on health insurance. and tax credits would be based on the marketplaces' more generous gold plan, rather than the silver plan.

although scientists are still learning about the novel coronavirus and its effects, they have known from the beginning that the groups most likely to suffer severe, life-threatening symptoms are the elderly and people with serious underlying medical conditions.
it was a tumultuous week in washington with president trump and house republicans unable to agree on a repeal of the affordable care act. so obamacare remains, as speaker paul ryan said, the law of the land. so how is that law playing out for people? critics often point to arizona as a state where the affordable care act has not worked out well. reporter will stone joins us from member station kjzz in tempe to talk about the aca in arizona.
it's very disturbing and it's driven by the three big entitlement programs that are very popular ― medicare, social security and medicaid, mcconnell told bloomberg tv. hopefully at some point here we'll get serious about this, he said. mcconnell went on to lament that it was a shame obama and congress weren't able to figure out how to ruin these programs together and bizarrely asserted that total gop control of the federal government somehow made this more difficult.
we're expecting a huge turnout here tonight. eight years ago there were a little more than 100 people. there were a lot of first-time caucus goers. tonight we're expecting even more people. there are around 600 democrats registered here in this precinct. a little over 400 independents.

king: when you get to the democratic side, let's start in 2008, to make it easier to go back, because if you look now, on the democratic side now -- let's come over to d's here. right now, of course, hillary clinton, martin o'malley, bernie sanders have a blank slate.
cnn's abby phillip contributed to this report.
the win all but assures that newman, 55, will take over the seat that lipinski's father held for nearly three decades before he retired after the 2004 primary and local democrats chose his son to replace him on the general election ballot.
in the press conference, trump largely ignored the 2019 border security bill, but repeated his 2018 calls for border reforms and for reductions in chain migration and for ending the visa lottery:
they say they -- and lindsey graham was right. i think lindsey graham justified his political life in the statement he made at the end of that.
i ask the men and women of this congress: look at the opportunities before us! our most thrilling achievements are still ahead. our most exciting journeys still await. our biggest victories are still to come. we have not yet begun to dream.
johnson: people should be vigilant right now. yes, we should have a lot of confidence in our homeland security
trump has repeatedly pressed republicans for a better healthcare plan but has so far promised a better plan if republicans win big in 2020.
schultz provides a pithy analysis of what happened in the fall of 2016, recalling how many of his constituents were attracted to bernie sanders: once [sanders] was out and it was just hillary and donald trump, the anger shifted over and got behind trump because they didn't care. they just wanted to crush the establishment.
thankfully, the media landscape has shifted considerably over the last 11 years and there is no way new media (or trump) will allow the corrupt media to wish biden's scandals into a cornfield.
peter bronson was in south florida on vacation from new york. he drove down from deerfield beach to voice his concerns over the trump administration.
hillary clinton and democratic party raise nearly $90 million
nonetheless, o'rourke is a long shot. no democrat has been elected statewide in texas in 20 years. as in arizona, o'rourke's candidacy is a test of how much demographic changes have shifted a solid republican state to the left, and whether it's enough to elect a democrat.
what i'm going to do is pass obamacare with a public option,'' biden said in the final presidential debate with donald trump. it becomes bidencare.
this is how you hear a lot of establishment democrats talking right now, that a sanders nomination would trigger a meltdown inside the party.
a decision from the supreme court is not expected until after the 2020 election.
hauser also said the trump administration seems to be signalling that lobbying is nothing to be ashamed of as many former lobbyists have executive-branch jobs, and at the same time more people might be disclosing their lobbying activities now that former trump campaign chairman paul manafort is in prison after failing to register as a foreign agent.
we will be looking at united as a plan to see if they offer good value for californians. it's to be determined on both ends.

«si cedemos a nuestra ira, si empezamos a ir por ese camino y empezamos a escuchar a los acosadores, entonces perdemos lo que no hizo grandes», dijo beck antes de presentar a cruz.
ever since it passed in 2010, republicans promised to repeal president barack obama's health care law. when donald trump won the white house and republicans won control of both chambers of congress in 2016, they finally had their chance. voters, however, started to realize what would be lost if the law were repealed, and obamacare suddenly became significantly more popular. activists mobilized to protest vulnerable gop lawmakers who had supported repeal, and health care was a top issue energizing democratic voters.
the winning was really important, but that speech —
but one of the other topics that sethi refuses to discuss—again, in addition to the never trump consultants around him, this is one topic that breitbart news had said it wanted to ask him about that instead led to sethi's team pulling back its aggressive requests for a breitbart news interview with the candidate—was simply whether sethi approves of the way sasse has handled himself as a senator since winning that primary and later the general election in 2014. sasse has, during the trump presidency, regularly attacked the president and criticized the way trump has governed. the two seem to have mostly buried the hatchet, at least for now, with the president endorsing his reelection. but sasse has, alongside now former sens. corker and jeff flake (r-az) as well as now sen. mitt romney (r-ut), been a thorn in trump's side on important matters repeatedly attacking him and lending the credibility of a so-called self-proclaimed conservative to anti-trump narratives from the left and establishment media.
the report postulates medicaid expansion is a contributing factor to the epidemic of opioid abuse – not the sole or original cause, as the report itself and sen. johnson took pains to point out, despite mischaracterizations by critics. much of the opioid crisis involves prescription drugs, which can become addictive even when legitimately prescribed, and are often stolen through fraud and resold on the street. medicaid expansion greatly increased access to prescription drugs. medicaid also includes programs to fight drug abuse, but some of those programs involve pharmaceutical treatments that can themselves become addictive, especially when they fall into the hands of street pushers.
but in the most recent polling, which was conducted before south carolina, sanders is actually leading the state of virginia with 28 percent of the vote. joe biden has 19 percent, and michael bloomberg has 17 percent, which, as you can probably gather, is not welcome news to brian.
question: needless to say, this is a big one and it's the first...
the two wings of the pre-trump gop didn't want to handle it. the libertarian anti-government crowd of the gop didn't think it was right for government to try and step in and regulate private insurers or subsidize private-sector health insurance for people who can't afford it, and the business community didn't want to disturb the private-sector healthcare program and didn't want to pay the taxes to subsidize people. republicans have to understand that [the] most popular part of that phrase is the for all, that americans with experience with medicare tend to like it because when you add in supplemental insurance that they have, it actually provides pretty decent insurance for a pretty low cost.
as originally introduced, the legislation would leave 24 million fewer people insured by 2026 than under obamacare, the non-partisan congressional budget office said.
arpaio is arizona's controversial former sheriff who was found guilty of criminal contempt for flagrant disregard of a federal judge's order in a racial-profiling case but was pardoned by president trump, against the wishes of some prominent republicans.
now, the question remains if mccarthy – who has a close relationship with trump – would be able to overcome his past obstacles.
the augusta area lost humana, cigna and coventry health plans for next year. humana was the most popular plan because of its price and its inclusion of university hospital, one of four major area hospitals which blue cross blue shield of georgia does not cover.
still, some in mccarthy's district will be glad to see obamacare go, and as soon as possible. this whole system has been a disaster from day 1, said rodger harmel, an insurance agent in bakersfield. rates have been at an all-time high.
the white house dinner was part of a low-key and ultimately unsuccessful lobbying effort by the president. press secretary sean spicer insists trump was actively working for the bill's passage, even though he spent much of the weekend watching the u.s. women's open golf tournament at his bedminster, n.j., resort.
but the baby's lungs were fine, kimmel said, which meant his heart wasn't. so now more doctors and nurses and equipment come in. it's — it's a terrifying thing. you know, my wife is back in the recovery room, she has no idea what's going on. and i'm standing in the middle of a lot of very worried-looking people — kind of like right now — who are trying to figure out what the problem is.
in america, we celebrate faith. we cherish religion. we lift our voices in prayer. and we raise our sights to the glory of god, the president said. those are beautiful words, but trump's actions speak louder.

the lobbying over the speech and its exact wording will continue up to the moment of delivery. julie hirschfeld davis of the new york times underscored how complicated – and consequential – this moment is.
scalise has said publicly he won't directly challenge mccarthy in the race, but the conference remains in a holding pattern until mccarthy makes his move. he signaled his potential interest in running for the top spot recently in an interview with politico saying, i wouldn't rule it out, depending on the political environment.
clinton said there's no evidence that classified information was hacked and ended up in the wrong hands.
the supreme court waited months to act in the case. the last of the written briefs in the case was filed oct. 19. but a court that includes three trump appointees waited through the election, trump's challenge to his defeat and a month after trump left office before issuing its order.
breitbart news editor-in-chief alex marlow joined patrick courrielche for red pilled america's 50th episode — the first of a two-part profile — to reflect on his political genesis and andrew breitbart's vision for the news media outlet he founded.
both national conventions had their emotional, viral moments ― brayden harrington's speech about his stutter at the democratic national convention, widow ann dorn's tribute to her retired police officer husband at the gop celebration ― but neither had any type of game-changing moment to alter the fundamental story of the race: it is a referendum on president donald trump, with many voters disapproving of his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, health care and racial justice. democratic nominee joe biden has a steady but not overwhelming lead in polls of the most crucial swing states.
kelly: one other thing about his record - which is that pence is an evangelical christian. bernie sanders - senator sanders, who's running for the democratic presidential nominee, he was tweeting trump's plan to deal with all this is to have pence, quote, who wanted to pray away hiv epidemic oversee the response.
— there was nary a mention of president trump's claims a day earlier that he championed protections for patients with preexisting conditions (read our health 202 fact-check here). the candidates mostly stuck to their own differences over expanding health coverage, which one could argue makes for a better debate but disappointed democratic activists who are primarily concerned with beating trump.
mcgann uses sources, including a colleague, to bolster her claim that women can even outperform their male counterparts and are more likely to pass legislation that is more favorable to women.
washington — the senate judiciary committee is set to convene monday for the first day of confirmation hearings for judge amy coney barrett, president trump's nominee to the supreme court, in what is expected to be a fiercely partisan battle over the future of the high court.
biden will try to strengthen protections for people with medical conditions. he will also create a new three-month sign-up period for obamacare, starting next month, aimed partly at people who lost their jobs during the pandemic. the most recent sign-up period was in the fall.

the obama administration expended tremendous effort shaping and nurturing the new system during its infancy and addressing problems as they came up. now the trump administration is in charge of managing these marketplaces, and its intentions are not clear.
azar said he would be obligated to make every program under his purview work as well as possible. but, what we have is not working for everybody, he added. azar said he wants to give states more flexibility in running obamacare programs, and give consumers more choice on what type of insurance they can buy.

olsen added, people — as we see even in republican states — are voting for the medicaid expansion because they would like to see poor people and working-class people have access to doctors. so the question is: what do you do with the republicans to make sure that those things are actually being met, but in a way that doesn't lead us down the road to one-size-fits-all bureaucratized government monopoly healthcare?

the first and perhaps most obvious question is what will be the impact of the law on your district? estimates are that over 10 years, 55,000 people in each congressional district will lose their coverage. and if you're in a district with rural counties or older people, it could be much higher. because medicaid would be slashed by $880 billion, and that money flows to states and then directly to hospitals, physician practices, social workers and nursing homes, what would be the resulting impact on the community, on the opioid crisis, on employment?

when you say this is an emergency, you would expect to hear what they plan to do about the emergency, said andrew kolodny, co-director of opioid policy research at brandeis university. when president trump designated the opioid crisis a public health emergency, at the very same time, he should have said, 'here's what we're going to do about it,' and put out a detailed plan outlining what every federal agency was going to do.

our allies will find that america is once again ready to lead.
trump's approach is a hallmark of a president who eschews strategic planning and preparation in favor of day-to-day tactical maneuvering and trusting his gut. but as he digs in against an emboldened democratic opposition, trump has found that his go-to arsenal of bluster, falsehoods, threats and theatrics has laid bare his shortcomings as a negotiator — preventing him from finding a way out of what may be the biggest political crisis of his presidency, david nakamura and seung min kim explain in today's paper.

but because choice was heavily criticized as being too unwieldy and bureaucratic, congress tried to reform it by passing the mission act in 2018 under trump. the mission act loosens the restrictions around when a vet may seek private medical care, allowing it if they live more than 30 minutes from a va clinic or face wait times of more than 20 days for most health-care appointments.

we request that the trump administration establish a national program to procure naloxone treatments and supply them to state and local health and law enforcement programs, the letter said.

stephanie hickman, 29, of west columbia, s.c., feared the worst when she began shopping for 2017 coverage on the exchange with help from a federally funded navigator at the downtown library. hickman was uninsured most of the year, and paid $200 a month for her prescription drugs.
last month's upset primary victory by alexandria ocasio-cortez, who beat 10-term incumbent joe crowley in a new york city district, was decisive proof: the democrats' path to victory requires exciting their base with a bold, fearless agenda that includes medicare for all.
the idea was to make sure healthy people enrolled before they got sick, so they would have protection against bills, so that they wouldn't require charity care that would raise costs throughout the system, and so that insurers could keep premiums low and stable.
while primus told staffers the reason they needed to find witnesses who had not spoken poorly of the aca was because they didn't want republicans using the hearing as an opportunity to attack obamacare, sources believe there were ulterior motives.
simon: lot of names have been - have been batted about this week. which ones strike you as more solid than just rumors?
conservatives have always been for repealing obamacare, and my concern is that this doesn't repeal obamacare, paul told reporters. what i've seen so far is that it keeps 10 out of 12 regulations, it continues the obamacare subsidies, and i think ultimately will not bring down premiums, because instead of trying to fix the death spiral of obamacare, it simply subsidizes it with taxpayer money to insurance companies. so for those reasons, it looks a lot like obamacare instead of a repeal of obamacare.
lasonya hill shared that the bonus she received as a result of the new tax law is helping her family to fund her two sons' college educations. her sons were standing next to her on stage.
so far, trump has beautifully managed foreign policy in a way that has not only kept us out of foreign entanglements, he's also tamped down aggressors such as north korea and iran. and let's not forget how he whupped isis or how he solved an ancient border dispute between syria and turkey while the fake news media were yelling about a coming kurd holocaust and world war iii.
when trump does talk about health care, it's mostly when he's lashing out at the late republican sen. john mccain for casting a crucial vote against repealing obamacare, rather than offering a comprehensive plan.
the party of the vice president, who acts as president of the senate and breaks ties when they occur. that will be the democratic party after biden is inaugurated as president and kamala harris becomes vice president. her tie-breaking vote assures the top senate democrat, chuck schumer, will become majority leader. (the senate technically has 48 democrats and two independents, bernie sanders of vermont and angus king of maine, who reliably vote with them.)
biden rides wave of endorsements from former rivals into super tuesday
republicans have had control of the discourse for months now, suggesting democrats have not fully absorbed the lessons of the past. if they don't want a repeat performance of 2014 in a year when the presidency is at stake, it's long past time to start offering their own sweeping narrative of pride, patriotism and success.
aaron bernstein / reuters gop sens. john barrasso (wyo.), bill cassidy (la.) and lindsey graham (s.c.) — three sponsors of the new bill — with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell (ky.) and majority whip john cornyn (texas), after a failed attempt to weaken pre-existing condition protections last year.
after thousands of wisconsin voters waited hours in line outside crowded polling stations for that state's recent primary, maryland sent ballots to eligible voters weeks in advance to encourage as many mail-in votes as possible — in a test of how future elections might safely be held during the pandemic.
that maxim is truer now more than ever.
by design, the mandate is sizable: it's either $695 per adult and $347.50 per child, or 2.5 percent of a household's income ― whichever is greater, up to a maximum of $2,085 per family.
the president held a make america great again rally in nashville on may 29. he touched on numerous topics, touting in particular passage of the tax cuts and jobs act. in addition to overhauling the nation's tax code, the new tax law will repeal the tax imposed on certain people who do not purchase a qualified health insurance plan.
as john mitchell famously said when he became richard nixon's attorney general, watch what we do, not what we say.
biden made the bizarre comment earlier this month that he sees himself as a transition candidate. he has no vision of his own. his job is to be a bridge between the muted radicalism of obama and the revolutionary zeal of the new resistance.
the republican bill would have repealed tax penalties for people without health insurance, rolled back federal insurance standards, reduced subsidies for the purchase of private insurance and set new limits on spending for medicaid, the federal-state program that covers more than 70 million low-income people. the bill would have repealed hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes imposed by the affordable care act and would also have cut off federal funds to planned parenthood for one year.
roberts' moves behind the scenes were as extraordinary as his ruling. he changed course multiple times. he was part of the majority of justices who initially voted in a private conference to strike down the individual insurance mandate -- the heart of the law -- but he also voted to uphold an expansion of medicaid for people near the poverty line.
former vice president joe biden declared his overwhelming victory in the south carolina primary with a forceful message for democrats: that the party would lose big if sen. bernie sanders (i-vt.) won the democratic nomination.
i began this evening by honoring three soldiers who fought on d-day in the second world war. one of them was herman zeitchik. but there is more to herman's story. a year after he stormed the beaches of normandy, herman was one of those american soldiers who helped liberate dachau. he was one of the americans who helped rescue joshua from that hell on earth. almost 75 years later, herman and joshua are both together in the gallery tonight — seated side-by-side, here in the home of american freedom. herman and joshua: your presence this evening honors and uplifts our entire nation.
he boasted of his accomplishments in the few weeks since taking office and said, it's been a lot of fun.
the decision was revealed on june 28, the last courtroom sitting of the 2011-12 session. as roberts began reading his opinion from the bench, he tried to speak steadily, but he was nervous. about 13 minutes into the 20-minute announcement, after he had summarized various legal rationales, he misstated the overall judgment. few noticed the slip because he had already laid out the reasoning.

whether it's a $2,000 computer to design websites or a $2 pen to write down appointments, expenses on job-related materials are deductible – and collectively, they can add up in a big way. often overlooked, however, are job-associated dues that include fees for trade associations or even subscriptions to periodicals and journals that are relevant to your profession.

trading medicare and medicaid for tax breaks?, he said in a speech before the international association of fire fighters. how is that going to help the people in this room or most of the people you live with? how is that going to help this country?
question: thank you. when will the -- when will you guys commence the building of the border wall?
khalid: and so, again, ari, that's kind of an implicit rebuke there of the sanders wing of the party and some of bernie sanders' online supporters, whom, you know, many folks within the democratic party feel have really been causing, you know, divisiveness within the party itself.
question: when will you start the building of the border wall?
trump told senate minority leader chuck schumer (d-n.y.) in december: i'll be proud to shut down the government for border security. he subsequently refused to sign a federal spending bill unless he was allocated $5.7 billion to begin work on his border wall. on thursday, a joint statement from unions representing pilots, flight attendants and air traffic controllers said the risk to air safety of the partial government shutdown was incalculable and unprecedented.
levin: do they view us as part of a global community?
susan bailey, president of the american medical association, applauded the moves, saying they will restore coverage to patients who are victims of the economic fallout of the pandemic.
the kasich campaign hopes the beat clinton message can also win over supporters of cruz, who have opposed kasich's support as governor for common core educational standards and for medicaid expansion under president obama's health care law.
here are the five fact checks to read before you vote in the primary.
democratic vice-presidential nominee kamala harris said trump and his supreme court nominee amy coney barrett would overturn obamacare, in a speech on monday.
as a 36-year veteran of the senate and former vice president, biden has maintained that he will work with both sides of the aisle. although the president has already taken a flurry of executive actions , some priorities need to be cemented with legislation to avoid possible reversal by his successors.
every american child should be able to grow up in a safe community, to attend a great school, and to have access to a high-paying job.
but make no mistake: the public is with biden now. the covid-19 relief package — with its direct payments to families and aid for businesses, the unemployed and local governments — is backed by nearly 70 percent of americans, according to a recent quinnipiac poll. in a nation that can't agree on a simple set of facts, this is staggering.
4. how will trump try to bring jobs back from overseas?
the house and senate bills call for increasing the credit to $3,600 for each child younger than 6 and to $3,000 for each child between 6 and 17 in 2021. it is currently a $2,000 credit for kids between the ages of 6 and 16.
mcneil told the panel she had reviewed the documents and asked rhetorically whether the gao could say that the drug czar's office has finally produced the congressionally mandated drug strategy.
spicer: honestly, i don't have a seating chart. i think we had a very small footprint going over there. i don't know who exactly went over. but, i don't -- i don't know, maybe 10 people, at most. sarah was there(ph).
but there was little in the speech that the trump campaign had not tried before without success.
the proposal, she said, would make it mandatory ― absolutely require ― that every five years people in medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner.
— his 2006 to 2009 disclosures lists his spouse as taking a salary from the george w. bush library foundation as administrative staff.
to make matters more disgraceful, devos justified her harmful decision with a gross misstatement. gainful employment regulations, she said in a press release, have been repeatedly challenged by educational institutions and overturned by the courts. devos was right that the rules had been challenged over and over by schools ― many of them the predatory schools that risked losing their federal aid under the rules if they didn't shape up and stop deceiving, overcharging, and under-educating students. but her characterization of what the courts had done with the rule was false.

in ohio, deaths from fentanyl have ravaged vast sections of the state. in 2015, there were 1,255 synthetic-opioid-related deaths, most from fentanyl. by the end of 2017, that number had nearly tripled to 3,572.
the truth is different. deaths from alcohol, drugs and suicide — deaths of despair — hit a new high in 2017. his assaults on obamacare have left 2 million more americans without health coverage, while he's never come close to presenting a comprehensive alternative that would, in fact, meet his promise to provide insurance for everybody.
the retiring arizona republican recently called the massive crowds at rallies for president trump the spasms of a dying party— his latest parting shot at trump supporters. given his 18% approval rating last summer in arizona, the dead-in-the-water senator's latest salvo about republicans is lathered in irony. he continues to educate his party about electioneering while choosing retirement to avoid an embarrassing defeat in this year's republican primary. arizona state sen. kelli ward had a nearly 30-point lead over flake the month before he announced his departure.
►$16.3 trillion for the green new deal, far more than other candidates would spend to combat climate change.
republicans will wield the biggest weapon given to the senate minority -- the power to filibuster, or demand unlimited debate on legislation that doesn't have the backing of a super-majority of 60 senators. that means the narrow democratic majority would need to win over at least 10 republicans, a huge challenge, to advance non-budgetary initiatives on topics such as the federal minimum wage, family leave, labor rights and background checks for gun purchases. and with the slimmest possible majority, democrats will have to stick together. a single defection or absence could slow key nominations and legislation.
democrats aren't the only people attacking ducey this campaign season.
barton and her husband, a contract computer technician, had been uninsured for most of their adult lives. when obamacare expanded medicaid, they were finally able to qualify for the low-income health program. this year, california's version of medicaid, known as medi-cal, paid for surgery to remedy barton's long-standing carpal tunnel syndrome.
the trump administration has said that procuring medical supplies was primarily a state responsibility, and that the federal stockpile was meant to serve as an emergency backup, not as a primary source of supplies.
president trump was in the spotlight tuesday night for a rare town hall in philadelphia with undecided voters, where he fielded questions on topics including the coronavirus pandemic and health care, which have been on the minds of many voters.
spicer: right, but i'm saying that -- so there's a reason that we put out several versions of that. one is that it -- the illustrative nature of -- of how you count the unemployed, whether or not they're long term unemployed or whether or not they're still seeking a job.
three decades later, she once again has the top job in congress, with the best view in washington – from a capitol on edge.
dr. ezekiel emanuel: no one is immune to the covid-19 virus. it threatens all of us. but while we are all experiencing the same pandemic, we are not experiencing it in the same way. the first dividing line is whether you or someone you love has gotten sick. many americans have not yet seen firsthand what devastation a positive test can inflict. another dividing line is whether you have a job that lets you stay at home, working as you juggle child care and video chats.
regardless of what happens now, health care is likely to remain a subject of controversy.
during the debate, clinton made the same argument she's made so many times before ― that the pluses of obamacare far outweigh the minuses, so the best next step is to fix the law's shortcomings. and although she ran out of time to describe these steps in detail, she has said previously she would focus on reducing the cost of prescription drugs and providing more financial assistance to people with particularly onerous premiums and out-of-pocket costs.
as the supreme court returns to work friday after a three-week recess and crosses the midpoint of its term, the cases on deck are far from the type that would give the new 6-3 conservative majority a chance to assert itself in the nation's most divisive controversies.
here's the bottom line. anybody who starts spreading ideas about a race that we have not won is bad timing, bad behavior and bad posturing, said house rules chairman pete sessions. i would encourage my team to recognize that while the speaker has served quite admirably, we are in a very difficult position at this time.
mass legal and illegal immigration to the u.s. continues to be the largest driver of population increases and demographic shifts in the country. every year, more than 1.5 million immigrants are admitted to the country. the u.s. has imported more than ten million immigrants in the last decade.
other factors beyond cruz could scuttle the senate talks. opposition by sens. lisa murkowski (r-alaska) and susan collins (r-maine) to a measure that blocks funding to planned parenthood is among them.
it was another star-studded affair, as comedian amy schumer and model emily ratajkowski were among those taken into custody.
blanchflower said underemployment is not caused by obamacare because it is so prevalent around the globe.
congress took another step on monday toward reauthorizing the legislation biden cosponsored as a senator in 1994 and expired in 2018.
it's unclear how precisely that would work out because a law was enacted in 2018 to close the doughnut hole ahead of schedule. that legislation was a modification of the affordable care act, and judges would have to sort out what that modification means if the aca comes off the books.
the withdrawal echoes the move by new mexico gov. michelle lujan grisham, who a week ago cut roughly 90 percent of the 118 national guardsmen assigned to the border.
despite some obvious plastic surgery, biden looks, sounds, and acts every day of his decrepitude.
detrow: nevada's often the overlooked early state. it isn't in the national campaign narratives much.
the general survey has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.6 percentage points. for the internist/primary care provider sample, margin is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. for specialists, plus or minus 6.0 points.
at issue in trump v. pennsylvania, consolidated with little sisters of the poor v. pennsylvania, were new rules established by the trump administration that vastly expanded the types of organizations that could opt out of the mandate based on religious beliefs or moral objections.
the american health care act, the republican proposal to replace the aca, would have amounted to arguably the single biggest rollback of a social welfare program in american history.
and so, if trump really wants to cut deals with democrats, there are options out there.
going forward, the chief justice would be viewed with skepticism by conservatives, despite also having taken the lead on limiting racial remedies and voting rights, helping roll back campaign finance regulations and voting for stronger second amendment gun rights.
the boisterous health care rally showed the unique position sanders occupies within the already-crowded field of rumored 2020 presidential contenders: he's done it before and he has the organizational muscle to show for it, even in a state like south carolina where he fared poorly in '16.
that finding was based on a review of 77 previously published studies on medicaid, but only 16 examined quality of care and health outcomes.
it's become pretty trendy for these big corporations to offer higher education benefits, tuition benefits, degree programs, things along those lines to help students, said kevin kinser, a professor at penn state university and head of the school's department of education policy studies. it clearly represents the anxiety around attending college particularly for lower-income individuals that many of these companies seem to be targeting for employment.
imagine the wonders our country could know in america's 250th year.
several scientists are now trying to organize another march on washington, akin to last weekend's women's march, to raise awareness about what they see as trump's hostility to science. (sarah kaplan is tracking it.)
incidentally, even though congress refused to give obama's cronies a fat taxpayer bailout in the omnibus spending bill – one of the very few good things about it – the administration is still looking for ways to go around the constitution and loot the treasury to cover what it calls an obligation of the u.s. government for which full payment is required.
ending obamacare could increase medicare beneficiaries' costs in other ways. the aca reduced payments to medical providers and private insurers. reversing that could lead to higher deductibles and copays for part a, which covers hospital visits, and higher premiums and deductibles for part b, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient care.
first of all, why is that and why do they like to talk about politics all the time?
gergen: do you need boots on the ground?
some in the gop establishment believe the push toward an exclusionary form of conservatism started with the tea party, a movement that came into being seven years ago in response to obama's policies on health care and other issues. yet almost none of the voters the enquirer interviewed at a trump rally in pittsburgh wednesday night had considered themselves tea partiers.
bernie sanders in trump country: since donald trump's election, bernie sanders has visited 28 states (not counting his home in vermont), often headlining multiple events in different cities over the course of just a few hours. he's keynoted events with progressive groups opposing obamacare repeal and the gop tax bill, done a book tour, and – increasingly as the midterms near – endorsed and stumped with congressional candidates.
since the georgia senate wins gave democrats just the narrowest of majorities, analysts say biden could push through parts, but not all, of these proposals, over the next four years:
three quarters also believe it's their responsibility to initiate end-of-life conversations.
but mask-wearing has proven to decrease the likelihood of transmission of covid-19. centers for disease control director robert redfield went as far to suggest in congressional testimony wednesday that masks might be more effective in fighting the virus than a vaccine for some americans.
simon: the three oldest trump children are on this list of transition team members - ivanka, donald, jr., and eric. of course, they also reportedly played a big role in the campaign. do we know what they'll be doing?
the court deployed a dig on the last day of the term in june 2012 to dismiss a case, first american financial corp. v. edwards, that had been argued a full five months earlier. that case presented a question with important implications for the separation of powers: whether congress can enact a law that confers standing — the right to sue — on people who, while they can point to a legal violation, did not suffer a concrete injury traceable to the violation. circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that after the case was argued on nov. 28, 2011, the assignment to write the majority opinion went to justice clarence thomas.
if the action against obamacare by trump's doj succeeds, some 20 million americans would lose their health insurance amid the covid-19 crisis.
in general, it was an attempt to shift the race from a referendum on trump's performance ― a referendum trump is very likely to fail ― toward a choice between himself and biden. trump mentioned biden's name more than 40 times in his speech thursday night. biden never directly mentioned trump during his speech the week before.
well, political scientists have some interesting thoughts about the reasons the g.o.p. won't just throw in the towel on the a.c.a. but details aside, modern republicans just hate the idea of using public policy to help americans get the health care they need, even when people's inability to get insurance is a result of pre-existing medical conditions over which they have no control.
my impression is it may have been the shock effect of trump's election and the recognition that there are a host of policies, projects, that we previously didn't think were imaginable or reasonable that are being considered on the other end of the political spectrum, said william darity, an economist at duke university and a proponent of job guarantee programs.
paul, who ran against donald trump in the republican primaries, told reporters the defeat of ryan's insurance industry rescue bill is not a defeat for trump.
they're afraid if they do anything, they'll be deported, monestel said.
-- contrary to trump's rhetoric in his immigration address, apprehensions at the border are relatively low compared with past points in recent u.s. history. from brittany renee mayes, aaron williams and laris karklis: u.s. border patrol took just over 400,000 people illegally entering the united states into custody in 2018, down from the second-high of 1.67 million in 2000. the washington post fact checker salvador rizzo reported that most of these declines have come, 'partly because of technology upgrades; tougher penalties in the wake of the 9/11 terrorist attacks; a decline in migration rates from mexico; and a sharp increase in the number of border patrol officers.'
the document does not say anything about those personal exemptions, as they are called, and how trump intends to handle those exemptions is crucial to how his plan will affect ordinary families.
metro columnist theresa vargas : trump asked you to imagine being victimized by an immigrant. we should imagine instead, 'we're all roxana.'
sure, premiums wouldn't be allowed to vary based on health status or pre-existing conditions. but prices could dramatically vary based on age, gender, occupation and other factors, including hobbies, in ways that are functionally the same as basing them on medical histories. insurance companies have a lot of experience figuring out that stuff.

in ryan's home state of wisconsin, a poll by the marquette law school released wednesday showed only 28% of registered voters supported a republican replacement of obamacare, and 60% supported either keeping obamacare or keeping and improving it.
this week, sanders abruptly ended his campaign. i cannot in good conscience continue to mount a campaign that cannot win and which would interfere with the important work required of all of us in this difficult hour, he said via livestream.
more than 30 conservative leaders have endorsed the coming plan, signing a letter last month promising it will lower monthly premiums and stabilize markets by giving states more dollars to use as they'd like and expanding private plan options.
it could be that three years out we are no longer making money, we are losing money, said himler.
according to jessica vaughan, director of policy for the center for immigration studies, a washington-based think tank that favors limited immigration, if the decline in snap enrollment is a result of the secure communities program, that could be because of the overreaction among the groups that work with immigrants in the community.
barrett closely identifies with the justice she once clerked for, the late antonin scalia, who more than any other justice popularized the idea of originalism, meaning that the court should interpret the constitution as it was originally intended by the founders. but scalia, at the same time, often referred to himself as a faint-hearted originalist because he also embraced one of the other building blocks of legal interpretation, namely, adhering to precedent, even when, in his view, some of those precedents conflicted with what the founding fathers thought when they ratified the constitution.
the 10 million on obamacare and 2.3 million young adults add up to 3.8 percent of the u.s. population in 2016, or more than the 3.3 percent represented in the tax returns that made payments. (we will ignore the fact that the 15 percent of the population is over 65 and in theory would be on medicare, and thus don't need health insurance.)
if the supreme court strikes down the law, those protections disappear. but such a ruling would do much more.
this is a democratic district. let's have a real democrat fighting for us, newman tweeted monday, including infographics showing how lipinski's past votes against obamacare and for restricting access to women's reproductive healthcare are at odds with her own support for universal healthcare and greater access to abortions.
teddy roosevelt gained public acclaim in the early 1900s as the first white house trust buster, but he did not target executives or companies in a sustained manner, opposed efforts to ban monopolies and eventually worked hand in hand with the leading industrialist of his day, j.p. morgan.

smart money in texas is not betting that rep. beto o'rourke, the telegenic democratic congressman from el paso, will defeat sen. ted cruz. however, despite mr. trump's nearly 10-point margin of victory in 2016 and cruz winning by 16 percentage points in 2012, the buzz around o'rourke is loud enough to suggest that the conservative incumbent may be in trouble.
levin: all right, ladies and gentlemen see you next time on life, liberty & levin.
the nyt article begins with the example of an engineer named clint murphy who concluded it's still better to pay the higher 2016 penalty than to purchase pricey health insurance – in fact, he describes the decision as a no-brainer.
the orders don't do anything about anything, though. it's just more vaporware from the trump administration. slogans, lies and exaggerations aren't policies. trump pitched his phantom plan by saying it rests on three pillars: more choice, lower costs, and better care, and that it would put patients first.

boehner has offered a plan b before, in the context of debate in late 2012 over the fiscal cliff as the bush tax cuts expired. his caucus rejected the plan.
however, gop leaders made clear shortly after the november 2016 election that they oppose his lower immigration agenda. in december 2016, for example, breitbart news reported:
diaz-balart emphasized that mccarthy and scalise had learned a lot since 2015. since then, the conference has seen the election of a republican president, passed tax reform and repealed a key piece of the affordable care act.
requiring navigators to sell junk plans is the same as requiring doctors to offer snake oil ― the whole notion is outrageous, said lori lodes, a former cms official from the obama administration and founder of the organization get covered america.
bash: so, that' a -- i mean, that's an interesting point, because some of these parents and family members, are saying the u.s. -- it's the u.s. policy law to prevent us from giving money and paying the ransom to get our family members back. i'm assuming that you think that that is a good policy to stick with particularly since you think it's just a ruse propaganda.
but even with the fierce sniping about medicare for all, which has become a litmus test in the 2020 race for the democratic nomination, the candidates have yet to explain how any version of the proposal would pass in a sharply divided senate ― even if sen. mitch mcconnell (r-ky.) finds himself the minority leader once again.
the capital gains tax would be reduced from 23.8 to 20 percent. this reduction comes from the elimination of the 3.8 percent tax that helps fund obamacare applying to investment income over $250,000 for a married couple. this cut is to incentivize investors for increasing investments while minimizing the after-tax liability. treasury secretary steven mnuchin hopes to greatly encourage investments and, in the long and short-term, stimulate economic growth.
he also pledged that he won't cave:
physicians in large medical systems may find more support than those in private practice. at kaiser permanente in northern california, physicians receive training in end-of-life discussions and have time to carry them out, said dr. ruma kumar, the hmo's regional medical director of supportive care services.
cornish: the thing is the first time around, all of these senators knew that it would be vetoed by president obama, right? not exactly high stakes.
but sanders would not hold another campaign rally in the 2020 race. on march 10, sanders abruptly cancelled a cleveland rally due to mounting coronavirus concerns. soon, even the news conferences and speeches that sanders and biden started holding instead were seen as dangerous. the primary was suddenly frozen in place.
odds-makers are giving bernie a 55 percent chance of becoming the democrat nominee.

at the same time, the administration is loosening regulations on certain types of health insurance policies to allow insurers to refuse coverage for pre-existing conditions. that's part of trump's ongoing campaign to sabotage the affordable care act's health insurance markets.
investors are anxiously awaiting the first presidential debate between president donald trump and democratic challenger joe biden, which is expected to attract a record-breaking television audience from 9 p.m. eastern time on tuesday night.
if sanders were to get all of his proposals enacted, his federal government would rise to 37% of the economy, according to the committee for a responsible federal budget. this would be an enormous departure from what has been a social contract between the government and the governed.
trump also noted that sen. elizabeth warren, a potential 2020 challenger, was in the state saturday speaking at the state democratic convention, again using the pocahontas slur to describe the massachusetts democrat.

washington – president joe biden on thursday took initial steps to expand health care coverage and reverse some of the policies of former president donald trump, including directing that people be given a new chance to sign up for government-subsidized care and lifting restrictions on abortion and family planning services.

the change raises the stakes on the 2018 midterms, because it means, among other things, that state officials, many of whom appear on this year's ballot, will have even more power to shape (and reshape) their health care markets.
donald trump has muscled ahead in iowa, regaining his lead on the brink of the first votes being cast in the 2016 presidential race. trump stands at 28%, while rival ted cruz has slid to 23%. but there's still a strong case for cruz in this race — he's more popular and respected than trump …
describing breitbart's speech –particularly the identification of culture's shaping of politics — as an epiphany, marlow recalled introducing himself to his future mentor in the lobby bar of the hotel.
asked to clarify her position on obamacare last week, mcsally told huffpost she believed the way obamacare did it was not the way to do it. however, she quickly acknowledged the changed politics surrounding the law and its impact on the country's health care system, arguing it ought to be fixed rather than repealed outright.
the real problem, though, has been the marketplace and how insurers have slowly left. this is having an impact - the high deductibles and the lack of options - on real people. i spoke with a mother, corrine bobby (ph), who lives just north of phoenix. and her daughter was born with a complex congenital heart disease. and so she was thrilled when the aca happened and her daughter could get coverage. but even to this day, she can't afford insurance for the rest of her family.
the trump-mcconnell meeting comes as pressure on the senate intensifies to pass tax cuts and give trump at least one major legislative victory before the end of the year. the senate will move this week to pass a budget, the first step in its effort to overhaul the tax code.
on the contrary, the people passing up on obamacare are making entirely rational decisions. they're voting with their wallets, and if they vote the same way with their ballots in 2016, we can finally end this nightmare.
romney said in his announcement video, i have decided to run for united states senate because i believe i can help bring utah's values and utah's lessons to washington.
we will respect historic institutions, but we will also respect the sovereign rights of nations.
mcsally, who later lost a senate race for one of arizona's seats before being appointed to the other, now has a different outlook. it's not about government-run health care or about repealing obamacare in its entirety, she said in a campaign video earlier this month. it's about bringing the cost down.
so i want to look at some of the policy areas this plays out today, because i think it's important to say this really clearly — drained pools is by no means the most consequential example of drained pool politics. and so i actually want to begin with medicaid expansion after the affordable care act. you cite a study in the book which found that as the percent of the black population increases, the likelihood of medicaid adoption in a state decreases. tell me about that.
schilling: well the first thing, i think the most obvious issue for me is, i find it stunning that when the president of the united states says america first, people get offended. that's a dog whistle. now, when the left says dog whistle, america first. americans are black, white, yellow, brown, green -- i don't -- they're all colors, all races, all religions. america -- that's what makes us so great.

the passion you hear from president trump, his determination to take this case to the american people as he will tonight in his national broadcast from the oval office, comes from his deep desire to do his job to protect the american people, pence told karl later in the interview — after reiterating the debunked statistic about terrorists trying to enter the united states that karl himself presented as an example of trump's misleading rhetoric. [w]e're going to continue to carry that case forward until the democrats in congress come to the table and start negotiating not just to end the government shutdown but to end what is an undeniable crisis at our southern border.

obama tried to assure sanders supporters that biden is liberal enough, particularly on health care.
a nixon to excite the left? cynthia nixon, that is. the actress and activist, a staple of new york city progressive politics for some time now, is inching closer to a primary challenge to gov. andrew cuomo, who's seeking his third term – and could, with a rout, put himself in a position to run in 2020. but nixon, who's getting advice from strategists rebecca katz (a longtime top aide and ally of new york mayor bill de blasio) and bill hyers, poses two kinds of threats to cuomo: 1) to actually beat him. she has the name recognition and the right politics to flank him on the left; and 2) by coming close, to put a major dent in cuomo's standing with liberals, who already have their qualms.
schilling: it's more scary than amazing because it's again -- you know, in many -- i've told you this in many ways, the media can do whatever they want to if they don't like you. they can do whatever they want to if they do like you. they've managed to marginalize me in many ways for things i've never done, but when i think about it, like i said, if general flynn is not off-limits, if hillary clinton can give access to our uranium to the russians and not be held accountable, then the justice system is broken horribly.
and we're going to talk about that after the break.
the senate filibuster is the only thing standing between us and the pro-abortion agenda of the washington liberals, an announcer says in the west virginia ads. thankfully, sen. joe manchin is standing strong for life.
the house intelligence committee ran a mickey mouse investigation of the russia matter that failed to called dozens of relevant witnesses and did not look for collusion, thereby allowing it to claim there was no collusion. ryan sat silently as republican committee members cooked up a misleading memo and conducted a smear campaign against the fbi. the speaker also objected to a select committee or an independent commission on russian interference in our election, and will not consider legislation to protect special counsel robert s. mueller iii or deputy attorney general rod j. rosenstein.

swalwell did vote for the bipartisan background checks act that passed the democratic-controlled house by a vote of 240-190 in february. the legislation, according to the congressional research service, expands background check requirements by prohibiting a firearm transfer between unlicensed individuals unless a licensed gun dealer, manufacturer, or importer first takes possession of the firearm to conduct a background check.
eight years ago, during the supreme court's heated deliberations over the constitutionality of the aca, the five conservative justices, including roberts and kennedy, believed that the individual insurance mandate exceeded congress' power to regulate interstate commerce. but roberts thought the invalid provision could be separated from much of the sweeping law.

columbia, s.c. ― south carolina was the site of one of vermont sen. bernie sanders' most humiliating defeats in his 2016 presidential run. he received just 26 percent of the vote in the palmetto state's early primary, presaging a shutout in the south that virtually assured hillary clinton the democratic nomination.
about 8 million people signed up for a health plan through the aca exchanges -- according to hhs, that meant officials had to verify more than 160 million individual pieces of information. in the end, they found 1.2 million people had inconsistencies in their applications.
yet public opposition to the law has ticked up again in recent months, in part because the cost of coverage from the law's insurance exchanges is rising in many states for 2016. the most recent kaiser family foundation tracking poll found 46 percent of americans had an unfavorable opinion of the law, compared with 40 percent who viewed it favorably. this has left the law a weapon of choice for republicans in congress, particularly in an election year in which speaker paul a. ryan is seeking to set the policy agenda.
yet this new variant is the same as its predecessor when it comes to subsidies to help individuals pay for insurance. it would mostly reduce subsidies and cause out-of-pocket costs to rise, as the cbo said about the previous bill. it's not yet clear how the state grants would alter that dynamic.
what makes the closures even more harmful, james argued, is the fact that poor, disabled and minority children are most affected by them.
cooper: the clinton campaign says they have learned the lessons of 2008. they have focused -- they have taken iowa a lot more seriously. they have had a lot of small meetings in smaller groups where they felt she really shines as a candidate. she has said she is a different candidate.
sen. bernie sanders (vt-i), presidential candidate: we will struggle tonight if the voter turnout is low. that's the fact. so what is our job today, is to make sure that we have the highest voter turnout possible. that happens, we win. let's good get them. thank you all.
on the economy, the number of good jobs in manufacturing has gone from boom to bust. inequality reached new extremes, as trump's appointed swamp of lobbyists, ceos and operatives worm their way into the federal bureaucracy and create more corruption, rigged rules and rip-offs. his tax cut didn't produce the $4,000 pay boost he promised; rather it lined the pockets of the rich and the corporations. chief executives used the corporate breaks mostly to buy back stock in an effort to please stockholders and boost the value of their stock options. and while his wall is arousing anger among homeowners whose properties are being requisitioned, he failed even to propose the rebuilding of america's decrepit infrastructure that he promised.
obama's call comes days after presumptive democratic nominee hillary clinton voiced support for a public option, in a nod to supporters of bernie sanders, who wanted the federal government to take over providing health care coverage for all americans.
could the problem be that for progressivism, witting or unwitting, whatever the format is, whatever the forum is. sports -- we're going to devour it with our ideology. that's my sense of this. whatever is out there, we have got to superimpose and project our ideology.
that's why both health care plans put forward by biden and harris leave some form of a private insurance system largely in place. sanders, meanwhile, has no qualms about eliminating the private insurance system altogether. he argues that not doing so would leave too many americans at the mercy of for-profit insurers while driving up costs for everybody.
the upshot: warren is certainly aware that the short-term awkwardness with colleagues could pay off in 2020, when the party's primary electorate is likely to be well to the left of the senate democratic caucus.
trump also claims to believe in the first amendment, yet demonizes the media on an almost daily basis as enemies of the people, calls any media report that do not make him look good fake news, and has halted white house daily press briefings.

the awareness of structural problems in american politics, starting with the senate, already feels stronger than it did a year ago, when obama said all of these things to me. and the approach democrats are taking to their covid-19 relief bill suggests they are learning to adapt. party leaders decided early on to use budget reconciliation, so they can pass something with 50 votes in the senate; republican support would be nice, they said, but they're not going to hold up legislation for it.

it's a ridiculous question, farage said, in between drags from his cigarette. it's a ludicrous question. i don't know. ... what you've seen in the first few days is his full intention to carry out his campaign promises. how refreshing.
the health care component of the speech was to be expected because trump and house republicans are pushing a bill dubbed the american health care act to replace obamacare.
i kind of feel like i'm walking through a nursing home and seeing an old friend, and he's just yelling at me. and it's like, you're an old friend, why are you yelling? he just says it louder, you know, and it's like, stop yelling.

aetna lost $450 million in the aca's exchanges last year and has cited those financial losses as the reason it slashed its marketplace participation for 2017, pulling out of 11 states. but u.s. district court judge john d. bates, who blocked the aetna-humana merger in january, found that wasn't the only reason. bates wrote in his opinion that the company exited some markets to improve the chance that the merger would be approved. in florida, the exchange business had been profitable, and the decision to leave that state was motivated by an attempt to avoid antitrust scrutiny, bates wrote.
the debate comes about two weeks after the two nominees last faced off at their first debate and after major revelations have surfaced about trump's past.
we're now almost 10 years into it, so i deal with the world we're in, and so let's figure out an offramp that addresses some of the underlying issues about the cost of health care while also providing more access to health insurance for people on the individual market that still can't afford health insurance that have preexisting conditions, mcsally said.
so it makes sense that donald trump just named mccaughey to his team of economic advisers.
that was, in part, because of the presence of conservative challenger danny tarkanian in the race.
a believer in precedent: this could be another thing that upsets the conservative base. in his speech, he also endorsed stare decisis, the practice of following precedent. we follow precedent, he said. he added that to be a good judge, one has to follow not just the letter but also the spirit of the law.
sethi has presented himself as a conservative outsider in the race against the trump-backed bill hagerty, but all the people he has brought into every senior role in his campaign are devout never trump political consultants.
in announcing the withdrawal, bertolini left the door open for aetna to return to the exchanges if the federal government makes improvements to the program.
the perils of the high-wire act of relying solely on democrats in the senate was put on display friday, when sen. joe manchin, a west virginia democrat, announced he would oppose biden's pick to lead the office of management and budget, neera tanden. if tanden is unable to secure republican support -- something democrats have been exceedingly skeptical of up to this point -- manchin's no vote would effectively kill the nomination.
when mccain cast the deciding vote against legislation graham introduced to overhaul the affordable care act in september 2017, wrecking republican chances of obamacare repeal, some questioned whether their friendship would weather the storm. president trump tweeted mccain had, let his best friend l.g. down! it would be the first of many verbal attacks mr. trump would make over mccain's vote in the months ahead.
he promised to return to the state to campaign for heller, laxalt and tarkanian.

but mccaughey's claim fit the broader narrative about health care reform that the right was constructing ― namely, that the proposed legislation would limit care for the medically vulnerable. soon sarah palin, the former alaska governor and 2008 gop vice presidential candidate, made her own version of the argument.

for now, the basic structure of obamacare remains. people who aren't offered insurance through an employer or a government program can buy healthcare.gov plans, with subsidized premiums for those earning up to 400% of poverty. people with incomes up to 250% of poverty are also eligible for reductions in deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs. (on average, a 40-year-old making $45,000 pays $227 a month for a subsidized low-cost plan, according to the kaiser family foundation. if the same person earned $50,000, the plan would cost $340 a month without the subsidy.)

that's to create a public option plan to be sold on the marketplaces alongside private coverage. all three men — kaine, bennet and biden — are in the camp of moderate democrats who want to fill in coverage gaps with incremental reforms rather than a sweeping medicare-for-all overhaul.
some democrats also urged more must be done. sen. jeanne shaheen (d-n.h.):
but democrats argue it's easy to defend themselves on legislation that gives people direct checks, access to paid leave, an extension of unemployment insurance and doesn't create new or controversial programs. much of the bill is bolstering or a continuation of programs that many republicans already voted for.
the adjustments to the existing subsidy programs could be done rather quickly, but the provision for the unemployed may take longer to implement since it is new, said larry levitt, executive vice president for health policy at the kaiser family foundation.
governor greg abbott today held a press conference in houston on the importance of election integrity legislation this session. the governor named election integrity as an emergency legislative item during his state of the state address in february. governor abbott was joined for the press conference by senator paul bettencourt and representative briscoe cain, who have both filed several pieces of legislation to enhance election integrity in texas

gina brodie of tucson bought an individual policy for about a decade before the aca and says she's fed up with increasing premiums. brodie and her husband have been paying more than $900 a month for an gold-level plan they bought on healthcare.gov even though she gave up trying to find a primary care doctor who would accept her insurance over the summer.

another former freedom caucus member, former rep. dave brat (r-va), now works at liberty university leading efforts to expose chinese communists. he told breitbart news on friday night that meadows is an excellent choice for trump to lead the white house staff.
more conservative members, led by the house freedom caucus, were angry that the bill left some of the affordable care act's insurance regulations in place. those regulations, they suggested, would keep premiums from falling further ― although the precise relationship between each of these regulations and actual premiums is murky.
as i write this, biden is stepping away from matlock long enough to give a speech eviscerating trump.
but the most telling part of trump's answer was when he described his alternative. after making the case for allowing cross-state purchase of insurance ― which would potentially lower premiums, but only by allowing insurers to escape existing regulations on benefits and sales practices ― trump said the following:
the decision to work together was fueled by the pandemic, the coalition said, and by the need to address longstanding inequities in health care access and disparities in health outcomes. millions of americans lost their insurance during the downturn, and the virus has disproportionately affected communities of color, which have experienced high numbers of cases and deaths.

instead, obamacare funded the creation of non-profit co-op insurers to provide consumers with alternatives. but more than half of them have failed since their debut in 2014, undone mainly by enrollees' unexpectedly high medical use. other insurers -- particularly unitedhealthcare (unh) -- have announced they are pulling out of obamacare, further restricting consumers' choices.
solicitor general noel francisco, the government's chief advocate before the supreme court, said in a brief that the other provisions of obamacare are impossible to separate from the individual mandate and that it necessarily follows that the rest of the aca must also fall.

sanders went on to suggest that those who did not reject that money should have to explain why the health care industry sees their candidacy as a good investment.

trump feeling pretty confident: we're going to win
-- additional commentary in today's newspaper:
but did she score the charmin!?
biden repeatedly outpolls mr. trump in head-to-head matchups, including in pivotal states like michigan and pennsylvania. and a clear majority of democratic voters say the ability to beat mr. trump is the single most important attribute a candidate can possess. jesse harris, biden's senior iowa adviser, said the campaign is looking to get biden in front of as many iowans as possible. in an attempt to reach a wider group of voters, biden's team in iowa is targeting not just previous caucus-goers and democrats, but also independents and republicans.
and biden said he doubted such candidates would want bernie sanders to come in and campaign for them.

granted, building coalitions around ambitious proposals takes time and building movements around them on the campaign trail only helps. but as heated as the debate over medicare for all has been so far, the presidential candidates who support implementing some permeation of it will have to convince more of their democratic colleagues in the senate to support it if it has any chance of becoming law in the near future.

the campaign in idaho began when two high school friends and one's wife toured the state last summer in a bright green 1977 dodge camper – with medicaid for idaho emblazoned on the side. they were trying to raise support for medicaid expansion by talking about those who earn too much to qualify for the safety net program but can't afford coverage on the obamacare exchanges. the trio, along with many volunteers, collected double the 56,000 signatures needed, said emily strizich, co-founder of reclaim idaho, which led the effort.
biden's campaign ― which has been holding out hope that a big win in south carolina would give the former vice president the momentum he needs to win in states across the country ― has said from the beginning that it's important to restore the soul of the nation against donald trump's administration. on saturday, biden rephrased: his campaign also wants this election to be about the soul of the democratic party.

price said one way to cover people with preexisting conditions under an obamacare replacement would be to push them into high-risk pools, in which people with high medical costs are pooled together to avoid having their expenses drive up premiums for healthier consumers. that hasn't worked well in the past, providing costly coverage to limited numbers of people, the associated press notes.
i can't understand why the president would, once again, disparage a man as exemplary as my friend john mccain: heroic, courageous, patriotic, honorable, self-effacing, self-sacrificing, empathetic, and driven by duty to family, country, and god, romney tweeted on tuesday.

question: (inaudible) three months ago then candidate trump was in gettysburg and he made a list of day one promises. he called it a contract with the american voters. a bunch of them are not gonna get done today because you said he's done with making executive orders; labeling china a currency manipulator and posing congressional term limits (inaudible). i wanted to ask you why not pursue all those on day one, as he promised in a contract with the voters?
so, there's a balance and i don't think it's an either/or situation. we can ensure that we're doing things that are smart for the environment and smart for our longevity as well as making sure that we're doing things that create economic growth and job creation.
warren's poor showing in new hampshire is especially embarrassing for her because her home state of massachusetts borders new hampshire and that should have given her a geographical advantage. sanders is also from a neighboring state – vermont.
that hasn't always been easy with a court now evenly divided between conservative and liberal justices in the wake of justice antonin scalia's death in february. it was scalia who in 1986 helped create what is known as a hot bench — one that questions lawyers unsparingly, often within seconds of their opening remarks.

i wrote recently about the importance of admitting when you have made a mistake, and this is one area where i wish i could press delete on some of my past columns. i was particularly vicious toward planned parenthood, despite my long support for the work they do to increase health care access for women. when it came to abortion later in pregnancy, i employed my now signature black-and-white thinking on a complicated topic that required more care.
so at the moment — this is sunday night, almost 9 o'clock — you are leaning toward joe biden. ok. what are the odds that you change your mind between now and super tuesday?
that's a tactic where the party in power would add extra seats to the nine-person supreme court and fill those new seats with their own appointees.
trump can have the opinion that it should have been ruled unconstitutional, but it was not.

some of the fraud cases detailed in the report go far beyond individual beneficiaries making the sort of calculation quinones described. some of them were organized conspiracies involving large numbers of medicaid beneficiaries recruited to provide inventory to drug dealers. the largest scheme chronicled in the report saw over a billion dollars change hands.
so how are these remorseful senators defending what some now say was the wrong move, to stand by trump for so long?

and there are several ideas to lower prescription drug costs that democrats have pushed for years — including some trump has supported. medicare would be free to negotiate prices with drug companies; makers of medicare-covered prescriptions wouldn't be allowed to raise prices by more than inflation and consumers could legally buy prescription drugs from other countries.
meanwhile, the need for reliable health care remains pressing. conditions such as heart and lung disease (pdf) are widespread in rural areas. addiction to the prescription painkillers known as opioids is acute. nationally, the medicaid expansion offered a bit of stability for some rural hospitals at risk of closure.
will there be a detailed discussion when prime minister may comes on friday on the potential parameters of what have a trade deal might look like? is there going to be a joint news conference? and is donald trump going to get a state (ph) visit back to the u.k. later in the year?
it's a setback, and it's a distraction … but a lot of people think the administration will win on appeal, said katherine hempstead, who heads the insurance coverage team at the robert wood johnson foundation, a public health philanthropy.
and guided by our vision, not blinded by our doubts.
that's right. but i mean, deep must that zero-sum story be to have white americans, the majority of whom have voted against the party of the new deal that largely built the white middle class since that party also expanded to become the party of civil rights too — they're cheering the gutting of public investments that they, in fact, would benefit from. and yet ever since integration, we have had white political majority that has cheered on the cutting of the social safety net, the ratcheting down of welfare to virtual meaninglessness, and the attacks on unions.
primus also did himself no favors in a march 25 meeting with staff from a number of congressional committees that have health care jurisdiction. he reportedly said the medicare for all hearing was a check the box and move on type of thing.
-- treasury secretary steve mnuchin, who will deliver a briefing today to house members on his decision to lift sanctions on companies linked to a russian oligarch, is attracting more scrutiny from house democrats. nbc news's heidi przybyla reports: mnuchin … has largely escaped investigative scrutiny. but because of his role in the campaign — and, most recently, the dec. 19 announcement easing sanctions on companies aligned with oleg deripaska, the putin ally with ties to former trump campaign chairman paul manafort — house democrats believe mnuchin should be a focus of and source of information for several planned investigations both related and unrelated to the russia probe, according to the aides. these include examinations of trump's finances and the business practices of the trump organization.
but since november's elections, much of those plans have been deferred, including a $24 million expansion of a second clinic, largely financed through bonds. the health system still plans to move forward with the construction of one clinic and the remodeling of another. but those plans could be bigger.

at issue in the case was the individual mandate, which requires people to have health insurance. the penalty for not having insurance was dropped to $0 in the most recent tax legislation, potentially undercutting the supreme court's decision in 2012 that the affordable care act was constitutional because of congress' ability to tax.
ms. abrams, 44, who favors the expansion of medicaid under obamacare and the extension of state scholarships to the immigrants known as dreamers, has given republicans many opportunities to argue that she is too far left for a state like georgia. senator david perdue recently called her the most radical liberal.

and, hogue said, the supreme court can also be swayed by public opinion.
the battle could play a key role in determining control of the senate in 2020. mcsally, for instance, is facing a stiff democratic challenge from former astronaut mark kelly, who is married to former rep. gabrielle giffords. democrats need to pick up at least three seats to gain control of congress' upper chamber and have any hope of enacting the party's agenda.
older americans are among those unseen in this epidemic, sen. bob casey, the top democrat on the senate special committee on aging, said during a hearing on opioid misuse by the elderly at a hearing last week. in 2016, one in three people with a medicare prescription drug plan received an opioid prescription. this puts baby boomers and our oldest generation at great risk.
the central tenet of medicare-x also closely aligns with biden's vision.
donald trump has lost the presidential election, but his last, desperate effort to kill the affordable care act will get its day before the u.s. supreme court on tuesday, when the justices hear arguments in a republican-backed lawsuit alleging that obamacare is unconstitutional.

holahan, co-author of the recent urban institute report, found the number of insurers, the level of 2015 premiums, and the types of insurers participating within the markets were the major factors influencing whether there were premium increases or decreases. the report concluded there is no meaningful national average, and the wide variation state to state is tied directly varying levels of competition around the country.

trump wants to drop a neutron bomb on obamacare. over to you, 2020 voters.
president donald trump's vague platitudes about beautiful and very special health care for everybody are not going to cut it in his 2020 re-election race – after he was left exposed on the most urgent issue in american politics.
trump hasn't started in on clinton yet, they say. the republican national committee hasn't offered its full guidance to trump.
what is clear is that 2018 — a year that republicans say will be messy — will loom large for them as they move toward a vote on the measure. but republicans say that gives them nearly a year of time, since people will experience few changes with their health care in 2017.
geno difabio, machine shop worker in youngstown, ohio: 'so easy to argue for donald trump with the facts'
democrats will need a strong turnout of anti-trump voters to have a chance of defeating him in the general election.

currently, households do not pay taxes on a certain minimum amount of income, depending on size and family status. during the campaign, trump proposed exempting households from paying taxes on their first $15,000 in income, regardless of the type or size of the household. he also proposed bringing the minimum marginal rate that ordinary households pay on their income up from 10 percent to 12 percent.
spicer: it is. it's an honor to do this, and yes. i believe that we have to be honest with the american people. i think sometimes we can disagree with the facts. there are certain things that we may not fully understand when we come out. but our intention's never to lie to you, jonathan. our job is to make sure that sometimes -- and you're in the same boat -- there are times when you guys tweet something out or write a story, and you publish a correction. that doesn't mean that you were trying to deceive readers and the american people, does it? and i think we should be afforded the same opportunity. there are times when we believe something to be true, or we get something from an agency, or we act in haste because the information available wasn't complete, but our desire to communicate with the american people and make sure that you have the most complete story at the time. and so we do it.
levin: and as a matter of fact, congress, even republicans keep saying we need to protect the prosecutor. no, you need to protect his targets because there's no check and balance right now, he's got enormous power beyond any u.s. attorney.

polling has shown the race to be close, with scott leading nelson by 3 percentage points in a cbs news poll from july. florida is one of the states where a loss would be devastating for democrats, as it would widen the narrow gap between the current majority and minority in the senate.
while praising sen. amy klobuchar (d-mn), matthews said, she had the guts to talk about the issue of this campaign, socialism. some people like it. those of us like me who grew up in the cold war and saw some aspects of it after visiting places like vietnam, cuba, being there, i've seen what socialism is. i don't like it. it's not only not free. it doesn't freaking work.
they adjusted those differences to account for factors that might skew the findings, such as unemployment rates, median household incomes and the number of cardiologists per 100,000 residents.
if there is going to be peace and legislation, there cannot be war and investigation. it just doesn't work that way!
sanders: medicare for all is the most cost-effective approach.
they not only must fight to keep the elderly poor they care for safe and alive during the coronavirus pandemic, they also have to fight extremist ideologues who think nuns should provide abortion pills in their healthcare plans too. the supreme court already told the government to accommodate the nuns' conscience rights and the president issued an executive order ensuring that employers cannot be forced to violate their religious beliefs.
the battle over the soon-to-be law, however, could determine the political future for both parties. democrats are all but certain to lose ground in congress in a 2022 midterm, but limiting those losses could give biden additional opportunities to push progressive policies. republicans, meanwhile, need to pin down an anti-biden message and see if fiscal conservatism resonates with their base and the broader electorate the same way it did a decade ago.
schilling: i don't think that's the sole reason. i think that that's part of it. i've seen that dynamic at work, but i do know that -- i was surprised by that by what you said. there were a lot more liberals in the booth and espn was -- i mean, i had people literally come up to me. it's almost like being a member of the underground railway, i guess.
in nevada, he did it through sheer popularity by proving he'd built a coalition, one made up of union workers, people with college degrees and hispanic voters. in iowa and new hampshire, he did it by narrowly beating out his moderate rivals who split the majority of the vote, with the leading moderate candidate, joe biden, losing support and stumbling badly.
without the aca, insurers could once again charge copayments or coinsurance for preventive care, including screenings, immunizations, annual checkups and birth control. medicare beneficiaries could again have to pay for certain services, including screenings for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. the law also closed the infamous doughnut hole in medicare's prescription drug coverage that left many older people paying thousands of dollars out of pocket for their medication.
is medicare for all bold? absolutely. is it reasonable? you bet. it is time to accept that medicare for all is the practical alternative.
what a journey, newman said in a statement her campaign released tuesday night. i am bursting with pride and gratitude for the amazing coalition who helped bring about much needed change in our district. we are going to work together to lower healthcare costs, to fight climate change, and to continue building a hospitable community for everyone, no matter where you come from.
as other state insurance commissioners gradually sign off on insurers' rate requests — which should all be decided within a month — many consumers are learning what's in store for 2017.
larry levitt, a senior vice president at the kaiser family foundation, noted congress doesn't seem terribly concerned with policies to help rein in health-care spending. the deal repeals ipab and and delays the cadillac tax on high-cost health plans (two parts of the aca intended to do just that):
anti-pipeline protesters rallied outside the white house on jan. 24, after president trump signed executive orders to revive the dakota access and keystone xl oil pipelines. many activists traveled to washington, d.c., from standing rock, where they had been camping out for months in opposition to the dakota access pipeline. (zoeann murphy/the washington post)
sharfstein and other public health experts also note that the administration is seeking to repeal the affordable care act and cut $1.5 trillion over 10 years from medicaid. more than 500,000 people addicted to opioids could lose their drug treatment coverage if the aca is repealed, according to the kaiser family foundation. the proposed medicaid cuts could further reduce coverage.
in addition to the health law's risk corridor program, which partially reimburses insurers for extreme losses, another provision requires insurers to make payments to competitors with sicker and costlier members. that is a sore point for evergreen. the co-op, which has about 40,000 members, sued the government in june, alleging that the risk-adjustment system is flawed because it does not adequately measure risk. the lawsuit is pending in federal court and a decision is expected this summer.

— the trump campaign responded to the debate with a statement saying all the candidates showed they'll ruin health care.
gottlieb wasn't stopping with nicotine. he was beginning to take a harder line on dietary supplements and opioid prescribing limits, and was actively implementing food and calorie-labeling laws passed during the obama administration. and he was outspoken on the high cost of prescription drugs and called the industry to account for underhanded practices that delayed the availability of lower-cost generic medicines. he even publicly named names of those who in his words game the system and exploit loopholes. like all good regulators, he wasn't out to get companies, just to hold them accountable to the public.
the former vice president then took another shot, saying i've great respect for mayor pete and his service to this nation but i believe it's a risk – to be straight up with you – for this party to nominate someone who's never held office higher than mayor of a town of 100,000 in indiana. i do believe it's a risk.
since enrollment started in 2014, the affordable care act brought significant changes to denver health medical center, a safety-net hospital with the busiest trauma center in colorado. historically, nearly two-thirds of patients were either uninsured or covered by medicaid, the government health insurance program for the poor.

overall, the gop leadership worked with trump to pass tax cuts and to cut the cost of the obamacare program. but it has fought trump tooth-and-nail on his efforts to block migrants with a border wall and legal reforms, and it has rebuffed trump's plans to reduce migration. those populist, wage-boosting goals are opposed by investors and business groups, which gain wealth when the federal government imports one million legal immigrant workers and consumers each year.
the 2009 launch of big hollywood seized on a vacancy for right-of-center news media outlets within a landscape dominated by leftism, said marlow. a huge space [existed] for a right-of-center worldview in the media space, he said. big hollywood launched the day after president obama's inauguration, and it was the beginning of an opposition to the establishment media narrative that largely hinged on [framing] obama as the messiah.
but the conversation covered a lot more than health care policy, because it's impossible to talk about the 2010 law without talking about the ways politics have been changing in the past decade, and how those changes affected what democrats were and weren't able to do. in many ways, the saga of the affordable care act is a case study in the challenges that progressives must overcome if they want to pass ambitious legislation ― challenges facing democrats now just as surely as they did during obama's tenure.
advocacy groups on both sides of the abortion issue are closely watching a challenge to a 2018 mississippi law that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy. but the case has been in limbo for months, even as some conservatives see the new majority as the best shot in generations to chip away at the 1973 roe v. wade decision that established a constitutional right to abortion.
for reasons never revealed, justice thomas apparently failed to keep the four colleagues he needed on board with his analysis of the case, and a decision was never published. did he overreach and scare the others away by trying to make too big a statement about the relationship between congress and the judiciary? did the court, tormented that term by the first obamacare case, just throw up its hands? the fate of first american financial is one of the little mysteries i'd like to see solved one of these years.
the centers for medicare and medicaid services (cms) announced the cut late tuesday. the cut will affect navigators, the nonprofit organizations that the federal government pays to help with enrollment in the states that use healthcare.gov as their online marketplace for people trying to get coverage through the affordable care act.
the demonstrations were largely peaceful. protesters scarcely argued with the officers arresting them, who in most cases declined to even employ handcuffs in taking the women into custody. several democratic lawmakers -- including sen. tammy duckworth, who arrived with her infant in tow -- showed up to express their support for the demonstration.
she also, unlike sen. sanders, has articulated how she's going to pay for that proposal, chelsea clinton said of hillary clinton's plan.
wapo: sen. richard burr (r-n.c.) said friday that he has asked the senate ethics committee to review his recent stock sales, which included some in industries that have been hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak. the senate intelligence committee chairman, who had expressed confidence in the country's preparedness for the pandemic, sold a significant share of his stocks last month, according to public disclosures. burr said he relied solely on public news reports for the sales but asked senate ethics chairman james lankford (r-okla.) for a review. 'understanding the assumption many could make in hindsight however, i spoke this morning with the chairman of the senate ethics committee and asked him to open a complete review of the matter with full transparency,' burr said in a statement. the sales included stocks in hotels and restaurants, shipping, drug manufacturing and health care, records show. in his statement, burr said he had relied specifically on 'cnbc's daily health and science reporting out of its asia bureaus.'
in theory, even the conservatives justices should make quick work of the case.
the biden campaign also wants to solve the ppe shortages that have plagued the u.s. health care system since the pandemic began, stating that it would produce more of these critical supplies, rather than leave states, cities, tribes, and territories to fend for themselves.
the center-right niskanen center put it exquisitely: liberty is a vital principle of the open society, but so are community and equality. absolutizing any of these political goods is the essence of ideological thinking, while moderation is a recognition that all of them are important. such a recognition necessarily puts some constraints on the achievement of any of these principles. and to buttigieg's point, even freedom to attain one's ambitions requires other limits on freedom (e.g. taxes to pay for schools).
no force in history has done more to advance the human condition than american freedom. in recent years we have made remarkable progress in the fight against hiv and aids. scientific breakthroughs have brought a once-distant dream within reach. my budget will ask democrats and republicans to make the needed commitment to eliminate the hiv epidemic in the united states within 10 years. together, we will defeat aids in america.

coming off his impeachment by house democrats, trump refused to shake the extended hand of house speaker nancy pelosi, d-calif., before he began his speech. pelosi ripped up the text of the president's speech right after he delivered it.
still, he wonders whether cruz could beat clinton. polls show clinton with a slight lead over the first-term texas senator. he acknowledged kasich could possibly beat her.
bash: certainly complex, but, if i may, can you shed more light on what we just heard? do you have a handle on who the individuals are and how many there are in the united states who are in contact...
trademark political moves from gehrke's and barnwell-hagemeyer's previous campaigns are on display in this race. sasse's 2014 u.s. senate primary, for instance, was one where he portrayed himself—just like sethi is doing—as the conservative outsider in the race. when breitbart news approached gehrke back then with questions regarding sasse's position on immigration levels to the united states, he had promised to answer them and provide quotes from sasse or his team on the matter. then, after several days went by, gehrke ended up finally giving a quote that did not fully answer the question and left open the possibility that sasse would support increases in legal immigration—all while gehkre lined up endorsements from senators like sen. ted cruz (r-tx) for sasse in the final days of the campaign. interestingly, on wednesday, cruz just endorsed sethi in tennessee—just like he did for sasse—despite all of these career consultants around him.
you call that whatever the heck you want to call it ― it's not medicare for all, he said tuesday in an interview on cnn.
the victory in maine buoyed efforts in other red states, where activists were already organizing.
travel ban and a reckoning with the courts

most americans don't see where they fit if they've got to choose between a socialist who thinks that capitalism is the root of all evil and a billionaire who thinks that money ought to be the root of all power, buttigieg said.
he then stressed that sanders calls himself a democratic socialist.
translation: people won't buy obama's lousy insurance, not even when forced to buy it at gunpoint. obvious left-wing solution: use bigger guns.
but after a group of senate republicans came out with a roughly $600 billion proposal that didn't include any direct state and local funding, many democratic senators immediately torpedoed the proposal, forcing even the moderates to evaluate how hard they ultimately were willing to push for bipartisanship or wait for it, and whether there was too much of a risk of losing votes on the progressive side of the caucus.
the administration hasn't announced the selection, but four people confirmed to dan diamond and amy goldstein that brooks-lasure is the pick to lead the $1 trillion agency that oversees medicare, medicaid and large parts of the aca.
time to get real. as an economist who has spent decades studying our health care system, i can tell you that medicare for all advocates are the only ones who are being reasonable, because theirs is the only plan that will control health care costs while finally achieving universal coverage.
leaving your job can mean making some big life changes. it's important that you're prepared so those changes don't cause you to experience financial hardship or put your future at risk.
rep. colin allred, d-texas, fears those numbers are on the rise based on calls to his office from constituents who have lost their jobs and their health insurance.
here's what's happening as the candidates spend their final hours in iowa:
health care was a central issue in the 2018 midterms, with democrats often focusing on the issue in campaign ads. those ads leveraged republican hostility to the affordable care act and a lawsuit targeting the law to raise the specter of a decline in coverage and a loss of coverage for preexisting conditions — to good political effect for the party.
denver health is not alone. across the country, hospitals are shifting to a more conservative stance as they await sweeping changes to the nation's healthcare law that for the first time in u.s. history would reverse a government healthcare entitlement program. the affordable care act, commonly known as obamacare, provided coverage to 20 million americans and brought higher revenues to many hospitals.

and that is precisely what many senate republicans fear.
while pete buttigieg continues to surge in the polls, harris took her first jab at the south bend mayor when asked about reports of his campaign using a stock photograph of a kenyan woman on his website to promote a plan targeted at african americans. though harris laughed at the report, she warned that the democratic nominee must have to have the ability to unify the party and the country, and added and you can't unify folks if you don't understand who they are and their specific needs and the right that they have to be represented based not on a stock photograph, but [on] who they actually are. is this the sign of more attacks to come in the surging mayor's direction?
the democrats showed barrett huge photos of the constituents whose stories they told, including with big placards that staff members set up behind sen. amy klobuchar of minnesota and sen. richard blumenthal of connecticut.
we are disappointed that hhs did not do a better job at specifically defining discrimination in plan benefit design, carl schmid, who heads the aids institute and represents the i am essential coalition of 197 patient groups, said in a statement. some insurance plans are finding ways to discriminate against patients, particularly those with chronic and serious health conditions.
the secretary pointed to the massive obamacare premium increases which occurred under president obama. they continue because of the structural infirmities in how obamacare was designed, he explained.
what they need to do is be sure to protect the government programs: medicare and medical assistance, andursky said. we can't put them at risk.
moderator susan page asked pence to tell us specifically, how would your administration protect americans with pre-existing conditions to have access to affordable insurance if the affordable care act (aca) is struck down?
growing number of 2020 democrats supporting 'green new deal'
1. health care bill vote: the house will vote on a bill to repeal and replace obamacare on thursday.
thanks to a unified republican government, i am confident that republicans in congress will deliver on their promises to the american people and bring positive change to our broken healthcare system.
maida barnett, a retired medical technologist of east norwich on long island, considers herself a republican, but would vote for a democrat if trump or cruz get the gop nomination. she views kasich as the most sane one.
and, mr. secretary, thanks for coming in.
this time, by negotiating with mr. trump on the complex issue of health care, a measure whose complexity he did not seem to fully grasp, they moved an already contentious bill further and further to the right, eliminating too many benefits to keep moderate and other conservative members on board. even mr. trump was said to be taken aback by their attempts to remove things republicans have long promised to keep, like health insurance benefits for children up to 26 years old.

come saturday, this partial government shutdown is poised to become the longest in u.s. history. regardless of how or when it ends, the donnybrook will have illustrated trump's weaknesses. as a result, the public image of the president will probably fall more in line with these underlying political realities.
spicer: 10 were in our -- were in the travel going over. so, 10 out of 400, plus. question: but the people -- the people who(ph) were(ph) in the front row, so those were cia employees?
when evidence developed that the video trump tweeted may have come from a reddit user who had posted racist comments in the past, that reddit user, name of hansassholesolo, apologized, which prompted paul begala to tweet,if only our president had the conscience and class of hansassholesolo. (disgraceful trump team members including donald trump jr. then riled up the trumposphere with the phony claim that cnn had blackmailed hans.)
spicer: well, i think -- i think what it's gonna -- what we're doing -- we are going to smartly do this. i mean, let's be clear. part of it is to make sure that they have america's interests in what they're doing and who they are. so we're not gonna get together with people under guise of defeating isis if that's not truly their guise or if they're not -- so let's -- let's not take that too far. thank you.
and like clinton did in 2016, they argued medicare-for-all isn't feasible in the united states.
steven pinsky, an independent voter from plainview, on new york's long island, had hoped this would be the presidential election in which he could vote republican for the first time since ronald reagan's tenure. but the only republican he would vote for is kasich.
the fourth is to limit medical malpractice lawsuits. and the fifth is to make health care more competitive in part through co-insurance products that give consumers more of a stake in the overall cost of their care.
she said, if hillary clinton had won and the affordable care act would be safe, i would've been happy to go home. i have options!
in seeking to get rid of the tax, the democrats appear in one sense to be joining the slow dismantlement — or at least undermining their own argument that the embattled health law will save taxpayers more than it costs them over the long run while holding down health spending broadly.
surprised? don't be. gingrich's plan to let traditional medicare wither on the vine, as he put in 1996, is more than 20 years old. ryan may be retiring from congress after the upcoming election, but his 2012 plan (and the various versions of it created since then) to slash medicare and replace it with a voucher system remains popular among fellow gop politicians, even though they tend to hide this during election years. or even straight-up lie about it.
the two wamps sent out a number of more anti-trump messages over the course of 2018 and 2019 and even into 2020 while they have been backing sethi:

the president called 100% expensing in the year of equipment purchases, one of the best kept secrets of the tax plann and said, i think it'll go down as maybe the most important element.
but among his top priorities is first saving the affordable care act, on which his health care promises rely.
one thing is certain, he said: snap is the nation's first line of defense against hunger.

the states didn't trust one another, not least because many of them had little in common culturally, ethnographically or politically. new englanders' puritan ancestors had devised their institutions to prevent their greatest fear: the formation of an aristocracy. yet the chesapeake country was run by a landed, slaveholding gentry, complete with english-style manor homes with names like monticello and mount vernon. how would they ever agree on the contours of a shared central government?

we have undertaken a historic effort to massively reduce job-crushing regulations, creating a deregulation task force inside of every government agency; imposing a new rule which mandates that for every one new regulation, two old regulations must be eliminated; and stopping a regulation that threatens the future and livelihoods of our great coal miners.
those of us who are 70-plus, we'll take care of ourselves, but don't sacrifice the country, he said, adding that he was not living in fear of covid-19. what i'm living in fear of is what's happening to this country.
the concern over the potential impact on working seniors is just one example of problems that arise as details of the plan emerge, critics say.
davis: this is the question that's going to dog the republican party through the midterms if they don't act on health care. mcconnell today said they'll focus on what they have done and try to turn the page. here's what he said.
donald trump: there is nothing wrong with size of my ...
the trump campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
she is taking a more cautious approach than are neighboring states georgia, tennessee, florida and mississippi, where republican governors have all moved to reopen at least parts of their economies.
by the end of the night, a billionaire with no political experience whatsoever could be one big winner and a self-proclaimed democratic socialist could be the other, or a canadian-born freshman senator or former senator and former secretary of state hillary clinton. the polling is tight on both sides. so get ready for a surprise or two.
madden: because you know what? they don't want their vote wasted.
the president also repeated several claims that we have already debunked — sometimes more than once.
the steep cuts to medicaid and medicare unveiled in trump's 2020 budget unveiled this month only bolstered the attacks of eager presidential candidates.
and when we come back, we are going to talk about politics back home. and, believe it or not, there is another potential shutdown of part of the government looming. senator cruz is part of this debate.
but to create this future, we must work with –- not against -– the men and women of law enforcement.
james, who has an mba from the university of michigan and works in his family's supply chain business, has played up his credentials as both a businessman and a fresh-faced, energetic outsider. it may be working.
some experts think even that's a little high. the kaiser family foundation's analysis suggests that enrollment would be, at most, 15 or 16 million, and that's only if all state enrollment rates matched those of the top 10 states now.
according to the times, the decision to delay the cap on costs was made because many employers said they needed to upgrade their computer systems. the issue was they used different systems to administer both medical coverage and drug coverage, and they were not set up to aggregate all the money an individual spends out of pocket.
— he noted that he was hired at harvard law school by kagan, who was appointed to the high court by obama.
i am so relieved it's all over.no more debates.no more threats of theatrics.they were clear- we now know who each is. now we the people vote — debra messing (@debramessing) october 20, 2016
and so these things that maybe have a beginning in the need to construct and sustain this racial caste system begin to be applied more broadly over time. is that true to how you think about it, or am i getting that story wrong?
on top of that, even before trump won the presidency, 2016 candidate sen. bernie sanders also showed that voters could be won over by a democratic socialist, as he describes himself, who proposed massive, progressive policy overhauls that opponents also derided as being unfeasible. sanders of vermont is an independent who caucuses with the democrats.
more immediately, sanders' plans, if presented to voters, would make it considerably harder for democrats to win the white house. some of his proposals address vital issues but are simply too ambitious. others, like forgiveness for student loan debt, are unfair and unworkable from the get-go. a major expansion of government is not going to sell with suburban professionals — the demographic that swung heavily democratic in the 2018 midterms and is arguably the most fertile ground for their nominee to work this november.
no vote had been taken related to congressional taxing power. it did not seem to matter, because the individual mandate was going to be struck down. the only uncertainty was whether any of obamacare would survive.
levin: is that typical or is it normally 400?
levin: yes, but how is that the case?
but the court ducked that question. instead, it made three critical choices.
garcia-navarro: ok, rena, just one more question on health care - i'd like to bring it back to president trump. do you think he has a clear vision for what health care reform entails?
whether trump understood that during the campaign, or even if he understands it now, is not clear. trump famously bragged at one point that he did not study issues like nato, even as he went on to describe his strong opinions about nato. in august 2015, trump told nbc news that he learned military policy from the shows ― television news and interview programs.

cruz: it doesn't make sense to -- to negotiate with terrorists.
then, at the very end of a televised debate, sanders' campaign announced a major endorsement: progressive star rep. alexandria ocasio-cortez. that weekend, she and sanders rallied in front of more than 20,000 people in new york city. suddenly sanders had life again — his campaign contributions shot up, his poll numbers rose, and it was warren, not sanders, who was facing questions about viability.
he made a variety of claims about the health care system, health care proposals and the scientific realities of covid-19. here are some of the highlights, as well as fact checking and context for his statements.
schilling: so when you talk about, you know, racist is the word everybody's throwing around. everybody's a racist. if you don't agree with us, you're a racist this and that, but i look at the civil war, all right and you know the three amendments that were passed post-civil war -- 13, 14, and 15 -- what they meant and what they did.
kodjak: that's john mcdonough, a professor at harvard who is a senate staffer who worked on obamacare. he says if a similar bill passes next year without a replacement...
azar rejected sen. claire mccaskill's push to allow hhs to directly negotiate priceswith drug companies, which is prohibited by law. azar said the private companies that administer medicare's drug benefit already do a good job negotiating costs. to a get a better deal, he said, the government would have to designate a list of drugs that would be covered, excluding other treatments seniors may want. he said that's why some countries have lower drug prices than the united states does.

if you listen to trump, he's fulfilled all promises and has done so perfectly, he wrote in an email to usa today. in other words, he can't be relied on to tell the truth and only people who haven't paid attention over the past four years or are members of his worshipful base would believe otherwise.
or, put simply, conservatives support people freely helping others, while those on the left advocate for forcing, manipulating and controlling people to accomplish their goals.
what's more, if you look at the right/track wrong track numbers throughout obama's presidency, except for the very beginning of his hopey/changey administration, and a very short time in december of 2012, the right track/wrong track number was much, much wider during his eight years — we're talking about a steady 25 to 35 percent gap.

republicans have offered a number of bills intended to show their commitment to protecting people with preexisting conditions ― a move designed to blunt democratic attacks over health care in 2020.
every conversation about socialism should begin with a discussion about what it actually entails. survey data show most americans have no clue what socialism is, despite the fact that it's regularly discussed in the media.
trump's 2016 election offered the freedom caucus a chance to use the same strategy with the executive branch, because trump had few allies in the gop and little knowledge of how washington worked. although the caucus and the president at first clashed over the repeal of obama's affordable care act, caucus chairman mark meadows (r-n.c.) eventually developed close relations with the president, and the group became one of his biggest advocates.

concerning health care, trump said he was most disappointed that he hasn't been able to sell what a great job we've done. the president touted his administration's termination of the obamacare individual mandate, and said plans were now less expensive -- but that the carcass of obamacare remains a problem.
but his four fellow conservatives believed that if the individual mandate was going down, it should take the whole law with it. they believed all the pieces were interlocked. roberts thought the individual mandate was entwined with only two other provisions, those known as the community rating and guaranteed issue. the community-rating section prevented insurers from charging some individuals higher premiums than others based on health status. the guaranteed-issue section required insurers to cover people regardless of pre-existing conditions.
we didn't adequately explain what we had done, biden said during a conversation with house democrats last week, reflecting on the passage of the 2009 law. barack was so modest, he didn't want to take, as he said, a 'victory lap.' i kept saying, 'tell people what we did.' he said, 'we don't have time. i'm not going to take a victory lap.' and we paid a price for it, ironically, for that humility.
retirement savings: self-employed individuals can save a lot more for retirement in vehicles like a solo 401(k), said michael mccauley, a certified public accountant in new jersey. that's because maximum retirement thresholds vary based on income, he said, and can reach as high as $53,000 for tax year 2016 or even $59,000 for those over age 50. that kind of savings isn't just a great way to supercharge your nest egg, but also a powerful way to defer taxes on the income earned by your business.
daniel martin, a 28-year-old highlands patient who also works in the rafting trade said he uses his new coverage for his monthly blood medication. a trump voter, he hadn't realized that coverage now could be in jeopardy.
this may be why pundits and centrist politicians view those plans as reasonable, but it means that they are leaving the main reason for our system's dysfunction in place: the multipayer, for-profit financing model.

from inside the capitol, ivey says that no one wants to open the economy more than she does, but that the state must first increase its testing capacity.
some conservatives, though, question his bona fides, and he is controversial with democrats because of his role investigating president bill clinton as part of the starr investigation in the 1990s. and he now believes that a sitting president should be protected from litigation and criminal investigations because they are time-consuming and distracting.
more importantly, overruling would also likely be seen as breaking the filibuster without voting to get rid of the filibuster. if a provision can be brought into reconciliation bill, ruled out of order by the parliamentarian and then be allowed on a simple majority vote, that is no different than passing the same thing outside of reconciliation with 51 votes, the argument goes. the counterargument is overrides could still be stopped with a supermajority, making it different from scrapping the filibuster.
mfume, a 71-year-old democrat who held the seat for five terms from 1987 to 1996, is trying to regain the office he held before cummings.
between 2010 and 2016, counties in states where medicaid expanded had 4 fewer deaths per 100,000 residents each year from cardiovascular causes after expansion, compared with counties in non-expansion states, according to the research. the findings were presented at the american heart association's scientific sessions on friday. enrollments for insurance under the aca began in 2014.

though not explicitly mentioned in his proposal, biden has said that undocumented immigrants would be able to buy into the public option plan and receive unsubsidized coverage — an option currently not allowed under the affordable care act.
when we get rid of those lines, you have competition and we'll be able to keep pre-existing and help people that can't get, don't have money because we are going to have people protected. and republicans feel this way. believe it or not and strongly this way. we're going to block grant. into the states. block grant into medicaid. so we will be able to take care of people without the necessary funds to take care of themselves.
by rejecting and returning any unneeded funds, as well as funds unrelated to covid-19, you would be taking responsible action to avoid wasting scarce tax dollars, he wrote. after all, every dollar in this package is borrowed.

asked again if the muslim ban is no longer his proposal, trump said, it's called extreme vetting.
when i read about his full-throated support for the repeal of obamacare, i could only wonder what his local subscribers think, based on the following two facts: ohio is second in the nation in drug overdose deaths and, in 2017, ohio was one of the main beneficiaries of obamacare. as noted in a february cincinnati enquirer article: the decline in the rate of uninsured was staggering: in 2008, 36.1 percent of the poorest ohioans had no health insurance. as of 2015, the number was 14.1 percent — nearly a 61 percent drop.
5. what happens if obamacare is struck down?
the basis for the lawsuit is the affordable care act's individual mandate. as originally written, the health care law imposed a financial penalty on people who could get insurance but did not.
shapiro: a lot's happened with the biden campaign in the last four days - that big win in south carolina, now endorsements from former rivals pete buttigieg and amy klobuchar. what's the mood among his campaign staff you're talking to?

but as spring 2015 turned into summer, it became clear that sanders' anti-establishment, anti-billionaire message was taking off. crowds grew and grew, including a rally in madison, wis., that drew more than 10,000 people.
arguably the first major example of these programs is a partnership between starbucks sbux, +2.24% and arizona state university that began in 2014. when the program initially launched, the company paid for starbucks employees working an average of 20 hours per week to finish up the last two years of their degree for free through asu's online program. in 2015, the company expanded the program to cover four years of tuition.

betsy mccaughey built a career out of saying bombastic, completely false things about health care reform. she is reviled by actual health care policy analysts from the left, right and center for spreading frightening, but demonstrably false, misinformation while adopting the tone and posture of a serious expert.

levin: but we pay most of the bills.
well, look, the american people aren't as concerned about the political debate as they are concerned about what's really happening at the border, he said.
a test of that dependency is coming with some southern states now on the brink of reopening.
with obamacare repeal off the legislative agenda ― for now, at least ― why would these senators write legislation to solve a problem that doesn't exist? because their party is the middle of unsolving it.
but what i find fascinating about this is that ted cruz is playing the game that barack obama did to a very large extent. he is running a terrific ground game. and trump has been engaging in an air game. and that's very new to politics.
but mulvaney's assertion really goes off the rails when you consider the impact of the expansion of medicaid, the health program for the poor. he did not mention it, but that was also a key part of the affordable care act. the law offered medicaid to nearly all low-income individuals with incomes at or below 138 percent of the poverty level, or $27,821 for a family of three in 2016. in kentucky, far more people qualified for health care under medicaid than signed up for obamacare insurance.
today trump has arrived in european to represent our nation in crucial discussions with leaders of key nations. he's already insisted in a press conference in poland that nobody really knows who hacked the u.s. election, even though the entire intelligence community told him it was russia. with north korea developing a missile that could deliver nuclear warheads to u.s. territory, and so many other dangers and challenges in the world, is this the man with which we are to defend america?
the guidance under obama... meant that a state's plan couldn't result in fewer people enrolled in affordable, comprehensive coverage, corlette explained. this new guidance is saying that so long as people in the state have 'access' to [comprehensive] coverage, it doesn't matter what they actually do... if un-insurance spikes or there's a big movement to [less comprehensive plans] a state won't get dinged for that.
but the bill did have a significant impact on the democratic presidential primary that was still two years away. future fellow candidates like massachusetts sen. elizabeth warren, new jersey sen. cory booker, california sen. kamala harris and new york sen kirsten gillibrand all rushed to cosponsor the legislation.
kelly: wow. it's the whole indiana team - upped stakes and moved to d.c.
the white house response is that he's not going to release his tax returns, kellyanne conway said sunday on abc's this week. she said the issue was settled in the election. people didn't care, she said. they voted for him.
besides trying to undo trump's changes – and prevent more – democrats have introduced legislation to expand the aca. that would include making premium subsidies for obamacare plans more generous as well as available to higher-income families.
the focus of the real christians around me was not on giving women the support they needed to prevent pregnancy through access to contraception or on developing economic support for poor women who can't afford another child in an already struggling family. i could not make common cause with them. until, it turned out, when it came to so-called late-term abortion, generally understood to be abortion after 20-22 weeks.
of course i do, trump said. her donors took massive write-offs.
there's no evidence that trump cares about health care at all beyond his intense desire to undo anything president barack obama did in office. has there been anything about trump's response to the novel coronavirus pandemic to suggest that the health and well-being of americans is a priority for him? two hundred thousand dead say otherwise.
unlike the affordable care act, medicare for all is not difficult to understand, and sells itself on its merits. it appeals to patients drowning in medical debt, doctors and medical professionals buried in paperwork, workers who are shouldering more of their premium costs, and business owners who year after year are forced to devote more resources to keeping their employees insured.
question: is the president going to shake up the leadership of cfpb before the director's term's up?
washington – a blockbuster abortion case is apparently on hold. a series of gun rights challenges never made it to the lineup. high-profile questions posed by donald trump's presidency are beginning to fade into irrelevance.
to pay for the expansion of those benefits, newsom is proposing that california restore the individual mandate to purchase health insurance, which was canceled by president donald trump at the federal level.
california's senate seat will definitely remain in democratic hands. incumbent sen. dianne feinstein overwhelmingly won her primary against state sen. kevin de leon, who challenged feinstein from the left. however, feinstein and de leon are both on the november ballot, due to california's practice of advancing the top two vote-getters in a primary, regardless of party.

social security: early in the first obama administration, numerous democrats flirted with the idea of serious deficit reduction including cuts in social security benefits, possibly by raising the retirement age. those days are gone with the biden platform.
joel mcelvain, outgoing assistant director of the federal programs branch, has spent more than 20 years at the department, much of it working on the biggest cases of the day. a former colleague described mcelvain to huffpost as a really good guy — the type who in any rational or just world would be at doj his entire career.
president trump has often cited australia's system as something that we can perhaps adopt or model our healthcare reform on. well, australia has a two-tiered system — so does singapore and many of these other places that people cite — it's not single-payer, it's not like canada or the u.k. but almost all the two-tiered systems have a feature where you are required to buy health instance, which would be a mandate, which the gop has been dead-set against for so long. they're going to have to face all these things if they're going to avoid the kamala harris-bernie sanders medicare for all socialized medicine.
nextgen america, which is funded by former presidential candidate and billionaire investor tom steyer, will officially endorse biden on wednesday and has reserved the digital ad buy to reach voters younger than 35. the group's decision to back biden isn't surprising; it had already announced plans to spend more than $40 million targeting trump and key republican-held senate seats this year.
california's $72,000 estimate for a hospital stay for coronavirus is considerably larger than what other analysts have projected. kaiser family foundation researchers found the average employer-sponsored plan pays an average of $20,292 for hospital admission of a patient with pneumonia and major complications. the average cost ranged from $11,533 to $24,178, depending on the area of the country.
discussions are ongoing about just how far to go on some policies, in particular the deferred action for childhood arrivals (daca) program, which has temporarily shielded hundreds of thousands of people who arrived in the u.s. as children from deportation. trump has previously vowed to reverse it.
but biden also faces an existential challenge to his candidacy from bloomberg, who is essentially arguing that he's better placed to fulfill the mission around which the former vice president has anchored his campaign beating trump.

fiorina said, the american people got a bill passed through congress that said we could fire the top 400 senior executives at the v.a. for dereliction of duty, when we know that 307,000 veterans have died waiting for health care and the v.a. handed out $142 million worth of bonuses for superb performances.
but where i disagree with david - i think he's trying to generalize it too much in saying, oh, this is all politics. there's a fundamental problem here, which is that president trump's hold on power depends on dividing the nation. it's not just that he's incapable of being a uniter. it's that unity is a dire threat to his political standing. and, you know, at 3:14 this morning, he tweeted an attack on cnn. and then later he sent out a tweet that - complaining that this bomb stuff - that's his phrase - was hurting the republicans in the election. there's something very specific here about our president and his party because it knows that most of its supporters support president trump - is incapable of talking out against him.

there's a bear in the woods:
trump supported a partial repeal-and-replace bill in the republican-backed american health care act, which wasn't expected to have as big of an impact on the uninsured. but he also backed an immediate repeal of the aca, with a replacement at a later date.
we have a legacy system that is one-sixth of the economy, obama said. the idea that you could, in some way, dismantle that entire system ― or even transition it entirely ― to a single payer system looked politically impractical and probably really disruptive. ... the best chance to actually get people healthier was going to be to design a system that acknowledged 85% of the american people have health insurance and that plugged the gap for those 15% who don't.
but there is another option, suggested by the plaintiffs in a final footnote to their latest brief: just dismiss the appeal. the procedure is known as a dig: dismissed as improvidently granted. the justices use it once or twice a term, usually when a case turns out, on further reflection, not to be what they thought it was when they granted it. in fact, the court used a dig on april 23 to dismiss a securities case, emulex corp. v. varjabedian, that had been argued a week earlier.
the president pointed to something of a silver lining in the episode: people are now staying in the united states, spending their money in the united states, and i like that. you know, i've been after that for a long time. i've been saying, let's stay in the u.s., spend your money here. it's sort of enforced doing that.

so why can't the g.o.p. just cut its losses and accept that obamacare has become part of our social fabric? after all, there was a time when people like ronald reagan insisted that medicare would destroy american freedom; these days republicans pose as defenders of the program (even if they're still trying to undermine and privatize it on the sly).

obama, who tied with president donald trump for the most admired man in america in a gallup poll this year, is the most popular democrat, according to yougov. he had large support among young voters, a group that biden has struggled to reach throughout the primary cycle. obama's endorsement could help the former vice president grow support among that voting bloc and encourage young voters to turn out.

you can have something that 70% of the country wants and it can't pass, obama said. and that can't be how any democracy functions over time. if you ask me what has contributed to the cynicism ― of government, and to some degree what contributed to the cynicism around the health care initiative ― it's the fact that a small minority of people can put a halt to everything.
thus, the trump strategy — allow the aca to collapse, and profit — makes little sense. nothing further to the right than the gop plan can pass, because that would alienate still more moderate republicans. the only thing that could conceivably pass is something that would have democratic and moderate republican support, and thus would be more liberal than the gop plan. that should theoretically give democrats leverage to demand fixes to the aca on their terms — fixes designed to incentivize more enrollment to the markets and further expand medicaid in states that haven't opted in — even if trump is successful in sabotaging the individual markets.
spicer: ...make sure mara (ph) gets a question, this time.

i think that will be a game changer, he said. it's infrastructure we would have needed to have done anyways.

now the bill — and the multitude of questions surrounding it — moves across the capitol to the senate. and the job doesn't get any easier. with only a two-vote republican majority and likely no democratic support, it would take only three gop no votes to sink the bill.
at the same time, the message directly from biden was clear: bipartisanship would be ideal, but it wasn't a necessity, particularly given the bill's perceived popularity outside of washington.
trump during his campaign, and after being elected, asserted over and again the us, mostly because of obama, had been diminished in the eyes of the world. he pledged to reverse that and restore those purported losses.

but rain and snow, combined with mountainous terrain and limited public transit, mean traveling even short distances poses hardship. it is still challenging to have to travel even 20 miles to get your care, said lisa davis, director of pennsylvania's office of rural health and outreach associate professor of health policy and administration at pennsylvania state university. it could take you all day to get to a one-hour appointment.
i, personally, as a sense of humor, like the alligator and swamp language. i think it actually - i think it vividly illustrates the problem because all the people in this city who are the alligators are going to hate the swamp being drained. and there's going to be constant fighting over it. but - you know, he is my leader. and if he decides to drop the swamp and the alligator, i will drop the swamp and the alligator.
question: what about with obamacare, are you guys enforcing the mandate or not?
in our interview, obama still seemed taken aback that republican state officials were refusing to expand medicaid eligibility, as the affordable care act envisioned, even though the federal government had committed to covering most of the cost and literally millions of low-income americans scattered across states like florida, georgia and texas stood to get insurance.
the review pieces also offer up a rare, if crude, example of direct public engagement with white identity politics in (relatively) mainstream american political life. we don't tend to think of white folks' fights to secure government benefits and protections as identity politics, informed by a set of grievances specific to one's racial or ethnic background. we tend to talk about these fights in terms of religion, class and other markers, or simply as politics, without racial or ethnic qualifiers. can mitt romney win over evangelicals? blue-collar workers are feeling the pressures of wage stagnation! the widely understood subtext is that most of the folks in question are also white.
unitedhealthcare (unh), the nation's largest insurer that is expecting to lose about $1 billion on obamacare policies in 2015 and 2016, is exiting most obamacare exchanges in 2017. humana (hum) announced last month that it was pulling out of nearly 1,200 counties in eight states next year. afterward, it will only be selling insurance on the exchanges in 156 counties in 11 states. others, including several blue cross blue shield companies, are also scaling back.
the only long-term solution for these humanitarian disasters is to create the conditions where displaced persons can safely return home and begin the long process of rebuilding.
on the other hand, fewer high-income beneficiaries would face premium surcharges if obamacare went away. private medicare advantage plans could reduce costs and improve coverage. also, a 0.9 percentage point increase in the payroll tax on higher-income workers would be repealed.
we've financed and built one global project after another, but ignored the fates of our children in the inner cities of chicago, baltimore, detroit — and so many other places throughout our land.
republicans will oppose the bill for a series of reasons, from the topline cost on down, but the combination of a party still finding its way in the wake of trump's loss, along with a series of proposals that have maintained popularity, has stunted the force of the opposition, the official said.
republicans want to make sure they are not going to appear to be lap dogs and lay down. they are saying yes, evers won, but it's not a mandate and he can't arbitrarily throw out everything they've worked on for eight years. that becomes laying down the political gauntlet, says republican strategist brandon scholz, asked about the politics at play. if roles were reversed, and democrats were fortifying things they'd worked on for eight years, republicans would say the same thing.

taxes were a key item in donald trump's presidential agenda. he and his advisors feel that revision of the nation's tax code will spur economic growth and, besides changing healthcare policy, be a hallmark of his presidency. however, his proposed tax policy will benefit businesses and the wealthy, while hurting the middle class, the poor, and ballooning the federal budget deficit and the national debt.

extra stabilization money, in part for high-risk customers. the original version of the bcra provided $112 billion that would have allowed states to stabilize their markets or help high-risk customers in a wide variety of ways. in this version, that is bumped up to $182 billion. one function of this money is to mitigate some of the two-tier issues created by new, nonqualified plans. if an insurer offers a plan that meets the obamacare criteria, that insurer would be eligible for money to help high-risk customers.
we expect our partners, whether in nato, in the middle east, or the pacific –- to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost.
but the economy is the stage on which people work in the hope of gaining personal development and the satisfaction of succeeding. it isn't just about the money.
the effort to sell the proposal started early in the process with biden's transition team regularly consulting with top democratic lawmakers as they constructed their plan. key elements, like the emergency expansion of the child tax credit -- a potentially transformative plank of the plan -- came directly from legislation drafted by democrats that held wide-ranging support in their congressional ranks. there was a recognition, multiple people directly involved said, that the cascading crises meant now was the moment to go big.

more than three decades later, trump ran and won on similar promises. he too vowed to hold washington accountable, jumpstart sluggish economic growth, and rebuild america's military to protect our nation's interests first and foremost. his message resonated in corners of the country where the liberal media and political punditry thought it impossible.
we're on a continuing resolution right now, which, as you point out, expires on february 27, which is less than 20 days at this point. and, as long as we're on a continuing resolution, that, in and of itself, creates uncertainty about how we go about our homeland security missions.
and pelosi's edge in the shutdown fight was only reinforced as the day went on. early wednesday afternoon, trump made the highly questionable decision of telling pelosi he would deliver the state of the union address next week from the house chamber, even though pelosi has raised shutdown-related objections to it. but pelosi quickly sent a letter back saying she would not extend the invitation, and trump, rather remarkably, immediately backed down. pelosi had called his bluff.
bush deployed powell to spend some of the capital that he'd earned as president, including through his navigation of the aftermath of 9/11. bush gave his own oval office address a month after powell's u.n. appearance hoping to convey the seriousness and deliberateness of his decision to invade iraq. it was an attempt, in part, to use the white house as a character witness to his argument.
and here's where it gets weird. while many focus on the size of a budget impact — would a $50 million change in revenues over 10 years be merely incidental in a $2 trillion reconciliation bill? — experts warn that the test is not just about the size of fiscal change but also its relation to the policy involved.

confronted sunday morning on abc's this week with a fresh trump tweet that transmitted a video from trump's pro wrestling period, doctored to depict him pummeling a man whose head is a cnn microphone, trump's white house terrorism advisor thomas bossert could have stayed in his lane, pivoting to talk of securing the homeland. hell, he even could have criticized trump's latest incitement to violence and attack on free speech (see 1, below). instead, bossert sucked up to his bellicose boss, insisting, falsely, no one would perceive that as a threat before adding, i hope they don't. then bossert, perhaps hoping trump would applaud the tv appearance rather than throw his golf shoe at the screen, gushed, he's a genuine president expressing himself genuinely.
this idea of place in our system of government is critical. ours is a government of separated powers. the power to make, enforce, and interpret the law isn't centralized in one person or one branch of government, said sen. chuck grassley of iowa, a top member of the panel.
progressives have balked at the idea, calling it a giveaway to private insurance companies and big corporations that run their own health insurance plans. subsidizing cobra would direct federal funds toward private companies that pay higher rates than public programs like medicare and medicaid. other health care proposals that have been championed by progressives in both the house and senate would have medicare cover americans' out-of-pocket medical costs during the pandemic, or allow americans who have filed for unemployment to be eligible for medicare.

and senator kamala harris announced monday that she will be spending thanksgiving with her family in iowa. bidar notes that harris has spent four days in iowa this month and is scheduled to spend five days in the hawkeye state during the week of thanksgiving. according to the latest cbs news battleground tracker, harris is polling at 5% in iowa, tied for fifth place with amy klobuchar. harris's campaign says they have knocked on more than 200,000 doors in iowa since august. day by day and door by door, we are continuing to grow our network of supporters, volunteers, and precinct leaders that form the heart of our campaign, said iowa organizing director erin phillips.
in 2012, right before their convention began, democrats could not bring themselves to say the country was better off than it had been four years earlier when obama took office — even though he was sworn in when america was in the grip of the great recession, losing hundreds of thousands of jobs a month and headed to 10% unemployment, and the auto industry was in free fall. democratic strategists had decided it was best to play down progress so as not to offend what veteran operative chris lehane called angry-bird voters upset over the direction of their lives and the country.
when there's a question of whether a provision would be successfully challenged on the floor via the byrd rule, the issue is usually argued first in the parliamentarian's office by staff from the two parties. the parliamentarian may rule then or withhold a ruling until the issue is brought up on the floor.

….i want to thank acting chief mick mulvaney for having served the administration so well. he will become the united states special envoy for northern ireland. thank you! — donald j. trump (@realdonaldtrump) march 7, 2020
-- estimates indicate each week of the shutdown is costing the u.s. economy $1.2 billion. politico's victoria guida reports: the roughly 800,000 government employees who are either furloughed or working without pay will be forced to start slashing their consumer spending when paychecks don't appear this week. private-sector contractors and other workers tied to the government are already seeing damage from lost business. and a hit to the nation's financial standing is on the horizon with a warning from fitch ratings on wednesday about downgrading the government's credit rating if the shutdown persists. … [the shutdown] could also cost the u.s. government more than a billion dollars in lost productivity for 350,000 workers who are forced to stay home.
brianna keilar, cnn senior political correspondent: well, wolf, today is so much about the waiting game after hillary clinton made her case last night for why she thinks iowans should caucus for her, where she said that she is basically more electable and that she's more capable of getting things done.
policing the usa: a look at race, justice, media
bagley, a former justice department attorney, said the doj has a durable, longstanding, bipartisan commitment to defending the laws passed by congress as long as there is a legitimate non-frivolous argument to be made in its defense.
the department of justice has determined that the district court's comprehensive opinion came to the correct conclusion and will support it on appeal, said kerri kupec, a spokesperson for the justice department.
he will offer tax credits to help low-income and middle-class families pay for child care. parents earning less than $125,000 a can get back up to half what they spend on child care for children under 13. the cap is $8,000 for one child or $16,000 for two or more children. and families making up to $400,000 can qualify for partial credits.
the motley fool is a usa today content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives. its content is produced independently of usa today.
officials in both parties have said this is a major problem they want to address. democrats have proposed a variety of options, all of which entail some combination of bolstering the affordable care act's financial assistance, using government to control prices and creating new public plans that can offer alternative coverage.
in chicago, more than 4,000 people were shot last year alone –- and the murder rate so far this year has been even higher.
the senate's attempt to pass a repeal of obamacare blew up after late sen. john mccain voted to prevent it from going to conference.
some of the administration's decisions have actually made it easier for people to buy comprehensive coverage, although by all accounts that was not intentional. in particular, the administration's decision to yank some of the subsidies that insurers get under the law ended up making coverage more affordable for some buyers, because it meant they were eligible for more financial assistance. but the administration has not stopped trying ― and that includes through the courts.
several nights a week, christine birhanzl drives the streets of hamilton, a former paper and steel mill town in southwestern ohio, handing out blankets, food and clothes to addicts.
researchers looked at latino enrollment in food stamps between 2006 and 2016, the most recent year for which data is available. they found that after the federal government began stepping up deportation efforts, latino immigrant enrollment in snap and the aca dropped. (the aca wasn't passed until 2010, and went into effect in 2014.)
the white house didn't stop there. the justice department, led by robert kennedy, probed the price increases and reportedly sent fbi agents to interview steel executives at their homes. the defense department also shifted some submarine contracts to smaller steelmakers that declined to raise prices.
mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the us border in particular. cnn reported on november 2 that the mexican government had reported the following: nearly 15,000 troops are deployed to mexico's northern border, where they've set up 20 checkpoints. ... at the southern border, 12,000 troops are deployed and have set up 21 checkpoints. you can read a full fact check here
but that doesn't help the millions of people with higher incomes who don't qualify for subsidies and are facing higher premiums. for them, the loss of insurance competition and higher rates has been a double blow, according to insurance agents. people are getting slammed and having to pay through the nose, says jocelyn boland, an insurance agent in the columbia, s.c., area who is handling about 500 obamacare clients this year. i have a lot of upset people.
when it comes to electing the president, the fact is that every vote does not count. this does not apply to any other elected position — the person who gets the most votes gets elected to office. the electoral college is an anachronism.
sinema did write a letter to the appropriations committee and even introduced an act that would have blocked the pay increase. but sinema was not the only member of congress to take steps to block pay raises.
the trump administration's view is that when it comes to our health, we don't need more protections, we need fewer things getting in the way of allowing companies to do as they please. fossil fuel companies have enjoyed not only the lowering of clean air and water standards, but former industry lobbyists have taken over writing the rules at the environmental protection agency.
so now that i'm on the inside, i know something i didn't know then. he's under audit. he's said completely, when audit is completed, he will release, she said on cnn's state of the union.
drug prices are too high, azar responded. i said that when i was at lilly.
in new orleans, there are clusters of cases in predominantly black neighborhoods where people mostly work in the tourism industry.
the only lawmaker in new hampshire's four-member all democratic congressional delegation said have tremendous respect for the vice president. but i've got to tell you, it's a risk to go after this campaign with the same message, the same ideas, the same issues that we've been litigating. i think we need new energy, i think we need a new approach ... bringing people together the way pete does.
i am proud to invite all the governors to the white house for this important annual event, melania trump, who wore a dark sleeveless gown, said in a statement earlier sunday. tonight, we come together as one nation, leaving political labels and partisan interests behind.
administration seeks to keep economic bad news under wraps - wsj: the trump administration asked states to abstain from releasing unemployment claims fig­ures prior to the publication of a national compilation of weekly u.s. jobless claims, according to a state labor department official. the official cited an email sent on wednesday from gay gilbert, an administrator at the u.s. labor department. ... the emailed message asked states to keep the numbers embargoed until the national claims figures are released each thursday, the state official said. the number of americans applying for first time unemployment benefits jumped last week in a spike tied to the coronavirus pandemic, increasing by 70,000 to 281,000, the fourth biggest weekly increase on record go­ing back to 1967. state level anecdotes suggest jobless claims could hit more than 2 million in next thursday's report, an unprecedented level, according to a note from goldman sachs.
question: he still plans to (inaudible) that day one list, though?
trump also signed a bipartisan legislative package weeks before the 2018 midterm election that creates, expands and renews programs designed to fight the epidemic.
our terrible drug epidemic will slow down and ultimately, stop.
supreme court connection: he clerked for kennedy from 1993 to 1994.
it's a little bit surreal, because for such a long period of time, there were some of us who were talking about this, and we were roundly dismissed or ignored, and now it looks like it's something people are viewing as a credible policy option, he said.
this time, the agency that runs the health insurance exchanges is slashing funds for organizations that help people to shop for coverage, forcing the groups to make do with about one-fourth of the federal funding they got for this year's open enrollment.
the president backed that idea later on in his campaign, as yet another way of giving more americans access to affordable coverage. affordability of health insurance is an ongoing concern for many americans — not only for those already covered but also for the nearly 30 million who remain uninsured, despite the sweeping 2010 health-care law.
trump's approach to handling the pandemic is clear from his record. his administration has delegated much of the authority for the coronavirus response to states, including testing and contact tracing. he's invested heavily in vaccine development. he signed two coronavirus relief packages and has indicated he'd sign another one after the election.
56:51 - source: cnn watch the entire donald trump news conference
but this latest regulatory change is a reminder that the gop has never given up on its goal of wiping obamacare off the books, and that people with serious medical problems are likely to suffer as a result.
at the end of that speech, obama promised: i won't stop; in fact, i will be right there with you, as a citizen, for all my days that remain.
although the success of this approach has yet to manifest itself in the polls, harris, in particular, has provided sanders ample fodder to distinguish himself as a more genuine champion of single-payer health care.
rubio doubled down on his charge the following day on cnn's state of the union: the bottom line is there's been this disturbing pattern over the last couple of weeks from ted cruz of just saying things that are not true.
ouch: the cdc says states should prioritize vaccinations for people with disabilities.
his greatest looming challenge will be presiding over ongoing investigations whose dimensions and direction are unclear. those alleged entanglements continue to expand, matt, ellen and greg write. u.s. officials said this week that the fbi has scrutinized communications between trump's national security adviser, lt. gen. michael t. flynn, and russian ambassador sergey kislyak. … u.s. officials, who like others spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation, said they have seen no evidence of wrongdoing. … the fbi for several months has been investigating allegations that trump associates or acquaintances, including his former campaign manager paul manafort, might have had improper contact with russian officials or intermediaries, u.s. officials said. the bureau is also still examining allegations in the dossier that comey discussed with trump in new york last month, according to a u.s. official.
striking down the aca will affect the most vulnerable, including women, children, seniors, people with low incomes and individuals with disabilities. how will pregnant women afford the necessary prenatal and maternity care, currently considered an essential benefit under the aca, if they lose coverage? at a time when the maternal mortality rate in the united states is worse than it was in the 1990s, it is unconscionable that we would further limit access to this care.
unless that changes, the outcome will depend on the supreme court, where nothing is guaranteed.
pelosi is described by friends and foes alike as a master legislative strategist. the first woman elected speaker of the house in 2007, she was a fierce critic of then-president george w. bush, but pelosi rounded up democratic votes to help him pass an economic bailout package.
spanish during the debate:beto o'rourke, cory booker weren't the first to drop spanish in a debate. and they likely won't be the last
trump said at the iowa rally that democrats support open borders.
joseph biden, vice president of the united states: given russia's recent history, we need to judge it by its deeds, not its words. don't tell us; show us, president putin.
house democrats will continue their vigorous defense of the affordable care act thursday when they bring to the floor measures to roll back some of president donald trump's alterations to the law. democrats' package includes provisions that would block trump's expansion of short-term plans that don't meet all the aca's requirements and would restore outreach funding that helps people enroll in obamacare plans.
obamacare must 'fall,' trump administration tells supreme court
just like in the past, the current debate over who gets to be a real american is all tied up with bigger debates about race and immigration. what's so fascinating about the latest iteration of this fight is that many white conservatives — whether downscale or establishment — suddenly see their fellow real americans standing on the wrong side of the line.
obama, by the way, had a similar election but couldn't sustain it, partly because he kept lying.
in iowa, doubt creeps in even among trump supporters
our citizens deserve this, and so much more — so why not join forces to finally get it done? on this and so many other things, democrats and republicans should get together and unite for the good of our country, and for the good of the american people.
as far as higher prices, darity believes that is not a serious argument against a job guarantee.
washington, dc - july 26: u.s. sen. john mccain (r-az) (l), who was recently diagnosed with brain cancer, and sen. lindsey graham (r-sc) head for the senate floor for a vote at the u.s. capitol july 26, 2017 in washington, dc. gop efforts to pass legislation to repeal and replace the affordable care act, also known as obamacare, were dealt setbacks when a mix of conservative and moderate republican senators joined democrats to oppose procedural measures on the bill. chip somodevilla / getty images
the inmates here are at least alive — unlike so many drug users in this part of central ohio, 40 miles southwest of columbus. fayette county has the seventh-highest number of fentanyl overdose deaths per capita in the nation, according to internal data from the centers for disease control and prevention obtained and analyzed by the washington post.
i often say that knowing when to leave a party is an art form.
the biggest value for the democrats is that it disrupts a news cycle and throws you off your message, haynes said. it'll take (republican candidates) off message for a day or two but there's no real long term damage.
clinton said back in june, she said trump was not fit to be president and commander in chief.
if enacted, such a program could be big or small; it could create massive reverberations in the private sector; and it could reshape monetary policy. one thing that is more certain is that americans will be hearing about the idea of job guarantees for the next few years.
the merits of the case are notoriously weak. even conservative and libertarian lawyers who supported past challenges to obamacare have filed friend-of-the-court briefs urging the justices to reject this one. for that reason, many legal observers think the chances of this lawsuit succeeding are relatively small.
i think maybe crazy bernie has it, trump said about sanders at a rally in north charleston, s.c., after asking audience members to cheer for the democrat they thought he could beat the easiest in november. sanders has called trump the most dangerous president in modern u.s. history.
when the time comes, pelosi will be able to say that she didn't want to move forward, but the so-called facts forced her hand. it's this type of political gamesmanship that the american people have come to loathe.
washington post fact-checker glenn kessler waded into the dispute. he notes that vaccinations under the trump administration reached a seven-day average of 980,000, virtually the goal of a million shots a day that biden had set for himself. but biden administration officials say that the plan set up by the trump administration did not have a solid national strategy for vaccinating people once the first stage of inoculating health-care workers and long-term care residents was complete.
schilling: yes, by playing a specific amount of time, yes.
more recent studies from the same researchers, studies from other groups and the number of corruption convictions in the state under ducey's administration have shown that arizona is middle of the road in terms of government corruption.
sen. ted cruz (r-tex.) follows the same strategy today. his 2016 platform included promises to repeal obamacare, abolish the irs and balance the budget — plans that he knew could never get enacted but were just the right red meat for the base. he treats his supporters like cannon fodder, whipping them into hysteria and sending them into battle.
president trump has chosen brett kavanaugh, a conservative judge from the u.s. court of appeals for the d.c. circuit — often thought of as the second-most-powerful court in the country — to replace justice anthony kennedy on the supreme court.
editor's note: donald trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the u.s.
that torch is now in our hands. and we will use it to light up the world. i am here tonight to deliver a message of unity and strength, and it is a message deeply delivered from my heart.
joe biden has seen a surge of momentum following endorsements from some former rival candidates. that's left the biden presidential campaign with new expectations for super tuesday.
consumers are sure to flock to the cheaper public plan. health care providers will respond by raising their rates for private insurers, who will have to pass those cost increases along to their customers in the form of higher premiums. that will drive still more people to the public option. the cycle would repeat, until the public option was the only insurance option left.
jeb bush (r), presidential candidate: he had written two memoirs. because it was all about him and his ambitions. and he's, as i said, an extraordinary, extraordinary speaker. and he was there for two years as the united states senator when he lost his campaign.

schilling: no, because i think the republic -- most of the republicans in congress stopped representing me about seven or eight years ago and started representing themselves and running for office the day they got into office.
cnn's photojournalists do not turn off cameras when trump insults cnn, and trump would not be able to notice even if they did: they do not use any light that goes on and off when they start and stop recording.
some 11.1 million people are enrolled in obamacare this year, according to the latest federal statistics.
courrielche said, andrew thought [the acorn story] was the story of his life, not only because it showed a deranged government-funded organization in action, [but] it would also expose the extreme bias in the media. you see, this was way before 'fake news' became a household phrase. many right-of-center folks were aware of the media bias, but almost no one understood how corrupt the press had become. andrew was going to expose that fact not just by calling out their bias …. instead he was going to expose it by showing that they would ignore a massive story that hurts the left.
ouch: the new mysterious, deadly coronavirus is sneaky and difficult to defeat. it's not alive, but it's frighteningly good at hijacking our cells and replicating millions of versions of itself to wreak havoc.
i think that the enrollment period should have been reopened, collins said in the interview. one of the reasons that i pushed the paycheck protection program so hard is that if we can keep people on their regular payroll, many more people will continue to receive their health insurance.
in refusing to follow bipartisan tradition and defend the aca in the u.s. federal court system, the trump administration is nakedly admitting that it wants to eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions, breaking a promise that the president has made time and again, said topher spiro, vice president of health policy at the center for american progress.
blitzer: yes. and the hillary clinton campaign is doing that social media, new development as well since then. all right, jeff, thanks very much.
inskeep: very briefly, what struck your ear, more broadly, as you listened to this lawmaker talking about rediscovering the power of public imagination, as she put it?

verrilli's tenure has been remarkable for its rapid-fire succession of historic cases, from obamacare and immigration to voting rights and same-sex marriage, that pitted a progressive democratic administration against a court dominated by the nominees of republican presidents. through it all, the 58-year-old appellate lawyer had to represent his client without repelling the court.

doctors know it's important to talk with their patients about end-of-life care.
obama had stayed mum on endorsing a candidate throughout the democratic primary, saying voters must pick the nominee. after sen. bernie sanders suspended his campaign last week, the primary election effectively came to an end, and biden is the presumptive democratic nominee.
meadows is cut from the same cloth as the president; he's a fighter and will do what it takes to win, cliff sims, a former trump white house official and outside ally of the president, added. he's the perfect choice to lead the white house staff through election season. a brilliant choice by president trump.
biden was happy to go along with all of that. he called the passage of obamacare a big f—ing deal on an open mic. but biden himself was not a radical. nor was he a moderate. his record in the senate was wildly inconsistent, driven more by political expediency than ideological convictions.
story highlights this isn't the first time barack obama has weighed in on events during donald trump's presidency obama clearly feels these are extraordinary times, cillizza writes
this conversation allows parents to make a very important moral argument: charity is morally positive, because it means people are voluntarily helping those in need, but government welfare programs – however well-intentioned they might be – are not forms of charity. they require the government to use force and coercion. those who don't want to pay for a government program because they think it isn't helpful – or perhaps believe it's harmful – are forced to pay their taxes and participate anyway. those who refuse can end up in prison.
trump was taking a private firm's estimate of about $5,000 in pre-tax household income gains and doubling it for reasons that do not make sense. you can read a full fact check here
those changes would require passing legislation through a closely-divided congress.

i've practiced medicine before and after the aca, and i have seen the profound impact it has had on the health and well-being of patients. in the emergency room before the aca, i treated a young woman who died from cardiac arrest because she couldn't afford treatment for the heart condition with which she was born.
the exhausting first year of donald trump's presidency
don't be a jerk: during a speech at catholic university's law school in 2015, a speech lots of people will be combing through, kavanaugh spoke a lot about humility (and used a lot of sports metaphors likening judges to referees and umpires and the necessity of being consistent).
know your options. having a thorough knowledge of your exchange options can help you when it comes to applying for subsidies. individual exchanges often change their benchmark plans -- those that qualify for government subsidies. if you stay in your plan from the previous year thinking it will still be the benchmark plan, but then the benchmark plan shifts to a different carrier, you may lose your subsidy.
infrastructure has been viewed as a bipartisan opportunity by both sides, but the issue faltered during the trump administration. talks around an infrastructure plan with trump and republicans broke down in 2019 and the repeated claims by the white house that the coming week would be infrastructure week became a running joke for democrats and republicans alike. the former president tweeted at the beginning of the pandemic that he was open to an infrastructure package to boost the economy, but the house passed a $1.5 trillion infrastructure bill in july with only three republicans supporting it and the measure stalled in the then-gop controlled senate.
montana health, which lost about $40 million in 2015, also has requested an average premium increase of 21% in idaho for next year and 22% in montana, she said.
many argue that premium costs — even when heavily subsidized by the government — are too high. the health law considers it affordable if insurance premiums cost 6% or less of income for those earning under 200% of the federal poverty limit, or about $40,000 for a family of three,
if only there was something, we can call it the affordable care act, and it can have exactly those types of protections and coverages and....oh right @barackobama did that already. seems like you are an expert at copy/paste. first #nafta, no the #aca. #trumpisalaughingstock — the voice of reason (@portarican_rt) august 8, 2020
new data seems to agree. a washington post-abc news poll out friday found that 48 percent of americans would blame trump and republicans for a shutdown, compared with 28 percent who would blame democrats. the rest of the participants either blamed both equally or had no opinion. a cnn poll also out friday found similar numbers blaming the president and republicans in congress over democrats, though 56 percent said approving a budget deal was more important than a daca deal, while just over a third said they wanted an immigration compromise included.
still, part of cruz's ability to rebound depends on whether he helps unify the gop or keeps his distance from trump after a bitter campaign. while cruz plans to be active as a surrogate in down-ticket races, he could anger trump supporters if he declines to help the party's presumptive nominee.
you would not be the first new yorker to do that.
everyone who has come to see senator sanders in the closing days of the campaign has been contacted by text, by e-mail, by phone call. they're trying to turn out their number ones, they call them. they organize people by one, two, three. one is the most committed supporter. they believe that they have enough number ones to have a big turnout here. the number that they're eying is this. if it's more than 160,000 people who turn out tonight, they believe that they're in good shape.
sen. kamala harris (d-calif.) on monday released her version of medicare for all, a plan to create a new, government-run insurance plan designed to cover all americans and pay for nearly all their medical expenses. the proposal would likely eliminate existing employer-sponsored plans, over the course of a decadelong transition, but allow private insurers to offer an alternative form of coverage, much as they do today for seniors on medicare.
clearly, state and federal policymakers need to continue to work together (toward) a more stable risk pool, certainty on funding and more reasonable regulations, says huff, who is also director of missouri's insurance office. over six years after the law was passed, making substantive corrections to the law is past due and, consequently, the markets are suffering.
one facet of obamacare is that it expanded medicaid eligibility. the cbo now expects a bump in medicaid sign-ups — up to 11 million enrolled this year and 15 million by 2026, per the report — citing new economic projections and a decrease in the share of future wage growth projected to go to lower-income people.
who knows what's going to happen? lacayo said, before dashing off.
more health highlight from the debate:
the senate approved the motion on monday afternoon to invoke cloture and end debate, 81-18, featuring overwhelming support.
sessions also took a break from his work to help trump's private prison owner donors, and to hurt gravely ill people who depend on medical marijuana, to appear last friday on the morning show fox & friends. despite his announced decision to recuse himself from the russiagate investigation, sessions offered thoughts on the russiagate investigation, including, when pressed by the fox hosts about concerns that special counsel robert mueller has hired lawyers connected to democratic politics, this comment: well, mr. mueller, is entitled, lawfully, i guess at this point, to hire who he desires, but i think he should look for people who have strength and credibility by all people. fairly bland, but a less disgraceful attorney general could have said, i'm recused from this matter so i can't comment on it. especially since a march 2 memo from jody hunt, sessions' chief of staff, said the ag's commitment to recuse on the investigation covers speaking with the media: the attorney general's recusal is not only with respect to such investigations, if any, but also extends to department responses to congressional and media inquiries related to any such investigations. george w. bush white house ethics lawyer richard painter flatly told politico that sessions should not be doing this.
absent a vaccine, i think it would quite likely become like seasonal flu or perhaps like some of the other coronaviruses that we are familiar with, bill hanage, an associate professor of epidemiology at harvard university's school of public health, told usa today earlier this year. it is entirely plausible that this could become part of our regular landscape of respiratory virai infections.

obama: how hard is it to say nazis are bad?
think really hard about whether this is the right thing for you or whether you should enroll full-time and get and complete the degree as quickly as possible, he said.
two of the biggest megadonors behind cruz's presidential ambitions offered personal donations to trump's favorite veterans' charities if the businessman agreed to face the texas senator. the dare comes on the eve of the next republican debate in des moines, iowa, which trump has pledged to not attend.
when sanders is pressed on how he will accomplish his ambitious goals, he often responds with the nebulous answer that it will require a political revolution, which seems to mean energizing and engaging an unprecedented number of new voters who would not only ensure his election but flip control of the senate and possibly the house.
andrew yang: sure. so none of you had heard of me eight, 10 months ago, i'd imagine. and i'm sitting here having outperformed half a dozen sitting senators, governors, members of congress. and so you have to ask yourself, how did that happen? and it happened because i'm laser-focused on the real problems that americans see around us every day, many of which led directly to donald trump being elected. right now, i'm fifth in the polls, rising, fastest-growing candidate or campaign in the race.

the reason you don't want to be dismissive of the intent of people who propose these things is there is a set of workers out there who aren't getting jobs no matter how well the economy is performing, said holtz-eakin.
bonfire of the vanities by tom wolfe (1987) - we know this isn't a political book, per se. but boy is it a great insight on the way the world of politics functions. wolfe's masterwork, set in the heady days of mid-1980s manhattan, provides amazing insight on the way racial politics, media muckraking, politicians' opportunism and cultural trends shape the way we are governed.

a recent study found nearly 40 percent of american patients dying with cancer received at least one chemotherapy treatment in the six months before they died, more than in six other countries studied. an average of about $18,500 was spent on u.s. hospital costs for patients in their last six months.
the research suggests, however, that medicaid is the federal program most prone to abuse, and the primary government funding source for the epidemic, the authors point out.

americans are fed up with the status quo. according to the cooperative congressional election survey, nearly two-thirds of 2016 voters indicated government corruption was an issue of very high importance to them. these voters supported trump by roughly 30 percentage points over hillary clinton, proving that the american public wants political figures to stand for their principles and drain the washington swamp.
our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion.
6. who is key to keeping the 50 senate democrats together?
(cnn) mike bloomberg's rivals tore into his claim to be the best candidate to defeat donald trump in november by branding him as a misogynistic, obamacare-hating, soft-on-wall-street bully -- basically the rough equivalent of that other new york billionaire.
richland was one of 74 counties that dropped from at least four insurers in 2016 to just one in 2017, according to a kaiser health news analysis of federal data for the 39 states that enroll people through healthcare.gov. in 66 of those counties, the blue cross and blue shield affiliated plan was the sole survivor.
jonathan turley, constitutional attorney, dec. 3, 2013: you have the rise of an uber presidency. there could be no greater danger for individual liberty. and i really think that the framers would be horrified.
stunning, no? and as gelles notes, this is far from a complete list of twitter attacks from trump. to expand on gelles' list, here's some of what trump has recently tweeted about the 11 people, places or things listed above.
mccaughey, already notorious for dishonest attacks on president bill clinton from a decade before, was engaging in wild distortion. the provision merely required that medicare pay for counseling sessions on how to write advance directives. that way, physicians would be able to carve out the time for seniors who wanted help making decisions about end-of-life care in the future.
still, new jersey's job growth was rather mediocre when compared to other states. in december, the state ranked 24th in year-over-year job growth, according to arizona state university's school of business.
in addition, the focus on new york city was bizarre. notwithstanding an uptick in crime, including shootings and murders in recent months, new york city does not even break the top 25 most crime-ridden big cities. and though the city is in the grips of an uptick in crime that is cause for local concern, the big apple is on track to have far fewer violent crimes this year than it did under giuliani.
i realized that it was a good lesson because i learned early in my life that they don't vote their conscience. they vote a --
the white house counsel's office was down to fewer than 20 lawyers late last year, compared with 40 to 50 in past administrations: since his arrival in december, cipollone has increased the staff to roughly 35 lawyer and aims to bolster the ranks to 40 in the coming weeks … he also hired three deputies, all with extensive experience in past republican white houses and the justice department. … cipollone first met trump when fox news commentator laura ingraham, a close friend, recommended him to help prepare the then-candidate for the 2016 presidential debates.
and yet: the us intelligence community has unanimously concluded that russia sought to interfere in the 2016 election – a move that seems like a direct shot at, well, democracy itself. and trump remains silent on putin and the country he rules. hmmm.
there's no reason for the national archives to ever digitally alter a historic photograph, rice university historian douglas brinkley said. if they don't want to use a specific image, then don't use it. but to confuse the public is reprehensible. the head of the archives has to very quickly fix this damage. a lot of history is messy, and there's zero reason why the archives can't be upfront about a photo from a women's march.

— he lists being a lecturer at harvard law (for which he was paid $27,220), the director of the d.c. circuit historical society and an adviser to the american law institute.
that is a phrase the lawmaker coined back in may because the late night host has been outspoken about his young son's heart condition and the amount of money it would cost someone who didn't have health insurance before the affordable care act, or obamacare, became law to obtain the kind of care his son has needed.
if we are going to break the stranglehold of corporate interests over the health care needs of the american people, we have got to confront a washington culture that is corrupt ― that puts profits ahead of the needs of the american people, he said toward the end of a speech about medicare for all to an audience of cheering supporters in washington. and that is why today i am calling on every democratic candidate in this election to join me in rejecting money from the insurance and drug companies. reject that money!
yo, superpacs: you won't stop trump by calling him a fake conservative. go at his strengths– as a sleaze who steamrolls the little guy. — jordan gehrke (@gehrke) february 1, 2016
7:35 p.m. et donald trump just delivered a pre-debate statement with women who have accused president bill clinton of sexual assault or rape including juanita broaddrick. full story to come on cbsnews.com.
minutes earlier, trump had taken the stage. for nearly 19 minutes, the real estate mogul told a captive audience stories about construction projects he had handled in new york, including at manhattan's grand hyatt hotel, which hosted the dinner. he spent the final eight minutes of his speech referencing prepared remarks about new york values, derided by cruz. those values, trump said, are represented by police, firefighters, transit workers and families playing in central park.
companies and groups last year increased their spending on washington lobbying to a level not seen in nearly a decade, according to the latest disclosures.
we are rationing the medication that would save people's lives at the moment that they're overdosing, wen recalled in a recent interview. how is that possible?
senator klobuchar, i'm going to come to you.
dionne: well, i think one of the difficulties here besides the fact that president trump clearly sort of focused on this caravan because he knows that talking about the threat of immigration helps to mobilize his base - the problem here is that there is a total mischaracterization of what democrats stand for. they are constantly accused of being for open borders. and when you look at all of the immigration bills they've voted for, they call for - and with support, i should say, back in the day from some republicans - they all spoke of obvious limits on immigration and tougher border enforcements.
the deal, which has strong support in the senate but may have a harder time passing the house today, would add more than $500 billion in federal spending over the next two years, delivering the military funding boost sought by president trump alongside the increase in domestic programs sought by democrats, the post's erica werner and mike debonis report. with a government shutdown deadline looming at midnight, the accord holds the promise of breaking a months-long partisan standoff centered on federal spending, though roadblocks remain, they write.
williamson's piece predictably raised lots of eyebrows — in right-wing circles and beyond — and david a. french, also at the national review, came to his colleague's defense in a post responding to the backlash. kevin is right, french wrote. if getting a job means renting a u-haul, rent the u-haul. you have nothing to lose but your government check. (french doubled down again this week with a post titled, the great white working-class debate: just because i'm 'nasty' doesn't mean i'm wrong.)
the proposal under discussion now comes from two republican senators, lamar alexander of tennessee and susan collins of maine. its focus is insurance for people who buy coverage on their own, either through healthcare.gov, state exchanges like covered california, or directly from insurers.
let's face it; pelosi couldn't even stand up to radical rep. ilhan omar, d-minn., over omar's anti-semitic comments. does anyone really think pelosi will stand up to the angry socialist mob over impeachment? who's she trying to kid?
trump has also backed an end to surprise billing, which members of congress have sought to take up.
well, i was wrong about clinton. hideous hillary won the primary, but bernie did give her a helluva run, and bernie is a 485-year-old marxist. how's that for change?
last monday, kimmel said, a surgeon opened [billy's] chest and fixed one of the two defects in his heart. he went in there with a scalpel and did some kind of magic that i couldn't even begin to explain. he opened the valve, and the operation was a success. it was the longest three hours of my life. the baby will need to have another heart surgery in three to six months, and another procedure when he's a teenager to replace the valve he has now.
and we've spent trillions of dollars overseas, while our infrastructure at home has so badly crumbled.

bash: congresswoman, thank you so much. former congressman, thank you so much for joining us.
the technology exists. we're just going to have to find a way to do it, klobuchar said monday. … i think at some point it's going to become inevitable.
tolson: i think as a business person, he has a clear vision in terms of the final outcome. i don't know necessarily if the first round is the best solution, but something has to be done. and obamacare, great in its idea - maybe president obama had a vision as well, but we didn't get there.

the republican-controlled senate is charging ahead with barrett's confirmation at a pace that is uncharacteristic of the upper chamber, as they and mr. trump want her confirmed before the general election on november 3. but democrats are casting barrett's nomination as illegitimate, citing the proximity to election day.

rep. cheri bustos (d-ill.), who heads the house democratic campaign arm, said she's urging vulnerable members to follow federal health guidelines, which also means no public gatherings.
tourists in the nation's capital have been forced to come up with alternative itineraries as a result of the shutdown. popular tourist attractions like the national zoo, the smithsonian museums and national monuments are all closed.
the senate passed the measure last year under special rules that protected it from a democratic filibuster, and the house passed it this week.
obamacare's problems and two visions for fixing them
it was an energetic speech from biden, who has been dinged on the campaign trail for an apparent inability to spur the same enthusiasm and movement-style politics as sanders. the senator won the popular vote in iowa, the new hampshire primary and had a blowout victory in the nevada caucuses.
editor's note: cecile richards is president of the planned parenthood action fund. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.
mccammon: you know, trump has said they will be running his business while he's president, and he's promised it would be in a blind trust. and that's intended to shield him from conflicts of interest. but, of course, these are his children, and it's clear that they're continuing to take an active role in the transition to a trump administration. we know that they've been in and out of meetings at trump tower in new york this week. and it's not clear exactly what their role will be, but federal law prohibits federal employees - and that includes the president - from hiring immediate family members to agencies that they control, which is a lot of agencies if you're the president. and that also would include his son-in-law jared kushner, who's played an important role in the campaign and was seen taking a walk this week with white house chief-of-staff denis mcdonough.
affordable care act hits more road bumps
bash: yes. congresswoman, i want to ask you about what to do now with regard to isis.

the susan b. anthony group spent $200,000 on radio ads pressuring west virginia sen. joe manchin – one of the few anti-abortion democrats in congress – to continue supporting the hyde amendment and opposing eliminating the filibuster.
i don't know why president obama hasn't supported joe biden a long time ago, trump said at a coronavirus briefing, claiming that obama feels something is wrong.
[applause] thank you. good evening, and welcome to tonight's program. my name is brian f. keane, and i am the director of the kennedy political union.
taxes: they'd be going up. much of the initial round of biden's tax increases would come from reversing many of trump's signature tax cuts from 2017. this would impact upper-income americans the most, regardless of age.
rubio's claim that cruz supported paul's budget – which was advertised as reducing the size of the military, but which actually increased defense spending – is true. but his assertion that cruz hasn't supported other measures is false, since he supported rubio's own bill that increased spending.
i want to make sure it gets done right, he said of replacing obamacare in an interview with the washington post.
it's like he doesn't know how to take on his opponents without just yelling it. and he was stumbling on these words.
as we found out, no one could have predicted the magnitude of the next day. marches erupted across the country and on every continent. several reports said it was likely the largest demonstration on record in the united states, dwarfing the inaugural crowd the day before. by some estimates as many as 4 million people just felt they had to march. so they picked up their signs, left home and spoke with their feet.
kaine: no, on this one -- on this one we're in the same place because, again, we can't police a region that won't police itself.
biden ended his speech with one more poignant attack on sanders' lifelong position as an independent in congress, and as a democratic socialist who has been critical of the democratic party.
a key problem with the plan is that the federal deduction for state and local income taxes would be eliminated, thereby hurting taxpayers in new york, california, or massachusetts who pay high amounts. the residents of those and other such states would be severely hurt since their taxes are much higher than places like florida and texas, and would actually see a severely substantial tax increase. according to the congressional joint committee on taxation, taxpayers using this deduction save more than $100 billion, which is actually greater than the mortgage interest deduction.

trump's immigration policies have resulted in sacred immigrant children being put in cages and separated from their parents. he is now keeping many pregnant women from entering the u.s. from abroad, to prevent their babies from being born as u.s. citizens.
sagal: according to new data released on thursday, social media site blank lost over 2 million users last quarter.
cpac has never been ideal turf for trump. though the gathering helped legitimize him among conservatives when he first appeared in 2011, he skipped the conference in 2016, out of fear that the crowd would walk out of his speech in protest. his address on friday sparked no such act of defiance. it was, instead, a fairly well received, if not meandering, attack on the press, and a review of campaign promises.
first, the g.o.p.'s policy-making and policy analysis capacity has been downgraded to the point of worthlessness. there are real conservative policy experts, but the party doesn't want them, perhaps because their very competence makes them ideologically unreliable — a proposition illustrated by the rush to enact this bill before the nonpartisan congressional budget office can estimate either its costs or its effects. basically, facts and serious analysis are the modern right's enemies; policy is left to hacks who can't get even the simplest things right.
between a coronavirus pandemic that had infected 7.6 million americans as of friday and a high-stakes supreme court case just weeks away, health insurance for people with pre-existing health conditions is on the minds of many.
what's unprecedented about trump's criticism of amazon.com inc. amzn, -3.44% , however, is the frequency and intensity of his attacks and an apparent personal animus toward company owner jeff bezos.
-- the shutdown has sharply reduced the fda's food inspections. laurie mcginley and joel achenbach report: the agency, which oversees 80 percent of the food supply, has suspended all routine inspections of domestic food-processing facilities, fda commissioner scott gottlieb said in an interview. he is working on a plan to bring inspectors back as early as next week to inspect facilities considered high-risk because they handle sensitive items such as seafood, soft cheese and vegetables, or have a history of problems.
nhai nguyen, 68, has been in the united states since 1991. she's retired now, and her 74-year-old husband is blind. food stamps only take them but so far, she said, so they come to the food pantry at the spanish catholic center. she worries constantly, she said, even though she is a naturalized citizen.
i have a deep devotion...to making sure that every american feels that he or she has a place in our country, she said.
so while trump makes a very comprehensive, mostly cultural and identity critique, the democrats come back with a materialist response, which is, we're going to protect your benefits. and that's a decent response in normal times, but in times like this, i think the democrats should be making an argument in defense of pluralism, in defense of diversity, a big argument against what trump really stands for.
mcsally is denying her change in tone marks a significant shift ― she said it was fake news when an interviewer asked her about it on friday. but her new rhetoric, which comes after years of support for a full repeal of obamacare and after a vote for a plan that would have increased costs and weakened protections for people with preexisting conditions, is representative of how republican senators up for reelection in 2020 are approaching the law.
but three weeks into his presidency, he has been repeatedly disarmed and frustrated by partisan opponents and the machinery of a government designed to check his power.
the white house, meanwhile, began planning travel. biden is set to visit pennsylvania next week to sell the bill, while vice president harris will travel to colorado. over the next 10 days, the white house plans to highlight different key aspects of the bill, including halving child poverty and boosting rural health care.
but if the lack of democratic support was to blame for this governing debacle, trump has no one to blame but himself.
health care remains the no. 1 issue for voters, according to public opinion polling, and republicans remain on the defensive following a democratic midterm romp.
according to a new monmouth university poll, half of americans say the president has done a good job handling the crisis, compared with 72 percent who say their state's governor has done a good job.
police and sheriffs are members of our community. they are friends and neighbors, they are mothers and fathers, sons and daughters – and they leave behind loved ones every day who worry whether or not they'll come home safe and sound.
former cbs news anchor dan rather:
unless the states in the south can coordinate the way the states in the north, east, the west, and the upper midwest are striving to do, we're going to have problems, he says.
there's been a lot of focus on how the 2020 candidates are picking sides between medicare-for-all and the public option approach. many of them have moved towards a more moderate position, a shift that was most evident last night in warren, who spoke enthusiastically about shoring up obamacare and barely mentioned medicare-for-all.
trump's demand was an audacious act of political brinkmanship, designed to rattle and win over dissident republican lawmakers who, for various reasons, were objecting to the bill.
this is hyperbole. the law has survived many setbacks, and it will overcome aetna's decision, too.
well, the speaker has awesome power. but if the president of the united states is against governance and doesn't care whether people's needs are met or that public employees are paid or that we can have a legitimate discussion, then we have a problem, and we have to take it to the american people, she replied.
amy coney barrett: a dream for the right, nightmare for the left
born in the great recession, the affordable care act was drafted with a focus on costs. political compromises and concerns about runaway deficits kept the law's overall 10-year price tag under $1 trillion, and included enough spending cuts and tax increases to pay for it. those constraints led its architects to scale back the financial help for americans buying their own coverage. staffers who wrote the formulas said they ran hundreds of simulations to figure out how to cover the most people within their budget.
the president has long cited his move to restrict travel from china as one of those actions. but the president was also slower on other needed measures.
the end of christie's term in office can't come quick enough for the people of new jersey, who currently give the governor a 15 percent approval rating. christie could quickly replace hapless reince priebus (june 15 ranking: 10) as white house chief of staff, assuming priebus is tired of the humiliation at trump's hands, and christie is tanned, rested, and ready for more humiliation at trump's hands.

yeah. i traveled to montgomery, alabama, where oak park is still there, but the pool that was the center of the park in the middle of montgomery was filled in, seeded over with grass by the time the next summer came along, and you see this wide expanse rimmed with oak trees now. i actually collected a handful of the acorns from these oak trees just as a reminder of how recent this phenomenon was, and how it can regenerate if we're not careful — these seeds of this exclusion and dispossession. they closed in montgomery the parks and recreation department for a decade, from 1959 to 1969. so they sold off the animals to the zoo. they had no parks and recreation department at all for a decade of the 1960s. and when they reopened the system, they never recreated the pool. they never rebuilt the pool.
spicer: go ahead. question: first of all, congratulations.

spicer: i'm not gonna get in front of the president's executive actions, but i will tell you that areas like dakota and the keystone pipeline, areas that we can increase jobs, increase economic growth, and tap into america's energy supply more, that's something that he has been very clear about. i think he talked about it, not only on the campaign, but around the thanksgiving period. he was talking about that being a big priority. that's one of those ones where i think that the energy sector and our natural resources are an area where i think the president is very, very keen on making sure that we maximize our use of natural resources to america's benefit. it's good for economic growth, it's good for jobs, and it's good for american energy.
the department, which oversees the implementation of the affordable care act, has gotten hit by audits showing it hasn't done enough to crack down on fraudsters trying to scam the system. at the same time, some frustrated applicants say they have played by the rules -- signed up on time and submitted the necessary paperwork -- only to be caught up in bureaucratic red tape.
saxo bank strategist eleanor creagh said, given biden's lead in the polls, a strong showing in the debate could raise expectations of a democratic clean sweep. one way to lower the odds of a contested outcome (that brings noise and volatility) is via a large margin of victory that cannot be undermined, she said.
sen. claire mccaskill is yet another endangered democrat seeking re-election in a state mr. trump won by an overwhelming margin. mccaskill has lucked out in her republican opponents in previous years; in 2012, the candidacy of republican todd akin was tanked by his comment that legitimate rape could not result in pregnancy.
another complication for ginsburg was that in late spring she had fallen on the marble floor of her bathroom and cracked several ribs. there was nothing to be done except to work through the pain.
the los angeles times reported last month that california had built up a large stockpile of thousands of ventilators, 50 million respirator masks, and several mobile hospital units under republican gov. arnold schwarzenneger. however, his democratic successors cut the funding necessary to maintain the stockpiles, and never restored them.
biden ramps up government spending on education, health care and other social programs, the benefits of which largely go to those in the bottom half of the income distribution,'' moody's analytics wrote in a report for investors before biden was officially the president-elect. meanwhile, he meaningfully increases taxes on the well-to-do, financial institutions and businesses to help pay for it.
senator cruz and mr. trump both respect the veterans and hold them in the highest regard but senator cruz respects the process and we are calling on mr. trump to do the same and debates are the purest form of democracy, the donors said in a statement. iowans – and americans – deserve to hear from the front-runners in this 'two-man race' one last time.

under the alexander-collins bill, no insurer that accepts either reinsurance or csr funds could pay for abortion services. if that were to become law, then it's almost certain no insurer offering coverage to individuals would include abortion coverage, because no insurer would want to give up those lucrative payments.

tonight, the trump administration took its cynical sabotage campaign of americans' health care to a stunning new low, pelosi said in a statement. once again, republicans are trying to destroy protections for americans with pre-existing conditions. the trump administration is perpetuating the same cruel vision of higher costs and less coverage that house republicans voted for in the monstrosity of trumpcare.
donors want team players who unite, not fracture our party, mosbacher said.
this is an updated version of a report that was first published on may 2, 2019.
rather than replace the aca and traditional medicare with something less reliable, as biden suggests, sanders' legislation would enroll everyone in an expanded version of medicare that covers vision and dental care, and no longer costs americans anything at the point of service.
gohmert said, this is really tragic, a massive spending bill. and the truth is, the house did our job. we passed 12 appropriations bills. we had a budget. and the senate didn't do their job. it doesn't appear they're ever going to until number one, we get rid of the cloture, the 60 vote requirement and go with 51. … president trump's been great on that. and then — and by the way, the constitution only requires a majority. that was a super-imposition by the senate.
the law's likely overhaul puts many hospitals in a uniquely daunting position of being unable to predict how many of their patients will be insured and what type of coverage they will have in the future. as a result, many are more wary than in years past to invest in expensive capital projects, issue debt, or expand into new regions, said healthcare experts and hospital executives.
biden's health care policy team includes dr. ezekiel emanuel, an architect of obamacare; his foreign policy advisors include jake sullivan, who helped negotiate the hopeless iran deal.
democrats said the health care issue helped them reclaim the u.s. house in last year's congressional elections, and it will help them win back the presidency next year – especially if the obama health care law is struck down.
i think i'm going to see you roaming the halls of congress, looking for some kind of solution to your funding problem in the next couple of weeks.
some members of congress are more sympathetic to the cause than others. sen. roger wicker (r-miss.), who has been tracking the heritage-led effort, seemed to feel the plan might give congress another chance to repeal obamacare.

trump's 2020 campaign website boasts about promises kept – including the repeal of obamacare's individual mandate requiring the purchase of health insurance. but the listed achievements include plans like the multi-billion dollar effort to combat opioid abuse, which though worthy, does not come close to an explanation of how the health care system would work if the aca is finally killed off.
new polling indicates iowa democrats are cool on the idea of nominating a business leader:

getting rid of the irs and obamacare is not a realistic or achievable legislative agenda, feehery said, describing campaign vows gop contenders made in 2010 and 2014. and i think it's a two-way thing. i don't think we're necessarily listening to the voters, but i don't think the voters are listening to what's doable. those misaligned policy impulses and divisions on key policy things makes it difficult for a candidate to rise who is promoting a responsible agenda.

in keeping with sanders' base-centric approach to turning his campaign's tide, he stuck to his standard populist script on wednesday, mixing moral denunciations of corporate greed with snarky asides and paeans to the social democratic reforms of the mid-20th century. he insisted that the current health care system, in which millions of americans go without the care they need as insurance executives earn multimillion-dollar compensation packages, is the result of corporate capture of the political system.

while the fentanyl epidemic has mostly affected white americans, the drug is increasingly claiming more african american lives in cities like washington, philadelphia, st. louis and baltimore. between 2013 and 2017, 1,261 people died from fentanyl overdoses in baltimore, which has the second-highest number of fentanyl-related overdose deaths per capita in the country. the maryland department of health found that an additional 566 people died in the first nine months of 2018, the most recently available data for the city. that far exceeds the number of homicides committed during the entire year, when 309 people were murdered in baltimore.

texas sen. ted cruz, a republican, helped lead the charge in october 2013 to shutdown the government as part of a protest over the affordable care act, more colloquially known as obamacare. cruz's efforts were met with no success though, as both the senate and the presidency were controlled by democrats.

if trump wants, he can unleash serious damage by undermining the individual markets in three ways. insurers currently making decisions will closely scrutinize signs from the administration to gauge those markets' long-term viability. his administration can weaken the individual mandate through various mechanisms, which would mean fewer younger and healthier people and higher premiums. it can pull back on all forms of outreach designed to get people to enroll on the marketplaces. or it can stop paying cost-sharing reductions to insurance companies, which enable them to reduce out-of-pocket costs for lower-income enrollees, which may encourage insurers to flee the markets.
the precise effects of those changes on insurance coverage and the federal budget are unknown ― because republican leaders, determined to rush a vote, would not allow time for the cbo to analyze the changes. in fact, it wasn't until late thursday evening that leadership posted the text of the changes.

sanders and ocasio-cortez are both self-described democratic socialists. they both energize the left. and they both rocketed out of obscurity to the center of the political debate. but there's a difference in how the washington establishment treats them. sanders skeptics attack his ideas; they challenge him. ocasio-cortez's critics not only critique her words but question whether she should have a voice in the public debate at all. this is a person not ready for prime time, certainly not ready for congress, the ever-quoted voice of the washington establishment norm ornstein tweeted in response to her answer on a question about israel. she should stop campaigning & do a crash course on basics, including economics and foreign policy. otherwise, she will stumble badly out of the blocks and do major damage. early impressions hard to erase.

in the latest swipe at the affordable care act, which trump was unable to repeal in his first year in office, the centers for medicare & medicaid services on saturday said it was putting on hold its risk adjustment program in which it collects money from insurers with fewer high-cost plan members and transfers the funds to insurers with more high-need patients that require more expensive care.
the latest plan is being forged by leaders at the conservative think tanks heritage foundation and the galen institute, along with former senator rick santorum and yuval levin of the ethics and public policy center. they've been meeting regularly over the past eight months to craft a recommendation for congress to repeal much of the aca's coverage requirements and taxes, turn over some of its spending to states through block grants and expand the use of tax-free health savings accounts.

second, biden now can put meat on the bones of his message that the election is a fight for the soul of the nation. originally, this meant a battle to recapture america as a decent, fair and welcoming country. now, in the covid-19 pandemic, the battle is between two ways of addressing adversity. in biden's telling, republicans focus on bailing out corporate interests (e.g., the giant slush fund) and savaging regulations (even clear-air requirements in the middle of a respiratory illness) while democrats want to focus on more help for nurses and responders, more unemployment pay and more help for small business. (the senate majority leader is already dragging his feet on a fourth stimulus package). how the two sides react to the pandemic becomes emblematic of their values and priorities.

garcia's source for the claim was a harvard study from the year before ducey took office.

obama, however, clearly feels these are extraordinary times. while he worked hard publicly to ensure that the handoff of power to trump was orderly and respectful, it's obvious that obama not only disagrees deeply with his successor's worldview but that he also regards trump's approach and actions as potentially very dangerous to the country.

republican-controlled states say that when congress voided the penalty for not having insurance, all of obamacare was rendered unconstitutional. the trump administration sided with those states. the supreme court heard arguments shortly after trump's third court nominee, amy coney barrett, took her seat as an associate justice. while republicans were banking on the court's 6-3 conservative majority, chief justice john roberts and associate justice brett kavanaugh signaled during the november oral arguments they are inclined to uphold the bulk of the law even if individual mandate is struck down. a ruling is likely by june.

bernie sanders would have won five, six, seven states, trump remarked. when you look at it, she did him no favors. that was not a good friendship. we started to see that during the debates, by the way. it became unhinged.
in 2003, bennet became the chief of staff to then-denver mayor john hickenlooper, who is also running for the democratic presidential nomination. he left hickenlooper's office in 2005 to become superintendent of the denver public school system, where he helped pass a merit pay system for teachers. he was later appointed to fill the senate seat vacated by ken salazar in 2009 and promptly re-elected the following year.
because the filings regarding the application for a stay in this matter were not completed until earlier today and the justices need time to review these filings, the decision by the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit is temporarily stayed, justice samuel a. alito jr. wrote.
there is also the proposal to eliminate itemized tax deductions other than mortgage interest and charitable giving. mnuchin stated that the reasoning behind this move was to eliminate tax loopholes while offsetting the reduction in the base tax rate for americans in higher income brackets. the problem here is that there are certain taxpayers who are not in the higher tax brackets and may need those itemized deductions in order to lower their tax liability. in the end, they may actually see their federal income tax bill increase and not feel the proposed beneficial effect of trump's plan.

we still don't know how much west virginia is going to get, manchin spokesman jonathan kott told me. he is going to make sure west virginia gets as much as possible.
university of texas professor donald f. kettl takes up this task in his new book, the divided states of america. he seeks to show how we got to this impasse and presents an argument for how federalism itself could be the instrument of our salvation. kettl offers a clear and cogent exposition of the problem, but his answer to it, a hamiltonian solution to madison's great dilemma, is little developed.
but the plans often have more limitations in what they cover than aca plans do. they're allowed to restrict enrollment to those without preexisting conditions, for example, and don't have to cover all essential benefits included in all obamacare plans. they might exclude prescription drugs; they might cap how much they'll pay in a hospital, says levitt. so if you look at one of these short-term plans, you really want to read the fine print carefully.
according to the nonpartisan congressional budget office, employer tax rate increases are generally passed on to employees in the form of lower wages or higher prices.
pelosi went on to say in her interview with the post that she doesn't support impeachment because it divides the country. that's a topic pelosi knows a lot about. this is the same person who told the american people in 2017 that if the republican plan to repeal and replace obamacare passed, hundreds of thousands of people will die.
and then on sunday, conway got a little more specific.
on tuesday, former health and human services secretary tom price who had been a key administration official during republican efforts to repeal and replace obamacare last year, said that getting rid of the individual mandate — the requirement that people buy health insurance or face a tax penalty — would likely make costs go up for people who remain in the marketplace.

politics is like if i look at my friend [delaware's democratic sen.] chris coons and i say, 'listen up, jackwagon, what you want to do on this particular finance committee bill is going to be way too expensive and might bankrupt our kids.' or if chris looks back at me and says, 'listen up, jackwagon, you're too much of a cheapskate and you're underinvesting in the next generation.' that's a really important debate. that's a political debate. that's not civics. civics is more important than that. civics doesn't change every 18-24 months because the electoral winds change and because polling changes.
inskeep: that's npr's domenico montanaro. and he speaks on this day, when some democrats will release a green new deal resolution.
the united states took a pretty significant risk in sending a pretty daring rescue mission. now, the intelligence proved to be able old. they were a little slow in implementing. but the fact that they would risk these soldiers and special forces community's -- personnel's lives in the rescue attempts shows, i think, that there were good faith efforts.
health care policy is all about tradeoffs, so for all these changes, there would be countereffects, including a reduction in taxes on the wealthy that the affordable care act raised to finance its coverage expansions.
finally, trump said at a white house unleashing american energy event that he planned to cancel obama-era limits on u.s. financing for overseas coal projects and that he would accelerate efforts to effectively turn american communities into energy colonies mined for fossil fuels to export overseas. we have nearly 100 years' worth of natural gas and more than 250 years' worth of clean, beautiful coal, trump said. we will be dominant. we will export american energy all over the world, all around the globe. trump is selling the idea of clean coal at a time when even litigious coal baron and trump booster bob murray admits that the process of trying to make clean coal through the process of carbon capture and sequestration does not work.
