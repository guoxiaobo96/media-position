{"sentence": "3. end cash bail. the platform calls for eliminating cash bail across the country — a radical experiment in criminal justice reform that has only just begun in california and new york, with results that are deeply concerning. the idea is to reduce inequities, but in practice the end of cash bail means releasing violent criminals to commit more crimes. one suspect in antisemitic attacks in new york city late last year, for example, was repeatedly re-arrested after her releases.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "4. stop the practice of arresting children for behavior that ought to be handled in the principal's office. the democrats want to stop what they call the school-to-prison pipeline, arguing students of color suffer disproportionate suspensions and arrests (which would mean that liberal teachers are racist). but as andrew pollack points out, failing to arrest violent children could allow them to buy guns as adults, which is how the parkland, florida, shooting happened.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "5. we will repeal so-called 'right to work' laws. it is not clear how democrats will actually do this, since these laws are made at the state level. but right to work laws — freeing employees from being forced to join unions — have been a huge economic boost to states that have adopted them. working-class americans — especially minorities — have voted with their feet, moving from the highly unionized rust belt to the right to work south, where there are more jobs.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "6. democrats will recognize unions with majority sign-up—via so-called 'card check' processes. the card check violates the right to a secret ballot, and allows organizers to intimidate workers into voting to certify unions. the idea is so radical that even george mcgovern, the left-wing democratic presidential nominee in 1972 who lost to president richard nixon in a landslide, came out against it the last time democrats tried to mandate it, in 2009.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "7. oppose private school vouchers. there is growing support for school vouchers that allow students to escape failing public schools in their local districts by choosing alternative schools — including private and religious schools. vouchers are especially popular with minority families, who are desperate to escape the failing system in which the teachers' unions have trapped their children. democrats also want to restrict the expansion of charter schools, too.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "8. provide a public option toward universal health care. this idea was so radical ten years ago that democrats left it out of obamacare. but it is the beginning of medicare for all, which sanders wants to impose on everyone, and biden wants to offer as a choice (for now). there is no thought of achieving universal health care outside government, building on the recent reforms under the trump administration, such as tele-medicine — just more federal bureaucracy.", "label": 0}
{"sentence": "9. end the border wall and provide a roadmap to citizenship for the millions of undocumented workers. a biden administration would stop the construction of the unnecessary, wasteful, and ineffective wall on the southern border — thus allowing an open border — while also giving voting citizenship to the eleven million-plus illegal aliens who are already here, permanently changing the american electorate and enshrining democrats in power forever.", "label": 0}

{"sentence": "still, the insurance isn't as comprehensive as one might imagine a federal judge or supreme court justice would get. unlike the so-called cadillac plans that top corporate executives often enjoy that fully cover a host of health care expenses, the federal plans have deductibles, premium costs, co-pays and other out-of-pocket expenses.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "like any employer offering health insurance, the federal government pays a good portion of employees' premiums. except for some negotiated union contracts with postal workers, the feds generally pay about 72 percent of premium costs. but that's less than the average 80 percent that private sector employers kick in.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "that means judges who opt into the system pay premiums, just like the rest of us. they may even pay a bit more than the average private-sector employee. in addition, depending on what type of plan judges pick, like private-sector employees they may have high deductibles or high co-insurance for certain services. as in the marketplaces, it's all about what plan they choose.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "whatever the case, federal judges' own health coverage probably doesn't weigh too heavily on their decision-making. after all, we've been here before. the supreme court upheld the aca in 2012, saying the individual mandate -- the area of the law under dispute in the texas case -- was constitutional because of the tax penalty involved. but now that the trump administration abolished the penalty, the recent lawsuit argued the entire law was no longer constitutional.", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "the bigger the pool, the better", "label": 1}
{"sentence": "still, it might be more instructive if federal judges give a little thought to why their health insurance option works so well. that's primarily because federal employees are a large, diversified pool of patients, with varying ages, demographics and health care needs. such a pool helps insurers spread risk among young, healthy participants and those who are older or have more health care needs. the large pool also helps the government negotiate with insurers to keep costs down.", "label": 1}

{"sentence": "let's not forget the department of homeland security interfaces with the american public more than any other department of our government at airports, at ports. and so to just say, well, we will just make them come to work without pay, first of all, is a real challenge for the working men and women of my department.", "label": 2}
{"sentence": "second, it means furloughing at least 30,000 of our department and cutting back very significantly on our operations, our operations to pursue homeland security. so, this is not a situation to make light of. in these challenging times, we need a fully funded department of homeland security right now.", "label": 2}

{"sentence": "some of that is due to polarization, with obamacare popular among democratic voters and unpopular among republicans for reasons that probably have little to do with anything but partisan loyalty. but performance is still an issue. many millions still can't pay their medical bills, because they don't have insurance or their insurance covers too little. the u.s. still has the world's most confusing and expensive system, with little evidence that the extra money buys better quality.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "it was a far cry from the government-run insurance plan that harry truman once championed, but democratic leaders embraced it as the best they could get ― and so did obama, who repeated in our interview his belief that something like a government-run, single-payer system would probably work best, but creating one right away would be too difficult.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "by the middle of 2009, jim demint, the arch-conservative south carolina republican who had riled up tea party activists by promising that defeating reform would be obama's waterloo, was setting the tone on health care. grassley, facing the threat of a conservative primary challenge, started talking about death panels at events back home. and in a meeting obama later described in his memoir, the iowa senator told the former president there was no concession that would win his vote.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "the ultimate futility of courting republicans — so memorable today — is one of many grievances more progressive democrats still hold over obama's handling of the health care law. and in the popular imagination, it is the main reason obama made so many key compromises, like dropping a public option — the idea of a government-run insurance plan that would offer a more efficient, more patient-friendly alternative to private insurance.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "but here too it is easy to forget another reality of 2009 politics, one still very relevant today: the big pressure to compromise came from conservative democrats who had leverage to kill legislation if they wanted. in the senate, this was a function of the same small-state bias that gave republicans outsized power, and as a practical matter, it meant that democratic leaders were constantly trying to satisfy senators from places like arkansas and nebraska where voters were especially suspicious of big new federal programs and prone to believing conservative propaganda about what proposed legislation would do.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "those conservative democrats were the ones who were dead set against the public option. they were the ones who kept pushing to give state officials more power over the program. they were the ones most anxious over new spending. and those decisions had consequences later, when the law took effect. among other things, it meant less financial assistance for some middle-class americans buying insurance.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "whether obama could have pushed conservative democrats harder, or picked different places to give ground, remains a source of disagreement between him and some of his liberal allies even today. what's not in dispute is that obama always realized the law would need more work. that's why he talked about it as a starter home, with the expectation that it would be possible to bolster and expand the program over time, through a series of legislative and administrative fixes.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "a key change in individual taxes could occur with the revision of tax brackets. trump's proposal calls for reducing tax brackets for individuals from seven to three set at 10, 25, and 35 percent. according to the wall street journal, this reduces the amount of taxes on individual income for those earning over $699,000 by $214,000, while their ultimate share of all federal taxes reduces to 25 percent. this will benefit the wealthy since the top tax rate decreases from 39.6 percent to 35 percent.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "a key problem with the plan is that the federal deduction for state and local income taxes would be eliminated, thereby hurting taxpayers in new york, california, or massachusetts who pay high amounts. the residents of those and other such states would be severely hurt since their taxes are much higher than places like florida and texas, and would actually see a severely substantial tax increase. according to the congressional joint committee on taxation, taxpayers using this deduction save more than $100 billion, which is actually greater than the mortgage interest deduction.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "there is also the proposal to eliminate itemized tax deductions other than mortgage interest and charitable giving. mnuchin stated that the reasoning behind this move was to eliminate tax loopholes while offsetting the reduction in the base tax rate for americans in higher income brackets. the problem here is that there are certain taxpayers who are not in the higher tax brackets and may need those itemized deductions in order to lower their tax liability. in the end, they may actually see their federal income tax bill increase and not feel the proposed beneficial effect of trump's plan.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "trump's plan also increases the federal budget deficit and the national debt. the plan trump has proposed, which was set out as a one-page proposal without any financial justification to back it up, never stated anything at all about how the federal budget will be impacted nor how the national debt either increases or decreases. according to the analysts from the tax policy center, federal revenue is estimated to decrease by $6.2 trillion over the next ten years. the trump economic team should hope that there will be the 4 percent economic growth they projected that will make up for the federal revenue decrease. but if there is a recession or economic downturn, then trump's proposal will suffer serious consequences.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "many ended up buying more generous plans, while others kept their plans and just pocketed the savings. restoring csr funding now would reverse that process ― reducing premiums on the subsidized plans, but reducing tax credits too. the federal government would end up spending less money subsidizing insurance, but lower-income consumers would actually have to pay a lot more to keep the same plans.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "but the whole conversation appears to have become moot because of additional conditions republican leaders have attached to any affordable care act stabilization proposal. and by far the most important among these is the language around abortion.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "under the alexander-collins bill, no insurer that accepts either reinsurance or csr funds could pay for abortion services. if that were to become law, then it's almost certain no insurer offering coverage to individuals would include abortion coverage, because no insurer would want to give up those lucrative payments.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "that's not the case today. today, insurers can cover abortion services in states that allow such benefits, just as long as the insurers don't use federal dollars of any kind. in other words, insurers can't use money they've received in the form of premium tax credits. back when csr money was coming in, they couldn't use that money either.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "to accomplish this, insurers that cover abortion pay for those services with separate spending accounts, filled only with premiums they have received directly from individuals. in theory, the same workaround would (or could be made to) apply to the money insurers get from alexander-collins.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "but conservative republicans have never recognized that distinction as meaningful. they say the affordable care act violates the hyde amendment, which prohibits federal funding of abortion. the alexander-collins proposal would essentially outlaw the existing arrangement, leaving potentially millions of women without a way to get insurance that covers abortion.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "the first is his claim that the entire republican party would always, and very strongly, protect patients with preexisting conditions. this simply isn't true. the gop has dedicated dozens of congressional votes over the years to repealing obamacare, including its protections blocking insurance companies from denying coverage to people with preexisting health conditions. trump's justice department supports a lawsuit aiming to strike down the entire law that is soon to go before the supreme court. various republicans have tried to introduce legislation that could replace obamacare's protections, but health care experts have consistently said those bills would fall short of the protections the affordable care act offers.", "label": 4}
{"sentence": "the second major lie was that biden supports efforts to eliminate police budgets, part of trump's efforts to portray biden ― a veteran politician with a clear center-left ideology and track record ― as a stalking-horse for the left-most elements of the democratic party. if you give power to joe biden, the radical left will defund police departments all across america, trump said.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "it's not hard to see why republicans would try to cast themselves as guardians against rising crime in some cities ― to say nothing of the rioting that has spilled out from peaceful demonstrations against police misconduct, particularly in cities like minneapolis, minnesota, and kenosha, wisconsin. that's because it allows the gop to shift from the politically inconvenient terrain of dismissing protests against police misconduct and racism, which a majority of americans support, and turn to the stronger ground of condemning arson and property destruction, which already appear to be turning swing voters against democrats in the general election battleground state of wisconsin.", "label": 4}

{"sentence": "allowing insurers to offer non-obamacare-qualified plans. this mirrors an idea that texas sen. ted cruz and utah sen. mike lee had proposed in recent weeks: the senate's bill would allow an insurer to offer skimpier plans. as long as an insurer does offer a plan on the individual insurance exchanges that meets the demands of obamacare's title i (for example, covering certain areas like preventive care and protecting people with pre-existing conditions), that insurer will be allowed to offer additional plans off of the individual insurance exchanges that don't meet those criteria.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "even those who support the law say that mismatch would effectively shut down the health exchanges, because insurers would simply drop out. a trump administration really could collapse the federal exchange marketplace and the state exchanges if they end cost-sharing payments to insurers, said rosenbaum, who has been a strong backer of the health law. there is already some concern about the continuing viability of the exchanges after several large insurers, including aetna and united healthcare, announced they would be dropping out for 2017.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "another way trump could undermine the health law would be by simply not enforcing its provisions, particularly the individual mandate that requires most people to have insurance. that requirement is supposed to ensure that healthy as well as sick people sign up, thus spreading the costs of people with high bills across a larger population. but executive branch non-enforcement could make a real difference to the vitality of the exchanges going forward, bagley said. if healthy people don't sign up, sick people would need to pay more money for their insurance.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "aside from inflicting damage to the exchanges, the administration could also affect the law's operations by refusing to approve states' changes to their medicaid programs. states rely on federal regulators to sign off on changes large and small, including which citizens are eligible, to keep their medicaid programs operating. there are so many things that an administration that doesn't want a program to work can do, rosenbaum said.", "label": 5}
{"sentence": "the bigger question, though, is not what trump could do to cripple the health law — it's what he would do. he has addressed the issue only rarely — characterizing the health law as, simply, a disaster — and his plans for it aren't clear. it's one thing to talk about ripping insurance from 20 million people who are newly covered, bagley said. it's another to actually do it.", "label": 5}

{"sentence": "i always think of donald trump in this model, because trump is somebody who i think you really see had a temperament oriented towards this kind of zero-sum thinking, and then applied it to everything despite being at the very top of the ladder. i mean, he's somebody who was racist, but also his understanding, as far as i could tell, of all relationships between america and other countries was that we were either winning or losing the transaction. his understanding of all business deals was he was either winning the deal or he was losing the deal. his understanding of all human relations was he was either winning and dominating or losing and being made weak. and it always struck me in him and in its appeal to people that it is actually, sadly, much harder to make people think about the ways in which a world can be positive-sum, the ways in which a deal can benefit both sides simultaneously, than the ways in which it can be zero-sum. and so there's this real danger of people who have either felt this or seen this or oriented towards it, and then that becomes the only way they can think about life.", "label": 6}

{"sentence": "this was really important to me, because there actually has been a lot of reporting about poor and working class white people who reject welfare and means-tested medicaid, because they're so silly. they cut off their noses despite their faces and tsk-tsk about them. but i want to talk about something that was a much more middle class issue, which is college. the somewhat novel idea of well-funded public colleges, at least one in every state, was one of the hallmarks of the american whites-only social contract for the first half of the 20th century. all of that changed with a new post-civil rights movement anti-government ethos among the white voting majority which wanted tax cuts and not public spending, which wanted a sense of pulling up the ladder and divesting from these places that had become really fraught and contested spaces like public education of the k through 12 level. public college became a place where integration was being threatened. and so it's not normally conceived of. first of all, most people don't know that we have so much student loan debt because of government cutbacks of states spending less per capita on public college despite a growing tax base and a federal shift from grants to loans. people don't know that it's government cutbacks that created the student debt problem. and they certainly typically don't map the issue of race and racism onto it.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "but the shift in the expectation of free college for a majority white college-going population to a debt for diploma system for a predominantly students of color population is one of the most dramatic examples of racism draining the pool. and if i can just add, it's so frustrating, because it's seen as a colorblind issue. student debt — the rules that we changed in order to make student debt the new normal were not explicitly racist like redlining or all of that. but when you say suddenly to a generation, not only do you have to go to college to get a middle class job because of changes we've made in the labor market, but you will now have to fund that college out of your own family's wealth, knowing full well that family wealth is where history shows up in your wallet, where the amount of money you have in savings or cds or home equity absolutely tracks to what side of the color line you were on when the government was handing out free wealth building opportunities, you get what you have now, which is a widening of the racial wealth gap, which is the fact that a black family with a college degree has less wealth than a white family headed by a high school dropout. it's colorblind, but it's systemically racist, and it impacts not just the targeted community, but also the majority of white students who have to borrow now too.", "label": 6}
{"sentence": "this, i think, is such an important point. i want to hold on it for a minute, because something i was thinking about reading the book is a little bit subtle here. so if you think about the way a lot of american public policy has changed over the decades you're tracking, basically, it moves from the government does things that you just get, like public college, to you have to pay out of pocket for it. and so that's really a move from something that builds wealth in the future to takes income in the present. and so then, what looks like a fair race to people — i mean, everybody's getting this chance to go to college and get a pell grant — but in fact, as you say here, is reflecting that if you got in when the getting was good, you have the assets to then pay for the thing you need now and just have it then continue to build wealth. and that's where it seems we get into some of this widening wealth gap stuff. and i'd like to talk about the mechanisms of that a little bit, because i think it's really important, wherein if you have family who can pay for your higher education, and so then you go to college and you get a really good job, then you just start rebuilding wealth.", "label": 6}

{"sentence": "in my time at demos, we really focused on these issues of wealth and debt, because it is so much more compounding in terms of opportunity and disadvantage than an income. you could get a great job today or tomorrow. you could get a great contract. you could have enough money in a given paycheck to pay your bills. but the question of what happens when that paycheck stops or is paused or you feel sick and can't go in is life determining. and that is where, basically, we're all paying compound interest on decisions made long before we were born — racially explicit decisions. there's a section in the book where i lay out the list of free stuff that was given to white americans to help build wealth. and it's so important to recognize that the divides that everyday people observe today — what's going on with that black neighborhood? why does it feel like it doesn't have as many small businesses? why does it seem like the schools in black neighborhoods are underfunded? well, they're linked to property values, which are a result of generations of explicit laws forbidding black people from owning homes and selling them. and so we have this now somewhat colorblind story of economic disparity today that we try with the american mythology of individual effort and bootstraps and just overall individualism to justify by saying, well, black people just don't try that hard. but in fact, it's not that black people don't try that hard.", "label": 6}

{"sentence": "i spent a lot of time grappling while thinking about the book with the way in which policies that begin with racist roots get out of control. they slip their reins, and they become broadly applied, hurting a lot of people of all different races, and also in a funny way, non-racist in their modern intent, but still terrible. so you have a discussion in the book of single-family zoning. and single-family zoning is a policy with extraordinarily racist roots, and particularly so in california, where i live. and in san francisco, where i live, single-family zoning has made it unbelievably unaffordable for basically anybody to live here — black people, brown people, but also white people. i know tons of white people who have had to leave or have not been able to raise a family here because of single-family zoning. and one of the stories about this that began to take shape in my head is that there's obviously the case of policies that are directly racialized even now, like medicaid, that the racialization of them ends up draining the pool. a lot of white people benefit from medicaid, but they're voting against it on race grounds. but then there's something like single-family vote zoning where i was talking to somebody doing survey research on this, and they were saying that in fact, single-family zoning is popular among everybody when you ask about it, voters of all races, but it's making things unaffordable for everybody.", "label": 6}

{"sentence": "what's more, while house conservatives did kill the gop bill, it's important that many moderate republicans — senators, governors and even some in the house — opposed the plan precisely because it would take coverage from lower-income people. indeed, we've now learned that there may be a hidden majority in both houses of congress (democrats plus moderate republicans) behind leaving in place the type of spending and regulations (with the exception of the mandate) that broadly make up obamacare. the genuine moderate republican opposition to such cruelly regressive policy is a pleasant surprise.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "thus, the trump strategy — allow the aca to collapse, and profit — makes little sense. nothing further to the right than the gop plan can pass, because that would alienate still more moderate republicans. the only thing that could conceivably pass is something that would have democratic and moderate republican support, and thus would be more liberal than the gop plan. that should theoretically give democrats leverage to demand fixes to the aca on their terms — fixes designed to incentivize more enrollment to the markets and further expand medicaid in states that haven't opted in — even if trump is successful in sabotaging the individual markets.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "it really is hard, as 538's nate silver put it, to think of anything less populist than the republican health-care plan. you might be able to say the bank bailouts were, but even that's probably not true. as unfair as it was to give money to the people most responsible for the global financial crisis — and it was on a world-historical scale, especially when they were allowed to pay themselves that money in bonuses — it at least helped prevent what in all likelihood would have been an even bigger meltdown. the only thing worse than how much credit markets seized up before the $800 billion bailout is how much they would have if there hadn't been one. more people would have lost their jobs, loans would have become impossible to come by instead of just mostly so, and they would have stayed that way more than they already have, since it can take a while for new banks to replace the relationships and local knowledge that old ones had. that, at least, is what a professor named ben bernanke found was part of the reason the recovery from the great depression was as slow as it was.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "the bailout, in other words, mostly helped wall street, but didn't exclusively help it. that's more than you can say for the gop's health-care plan.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "now, there are three ways to think about the senate bill. the first is that it would take health-care from the poor and middle-class to pay for tax cuts for the rich at a time of already historic inequality. the second is that it would make insurance more expensive for everyone and less useful for anyone who is sick. and the third is that it would hurt president trump's working-class base the most. other than that, how were the tax cuts, mrs. lincoln?", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "it's really pretty simple. the senate bill would, over the course of the next decade, cut obamacare's health insurance subsidies by $408 billion and medicaid by $772 billion all to pay for $700 billion of tax cuts, nearly half of which the nonpartisan tax policy center says would go to the top 1 percent of households. not only that, but the fact that it would only peg the value of its remaining subsidies to higher-deductible plans means that a lot of people would be pushed into them. they couldn't afford anything else. on an apples-to-apples basis, the nonpartisan kaiser family foundation estimates that the senate bill would increase the cost of a silver plan that covers 70 percent of expected medical costs by an average of 74 percent over the next three years — and more for the type of older, poorer people who overwhelmingly went for trump.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "although it's actually even worse than that. a 64-year-old making $26,500 would, according to the congressional budget office, see their premiums for a silver plan go from $1,700 under obamacare to $6,500 under the senate bill — but it'd be for a silver plan that covered 17 percent less of their expected medical expenses. so they'd be paying more to get less. how much more? well, the kaiser family foundation calculates that, in the case of our hypothetical 64-year-old, their deductible would go from $809 to $6,105. and it'd be an even bigger jump for people a little bit lower on the income ladder. someone making just $18,090 would see their deductibles increase from $255 to the same $6,105. the senate bill, then, would leave a lot of people with a choice between plans they couldn't afford to buy and couldn't afford to use.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "or, as the republicans would call it, freedom! and if you lived in a red state, you would probably get more of it. that's because the senate bill would let them opt out of essential health benefits like mental health, maternity care and prescription drugs — and in the process, the brookings institution's matthew fiedler points out, bring back annual and lifetime limits on benefits. the result would be a system where healthy people would mostly buy cheaper plans that didn't cover much, and mostly sick people would buy ones that did, you know, cover things — which would only make those more comprehensive plans so expensive that hardly anybody would be able to buy them at all. people would be forced to buy skimpy insurance that might not even insure you if you use too much of it.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "this isn't a health-care plan that helps you if you need health care. not when it would give you higher premiums, higher deductibles and worse coverage. no, this is a health-care plan that only helps you if you're wealthy and have a lot of investment income. it would cut the tax on capital gains, interest and dividends from 23.8 to 20 percent for households making $250,000 or more. other than that, you're out of luck — and maybe out of being insured. indeed, the cbo estimates that the senate bill's $1.1 trillion of cuts to health insurance spending would result in 22 million fewer people having insurance in 10 years' time. all so that the top 2 percent of households, who are the only ones really getting ahead in today's economy, can have 2 percent more money after taxes.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "for instance, one of its early goals was to eliminate the export-import bank, the federal government corporation that facilitates u.s. exports. it viewed the bank as wasteful corporate welfare. the group had too few members to block the bank's reauthorization on its own. so, the caucus worked with the chairman of the financial services committee, who refused to pass the reauthorization bill out of committee, and the bank's authorization expired. a cross-party coalition of lawmakers had to use a special house procedure to bypass the caucus and the committee and eventually reauthorize the bank.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "trump's 2016 election offered the freedom caucus a chance to use the same strategy with the executive branch, because trump had few allies in the gop and little knowledge of how washington worked. although the caucus and the president at first clashed over the repeal of obama's affordable care act, caucus chairman mark meadows (r-n.c.) eventually developed close relations with the president, and the group became one of his biggest advocates.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "caucus members also care about delivering what they think their constituents want. they often justify their tactics as ways to keep their campaign promises, as meadows did when he encouraged a possible shutdown in contrast with politicians who forget what they promised the american people. and caucus members have long believed that public conflict — like shutting down the federal government — is a strong negotiation tactic and a valuable way to show voters their commitment to policy.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "but because choice was heavily criticized as being too unwieldy and bureaucratic, congress tried to reform it by passing the mission act in 2018 under trump. the mission act loosens the restrictions around when a vet may seek private medical care, allowing it if they live more than 30 minutes from a va clinic or face wait times of more than 20 days for most health-care appointments.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "inequality is at the root of america's existential crisis, kettl argues, and not only because it is higher here than in any of the world's other leading industrialized nations. income inequality among the states is growing, too, creating more polarization and more friction and rendering the united states a collection of states divided. with washington deadlocked, the states continue to go their own way in everything from infrastructure investments to obamacare implementation. their policy differences are increasingly driving the country apart.", "label": 9}

{"sentence": "such grants are central to kettl's solution, which draws inspiration from the writings of alexander hamilton, who championed a strong central government because he was skeptical that the states could ever give the country the direction it needed. kettl's advice is to transform the grants' role by focusing them primarily on inequality-busting initiatives to redistribute wealth from rich to poor, and social benefits to the very young and very old from the rest of us. as part of this effort, washington would take a stronger hand in how medicaid is administered by the states and in encouraging the states to adopt policy innovations successfully tested by their counterparts.", "label": 9}

'when you move to a block grant, do you still have the right?' menendez asked.

{"sentence": "in addition, presidents have other ways of changing the direction of government. even without issuing a formal directive by executive order or memorandum, presidents can institute important policies by, for example, instructing agency heads to issue guidelines. this is how the department of homeland security implemented obama's instruction to carry out parts of the dream act without congressional approval, through guidances known as delayed action for childhood arrivals (daca) and deferred action for parents of americans (dapa). dhs then prioritized the implementation of deportation of undocumented persons, later reversed by the u.s. court of appeals for the 5th circuit.", "label": 9}
{"sentence": "but to sum up, the rhetoric of sweeping, day-one change is almost always belied by the reality of presidential life. it will be interesting to see whether trump meant his promises to reverse obama policies literally — and will issue that flurry of executive orders — or whether he meant it seriously, and will reach his goals through other means. or perhaps changing the direction of the ship of state will be more difficult than he anticipated.", "label": 9}
